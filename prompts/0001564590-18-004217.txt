 Item 1. Business 
 W&T Offshore, Inc. is an independent oil and natural gas producer, active in the exploration, development and acquisition of oil and natural gas properties in the Gulf of Mexico.  W&T Offshore, Inc. is a Texas corporation originally organized as a Nevada corporation in 1988, and successor by merger to W&T Oil Properties, Inc., a Louisiana corporation organized in 1983.  
 We have grown through acquisitions, exploration and development and currently hold working interests in 49 offshore fields in federal and state waters (47 producing and two fields capable of producing).  We currently have under lease approximately 700,000 gross acres (370,000 net acres) spanning across the Outer Continental Shelf (“OCS”) off the coasts of Louisiana, Texas, Mississippi and Alabama, with approximately 470,000 gross acres on the conventional shelf and approximately 230,000 gross acres in the deepwater.  A majority of our daily production is derived from wells we operate.  We currently own interests in approximately 135 offshore structures, 87 of which are located in fields that we operate.  Our interest in fields, leases, structures and equipment are primarily owned by W&T Offshore, Inc. and our wholly-owned subsidiary, W & T Energy VI, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company.    
 The Gulf of Mexico is an area where we have developed significant technical expertise and where high production rates associated with hydrocarbon deposits have historically provided us the best opportunity to achieve a rapid return on our invested capital.  We have leveraged our experience in the conventional shelf (water depths of less than 500 feet) to develop higher impact capital projects in the Gulf of Mexico in both the deepwater (water depths in excess of 500 feet) and the deep shelf (well depths in excess of 15,000 feet and water depths of less than 500 feet).  We have rights to explore and develop new prospects and existing oil and natural gas properties in both the deepwater and the deep shelf, while at the same time continuing our focus on the conventional shelf.  Our drilling efforts in recent years have included the deepwater of the Gulf of Mexico.  During 2017 and 2016, a portion of our production was from the deepwater fields, Big Bend and Dantzler, which commenced production in late 2015.  The reserves of both of these are comprised of over 75% oil and natural gas liquids (“NGLs”) on a Boe basis.  As of December 31, 2017, the Big Bend field was in our top ten fields based on reserves, net to our interest, on a Boe basis.     
 In managing our business, we are focused on optimizing production and growing reserves in a profitable and prudent manner, while managing cash flows to meet our obligations and investment needs.  Our cash flows are materially impacted by the prices of our commodities produced (crude oil and natural gas, and the NGLs extracted from the natural gas).  In addition, the prices of goods and services used in our business impact our cash flows and margins.  During 2017, commodity prices improved from the lower price levels experienced during 2016 and 2015, but were nonetheless below the levels realized in years prior to 2015.  Our margins in 2017 have improved from 2016 and 2015 levels, and are approaching the margin levels achieved prior to 2015.  Although we have historically grown our reserves and production through both acquisitions and our drilling programs, for the last three years we have focused on increasing reserves and production through drilling and through projects to optimize production from existing wells.  While our production decreased 5.2% in 2017 from the prior year, our reserves increased more than production and resulted in a net increase in reserves year-over-year.  The increase in proved reserves is a result of drilling, recompletion and workover effects, and improved commodity prices.  During 2017, we drilled five wells on the continental shelf, four of which were successful and began producing during 2017.

Based on a reserve report prepared by Netherland, Sewell & Associates, Inc. (“NSAI”), our independent petroleum consultants, our total proved reserves at December 31, 2017 were 74.2 million barrels of oil equivalent (“MMBoe”) or 445.3 billion cubic feet of gas equivalent (“Bcfe”) compared to 74.0 MMBoe as of December 31, 2016.  Approximately 74% of our proved reserves as of December 31, 2017 were classified as proved developed producing, 10% as proved developed non-producing and 16% as proved undeveloped.  Classified by product, our proved reserves at December 31, 2017 were 46% crude oil, 11% NGLs and 43% natural gas.  These percentages were determined using the energy-equivalent ratio of six thousand cubic feet (“Mcf”) of natural gas to one barrel (“Bbl”) of crude oil, condensate or NGLs.  This energy-equivalent ratio does not assume price equivalency, and the energy-equivalent prices for crude oil, NGLs and natural gas may differ significantly.  Our total proved reserves had an estimated present value of future net revenues discounted at 10% (“PV-10”) of $992.9 million before consideration of cash outflows related to asset retirement obligations (“ARO”).  Our PV-10 after considering future cash outflows related to ARO was $800.7 million, and our standardized measure of discounted future cash flows was $740.6 million as of December 31, 2017.  Neither PV-10 nor PV-10 after ARO is a financial measure defined under generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”).  For additional information about our proved reserves and a reconciliation of PV-10 and PV-10 after ARO to the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows, see Properties – Proved Reserves under Part I, Item 2 in this Form 10-K. 
 Under current commodity pricing conditions, we expect to continue to focus on conserving capital and maintaining liquidity.   We expect our 2018 production to be lower compared to 2017 before considering any potential acquisition opportunities.  Factors such as drilling results, time required to bring successful wells to completion, natural production declines, unplanned downtime and well performance could lead to results different from our production expectations for 2018.  Our capital expenditure budget for 2018 of approximately $130 million is composed of select lower-risk, high-return, oil-focused projects combined with higher-risk, higher return, oil-focused projects that, assuming success, would be placed on production fairly quickly.
 To provide additional financial flexibility, as we have previously reported, throughout 2017 and now into 2018 we have been working to establish a drilling joint venture with private investors.  We are in final stages of establishing a drilling joint venture to be formed with private investors that will allow us to drill and exploit assets on a promoted basis and with reduced capital outlay.  We have completed negotiations with an initial group of investors, the terms of which are subject to funding at an initial closing expected to occur by mid-March.  It is expected that entities owned and controlled by Tracy W. Krohn, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of the Company, and his family will invest on the same terms as are negotiated with the unaffiliated investors to acquire an approximate 4% interest in the drilling joint venture.  More investors may join the joint venture before or after the initial closing.  If completed, this joint venture arrangement should reduce cash commitments for capital expenditures depending on the level of outside investor participation. We believe other arrangements on a promoted basis are available in the current market environment.  We believe financing arrangements exist for the right acquisition opportunity, although these financing arrangements may be structured differently than past arrangements.  
 We also expect to reduce or extend the maturities of a significant amount of our existing indebtedness within the next 12 months assuming reasonably stable market conditions to provide greater financial flexibility.  Our 2018 plans include spending $24 million for ARO, compared to $72 million spent on ARO in 2017.  We continue to closely monitor current and forecasted commodity prices to assess what changes, if any, should be made to our 2018 plans. 
 Our exploration efforts have historically been in areas in reasonably close proximity to known proved reserves, but starting in 2012, some of our exploration projects were higher risk deepwater projects with potentially higher returns than our previous risk/reward profile.  The investment associated with drilling an offshore well and future development of an offshore project principally depends upon water depth, the depth of the well, the complexity of the geological formations involved and whether the well or project can be connected to existing infrastructure or will require additional investment in infrastructure.  Deepwater and deep shelf drilling projects can be substantially more capital intensive than those on the conventional shelf.  During 2017, we did not drill or participate in any deepwater projects, and in 2016, we participated in one deepwater project.  Certain risks are inherent in our business specifically and in the oil and natural gas industry generally, any one of which can negatively impact our rate of return on invested capital if it occurs.  When projects are extremely capital intensive and involve substantial risk, we often seek participants to share the risk.  
 2


We generally sell our crude oil, NGLs and natural gas at the wellhead at current market prices or transport our production to “pooling points” where it is sold.  We are required to pay gathering and transportation costs with respect to a majority of our products.  Our products are marketed several different ways depending upon a number of factors including the availability of purchasers at the wellhead, the availability and cost of pipelines near the well or related production platforms, the availability of third-party processing capacity, market prices, pipeline constraints and operational flexibility. 
 Business Strategy 
 Our business strategy is to acquire, explore and develop oil and natural gas reserves on the OCS, the area of our historical success and technical expertise, which we believe will yield desirable rates of return commensurate with our perception of risks.  We believe attractive drilling and acquisition opportunities will continue to become available in the Gulf of Mexico as the major integrated oil companies and other large independent oil and gas exploration and production companies continue to divest properties to focus on larger and more capital-intensive projects that better match their long-term strategic goals.  Also, we expect opportunities will arise as producers seek to divest their properties for short-term cash flow needs.  Our plans for the short-term include operating within cash flow, maintaining liquidity, meeting our financial obligations, establishing a drilling joint venture to provide drilling capital on a promoted basis (as discussed above) and pursuing acquisitions meeting our criteria.
 We believe a portion of our Gulf of Mexico acreage has exploration potential below currently producing zones, including deep shelf reserves at subsurface depths greater than 15,000 feet.  Although the cost to drill deep shelf wells is significantly higher than shallower wells, the reserve targets are typically larger, and the use of existing infrastructure, when available, can increase the economic potential of these wells.  
 Competition 
 The oil and natural gas industry is highly competitive.  We currently operate in the Gulf of Mexico and compete for the acquisition of oil and natural gas properties primarily on the basis of price for such properties.  We compete with numerous entities, including major domestic and foreign oil companies, other independent oil and natural gas companies and individual producers and operators.  Many of these competitors are large, well established companies that have financial and other resources substantially greater than ours and greater ability to provide the extensive regulatory financial assurances required for offshore properties.  Our ability to acquire additional oil and natural gas properties and to discover reserves in the future will depend upon our ability to evaluate and select suitable properties, finance investments and consummate transactions in a highly competitive environment.  
Oil and Natural Gas Marketing and Delivery Commitments
  We sell our crude oil, NGLs and natural gas to third-party customers.  We are not dependent upon, or contractually limited to, any one customer or small group of customers.  However, in 2017, approximately 46% of our sales were to Shell Trading (US) Co. and 15% were to Vitol Inc., with no other customer comprising greater than 10% of our 2017 revenues.  Due to the free trading nature of the oil and natural gas markets in the Gulf of Mexico, we do not believe the loss of a single customer or a few customers would materially affect our ability to sell our production.  We do not have any agreements which obligate us to deliver material quantities to third parties.
Exchange Transaction in 2016
 In September 2016, we consummated a transaction whereby we exchanged approximately $710.2 million principal amount, or 79%, of our 8.500% Senior Notes due 2019 (the “Unsecured Senior Notes”) for $301.8 million principal amount of new secured notes and 60.4 million shares of our common stock.  In conjunction with the transaction, we closed on a new $75.0 million, 11.00%, 1.5 Lien Term Loan (the “1.5 Lien Term Loan”), and two amendments were made effective under our Fifth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, as amended (the “Credit Agreement”) (collectively, the “Exchange Transaction”).  See Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Part II, Item 7, and in Financial Statements and Supplementary Data –  Note 2 – Long-Term Debt under Part II, Item 8 in this Form 10-K for a full description of the transaction, the new debt instruments and the accounting for the transaction.

Regulation  
 General.  Various aspects of our oil and natural gas operations are subject to extensive and continually changing regulations as legislation affecting the oil and natural gas industry is under constant review for amendment or expansion.  Numerous departments and agencies, both federal and state, are authorized by statute to issue, and have issued, rules and regulations binding upon the oil and natural gas industry and its individual members.  The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (“BOEM”) and the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (“BSEE”) regulations, pursuant to the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act (“OCSLA”), apply to our operations on federal leases in the Gulf of Mexico.  
 The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (“FERC”) regulates the transportation and sale for resale of natural gas in interstate commerce pursuant to the Natural Gas Act of 1938 (“NGA”) and the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978 (“NGPA”).  In 1989, Congress enacted the Natural Gas Wellhead Decontrol Act, which removed all remaining price and nonprice controls affecting wellhead sales of natural gas, effective January 1, 1993.  Sales by producers of natural gas and all sales of crude oil, condensate and NGLs can currently be made at uncontrolled market prices.  The FERC also regulates rates and service conditions for the interstate transportation of liquids, including crude oil, condensate and NGLs, under various statues. 
 The Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”), the FERC and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (“CFTC”) hold statutory authority to monitor certain segments of the physical and futures energy commodities markets.  These agencies have imposed broad regulations prohibiting fraud and manipulation of such markets.  We are required to observe the market-related regulations enforced by these agencies with regard to our physical sales of crude oil or other energy commodities, and any related hedging activities that we undertake.  Any violation of the FTC, FERC, and CFTC prohibitions on market manipulation can result in substantial civil penalties amounting to over $1 million per violation per day.    
 These departments and agencies have substantial enforcement authority and the ability to grant and suspend operations, and to levy substantial penalties for non-compliance.  Failure to comply with such regulations, as interpreted and enforced, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.  
 Federal leases.  Most of our offshore operations are conducted on federal oil and natural gas leases.  These leases are awarded based on competitive bidding and contain relatively standardized terms.  These leases require compliance with BOEM, BSEE, and other government agency regulations and orders that are subject to interpretation and change.  The BOEM and BSEE also regulate the plugging and abandonment of wells located on the OCS and, following cessation of operations, the removal or appropriate abandonment of all production facilities, structures and pipelines on the OCS (collectively, these activities are referred to as “decommissioning”).  
 Decommissioning and financial assurance requirements.  The BOEM requires that lessees demonstrate financial strength and reliability according to its regulations or provide acceptable financial assurances to assure satisfaction of lease obligations, including decommissioning activities on the OCS.  In July 2016, the BOEM issued Notice to Lessees and Operators (“NTL”) #2016-N01 (“NTL #2016-N01”) to clarify the procedures and guidelines that BOEM Regional Directors use to determine if and when additional financial assurances may be required for OCS leases, rights of way (“ROWs”) and rights of use and easement (“RUEs”).  NTL #2016-N01 became effective in September 2016, but the BOEM has since extended indefinitely the start date for implementation.  In December 2016, we received an Order to Provide Additional Security from the BOEM totaling approximately $29.5 million for our sole liability properties (the “December 2016 Order”).  However, following the BOEM’s action in January 2017 to extend the implementation date of NTL #2016-N01 for a period of six months, the BOEM elected to include sole liability properties as being covered under the extension and thus issued us a letter on February 21, 2017 rescinding the December 2016 Order while the BOEM reviewed its financial assurance program.  In June 2017, the BOEM further extended the start date for implementing NTL #2016-N01 indefinitely beyond June 30, 2017.  This extension currently remains in effect; however, the BOEM reserved the right to re-issue sole liability orders in the future, including in the event that it determines there is a substantial risk of nonperformance of the interest holder’s decommissioning sole liabilities.  See Risk Factors under Part I, Item 1A, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Part II, Item 7 and Financial Statements and Supplementary Data under Part II, Item 8 in this Form 10-K for more discussion on decommissioning and financial assurance requirements. 
 4


Reporting of decommissioning expenditures.  During December 2015, the BSEE issued a final rule requiring lessees to submit summaries of actual expenditures for decommissioning of wells, platforms, and other facilities required under the BSEE’s existing regulations.  The BSEE has reported that it will use this summary information to better estimate future decommissioning costs, and the BOEM typically relies upon the BSEE’s estimates to set the amount of required bonds or other forms of financial security in order to minimize the government’s perceived risk of potential decommissioning liability.
 “Unbundling.”  The Office of Natural Resources Revenue (the “ONRR”) has publicly announced an “unbundling” initiative to revise the methodology employed by producers in determining the appropriate allowances for transportation and processing costs that are permitted to be deducted in determining royalties under Federal oil and gas leases.  The ONRR’s initiative requires re-computing allowable transportation and processing costs using revised guidance from the ONRR going back 84 months for every gas processing plant utilized during that period.  Through December 31, 2017, we have paid $ 2.1 million in additional royalties as a result of this initiative.   
 Regulation and transportation of natural gas.  Our sales of natural gas are affected by the availability, terms and cost of transportation.  The price and terms for access to pipeline transportation are subject to extensive regulation.  The FERC has undertaken various initiatives to increase competition within the natural gas industry.  As a result of initiatives like FERC Order No. 636, issued in April 1992, the interstate natural gas transportation and marketing system allows non-pipeline natural gas sellers, including producers, to effectively compete with interstate pipelines for sales to local distribution companies and large industrial and commercial customers.  The most significant provisions of Order No. 636 require that interstate pipelines provide firm and interruptible transportation service on an open access basis that is equal for all natural gas supplies.  In many instances, the results of Order No. 636 and related initiatives have been to substantially reduce or eliminate the interstate pipelines’ traditional role as wholesalers of natural gas in favor of providing only storage and transportation services.  The rates for such storage and transportation services are subject to FERC ratemaking authority, and FERC exercises its authority either by applying cost-of-service principles or granting market based rates.  Similarly, the natural gas pipeline industry is subject to state regulations, which may change from time to time.  
 The OCSLA, which is administered by the BOEM and the FERC, requires that all pipelines operating on or across the OCS provide open access, non-discriminatory transportation service.  One of the FERC’s principal goals in carrying out OCSLA’s mandate is to increase transparency in the OCS market, to provide producers and shippers assurance of open access service on pipelines located on the OCS, and to provide non-discriminatory rates and conditions of service on such pipelines.  The BOEM issued a final rule, effective August 2008 that implements a hotline, alternative dispute resolution procedures, and complaint procedures for resolving claims of having been denied open and nondiscriminatory access to pipelines on the OCS. 
 In December 2007, the FERC issued rules (“Order 704”) requiring that any market participant, including a producer such as us, that engages in wholesale sales or purchases of natural gas that equal or exceed 2.2 million British thermal units (“MMBtu”) during a calendar year must annually report such sales and purchases to the FERC to the extent such transactions utilize, contribute to, or may contribute to the formation of price indices.  It is the responsibility of the reporting entity to determine which individual transactions should be reported based on the guidance of Order 704.  Order 704 also requires market participants to indicate whether they report prices to any index publishers, and if so, whether their reporting complies with FERC’s policy statement on price reporting.  These rules are intended to increase the transparency of the wholesale natural gas markets and to assist the FERC in monitoring such markets and in detecting market manipulation. 
 Additional proposals and proceedings that might affect the natural gas industry are pending before Congress, the FERC, state legislatures, state commissions and the courts.  The natural gas industry historically has been very heavily regulated.  As a result, there is no assurance that the less stringent regulatory approach pursued by the FERC, Congress and the states will continue. 
 While these federal and state regulations for the most part affect us only indirectly, they are intended to enhance competition in natural gas markets.  We cannot predict what further action the FERC, the BOEM or state regulators will take on these matters; however, we do not believe that any such action taken will affect us differently, in any material way, than other natural gas producers with which we compete.

Oil and NGLs transportation rates.  Our sales of liquids, which include crude oil, condensate and NGLs are not currently regulated and are transacted at market prices.  In a number of instances, however, the ability to transport and sell such products is dependent on pipelines whose rates, terms and conditions of service are subject to FERC jurisdiction.  The price we receive from the sale of crude oil and NGLs is affected by the cost of transporting those products to market.  Interstate transportation rates for crude oil, condensate, NGLs and other products are regulated by the FERC.  In general, interstate crude oil, condensate and NGL pipeline rates must be cost-based, although settlement rates agreed to by all shippers are permitted and market based rates may be permitted in certain circumstances. The FERC has established an indexing system for such transportation, which generally allows such pipelines to take an annual inflation-based rate increase. 
 In other instances, the ability to transport and sell such products is dependent on pipelines whose rates, terms and conditions of service are subject to regulation by state regulatory bodies under state statutes and regulations.  As it relates to intrastate crude oil, condensate and NGL pipelines, state regulation is generally less rigorous than the federal regulation of interstate pipelines.  State agencies have generally not investigated or challenged existing or proposed rates in the absence of shipper complaints or protests, which are infrequent and are usually resolved informally.  We do not believe that the regulatory decisions or activities relating to interstate or intrastate crude oil, condensate or NGL pipelines will affect us in a way that materially differs from the way they affect other crude oil, condensate and NGL producers or marketers. 
 Regulation of oil and natural gas exploration and production.  Our exploration and production operations are subject to various types of regulation at the federal, state and local levels.  Such regulations include requiring permits, bonds and pollution liability insurance for the drilling of wells, regulating the location of wells, the method of drilling, casing, operating, plugging and abandoning wells, and governing the surface use and restoration of properties upon which wells are drilled.  Many states also have statutes or regulations addressing conservation of oil and gas resources, including provisions for the unitization or pooling of oil and natural gas properties, the establishment of maximum rates of production from oil and natural gas wells and the regulation of spacing of such wells. 
 Hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico can have a significant impact on oil and gas operations on the OCS.  The effects from past hurricanes have included structural damage to fixed production facilities, semi-submersibles and jack-up drilling rigs.  The BOEM and the BSEE continue to be concerned about the loss of these facilities and rigs as well as the potential for catastrophic damage to key infrastructure and the resultant pollution from future storms.  In an effort to reduce the potential for future damage, the BOEM and the BSEE have periodically issued guidance aimed at improving platform survivability by taking into account environmental and oceanic conditions in the design of platforms and related structures.  
 Environmental Regulations
General.  We are subject to complex and stringent federal, state and local environmental laws.  These laws, among other things, govern the issuance of permits to conduct exploration, drilling and producing operations, the amounts and types of materials that may be released into the environment, the discharge and disposal of waste materials, the remediation of contaminated sites and the reclamation and abandonment of wells, sites and facilities.  Numerous governmental departments issue rules and regulations to implement and enforce such laws, which are often costly to comply with, and a failure to comply may result in substantial administrative, civil and even criminal penalties or the suspension or cessation of operations in affected areas.  Some laws, rules and regulations relating to protection of the environment may, in certain circumstances, impose strict liability for environmental contamination, rendering a person liable for environmental damages and cleanup costs without regard to negligence or fault on the part of such person.  Other laws, rules and regulations may restrict the rate of oil and natural gas production below the rate that would otherwise exist or even prohibit exploration and production activities in sensitive areas.  In addition, state laws often require various forms of remedial action to prevent and address pollution, such as the closure of inactive oil and gas waste pits and the plugging of abandoned wells.  The regulatory burden on the oil and gas industry increases our cost of doing business and consequently affects our profitability.  The cost of remediation, reclamation and decommissioning, including abandonment of wells, platforms and other facilities in the Gulf of Mexico is significant.  These costs are considered a normal, recurring cost of our on-going operations.  Our competitors are subject to the same laws and regulations.

 Hazardous Substances and Wastes.  The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (“CERCLA”) imposes liability, without regard to fault, on certain classes of persons that are considered to be responsible for the release of a “hazardous substance” into the environment.  These persons include the current or former owner or operator of the disposal site or sites where the release occurred and companies that disposed or arranged for the disposal of hazardous substances.  Under CERCLA, such persons are subject to joint and several liability for the cost of investigating and cleaning up hazardous substances that have been released into the environment, for damages to natural resources and for the cost of certain health studies.  
 The federal Solid Waste Disposal Act, as amended by the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976 (“RCRA”), regulates the generation, transportation, storage, treatment and disposal of non-hazardous and hazardous wastes and can require cleanup of hazardous waste disposal sites.  RCRA currently excludes drilling fluids, produced waters and certain other wastes associated with the exploration, development or production of oil and natural gas from regulation as “hazardous waste,” and the disposal of such oil and natural gas exploration, development and production wastes is regulated under less onerous non-hazardous waste requirements, usually  under state law.  From time to time, however, various environmental groups have challenged the Environmental Protection Agency’s (“EPA”) exemption of certain oil and gas wastes from RCRA.  For example, following the filing of a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia in May 2016 by several non-governmental environmental groups against the EPA for the agency’s failure to timely assess its RCRA Subtitle D criteria regulations for oil and gas wastes, the EPA and the environmental groups entered into an agreement that was finalized in a consent decree issued by the District Court on December 28, 2016.  Under the decree, the EPA must propose no later than March 15, 2019, a rulemaking for revision of certain Subtitle D criteria regulations pertaining to oil and gas wastes or sign a determination that revision of the regulations is not necessary.  If the EPA proposes a rulemaking for revised oil and gas waste regulations, the consent decree requires that the EPA take final action following notice and comment rulemaking no later than July 15, 2021.  In addition, legislation has been proposed from time to time in Congress that would revoke or alter the current exclusion of exploration, development and production wastes from the RCRA definition of “hazardous wastes.”  A loss of the RCRA exclusion for drilling fluids, produced waters and related wastes could potentially subject such wastes to more stringent handling, disposal and cleanup requirements.  Other wastes handled at exploration and production sites or generated in the course of providing well services may not fall within the RCRA exclusion.  Moreover, stricter standards for waste handling, disposal and cleanup may be imposed on the oil and natural gas industry in the future.  Additionally, Naturally Occurring Radioactive Materials (“NORM”) may contaminate minerals extraction and processing equipment used in the oil and natural gas industry.  The waste resulting from such contamination is regulated by federal and state laws.  Standards have been developed for: worker protection; treatment, storage, and disposal of NORM and NORM waste; management of NORM-contaminated waste piles, containers and tanks; and limitations on the relinquishment of NORM contaminated land for unrestricted use under RCRA and state laws.  We do not anticipate any material expenditures in connection with our compliance with existing RCRA and applicable state laws related to NORM waste. 
 Air Emissions and Climate Change.  Air emissions from our operations are subject to the federal Clean Air Act (“CAA”) and comparable state and local requirements.  We may be required to incur certain capital expenditures in the future for air pollution control equipment in connection with obtaining and maintaining operating permits and approvals for air emissions.  For example, in October 2015, the EPA issued a final rule under the Clean Air Act lowering the National Ambient Air Quality Standard for ground level ozone from 75 to 70 parts per billion.  The EPA published a final rule in November 2017 establishing attainment area designations for certain areas of the US and is expected to issue nonattainment designations for additional areas of the US in the first half of 2018, which areas may include regions where we conduct operations.  In addition, the EPA has developed, and continues to develop, stringent regulations governing emissions of toxic air pollutants at specified sources.  Moreover, the U.S. Congress and the EPA, in addition to some state and regional efforts, have in recent years considered legislation or regulations to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases (“GHG”).  These efforts have included consideration of cap-and-trade programs, carbon taxes, and GHG monitoring and reporting programs.  
 7


In the absence of federal GHG limitations, the EPA has determined that GHG emissions present a danger to public health and the environment, and it has adopted regulations that, among other things, restrict emissions of GHG under existing provisions of the CAA and may require the installation of control technologies to limit emissions of GHG.  For example, in June 2016, the EPA published a final rule establishing new source performance standards that require new, modified, or reconstructed facilities in the oil and natural gas sector to reduce methane gas and volatile organic compound emissions.  The 2016 rule would apply to any new or significantly modified facilities that we construct in the future that would otherwise emit large volumes of GHG together with other criteria pollutants.  However, in June 2017, the EPA published a proposed rule to stay certain portions of the 2016 rule for two years and reconsider the entirety of the 2016 rule but the agency has not yet published a final rule and, as a result, the 2016 rule is currently in effect but future implementation of the 2016 rule is uncertain at this time.  Also, certain of our operations are subject to EPA rules requiring the monitoring and annual reporting of GHG emissions from specified offshore production sources.  
 Water Discharges.  The primary federal law for oil spill liability is the Oil Pollution Act (the “OPA”) which amends and augments oil spill provisions of the federal Water Pollution Control Act (the “Clean Water Act”).  OPA imposes certain duties and liabilities on “responsible parties” related to the prevention of oil spills and damages resulting from such spills in or threatening United States waters, including the OCS or adjoining shorelines.  A liable “responsible party” includes the owner or operator of an onshore facility, vessel or pipeline that is a source of an oil discharge or that poses the substantial threat of discharge or, in the case of offshore facilities, the lessee or permittee of the area in which a discharging facility is located.  OPA assigns joint and several, strict liability, without regard to fault, to each liable party for all containment and oil removal costs and a variety of public and private damages including, but not limited to, the costs of responding to a release of oil and natural resource damages and economic damages suffered by persons adversely affected by an oil spill.  Although defenses exist to the liability imposed by OPA, they are limited.  In addition, in January 2018, the BOEM raised OPA’s damages liability cap to $137.7 million.  OPA requires owners and operators of offshore oil production facilities to establish and maintain evidence of financial responsibility to cover costs that could be incurred in responding to an oil spill, and to prepare and submit for approval oil spill response plans.  These oil spill response plans must detail the action to be taken in the event of a spill; identify contracted spill response equipment, materials, and trained personnel; and identify the time necessary to deploy these resources in the event of a spill.  In addition, OPA currently requires a minimum financial responsibility demonstration of between $35 million and $150 million for companies operating on the OCS.  We are currently required to demonstrate, on an annual basis, that we have ready access to $150 million that can be used to respond to an oil spill from our facilities on the OCS.  
 The Clean Water Act and comparable state laws impose restrictions and strict controls regarding the monitoring and discharge of pollutants, including produced waters and other natural gas wastes, into federal and state waters.  The discharge of pollutants into regulated waters is prohibited, except in accordance with the terms of a permit issued by the EPA or the state.  The EPA has also adopted regulations requiring certain onshore oil and natural gas exploration and production facilities to obtain individual permits or coverage under general permits for storm water discharges.  The treatment of wastewater or developing and implementing storm water pollution prevention plans, as well as for monitoring and sampling the storm water runoff from our onshore gas processing plant may have significant costs.  Obtaining permits has the potential to delay the development of oil and natural gas projects.  These same regulatory programs also limit the total volume of water that can be discharged, hence limiting the rate of development, and require us to incur compliance costs.  Pursuant to these laws and regulations, we may be required to obtain and maintain approvals or permits for the discharge of wastewater or storm water and are required to develop and implement spill prevention, control and countermeasure plans, also referred to as “SPCC plans,” in connection with on-site storage of significant quantities of oil.  
 Protected and Endangered Species.  Executive Order 13158, issued in May 2000, directs federal agencies to safeguard existing Marine Protected Areas (“MPAs”) in the United States and establish new MPAs.  The order requires federal agencies to avoid harm to MPAs to the extent permitted by law and to the maximum extent practicable.  It also directs the EPA to propose new regulations under the Clean Water Act to ensure appropriate levels of protection for the marine environment.  In addition, Federal Lease Stipulations include regulations regarding the taking of protected marine species (sea turtles, marine mammals, Gulf sturgeon and other listed marine species).

Certain flora and fauna that have been officially classified as “threatened” or “endangered” are protected by the Endangered Species Act (“ESA”).  This law prohibits any activities that could “take” a protected plant or animal or reduce or degrade its habitat area.  We conduct operations on leases in areas where certain species that are listed as threatened or endangered are known to exist and where other species that potentially could be listed as threatened or endangered under the ESA may exist.  We own a non-producing platform in the Gulf of Mexico located in a National Marine Sanctuary.  As a result, we are subject to additional federal regulation, including regulations issued by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.  Unique regulations related to operations in a sanctuary include prohibition of drilling activities within certain protected areas, restrictions on the types of water and other substances that may be discharged, required depths of discharge in connection with drilling and production activities and limitations on mooring of vessels.  During 2017, we reached an agreement with the various governmental agencies to remove the topside structure on our non-producing platform located in the National Marine Sanctuary and leave the bottom of the platform structure below the water line in place.  This bottom portion of the platform structure will remain due to the density and diversity of marine growth attached to and around the structure.   
 Other federal statutes that provide protection to animal and plant species and which may apply to our operations include, but are not necessarily limited to, the National Environmental Policy Act, the Coastal Zone Management Act, the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act, the Marine Mammal Protection Act, the Marine Protection, Research and Sanctuaries Act, the Fish and Wildlife Coordination Act, the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act, the Migratory Bird Treaty Act and the National Historic Preservation Act.  These laws and regulations may require the acquisition of a permit or other authorization before construction or drilling commences and may limit or prohibit construction, drilling and other activities on certain lands lying within wilderness or wetlands.  These and other protected areas may require certain mitigation measures to avoid harm to wildlife, and such laws and regulations may impose substantial liabilities for pollution resulting from our operations.  The permits required for our various operations are subject to revocation, modification and renewal by issuing authorities.  
 Financial Information
 We operate our business as a single segment. See Selected Financial Data under Part II, Item 6 and Financial Statements and Supplementary Data under Part II, Item 8 in this Form 10-K for our financial information.
 Seasonality 
 Generally, the demand for and price of natural gas increases during the winter months and decreases during the summer months.  However, these seasonal fluctuations are somewhat reduced because during the summer, pipeline companies, utilities, local distribution companies and industrial users purchase and place into storage facilities a portion of their anticipated winter requirements of natural gas.  As utilities continue to switch from coal to natural gas, some of this seasonality has been reduced as natural gas is used for both heating and cooling.  In addition, the demand for oil is higher in the winter months, but does not fluctuate seasonally as much as natural gas.  Seasonal weather changes affect our operations.  Tropical storms and hurricanes occur in the Gulf of Mexico during the summer and fall, which require us to evacuate personnel and shut in production until the storm subsides.  Also, periodic storms during the winter often impede our ability to safely load, unload and transport personnel and equipment, which delays the installation of production facilities, thereby delaying production and sales of our oil and natural gas. 
Employees 
 As of December 31, 2017, we employed 298 people.  We are not a party to any collective bargaining agreements and we have not experienced any strikes or work stoppages.  We consider our relations with our employees to be good.
