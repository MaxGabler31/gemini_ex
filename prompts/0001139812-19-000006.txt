Item 1. | Business

General

MB Financial, Inc., headquartered in Chicago, Illinois, is a financial holding company with banking offices located primarily in the Chicago area.  The words “MB Financial,”  “the Company,” “we,” “our” and “us” refer to MB Financial, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries, unless the context indicates otherwise.  Our primary market is the Chicago metropolitan area, in which we operate 86 banking offices through our bank subsidiary, MB Financial Bank, N.A. (MB Financial Bank). Through MB Financial Bank, we offer a broad range of financial services predominately to small and middle market businesses and individuals in the markets that we serve. We also offer financial services on a national basis. Our main business segments include Banking, Leasing and Mortgage Banking.  As of December 31, 2018, on a consolidated basis, we had total assets of $20.2 billion, deposits of $14.7 billion, stockholders’ equity of $3.0 billion, and client assets under management or advisement of $7.5 billion in our wealth management group (including $3.0 billion in our trust department and $4.5 billion in our bank-owned investment management firm, MSA Holdings, LLC ("MSA"), the parent company of our registered investment advisors, MainStreet Investment Advisors, LLC ("MainStreet") and Cedar Hill Associates LLC ("Cedar Hill")). 

MB Financial, Inc. was incorporated as a Maryland corporation in 2001 in connection with a merger of predecessor companies. We have completed a number of acquisitions in recent years.

On August 18, 2014, the Company acquired Taylor Capital Group, Inc. ("Taylor Capital"), a bank holding company and the parent company of Cole Taylor Bank, a commercial bank headquartered in Chicago, through the merger of Taylor Capital with and into the Company, followed immediately by the merger of Cole Taylor Bank with and into MB Financial Bank. Consideration paid by the Company was $648.8 million, including $519.3 million in common stock and $129.5 million in cash. The Company issued 19.6 million shares of common stock as a result of the merger. In addition, each share of Taylor Capital’s Perpetual Non-Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series A was converted into one share of the Company's Perpetual Non-Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series A with substantially identical terms. On February 15, 2018, the Company redeemed all of the outstanding shares of the Company's Perpetual Non-Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series A. 

On December 31, 2015, MB Financial Bank acquired a 100% equity interest in MSA, then the parent company of MainStreet and Cambium Asset Management, LLC ("Cambium"), a registered investment advisor. In 2017, Cambium was merged into Cedar Hill, a registered investment advisor subsidiary of MB Financial Bank which became a subsidiary of MSA following that transaction.
On August 24, 2016, the Company acquired American Chartered Bancorp, Inc. ("American Chartered"), a bank holding company and the parent company of American Chartered Bank, a commercial bank headquartered in Schaumburg, Illinois, through the merger of American Chartered with and into the Company, followed immediately by the merger of American Chartered Bank with and into MB Financial Bank. Consideration paid was $487.4 million, including $382.8 million in common stock (9.7 million shares), $102.3 million in cash and $2.3 million in preferred stock and stock-based awards assumed.

Operating Segments 

Our operations are managed based on the operating results of three reportable segments: Banking, Leasing and Mortgage Banking. Our chief operating decision-makers use financial information from our three reportable segments to make operating and strategic decisions. 
Banking. We concentrate on serving small and middle market businesses and their owners. We also focus on serving consumers who live or work near our branches. We operate the following lines of business within our Banking Segment: commercial banking, loans to leasing companies, retail banking, cards and bank sponsorships, and wealth management. Each is described below.
Commercial Banking.  Commercial banking focuses on serving middle market businesses, primarily located in the Chicago metropolitan, southern Wisconsin and northern Indiana areas, except for our long-term health care and asset-based lending which have a more national scope. We provide a full set of credit, deposit, treasury management, capital markets, and international banking products to these companies. In general, our credit products are designed for companies with annual revenues between $3 million and $500 million. We have a broad range of credit products for our target market, including working capital loans and lines of credit; accounts receivable financing; inventory and equipment financing; industrial revenue bond financing; ESOP financing; business acquisition loans; owner occupied real estate loans; asset-based loans; and financial, performance and commercial letters of credit. Our deposit and treasury management products are designed for companies with annual revenues up to $500 million and include internet banking products, investment sweep accounts, zero balance accounts, automated tax payments, ATM access, telephone banking, lockbox, automated clearing house transactions, account reconciliation, controlled disbursement, detail and general information reporting, wire transfers, vault services for currency and coin, remote deposit capture and checking accounts. Our capital markets products include derivatives and interest rate risk solutions, capital solutions, merger and acquisition advisory, and real estate debt and equity placement. Our international banking services include trade services, export trade finance, and foreign exchange. We also provide a full set of credit, deposit and treasury management services for real estate operators and investors. Some treasury management services are provided nationwide.
Loans to Leasing Companies. Through this line of business, we offer loans similar to those offered in the commercial banking business line but serve equipment lessors located throughout the United States. We have provided banking services to this industry for more than four decades. Competition in serving equipment lessors generally comes from large banks, finance companies, large industrial companies and some community banks. We compete based upon rapid decision-making and elite service and by providing flexible financial solutions to meet our customers' needs. We provide full banking services to leasing companies by financing the debt portion of leveraged equipment leases (referred to as lease loans), providing short and long-term equity financing and making working capital and bridge loans. For lease loans, a lessee's credit is often rated as investment grade for its public debt by Moody's Investor Services. Whether or not a lessee has a public debt rating, they are subject to the same internal credit analysis as any other customer of MB Financial Bank. Lessees mostly include investment grade “Fortune 1000” companies located throughout the U.S. and large middle-market companies.
Retail Banking. Retail banking has 86 banking offices and 119 ATMs located throughout the Chicago metropolitan area. Our target customers are small businesses (with annual revenues up to $10 million) located in our market and consumers who live and work near our banking centers. We offer our retail banking customers, both business and consumer, a variety of deposit products and services, such as checking, savings, money market, NOW and certificates of deposit. Our products are designed to meet the needs of customers of all ages and lifestyles. Our services are conveniently delivered through our branch network, as well as through our electronic channels, internet and mobile banking, providing added access for all clients.
Our business banking division continues to grow. This division offers the expertise of a business banker, coupled with the personal attention of a local branch, to small businesses in our market. These businesses are afforded the same services available to our larger commercial customers, customized to meet the unique needs of our entrepreneurial clients. 
Cards and Bank Sponsorships. Our cards and bank sponsorship division offers general reloadable prepaid cards, payroll cards, incentive cards, and gift cards. These products are extended to existing customers and offered nationally (through sponsorship 
5

programs where MB Financial Bank is the issuing bank) to companies needing card payment solutions. In addition, we offer a small business corporate credit card, as well as a commercial multi-card which serves as both a travel and entertainment card and a purchasing card for our larger business customers.

Wealth Management.  Our wealth management group provides comprehensive wealth management solutions. We provide investment management, private banking services, financial planning and wealth advisory services to business owners, high net worth individuals, foundations, endowments and municipal agencies, through our private bankers, asset management and trust advisors. In addition, personal trust, custody, estate settlement, guardianship and retirement plan services are provided through our asset management and trust advisors. MainStreet, our registered investment advisor focused on the institutional sector, provides investment advisory solutions to the bank trust and independent trust company markets.
Leasing.  Leasing includes lease originations and related services offered through our leasing subsidiary, MB Equipment Finance. We invest directly in equipment that we lease (referred to as direct finance, leveraged or operating leases) to "Fortune 1000," large middle-market companies and health care providers located throughout the United States. Our lease portfolio consists of various kinds of equipment, generally technology related, such as computer systems, satellite equipment, medical equipment and general manufacturing, industrial, construction and transportation equipment. We seek leasing transactions where we believe the equipment leased is integral to the lessee's business, thereby increasing the likelihood of renewal at the end of the lease term. Our leasing subsidiary is also a value-added reseller of third party equipment maintenance contracts, hardware, and software to large companies.
Mortgage Banking. Prior to April 12, 2018, the Mortgage Banking Segment conducted business on a national level and originated residential mortgage loans for sale to investors and for the Company's portfolio through its mortgage retail offices, third-party channels, and our 86 Chicago area retail banking branches. On April 12, 2018, the Company announced the discontinuation of its national mortgage origination business, which includes substantially all originations outside of the Company's consumer banking footprint in the Chicagoland area. As a result, the Company expects to stop operating its mortgage business as a defined segment with separate Mortgage Banking Segment reporting in 2019. The Company plans to continue originating residential mortgage loans in the greater Chicago area through its mortgage retail offices, retain the mortgage servicing asset as well as its mortgage servicing operation in Wilmington, Ohio, and continue holding certain residential mortgages on its balance sheet. 
Lending Activities

General.  Our loan portfolio consists primarily of loans to businesses or for business purposes.

Commercial.  We make commercial loans mainly to middle market businesses, generally located in the Chicago metropolitan, southern Wisconsin, and northern Indiana areas.  Borrowers tend to be privately-owned and are generally manufacturers, wholesalers, distributors, long-term health care operators and service providers. Certain long-term health care borrowers are located outside the Chicago metropolitan, southern Wisconsin, and northern Indiana areas.  Loan products offered are primarily working capital, term loans and lines of credit that help our customers finance accounts receivable, inventory and equipment.  We also offer financial, performance and commercial letters of credit.  Commercial loans secured by owner occupied real estate are classified as commercial real estate loans.  Most commercial loans are short-term in nature, being one year or less, with the maximum term generally being five to seven years.  
Lines of credit for customers are typically secured and are subject to renewal upon a satisfactory review of the borrower’s financial condition and credit history.  Secured short-term commercial business loans are usually collateralized by accounts receivable, inventory, equipment and/or real estate, and advances are usually predicated on predetermined advance rates depending upon asset class.  Such loans are typically, but not always, guaranteed by the owners of the business.  Collateral securing commercial loans may depreciate over time, be difficult to appraise and fluctuate in value based on the success of the business.  In addition, in the case of loans secured by accounts receivable, the availability of funds for repayment and economic conditions may impact the ability of the borrower to collect the amounts due from its customers.  Accordingly, we make our commercial loans primarily based on the historical and expected cash flow of the borrower, secondarily on underlying collateral provided by the borrower, and lastly on guarantor support.
We also offer asset-based loans to businesses with collateral as the primary source of repayment. Most asset-based borrowers are located outside the Chicago, southern Wisconsin, and northern Indiana areas.  Collateral for these loans may include accounts receivable, inventory, equipment and owner-occupied real estate.  Collateral is monitored regularly to insure ongoing sufficiency of coverage and quality.  The primary risk for these loans is a significant decline in collateral values due to general market conditions.  Loan terms that mitigate these risks include asset appraisals with typical industry advance rates and amortization periods on fixed assets, percentage of collateral advance rates on current assets, ongoing field exams, dominion over cash collections using cash collateral accounts and regular asset monitoring.  Because of the national scope of our asset-based lending, the risk of these loans is also diversified by industry and geography.

Commercial Real Estate.  We originate commercial real estate loans that are generally secured by multi-unit residential property and owner and non-owner occupied commercial and industrial property.  Longer term commercial real estate loans are generally made at fixed rates, although some have interest rates that change based on the Prime Rate or LIBOR.  Generally, most loans are structured with a balloon payment at the end of five years or less. Periodically, terms of up to twenty-five years are offered on fully amortizing loans.  For our fixed rate loans with maturities greater than five years, we may enter into interest rate swap agreements with a third party to mitigate interest rate risk.  In deciding whether to make a commercial real estate loan, we consider, among other things, the experience and qualifications of the borrower as well as the value and cash flow of the underlying property.  Some other factors considered are net operating income of the property before debt service and depreciation, the debt service coverage ratio (the ratio of the property’s net cash flow to debt service requirements), the global cash flows of the borrower, the ratio of the loan amount to the property value and the overall creditworthiness of the prospective borrower.  Our commercial real estate loans typically range in size from $250 thousand to $30 million.

The repayment of commercial real estate loans is often dependent on the successful operations of the property securing the loan or the business conducted on the property securing the loan.  In addition, most commercial real estate loans are not fully amortized over the loan period but have balloon payments due at maturity.  A borrower’s ability to make a balloon payment typically will depend on their ability to either refinance the loan or complete a timely sale of the underlying property.

Construction Real Estate.  Construction lending can involve a higher level of risk than other types of lending because funds are advanced partially based upon the value of the project, which is uncertain prior to the project’s completion.  Because of the uncertainties inherent in estimating construction costs as well as the market value of a completed project and the effects of governmental regulation on real property, our estimates with regard to the total funds required to complete a project and the related loan-to-value ratio may vary from actual results.  As a result, construction loans often involve the disbursement of substantial funds with repayment dependent, in part, on the success of the ultimate project and the ability of the borrower to sell or lease the property or refinance the indebtedness.  
Lease Loans.  We lend money to leasing companies to finance the debt portion of leases (which we refer to as lease loans).  A lease loan arises when a lessor discounts the equipment rental revenue stream owed to the lessor by a lessee.  Lease loans generally are non-recourse to the leasing company, and, consequently, our recourse is limited to the lessee and the leased equipment.  For this reason, we underwrite lease loans by examining the creditworthiness of the lessee rather than the lessor.  Generally, lease loans are secured by an assignment of lease payments and a security interest in the equipment being leased.  As with commercial loans secured by equipment, equipment securing our lease loans may depreciate over time, may be difficult to value and may fluctuate in value.  We rely on the lessee’s continuing financial stability, rather than the value of the leased equipment, for repayment of all required amounts under lease loans.  In the event of default, it is unlikely that the proceeds from the sale of leased equipment will be sufficient to satisfy the outstanding unpaid amounts under terms of the lease loan.

The lessees usually acknowledge our security interest in the leased equipment and often agree to send lease payments directly to us.  Lessees are often companies that have an investment grade public debt rating by Moody’s or the equivalent although we also provide credit to below investment grade and non-rated companies.  Whether or not a lessee has a public debt rating, they are subject to the same internal credit analysis as any other customer.  Lease loans typically have a fixed interest rate and are fully amortizing, with maturities typically ranging from three to five years.  

Primarily through our Leasing Segment, we also invest directly in equipment leased to other companies (which we refer to as direct finance, leveraged or operating leases).  The profitability of these investments depends, to a great degree, upon our ability to realize the expected residual values of this equipment.  See “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Critical Accounting Policies-Residual Value of Our Direct Finance, Leveraged, and Operating Leases.”

Residential Real Estate.  We originate fixed and adjustable rate residential real estate loans secured by one to four unit dwellings.  Terms of first mortgages generally range from 15 to 30 years.  In deciding whether to make a residential real estate loan, we consider the qualifications of the borrower as well as the value of the underlying property.  

Consumer.  Our consumer loan portfolio is primarily focused on indirect motorcycle, powersports, recreational vehicles, and marine loans provided through a network of dealers in 47 states. Terms of these fixed rate loans typically range from two to fifteen years depending on the product. In deciding whether to make an indirect loan, we consider the qualifications of the borrower as well as the value of the collateral.
Our consumer loan portfolio also includes home equity lines of credit, fixed-rate home equity loans, personal and business credit cards, and to a lesser extent, secured and unsecured consumer loans.  Home equity lines of credit and home equity loans 
7

are generally extended up to 80% of the value of the property, less outstanding first mortgage loans. Typical terms for home equity lines of credit are 10 years of interest only payments and a 10-year fully amortizing repayment thereafter. Terms for home equity loans typically range from five to ten years.  In deciding whether to make a home equity line of credit or loan, we consider the qualifications of the borrower(s) as well as the value of the underlying property.  In deciding whether to make other consumer loans, we evaluate the qualifications of the borrower(s) and any collateral, if applicable.

Unsecured consumer loans typically have shorter terms and lower balances with higher yields as compared to residential real estate loans but carry a higher risk of default.  Consumer loan collections are dependent on the borrower’s continuing financial stability, and thus, are more likely to be affected by adverse personal circumstances.  Furthermore, the application of various federal and state laws, including bankruptcy and insolvency laws, may limit the amount which can be recovered on these loans in the event of default.
Competition

We face substantial competition in all phases of our operations, including deposit gathering and loan origination, from a variety of competitors.  Commercial banks, savings institutions, brokerage firms, credit unions, mutual fund companies, asset management firms, insurance companies and specialty finance companies all compete with us for new and existing customers.  We compete by providing quality services and expertise to our customers, ease of access to our facilities, convenient hours and competitive pricing (including competitive interest rates paid on deposits, interest rates charged on loans and fees charged for other non-interest related services).
Personnel

As of December 31, 2018, we and our subsidiaries employed a total of 2,661 full-time equivalent employees.  We consider our relationship with our employees to be good.
Supervision and Regulation 

We, our bank subsidiary (MB Financial Bank), and its subsidiaries, are subject to an extensive system of laws and regulations that are intended primarily for the protection of customers and depositors and not for the protection of security holders.  These laws and regulations govern such areas as capital, permissible activities, allowance for loan and lease losses, loans and investments, and rates of interest that can be charged on loans.  Described below are elements of selected laws and regulations.  The descriptions are not intended to be complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the full text of the statutes and regulations described.

Holding Company Regulation.  As a bank holding company and a financial holding company, we are subject to comprehensive regulation by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, frequently referred to as the Federal Reserve Board, under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 (the "Bank Holding Company Act"), as amended by the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 (the “Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act”), the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the “Dodd-Frank Act”), enacted on July 21, 2010, and other legislation.  We must file reports with the Federal Reserve Board and such additional information as the Federal Reserve Board may require, and our holding company and non-banking affiliates are subject to examination by the Federal Reserve Board.  Under Federal Reserve Board policy, the Dodd-Frank Act and Federal Reserve Board regulations, a bank holding company must serve as a source of strength for its bank subsidiaries.  The Federal Reserve Board may require, and has required in the past, a holding company to contribute additional capital to an undercapitalized bank subsidiary.  The Bank Holding Company Act provides that a bank holding company must obtain Federal Reserve Board approval before:


• | Acquiring directly or indirectly, ownership or control of any voting shares of another bank or bank holding company if, after such acquisition, it would own or control more than 5% of such shares (unless it already owns or controls the majority of such shares);


• | Acquiring control of, or all or substantially all of the assets of, another bank or bank holding company, or


• | Merging or consolidating with another bank holding company.


The Bank Holding Company Act generally prohibits a bank holding company from acquiring direct or indirect ownership or control of more than 5% of the voting shares of any company which is not a bank or bank holding company, or from engaging directly or indirectly in activities other than those of banking, managing or controlling banks, or providing services for its subsidiaries. The principal exceptions to these prohibitions involve certain non-bank activities which, by statute or by Federal Reserve Board regulation or order, have been identified as activities closely related to the business of banking or managing or controlling banks.  The list of activities permitted by the Federal Reserve Board includes, among other things: lending; operating a savings institution, mortgage company, finance company, credit card company or factoring company; performing certain data 
8

processing operations; providing certain investment and financial advice; underwriting and acting as an insurance agent for certain types of credit-related insurance; leasing property on a full-payout, non-operating basis; selling money orders, travelers’ checks and United States Savings Bonds; real estate and personal property appraising; providing tax planning and preparation services; and, subject to certain limitations, providing securities brokerage services for customers.  

The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act amended portions of the Bank Holding Company Act to authorize bank holding companies, such as us, directly or through non-bank subsidiaries to engage in securities, insurance and other activities that are financial in nature or incidental to a financial activity.  In order to undertake these activities, a bank holding company must become a “financial holding company” by submitting to the appropriate Federal Reserve Bank a declaration that the company elects to be a financial holding company and a certification that all of the depository institutions controlled by the company are well capitalized and well managed. In addition, each such depository institution must have at least a satisfactory rating under the Community Reinvestment Act ("CRA").  Our election to become a financial holding company became effective in July 2002.

Depository Institution Regulation.  Our bank subsidiary is subject to regulation by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.  This regulatory structure includes, among other items:

• | Real estate lending standards, which provide guidelines concerning loan-to-value ratios for various types of real estate loans;


• | Risk-based capital rules, including accounting for interest rate risk, concentration of credit risk and the risks posed by non-traditional activities;


• | Rules requiring depository institutions to develop and implement internal procedures to evaluate and control credit and settlement exposure to their correspondent banks;


• | Rules restricting types and amounts of equity investments; and


• | Rules addressing various safety and soundness issues, including operations and managerial standards, standards for asset quality, earnings and compensation standards.

Our bank subsidiary and its affiliates are subject to the examination and enforcement powers of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (the “CFPB”) with respect to federal consumer financial laws.

Capital Adequacy.  The Federal Reserve Board, Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (collectively, the federal banking agencies) have issued risk-based and leverage capital regulations applicable to bank holding companies and banks.  In addition, these agencies may from time to time require that a bank holding company or bank maintain capital above the minimum levels, based on its financial condition or actual or anticipated growth. 
Effective January 1, 2015 (with some provisions phased in over several years), we and our bank subsidiary became subject to new capital regulations adopted by the Federal Reserve and the OCC, which establish required minimum risk-based capital ratios for common equity Tier 1 (“CET1”), Tier 1, and total capital and a minimum required leverage ratio and capital conservation buffer; prescribe the risk-weightings of certain assets for purposes of the risk-based capital ratios; and define what qualifies as capital for purposes of meeting the capital requirements. These regulations implement the regulatory capital reforms required by the Dodd Frank Act and the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision. The federal banking agencies have also adopted a rule on liquidity coverage requirements, which applies only to banking organizations with total consolidated assets of $250 billion or more or on-balance sheet foreign exposure of $10 billion or more, and sets less stringent requirements for institutions that do not meet these requirements but have $50 billion in or more in total assets.
Under the capital regulations, the minimum capital ratios are: (1) a CET1 capital ratio of 4.5% of risk-weighted assets; (2) a Tier 1 capital ratio of 6.0% of risk-weighted assets; (3) a total capital ratio of 8.0% of risk-weighted assets; and (4) a leverage ratio (the ratio of Tier 1 capital to average total adjusted assets) of 4.0%.  CET1 generally consists of common stock; retained earnings; accumulated other comprehensive income (“AOCI”) unless an institution elects to exclude AOCI from regulatory capital; and certain minority interests; all subject to applicable regulatory adjustments and deductions. Tier 1 capital generally consists of CET1 and noncumulative perpetual preferred stock. Tier 2 capital generally consists of other preferred stock and subordinated debt meeting certain conditions plus an amount of the allowance for loan and lease losses up to 1.25% of assets. Total capital is the sum of Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital.
There are a number of changes in what constitutes regulatory capital compared to the rules in effect prior to January 1, 2015, some of which are subject to transition periods.  These changes include the phasing-out of certain instruments as qualifying capital and eliminate or significantly reduce the use of hybrid capital instruments, especially trust preferred securities, as regulatory capital. Mortgage servicing and deferred tax assets over designated percentages of the CET1 threshold are deducted from capital.  In addition, Tier 1 capital includes AOCI, which includes all unrealized gains and losses on available for sale debt and equity securities.  However, because of our asset size at the time of election, we were eligible to elect to permanently opt out of the 
9

inclusion of unrealized gains and losses on available for sale debt and equity securities in our capital calculations.  We elected this option in the first quarter of 2015.
For purposes of determining risk-based capital, assets and certain off-balance sheet items are risk-weighted from 0% to 1,250%, depending on the risk characteristics of the asset or item. The current regulations changed the risk-weighting of certain assets to better reflect credit risk and other risk exposure compared to the earlier capital rules. These include a 150% risk weight for certain high volatility commercial real estate acquisition, development and construction loans and for non-residential mortgage loans that are 90 days past due or otherwise in non-accrual status; a 20% credit conversion factor for the unused portion of a commitment with an original maturity of one year or less that is not unconditionally cancellable; and, starting in 2018, a 250% risk weight for mortgage servicing and deferred tax assets that are not deducted from capital.
In addition to the minimum CET1, Tier 1, leverage ratio and total capital ratios, the Company and the Bank must maintain a capital conservation buffer consisting of additional CET1 capital greater than 2.5% of risk-weighted assets above the required minimum risk-based capital levels to avoid limitations on paying dividends, repurchasing shares, and paying discretionary bonuses.  The capital conservation buffer requirement began to be phased in on January 1, 2016 when a buffer greater than 0.625% of risk-weighted assets was required, which amount increased each year until the buffer requirement was fully implemented on January 1, 2019.

The Financial Accounting Standards Board has adopted a new accounting standard for US Generally Accepted Accounting Principles that will be effective for our first fiscal year beginning after December 31, 2019. This standard, referred to as Current Expected Credit Loss ("CECL") requires FDIC-insured institutions and their holding companies (banking organizations) to recognize credit losses expected over the life of certain financial assets. CECL covers a broader range of assets than the current method of recognizing credit losses and generally results in earlier recognition of credit losses. Upon adoption of CECL, a banking organization must record a one-time adjustment to its credit loss allowances as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption equal to the difference, if any, between the amount of credit loss allowances under the current methodology and the amount required under CECL. For a banking organization, implementation of CECL is generally likely to reduce retained earnings, and to affect other items, in a manner that reduces its regulatory capital. The federal banking regulators (the Federal Reserve, the OCC and the FDIC) have adopted a rule that gives a banking organization the option to phase in over a three-year period the day-one adverse effects of CECL on its regulatory capital.
To be considered "well capitalized," a bank holding company must have, on a consolidated basis, a total risk-based capital ratio of 10.0% or greater and a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6.0% or greater and must not be subject to an individual order, directive or agreement under which the FRB requires it to maintain a specific capital level. 
As of December 31, 2018, we and our bank subsidiary met the requirements to be "well capitalized" and the full capital conservation buffer requirement. The well capitalized standard for the Bank is discussed below.

Prompt Corrective Action.  The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 ("the Act"), among other things, identifies five capital categories for insured depository institutions (well capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized) and requires the respective federal bank regulatory agencies to implement systems for “prompt corrective action” for insured depository institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements within these categories.  The Act imposes progressively more restrictive constraints on operations, management and capital distributions, depending on the category in which an institution is classified.  Failure to meet the capital guidelines could also subject a banking institution to capital raising requirements.  An “undercapitalized” bank must develop a capital restoration plan and its parent holding company must guarantee that bank’s compliance with the plan.  The liability of the parent holding company under any such guarantee is limited to the lesser of 5% of the bank’s assets at the time it became “undercapitalized” or the amount needed to comply with the plan.  Furthermore, in the event of the bankruptcy of the parent holding company, such guarantee would take priority over the parent’s general unsecured creditors.  In addition, the Act requires the various regulatory agencies to prescribe certain non-capital standards for safety and soundness relating generally to operations and management, asset quality and executive compensation and permits regulatory action against a financial institution that does not meet these standards.

The various federal bank regulatory agencies have adopted substantially similar regulations that define the five capital categories identified by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act, using the total risk-based capital, Tier 1 risk-based capital, CET1 and leverage capital ratios as the relevant capital measures.  A “well capitalized” institution must have a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of at least 8%, a total risk-based capital ratio of at least 10%, a CET1 capital ratio of at least 6.5% and a leverage ratio of at least 5% and must not be subject to a capital directive or order.  An institution is “adequately capitalized” if it has a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of at least 6%, a total risk-based capital ratio of at least 8%, a CET1 capital ratio of at least 4.5% and a leverage ratio of at least 4%.  An institution is “undercapitalized” if it has a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than

6%, a total risk-based capital ratio of less than 8%, a CET1 capital ratio of less than 4.5% or a leverage ratio of less than 4%.  An institution is “significantly undercapitalized” if it has a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 4%, a total risk-based capital ratio of less than 6%, a CET1 capital ratio of less than 3%, or a leverage ratio of less than 3%.  An institution is “critically undercapitalized” if its tangible equity is equal to or less than 2% of total assets.  Generally, an institution may be reclassified in a lower capitalization category if it is determined that the institution is in an unsafe or unsound condition or engaged in an unsafe or unsound practice.

Dividends.  The Federal Reserve Board’s policy is that a bank holding company should pay cash dividends only to the extent that its net income for the past year is sufficient to cover both the cash dividends and a rate of earnings retention that is consistent with the holding company’s capital needs, asset quality and overall financial condition, and that it is inappropriate for a bank holding company experiencing serious financial problems to borrow funds to pay dividends.  Furthermore, a bank that is classified under the prompt corrective action regulations as “undercapitalized” will be prohibited from paying any dividends.
Our primary source for cash dividends is the dividends we receive from our bank subsidiary.  Our bank is subject to various regulatory policies and requirements relating to the payment of dividends, including requirements to maintain capital above regulatory minimums.  A national bank must obtain the approval of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency prior to paying a dividend if the total of all dividends declared by the national bank in any calendar year will exceed the sum of the bank’s net profits for that year and its retained net profits for the preceding two calendar years, less any required transfers to surplus. Furthermore, if the dividend amount is in excess of the sum of the bank’s net profits for the current year and the preceding two calendar years, the excess amount can be offset by the retained net profits of the preceding third and fourth calendar years. 
As described above under “--Capital Adequacy,” the capital conservation buffer requirement can also restrict our ability and the ability of our bank subsidiary to pay dividends.
Stress Testing. As required by the Dodd-Frank Act and the regulations of the Federal Reserve Board and the OCC, institutions such as the Company and our subsidiary bank, with average total consolidated assets greater than $10 billion, must conduct annual, company-run stress tests under the baseline, adverse and severely adverse scenarios provided by the federal banking regulators. The regulators may also require the use of additional scenarios. The stress test is a process to assess the potential impact of scenarios on the consolidated earnings, losses and capital of an institution over the planning horizon, taking into account the institution’s condition, risks, exposures, strategies and activities. The purpose of the stress tests is to ensure that institutions have robust, forward-looking capital planning that accounts for their risks and to help ensure that institutions have sufficient capital throughout times of economic and financial stress. Beginning with the 2016 stress test, which is the first stress test we and our bank subsidiary conducted under the regulations, the company-run stress tests are to be conducted using data as of December 31st of the preceding calendar year and the scenarios released by the agencies from time to time. Aligned with the prior year, stress test results must be reported to the agencies by July 31st of each year, with public disclosure of a summary of the stress test results between October 15th and October 31st. The stress test results are an important factor considered by the Federal Reserve Board and the OCC in evaluating, among other matters, the capital adequacy of the Company and our subsidiary bank and whether any proposed payments of dividends or stock repurchases may be an unsafe or unsound practice. We and our subsidiary bank must consider the results of stress tests in the normal course of business, including consideration of capital planning, assessment of capital adequacy and risk management practices. On May 24, 2018, the Economic Reform, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act (the “Economic Reform Act”) was enacted. Among other things, the Economic Reform Act provides that, effective 18 months from enactment, the Dodd-Frank Act’s requirements for company-run stress tests will not apply to certain banks and bank holding companies, including the Company and Bank.  The Federal Reserve and the OCC have provided immediate relief from such requirements, which applies to the Company and the Bank, and have proposed to amend their regulations accordingly. As a result of the Economic Reform Act, the company-run stress tests and public disclosure for the Company and the Bank are no longer required.

Federal Deposit Insurance Reform.  The FDIC maintains the Deposit Insurance Fund (the “DIF”).  The deposit accounts of our bank subsidiary are insured by the DIF to the maximum amount provided by law.  The general insurance limit is $250 thousand.  This insurance is backed by the full faith and credit of the United States Government.

As insurer, the FDIC is authorized to conduct examinations of and to require reporting by DIF-insured institutions.  It also may prohibit any DIF-insured institution from engaging in any activity the FDIC determines by regulation or order to pose a serious threat to the DIF.  The FDIC also has the authority to take enforcement actions against insured institutions.

As required by the Dodd-Frank Act, the FDIC has adopted rules under which insurance premiums are assessed on an institution’s total assets minus its tangible equity (defined as Tier 1 capital).  For a bank with total assets of $10 billion or more, FDIC regulations require the bank to be assessed under a scorecard method. The scorecard method uses a performance score and a loss severity score, which are combined and converted into an initial base assessment rate.  The performance score is based on measures of the bank’s ability to withstand asset-related stress and funding-related stress and weighted CAMELS ratings. The 
11

loss severity score is a measure of potential losses to the FDIC in the event of the bank’s failure. Under a formula, the performance score and loss severity score are combined and converted to a total score that determines the bank’s initial base assessment rate. The FDIC has the discretion to alter the total score based on factors not captured by the scorecard.  The resulting initial base assessment rate is subject to adjustments downward based on long term unsecured debt issued by the bank, to adjustment upward based on long term unsecured debt held by the bank that is issued by other FDIC-insured institutions, and to further adjustment upward if the bank’s brokered deposits exceed 10% of its domestic deposits.  Modifications to the scorecard method may apply to certain “highly complex institutions.” Currently, initial base assessment rates range from 3 to 30 basis points and are subject to certain adjustments. In addition, the FDIC may increase or decrease its rate schedules by 2.0 basis points without rulemaking, and in an emergency, may impose a special assessment.
Pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, the FDIC has established 2.0% as the designated reserve ratio (DRR), that is, the ratio of the DIF to insured deposits. The FDIC adopted a plan under which to meet the statutory minimum DRR of 1.35% (formerly 1.15%), which was achieved on September 30, 2018, ahead of the September 30, 2020 deadline imposed by the Dodd-Frank Act. The Dodd-Frank requires the FDIC to offset the effect of the increase in the statutory minimum DRR to 1.35% on institutions with assets less than $10 billion. To implement this offset, the FDIC’s rules required institutions with total assets of $10 billion or more to pay a surcharge during a temporary period which has ended. For institutions with assets of less than $10 billion, the FDIC will apply certain credits to their assessments as the required offset.
In addition, all institutions with deposits insured by the FDIC are required to pay assessments to fund interest payments on bonds issued by the Financing Corporation, a mixed-ownership government corporation established to recapitalize a predecessor to the Deposit Insurance Fund.  These assessments will continue until the Financing Corporation bonds mature in 2019.

Insurance of deposits may be terminated by the FDIC upon a finding that the institution has engaged or is engaging in unsafe and unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, order or condition imposed by the FDIC or written agreement entered into with the FDIC. We do not know of any practice, condition or violation that might lead to termination of deposit insurance.

Transactions with Affiliates.  We and our bank subsidiary are affiliates within the meaning of the Federal Reserve Act.  The Federal Reserve Act imposes limitations on a bank with respect to extensions of credit to, investments in, and certain other transactions with, its parent bank holding company and the holding company’s other subsidiaries.  Furthermore, bank loans and extensions of credit to affiliates also are subject to various collateral requirements.

Community Reinvestment Act.  Under the Community Reinvestment Act, every FDIC-insured institution is obligated, consistent with safe and sound banking practices, to help meet the credit needs of its assessment area, including low and moderate income neighborhoods.  The Community Reinvestment Act requires the appropriate federal banking regulator, in connection with the examination of an insured institution, to assess the institution’s record of meeting the credit needs of its community and to consider this record in its evaluation of certain applications, such as a merger or the establishment of a branch.  An unsatisfactory rating may be used as the basis for the denial of an application and will prevent a bank holding company of the institution from making an election to become a financial holding company.

As of its last examination, MB Financial Bank received a Community Reinvestment Act rating of “outstanding.”

Interstate Banking and Branching.  The Federal Reserve Board may approve an application of a bank holding company to acquire control of, or acquire all or substantially all of the assets of, a bank located in a state other than the bank holding company’s home state, without regard to whether the transaction is prohibited by the laws of any state.  The Federal Reserve Board may not approve the acquisition of a bank that has not been in existence for the minimum time period (not exceeding five years) specified by the law of the target bank’s home state.  The Federal Reserve Board also may not approve an application if the bank holding company (and its bank affiliates) controls or would control more than ten percent of the insured deposits in the United States or, generally, 30% or more of the deposits in the target bank’s home state or in any state in which the target bank maintains a branch.  Individual states may waive the 30% statewide concentration limit.  Each state may limit the percentage of total insured deposits in the state that may be held or controlled by a bank or bank holding company to the extent the limitation does not discriminate against out-of-state banks or bank holding companies. Under the Dodd-Frank Act, the OCC may generally approve de novo branching by a national bank outside its home state.

The federal banking agencies are authorized to approve interstate bank merger transactions without regard to whether these transactions are prohibited by the law of any state, unless the home state of one of the banks opted out of interstate mergers prior to June 1, 1997.  Interstate acquisitions of branches are permitted only if the law of the state in which the branch is located 
12

permits these acquisitions.  Interstate mergers and branch acquisitions are subject to the nationwide and statewide-insured deposit concentration limits described above.

Privacy Rules.  Federal banking regulators, as required under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, have adopted rules limiting the ability of banks and other financial institutions to disclose nonpublic information about consumers to non-affiliated third parties.  The rules require disclosure of privacy policies to consumers and, in some circumstances, allow consumers to prevent disclosure of certain personal information to non-affiliated third parties.  The privacy provisions of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act affect how consumer information is transmitted through diversified financial services companies and conveyed to outside vendors.

International Money Laundering Abatement and Financial Anti-Terrorism Act of 2001. The President signed the Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001 (the "USA PATRIOT Act") into law in October 2001.  This act contains the International Money Laundering Abatement and Financial Anti-Terrorism Act of 2001 (the "IMLAFA").  The IMLAFA substantially broadens earlier anti-money laundering legislation and the extraterritorial jurisdiction of the United States, imposes certain compliance and due diligence obligations, defines certain crimes and penalties, compels the production of documents located both inside and outside the United States, including those of foreign institutions that have a correspondent relationship in the United States, and clarifies the safe harbor from civil liability to customers.  The U.S. Department of the Treasury has issued a number of regulations implementing the USA PATRIOT Act that apply certain of its requirements to financial institutions such as our bank.  The regulations impose obligations on financial institutions to maintain appropriate policies, procedures and controls to detect, prevent and report money laundering and terrorist financing. There is also increased scrutiny of compliance with the rules enforced by the Office of Foreign Assets Control, commonly known as "OFAC," which is responsible for administering economic sanctions programs that affect transactions with designated foreign countries, nationals, and others.  The obligations of financial institutions, including us, to identify their customers, watch for and report suspicious transactions, respond to requests for information by regulatory authorities and law enforcement agencies, and share information with other financial institutions, requires the implementation and maintenance of internal procedures, practices and controls which have increased, and may continue to increase, our costs and may subject us to liability.
In May 2016, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network ("FinCEN"), which is a unit of the U.S. Department of the Treasury that adopts regulations implementing the USA PATRIOT Act, the Bank Secrecy Act, and other anti-money laundering legislation, issued final rules governing enhanced customer due diligence. The rules impose several new requirements on covered financial institutions, which includes MB Financial Bank. For each such customer (entity) that opens an account (including an existing customer opening a new account), the covered financial institution must identify and verify the customer's "beneficial owners," of the underlying entity as defined in the rules. Covered financial institutions are required to understand the nature and the purpose of the customer relationship for the purpose of developing a customer risk profile; conduct ongoing monitoring to maintain and update customer information; and identify and report suspicious activity. The final rules went into effect on May 11, 2018.

As noted above, enforcement and compliance-related activity by government agencies has increased. Money laundering and anti-terrorism compliance is among the areas receiving a high level of focus in the present environment.
Volcker Rule. Under the Dodd-Frank Act and regulations adopted by the federal banking agencies to implement the provisions of the Act known as the Volcker Rule, FDIC-insured depository institutions, their holding companies, subsidiaries and affiliates, (collectively, “banking entities”), are generally prohibited, subject to certain exemptions, from proprietary trading and from acquiring or retaining an ownership interest in a "covered fund." 
Activities eligible for exemptions include, among others, certain underwriting, marketing and risk-mitigating hedging activities, fiduciary transactions, and, if certain conditions are met, ownership of interests in certain hedge funds or private equity funds offered to customers of a banking entity’s trust or investment advisory or certain other services, if the banking entity does not guarantee or insure the performance of such a fund. These conditions include, among others, limits on such ownership interests (3% of total ownership interests for any single fund and 3% of Tier 1 capital for the aggregate value of all ownership interests in such funds); a requirement that the amount of such ownership interests be deducted from regulatory capital; a requirement that, for purposes of these limits, ownership interests held by a director or employee of the banking entity are attributed to the banking entity if the banking entity finances the acquisition of the director’s or employee’s ownership interest; and a prohibition against certain transactions between a banking entity and such a fund, including loans, purchases of assets and others. No director or employee of the banking entity (or its affiliates) may hold an ownership interest in such a fund unless directly engaged in providing investment advisory or other services to the fund when the ownership interest is acquired.

Regulatory Reform.  On July 21, 2010, the Dodd-Frank Act was signed into law. The Dodd-Frank Act (as amended) implements far-reaching changes across the financial regulatory landscape, including provisions that, among other things:


• | Centralize responsibility for consumer financial protection by creating the CFPB, with broad rulemaking, supervision and enforcement authority for a wide range of consumer protection laws that apply to all banks and certain others, including examination and enforcement powers with respect to any bank with more than $10 billion in assets and its affiliates, and the power to prohibit unfair, deceptive or abusive acts or practices.


• | Restrict the preemption of state consumer financial protection law by federal law and disallow subsidiaries and affiliates of national banks, such as MB Financial Bank, from availing themselves of such preemption.


• | Require new capital rules (discussed under “--Capital Adequacy” above).


• | Require publicly-traded bank holding companies with assets of $10 billion or more to establish a risk committee responsible for enterprise-wide risk management practices, comprised of an independent chairman and at least one risk management expert.


• | Change the assessment base for federal deposit insurance from the amount of insured deposits to consolidated average assets less tangible capital.


• | Increase the minimum ratio of net worth to insured deposits of the Deposit Insurance Fund from 1.15% to 1.35% and require the FDIC, in setting assessments, to offset the effect of the increase on institutions with assets of less than $10 billion. This increase is generally expected to impose more deposit insurance cost on institutions with assets of $10 billion or more. 


• | Provide for new disclosure and other requirements relating to executive compensation and corporate governance, including guidelines or regulations on incentive-based compensation and a prohibition on compensation arrangements that encourage inappropriate risks or that could provide excessive compensation.


• | Make permanent the $250 thousand general limit for federal deposit insurance.


• | Repeal the federal prohibitions on the payment of interest on demand deposits, thereby permitting depository institutions to pay interest on business transaction and other accounts.


• | Allow de novo interstate branching by banks.


• | Give the Federal Reserve Board the authority to establish rules regarding interchange fees charged for electronic debit transactions by a payment card issuer that, together with its affiliates, has assets of $10 billion or more and to enforce a new statutory requirement that such fees be reasonable and proportional to the actual cost of a transaction to the issuer. The Federal Reserve Board has adopted rules under this provision that limit the swipe fees that a debit card issuer can charge a merchant for a transaction to the sum of 21 cents and five basis points times the value of the transaction, plus up to one cent for fraud prevention costs. 


• | Increase the authority of the Federal Reserve Board to examine the Company and its non-bank subsidiaries.


• | Require all bank holding companies to serve as a source of financial strength to their depository institution subsidiaries in the event such subsidiaries suffer from financial distress.


• | Restrict proprietary trading by banks, bank holding companies and others, and their acquisition and retention of ownership interests in and sponsorship of hedge funds and private equity funds, as described above under “--Volcker Rule.”


• | Require annual stress testing by banks and their holding companies with more than $10 billion in assets and impose certain reporting and disclosure requirements.


Certain aspects of the Dodd-Frank Act remain subject to rulemaking and take effect over several years. As noted above, on May 24, 2018, the Economic Reform Act was enacted to modify or remove certain financial reform rules and regulations, including some of those implemented under the Dodd-Frank Act. While the Act maintains most of the regulatory structure established by the Dodd-Frank Act, it amends certain aspects of the regulatory framework. Among other provisions, the Economic Reform Act raises the threshold for companies and depository institutions subject to the requirements for company-run stress tests discussed above under “Stress Testing.”
Consumer Protection Laws. We are subject to a number of federal and state consumer protection laws, including laws designed to protect customers and promote lending to various sectors of the economy and population. These laws include, among others, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Truth in Lending Act, the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, and their respective state law counterparts.
As indicated above, the Dodd-Frank Act created the CFPB, an independent federal agency with broad rulemaking, supervisory and enforcement powers under various federal consumer financial protection laws, including the laws referenced above, fair lending laws and certain other statutes. The CFPB has examination and primary enforcement authority with respect to depository institutions with $10 billion or more in assets, their service providers and certain non-depository entities such as debt collectors and consumer reporting agencies. Our subsidiary bank is subject to the CFPB’s examination and primary enforcement authority. 
14

The CFPB has authority to prevent unfair, deceptive or abusive practices in connection with the offering of consumer financial products. The Dodd-Frank Act authorizes the CFPB to establish certain minimum standards for the origination of residential mortgages including a determination of the borrower’s ability to repay. In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act allows borrowers to raise certain defenses to foreclosure if they receive any loan other than a “qualified mortgage” as defined by the CFPB. The Dodd-Frank Act permits states to adopt consumer protection laws and standards that are more stringent than those adopted at the federal level and, in certain circumstances, permits state attorneys general to enforce compliance with both the state and federal laws and regulations.
The CFPB has finalized a number of significant rules which impact nearly every aspect of the lifecycle of a residential mortgage loan. Among other things, the rules adopted by the CFPB require banks to: (i) develop and implement procedures to ensure compliance with the “ability to repay” test and identify whether a loan meets a new definition for a “qualified mortgage,” in which case a rebuttable presumption exists that the creditor extending the loan has satisfied the ability to repay test; (ii) implement new or revised disclosures, policies and procedures for originating and servicing mortgages including, but not limited to, pre-loan counseling, early intervention with delinquent borrowers and specific loss mitigation procedures for loans secured by a borrower's principal residence; (iii) comply with additional restrictions on mortgage loan originator hiring and compensation; (iv) comply with new disclosure requirements and standards for appraisals and certain financial products; and (v) maintain escrow accounts for higher-priced mortgage loans for a longer period of time. The rules include the TILA-RESPA Integrated Disclosure (TRID) rules. The TRID rules contain requirements and disclosure forms that are required to be provided to borrowers. In addition to the exercise of its rulemaking authority, the CFPB’s supervisory powers entitle the CFPB to examine institutions for violations of consumer lending laws, even in the absence of consumer complaints or damages. The CFPB issued a final rule to modify federal mortgage disclosure requirements under TRID, which went into effect in October 2018.
Incentive Compensation.  The Dodd-Frank Act requires the federal banking regulators and other agencies, including the Securities and Exchange Commission, to issue regulations or guidelines requiring disclosure to the regulators of incentive-based compensation arrangements and to prohibit incentive-based compensation arrangements for directors, officers or employees that encourage inappropriate risks by providing excessive compensation, fees or benefits or that could lead to material financial loss to a financial institution.  Proposed regulations for this purpose have been published, which are based upon the key principles that incentive compensation arrangements should (i) provide incentives that do not encourage risk-taking beyond the organization’s ability to effectively identify and manage risks, (ii) be compatible with effective internal controls and risk management, and (iii) be supported by strong corporate governance, including active and effective oversight by the organization’s board of directors and appropriate policies, procedures and monitoring.  It is proposed that institutions with assets between $1 and $50 billion must maintain records documenting their incentive-based compensation arrangements. In addition, those institutions are to ensure that those arrangements appropriately balance risk and financial rewards, are compatible with effective risk management and are supported by effective governance. The CFPB has issued a bulletin on sales and other incentive programs indicating that it expects institutions to institute effective risk controls for these programs that include risks to customers from unfair and abusive sales practices and other practices and factors, and a robust compliance management system.

As part of the regular, risk-focused examination process, the incentive compensation arrangements of banking organizations will be reviewed, and the regulator’s findings will be incorporated into the organization’s supervisory ratings, which can affect the organization’s ability to make acquisitions and take other actions. Enforcement actions may be taken against a banking organization if its incentive compensation arrangements, or related risk-management control or governance processes, pose a risk to the organization’s safety and soundness and the organization is not taking prompt and effective measures to correct any deficiencies.

The scope and content of the U.S. banking regulations and regulators’ policies on executive compensation are continuing to develop and are likely to continue evolving in the future. It cannot be determined at this time whether compliance with such policies will adversely affect the Company’s ability to hire, retain and motivate its key employees.
Registered Investment Advisors
Cedar Hill and MainStreet are registered investment advisors under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended (the “Investment Advisers Act”), and as such are supervised by the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Investment Advisers Act imposes numerous obligations on registered investment advisors, including record-keeping, operational and marketing requirements, disclosure obligations and prohibitions on fraudulent activities. Investment advisors also are subject to certain state securities laws and regulations.

Other Future Legislation and Changes in Regulations.  From time to time, various other legislative and regulatory initiatives are introduced in Congress and state legislatures, as well as by regulatory agencies. Such initiatives may include proposals to expand or contract the powers of bank holding companies and depository institutions or proposals to substantially change the 
15

financial institution regulatory system. Such legislation could change banking statutes and the operating environment of the Company in substantial and unpredictable ways. If enacted, such legislation could increase or decrease the cost of doing business, limit or expand permissible activities or affect the competitive balance among banks, savings associations, credit unions, and other financial institutions. The Company cannot predict whether any such legislation will be enacted, and, if enacted, the effect that it, or any implementing regulations, would have on the financial condition or results of operations of the Company. A change in statutes, regulations or regulatory policies applicable to the MB Financial or any of its subsidiaries could have a material effect on the business of the Company.
