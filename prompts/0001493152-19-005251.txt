ITEM 1. BUSINESS.
Organizational History
 
eMarine Global Inc., formerly Pollex, Inc., was originally incorporated in the State of Nevada on November 2, 2001 under the name “Web Views Corporation.” In June 2003, the Company acquired 100% of Cascade Mountain Mining Corp. (“Cascade Corp.”) pursuant to an exchange agreement. As a result of the acquisition of Cascade Corp., and the change in focus of the Company’s business, the Company changed its name from “Web Views Corporation” to “Cascade Mountain Mining Company, Inc.” on June 17, 2003, in connection with a Certificate of Amendment to the Company’s Articles of Incorporation. The Certificate of Amendment also affected a 60:1 forward stock split, which became effective on June 24, 2003, and reauthorized 300,000,000 shares of common stock.
 
On January 7, 2005, we changed our name to “National Parking Systems, Inc.” and effected a 1:4,000 reverse stock split, re-authorized 300,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $.001 per share, and re-authorized 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $.001 per share. On November 18, 2005, we changed our name to “BioStem, Inc.” and the Company’s common stock traded under the new stock symbol “BTEM”. The Company’s focus was parking and parking related services, including valet parking services which the Company operated through its wholly owned subsidiary BH holding Company, Inc. (“BH”) and vehicle immobilization services which the Company operated through its wholly owned subsidiary ABS Holding Company, Inc. (“ABS”).
 
On October 12, 2007, we entered into a Stock Exchange Agreement with Joytoto Co., Ltd., a Korean public company traded on the KOSDAQ (“Joytoto Korea”), and Joyon Entertainment Co., Ltd, a Korean company, to purchase 100% of the issued and outstanding capital stock of Joyon Entertainment, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“JEI”), in exchange for 115,000,000 shares of our common stock (after giving effect to a one-for-forty reverse split of our common stock) as well as the divestment of our two subsidiaries, BH Holding Company, Inc. and ABS Holding Company, Inc. Effective on October 31, 2007, our name was changed to “Joytoto USA, Inc.” and our common stock commenced trading under the new symbol “JYTO”. We operated as a majority owned subsidiary of Joytoto Korea. We had one wholly-owned subsidiary, JEI, and two sub-subsidiaries, Joytoto Technologies, Inc., a Nevada corporation (“JTI”) and Joytoto America, Inc., a California corporation (“JAI”), both of which were wholly-owned subsidiaries of JEI. Our operations were organized into two business segments: Consumer Electronics and Video Games. On October 21, 2008, we filed a Certificate of Amendment to our Articles of Incorporation to change our name to “Pollex, Inc.,” thus resulting in our symbol change to “PLLX”, effective October 24, 2008.
 
On July 25, 2017, we entered into a share exchange agreement with e-Marine and the stockholders of e-Marine (the “e-Marine Stockholders”), pursuant to which the e-Marine Stockholders assigned, transferred and delivered, free and clear of all liens, 100% of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock of e-Marine, representing 100% of the equity interest in e-Marine to the Company in exchange for 14,975,000 restricted shares of common stock (the “Share Exchange”) of the Company. As a result, e-Marine became our wholly-owned subsidiary, and the e-Marine Stockholders acquired a controlling interest in the Company.
 
At the time of the Share Exchange, we were engaged in the online games business by acquiring gaming licenses in order to make them commercially available abroad. As a result of the acquisition of all the issued and outstanding shares of common stock of e-Marine, we have now assumed e-Marine’s business operations as our own. The acquisition of e-Marine is treated as a reverse acquisition, and the business of e-Marine became the business of the Company.
 
e-Marine Co., Ltd. was organized under the laws of the Republic of Korea on January 2, 2001, and is a maritime information and communications technology provider based in South Korea. e-Marine seeks to achieve safety of life at sea through the use of various technologies, such as e-Navigation, Maritime Internet-of-Things and marine big data technology (collectively, “Maritime ICT Convergence”). e-Marine’s main products and services are divided into four categories: (1) Electronic Chart Display & Information System; (2) Smart Ship; (3) Overseas Solutions Distributions; and (4) Aids to Navigation.

On August 15, 2017, we entered into an agreement and plan of (the “Merger Agreement”), pursuant to which we merged with and into our newly formed wholly-owned subsidiary (the “Merger Sub” and, the transaction, the “Merger”).
 
As permitted by Chapter 92A.180 of Nevada Revised Statutes, the purpose of the Merger was to effect a change of the Company’s name from “Pollex, Inc.” to “eMARINE Global Inc.” Upon the filing of articles of merger with the Secretary of State of Nevada on August 15, 2017 in order to effect the Merger, the Company’s articles of incorporation were deemed amended to reflect the change in the Company’s corporate name. Upon consummation of the Merger, the separate existence of Merger Sub ceased. 
 
Our principal execute offices are located at 4th Floor, 15-14, Samsan-ro 308beon-gil, Nam-gu, Ulsan, 44715 South Korea.
 
Overview of Business
 
We are a leading provider of information and communications technology for the maritime industry. We provide solutions for the collection, integration and display of maritime information abroad and ashore by electronic means to enhance berth-to-berth navigation and related services. We believe that these solutions provide the most efficient means to secure the safety of life at sea and to protect the marine environment. We offer all of our products and services through subscription, installation, updates and/or maintenance contracts.
Our Products & Solutions
 
We offer onboard and onshore products and solutions to customers operating within the maritime and shipbuilding industries through our two business divisions: (i) our maritime information and communications technology (“Maritime ICT”) division and (ii) our shipbuilding information and communications (“Shipbuilding ICT”) division.
 
We focus our business on four main hardware and software products : (i) Electronic Chart Display & Information System (“ECDIS”); (ii) Smart Ship solutions; (iii) distribution of overseas solutions; and (iv) Aids to Navigation management solutions.
 
Electronic Chart Display and Information Systems
 
We offer e-Navigator, our branded electronic chart display and information system (“ECDIS”), which is a computer-based navigation system that complies with International Maritime Organization (“IMO”) regulations and can be used as an alternative to paper navigation charters. Integrating a variety of real-time information, it is an automated decision aid capable of continuously determining a vessel’s position in related to land, charted objects, navigation aids and unseen hazards, which is key in helping operators monitor and plan routes. An ECDIS includes electronic navigation charts (“ENC”), which we also offer, and integrates position information from the global positioning system (“GPS”) and other navigational sensors, such as radar, fathometer and automatic identification systems. It can also provide additional navigation-related information, such as sailing directions. Only the hardware is regulated by the IMO, while the software is subject to patents. We have obtained ECDIS software and South Korean patents for ECDIS technology.
Smart Ship Solutions
 
Our Smart Ship technology is the result of our partnership with Hyundai Heavy Industries (“HHI”) and much of it has been implemented on HHI’s newly-built ships. These systems use the marine Internet of Things (“I.o.T.”) and big data technologies to provide solutions such as the Intra-Ship Integrated Gateway (“ISIG”), an intra-ship network that promotes greater communication amongst a fleet while at sea; the Collision Avoidance and Optimal Voyage Systems, both dedicated to helping mariners determine the best routes and avoid incidents at sea; and the Remote Maintenance and Engine Monitoring Systems, which similarly promote crews’ safety by ensuring that vessels are kept in shipshape condition. Through the further development of our Smart Ship solutions, we believe will make greater in-roads into the autonomous ship and unmanned ship markets.

-


Smart Ship solutions are navigation oriented hardware and software that are developed by utilizing maritime I.o.T and big data technology. We develop Smart Ship technology under the partnership with HHI. This partnership has resulted in the development of a number of Smart Ship solutions that we supplied to HHI’s newly-built ships. By applying marine I.o.T. and big data technologies, we believe we will continue to expand the development of Smart Ship solutions, by gradually entering the autonomous ship and unmanned ship market. Some of our current Smart Ship Solutions include the following:
 
Overseas Solutions Distribution
 
We have agreements with a number of maritime products manufacturers. We have an exclusive agreement with Teledyne Technologies International Corp for the distribution of CARIS, maritime GIS software. We distribute digital charts from C-Map, The United Kingdom Hydrographic Office and the Korea Hydrography and Research Association. In 2017, we began providing services related to a maritime-training simulator for the Republic of Korea Navy in cooperation with ECA-Sindel. We also are the exclusive distributor of Hatteland’s maritime-specialized hardware.
Aids to Navigation Management Systems


We implement Aids to Navigation (“AtoN”) management systems for public maritime agencies. AtoN systems include sensors that are attached to navigational aids at sea and management software installed at the ground control level for information collection, display and analysis. Our AtoN System consists of the (i) Maritime Weather Signals Total Management System and the (ii) e-A2N device.
 
The Maritime Weather Signals Total Management System is a technology that collects weather information that is then transmitted to all major ports and maritime offices for public and civic use. It collects weather signals in various formats, including AIS, CDMA and TRS, and then simultaneously displays such information as tidal height, wind directivity, wind speed and sea temperature. We have implemented over a dozen maritime information systems in major port cities such as Busan, Incheon and Ulsan. In 2017, we implemented our Total Management System, which compiles all maritime weather information and delivers it through one central center, at the National Maritime Positioning, Navigation, and Timing Office. We believe that once the IMO begins its e-Navigation initiative, the Total AtoN Management System will be a part of the Total Maritime Traffic System.
 
Our e-A2N device detects technical malfunctions and sends real-time data such as battery status and weather conditions to ground control, bringing attention to ship components in need of maintenance. We believe that our e-A2N device results in cost reduction and unnecessary manpower while also benefiting users, such as crew members, passengers, pilots and seaferers, by providing access to weather information via port dashboards and smart applications. To date, we have installed e-A2N devices in over 4,000 navigational aids throughout Korea.
 
Key Factors of Our Business Model
 
We cover every aspect of the ENC technology within our e-Navigator from manufacturing, modification, personalization, distribution and maintenance. We offer our customers our e-Navigator ECDIS and ENC separately or as a package, which we believe provides us with a cost competitive edge, as well as seamless integration and on-going maintenance.
 
We have developed our e-Navigator and our ECN products in an effort to offer our customers what we believe to be the best product possible in the market. Currently, we hold approximately 90% of the market of private ships through our government contracts with the Republic of Korea (“R.O.K”) Navy and Coast Guard, and we hold approximately 60% of the public sector market share. The rest of the market is held by other domestic and foreign competitors, including Japan Radio Co., Ltd., Furuno Electric Co., Ltd. and Martin Electric Co., Ltd. We have been the market leader of ECDIS in Korea, consistently supplying and operating maintenance service for the Republic of Korea Navy, the Coast Guard and other public and commercial ships. We continuously provide ECDIS maintenance services to an average of 200 navy vessels annually, with contracts renewed every one to two years

In September 2018, we won a contract from the R.O.K. Navy to provide maintenance services to navy ships through fiscal year 2020. This marks the 9th consecutive year in which we have won such contracts.
 
We are a Smart Ship solutions development partner of Hyundai Heavy Industries. We supply ISIG, Optimal Navigation System and Engine Status Monitoring System to Hyundai Heavy Industries and anticipate supplying subsequent Smart Ship products to Hyundai Heavy Industries and other shipbuilders in South Korea such as Hanjin Heavy Industries and Samsung Heavy Industries.
 
Industry Overview and Market Opportunity
 
Global Maritime Industry and Market
 
The global maritime industry and related markets suffered as a result of a decrease in demand for global shipping and a decrease in investment which in turn has resulted in a reduction of the number of newly-built ships. This regression lasted until early 2017, which was the lowest point of the industry’s economic cycle. As a result, the Company’s largest customer, Hyundai Heavy Industries, decreased its shipbuilding production and therefore resulted in a decrease of the Company’s Ship Solutions output for Hyundai’s new ships. Further as a result of this regression in the industry, many market participants concentrated on maintaining old ships with existing navigation solutions, causing a decrease in new navigation solutions during that time period. The global maritime economy has gained steam while international oil price is in a steady state. Shipbuilder’s order intakes are likely to see upturn consistently. According to industry experts, global shipbuilding market condition is expected to show expediential curve by representing significant improvements after getting better slowly over the next two-three years. From the analysis of Korea Institute for Industrial Economics & Trade, the shipping market condition is to show a rebound after hitting rock bottom last 2017. The shipbuilding industry’s situation will improve slowly until 2020, before showing a significant upturn since then.
Korean Shipbuilding Industry
 
In 2017, many Korean shipbuilders surpassed their annual projections, indicating a recovery from the severe order drought of 2016. According to Clarkson Research, in 2017 new-buildings of a combined 6.45m cgt were reported to have been contracted at Korean yards, representing an increase of 199% compared to the prior year. This growth rate is higher than that of China and Japan. Korean shipbuilders have led global tanker newbuilding market. According to industry statistics and ASIASIS’s survey, HHI obtained orders for 150 units of merchant vessels worth around $10 billion in 2017. Korean ‘Big 3’ shipbuilders, HHI, Daewoo and Samsung, have set their 2018 order goals higher than 2017’s, indicating positive growth in the order sales market going forward. As the Korean shipbuilding industry recovers and expands its technological innovation aimed at autonomous/unmanned ships in 2018, we anticipate an increased demand for our navigation and Smart Ship solutions from Korean shipbuilders. We also expect to continue supplying HHI ISIG and our Collision Avoidance Systems and Optimal Voyage Systems.
Market Opportunity
 
Beginning in July of 2018, the IMO will mandate every ship to be equipped with ECDIS. The IMO will initiate its Strategic Implementation Plan for e-Navigation in 2019. The plan will require that all navigation equipment be globally standardized, digitalized and inter-connected. The IMO’s goal is to increase safety of navigation in commercial shipping through better organization of data on ships by 2019. We believe that the IMO’s plan will consequently increase demand for smart ships. Out of 6,500 new ships already planned HHI over the next five years, approximately 700 ships will be equipped with the Total Smart Ship Solution Package. HHI’s Total Smart Ship Package consists of various Smart Ship Solutions that we develop, such as our Navigation Information Management System, our Engine Information System, and our Energy Management System.
Manufacturing
 
We manufacture our products and solutions at our Research and Development Center in Ulsan. We develop our own software, as well as incorporate our software into customized hardware. These hardware products are assembled either in our factory or at a location requested by our customers. Our manufacturing processes are in accordance with IDO 9001:2008, which is discussed below under the heading “Government Approvals.” These manufactured products are also compliant with international standards for function and performance, such as those set forth by the International Electrotechnical Commission.

Competition
 
ECIDIS & Navigation Systems
 
We lead the military and security market in South Korea. Our major competitors are Japan Radio Co., Ltd. and Furuno Electric Co., Ltd., who each hold 30% of South Korean commercial market share respectively. The majority of the commercial market is made up of European and Japanese navigation and communication products. With its ECDIS technology, we plan to develop a new solution: eMarine Integrated Communication System (“e-ICS”). We allocated $1,060,000 for the system’s development and introduced it during the second quarter of 2018. In developing e-ICS, its protocols and interface specifications will be provided by Hyundai in cooperation with communication equipment’s suppliers. While we currently operate primarily within the military and Korean markets, we plan to expand into Southeast Asia, Middle East Asia and North America by 2019.
Smart Ship Solutions
 
We provide ISIG, which undergirds our Smart Ship Solutions. We have provided 315 ISIGs to HHI since 2012. The Company has developed various Smart Ship solutions with HHI for HHI’s newly built ships. Beginning in 2018, HHI began implementing the jointly developed Smart Ship Solutions to most of their new ships. We derive approximately 15-20% of our revenue from our partnership with HHI.
 
The Unmanned/Autonomous Ship market is led by Rolls-Royce, Konsberg and Wartsila. By further developing systems such as ENC, ISIG, Collision Avoidance System and Track Control System, all of which we believe to be essential components of unmanned ships, we believe we will be well-positioned to enter the Unmanned/Autonomous Ship market by 2020.
 
Further, NAPA and ENRIAM, two Finnish companies, are leaders in providing fuel-saving solutions to the market; however, they mainly operate in the European passenger ship sector.
 
Aids to Navigation
 
South Korea leads in the application of I.o.T technology to AtoN systems. To date, we have implemented 13 maritime weather management modules in South Korea, which we believe to be the most among competitors. We also believe that we will maintain our position as a market leader by applying Big Data and Augmented Reality & Artificial Intelligence (“AR/AI”) technology to both our planned and future AtoN projects, such as our Integrated Maritime Weather Signal Control & Monitoring System project (2016 – 2017). We plan to implement a comprehensive management and operation system that connects all regional AtoN management systems for the Ministry of Oceans and Fisheries, which will establish a protocol for standardization of all maritime traffic and weather data. We believe that our role as the architect of this system will allow us to continue to play a major role in similar projects that utilize the system in the future.
Distribution
 
We have been South Korea’s sole distributor of CARIS, a maritime GIS solution, for nearly 17 years. Globally, CARIs has the highest market share in the maritime GIS field. Norway’s Hatteland Monitor holds the largest market share in its field while competing with MOXA and L3’s low-cost products, while we provide Hatteland products directly to Hyundai, Samsung and Doosan ships in South Korea
Customers
 
Our customers operate within the maritime and shipbuilding industries. Our main customers operate within the maritime security organizations such as R.O.K. Navy, the Korean Coast Guard, and the Korean Ministry of Fisheries, as well as shipbuilding companies such as HHI and Hanjin Heavy Industries.

We have been the market leader of ECDIS in Korea, consistently supplying and operating maintenance service for the Republic of Korea Navy, the Coast Guard and other public and commercial ships. We continuously provide ECDIS maintenance services to an average of 200 navy vessels annually, with contracts renewed every one to two years. We derive approximately 95% of our ECDIS sales revenue from our South Korean government contracts with Navy, Coast Guard and Ministry of Oceans and Fisheries. Through government contracts won by official bidding, we implement Aids to Navigation software, sensors and servers. The official bids are evaluated primarily on two factors: (i) the sophistication of the technology and (ii) the bid price. Winning bids typically result in contracts ranging from one to two years.
 
In addition, we develop our Smart Ship solutions through our partnership with Hyundai Heavy Industries and through our research and development contracts with the South Korean government, which we obtain through government-administrated bidding-process. Further, through our partnership with Hyundai Heavy Industries, we install our Smart Ship solutions into Hyundai’s newly-built ships, which are then sold to customers. We also supply overseas navigation-related solutions such as maritime PC hardware, Hatteland, and maritime GIS software, CARIS, to maritime agencies and shipbuilders.
