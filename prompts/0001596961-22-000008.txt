Our Company
RumbleOn is the nation's first, largest, and only publicly-traded, technology-based Omnichannel platform in the powersports industry. Headquartered in the Dallas Metroplex, RumbleOn is revolutionizing the customer experience for outdoor enthusiasts across the country and making powersport vehicles accessible to more people in more places than ever before. We are transforming the powersports customer experience by giving consumers what they want—a wide selection, great value and quality, transparency, and an easy, friction-free transaction. Every element of our business, from inventory procurement to fulfillment to overall ease of transactions, whether online or on-site at one of our now 55 retail locations or experience centers, has been built for a singular purpose – creating a customer experience without peer in the powersports industry.
Although our primary focus is on disrupting the customer experience in the powersports industry, we participate in the automotive industry through our wholly-owned distributors of used automotive inventory, Wholesale, Inc. ("Wholesale Inc") and Got Speed, Inc. (“Got Speed”). Our logistics services company, Wholesale Express, LLC ("Wholesale Express"), provides freight brokerage services facilitating transportation for dealers and consumers.
Incorporated in Nevada in 2013 as a development stage company, we have been building the RumbleOn brand and vision since 2016. Led by our co-founder, chairman, and Chief Executive Officer Marshall Chesrown, we have achieved and built upon key milestones:
•April 2017: launched RumbleOn.com.
•October 2017: celebrated our initial listing on The Nasdaq Stock Market.
•October 2018: acquired Wholesale Inc and Wholesale Express.
•August 2021: acquired the RideNow companies (the “RideNow Transaction”), a collection of 41 retail powersports locations with a geographic footprint spanning primarily the Sunbelt.
•September 2021: processed the first powersports vehicle through our Orlando Fulfillment Center.
•February 2022: completed the initial funding of our captive consumer finance facility for RumbleOn Finance.
•February 2022: acquired Freedom Powersports (the “Freedom Transaction”), adding ten retail locations in Texas, one in Alabama and two in Georgia.
•February 2022: appointed seasoned finance executive, Narinder Sahai, as Chief Financial Officer and appointed RumbleOn’s President, Peter Levy, to President and Chief Operating Officer.
•February 2022: unveiled the regional management structure, anchored by tenured team members of RideNow.
These key events well-position RumbleOn as the first mover in transforming the powersports industry through our customer experience focused, technology-based, Omnichannel platform. 
Our Industry and Opportunity
We operate primarily in the powersports industry, offering significant scale and breadth of products and our Omnichannel platform from which we will provide our only of its kind powersports customer experience. From our view, powersports includes motorcycles, side-by-sides, ATV, UTV, snowmobile, and personal watercraft ("PWC"). Add in boats and traditional RVs and, according to the US Census Bureau, the total value of the powersports market for traditional retail dealers was approximately $70 billion in 2017. Notably, however, the Census Bureau statistics do not account for a huge peer-to-peer market in used powersports, which RumbleOn believes represents up to 70% of used powersports transactions, providing RumbleOn an outstanding inventory sourcing opportunity and creating a total addressable powersports market in excess of $100 billion.
The powersports marketplace in the United States is highly fragmented. We face competition from traditional franchised dealers who sell both new and used vehicles; independent used powersports dealers; online and mobile sales platforms; and private parties. We believe that the principal competitive factors in our industry are delivering an outstanding consumer experience, competitive sourcing of quality inventory, breadth and depth of product selection, and value pricing.
Our competitors vary in size and breadth of their product offerings. We believe that our principal competitive advantages in powersports sales includes our ability to provide a high degree of customer satisfaction with the buying experience by virtue of our Omnichannel platform. We provide customers the opportunity to experience RumbleOn's offerings online, in-store, and through our mobile app, or any combination of those three options. Our ability to make a cash offer to purchase a vehicle with our customer-friendly purchase process, and our breadth of selection of the most popular makes and models available online and in-store provides a competitive sourcing and sales. 
RumbleOn's Solution - Creating the Future of Powersports
RumbleOn is creating a best-in-class experience in powersports for our customers. Doing so requires offering an unmatched choice and selection and replicating an outstanding customer experience throughout the lifecycle of powersports ownership, one customer at a time.
Customers come to RumbleOn's 55 retail locations as well as our more than 60 websites to shop for new and quality used powersports products and soon for parts, accessories and merchandise. We address the entire powersports market. We are reimagining and revolutionizing the customer experience on the technology-led Omnichannel RumbleOn platform, and we are doing so for everyone — from the enthusiast to the novice, and everyone in between – with a focus on four key initiatives:
•Creating an end-to-end ownership experience enables building lifelong connectivity to our customers in several ways, and the experience we are building is not just about the initial transaction. We are also focused on the touch points that continue to keep our customers engaged throughout their powersports ownership experience. Quality assurance, clear and consistent pricing, professional pickup and delivery, customization, after sale service, and guarantees are just a few of the ways we are building a reliable and consistent customer experience. Our offerings —and our entire customer experience —are designed to turn a single transaction into a lifetime relationship. 
•Providing the best selection of high-quality inventory enables us to address the 'wants' of all powersports customers coast to coast. We are well-positioned to acquire high-quality used vehicles through the strength of our online Cash Offer Tool, a unique and important competitive advantage for RumbleOn. Affording our consumers the ability to visit a retail location and receive cash for their used powersports unit instantaneously gives them peace of mind, and provides us the opportunity to drive a meaningful amount of incremental used inventory onto our platform. We are also leveraging robust data from the Cash Offer Tool and now from 55 RideNow and Freedom Powersports retail locations to ensure that the right vehicle is in the right place at the right time —with the right price. 
•Becoming the premier destination for used powersports vehicles and introducing more used inventory into our showrooms as well as online attracts new customers to our platform and, most importantly, new riders to the industry due to affordability. On a comparable pro forma basis in Q4 2021, we increased the number of used retail powersport units sold by 87% year-over-year at the RideNow locations. We are focused on both new and used; however, the opportunity to dramatically increase the number of used retail powersports units presents our greatest near-term opportunity. In the current new vehicle supply-constrained environment, we can better control used inventory than new because used is not dependent on a manufacturer's production or distribution constraints. In fact, our broad access to used inventory is — and will continue to be— an important differentiator for RumbleOn in any market environment. 
•Offering powersports financing through our wholly-owned captive consumer finance subsidiary RumbleOn Finance is another way we are making powersports ownership easy and accessible to more of our customers. RumbleOn Finance provides an opportunity to bring new entrants to the powersports space by offering competitive financing solutions, especially for those customers for whom financing from traditional financial institutions or manufacturers is not readily available. In the future, our paperless online transactions will further enhance our unmatched, true Omnichannel experience and create incremental sales with no geographic boundaries.
Our Growth Strategies
The key metric to our powersports business is retail vehicle unit sales, both online or in-store. Unit sales drives revenue and provides the opportunity to build additional revenue through financing, parts, merchandise, and accessories, each of which are higher margin revenue streams. As we mature, and expand our Omnichannel customer experience, we will create 
additional opportunities to expand revenue streams. However, additional revenue opportunities begin with retail vehicle unit sales and, as a result, our growth strategy is focused on this metric.
Our ability to increase vehicle unit sales is a function of our market penetration in existing markets, the number of markets we operate in, and our ability to build and maintain our brands by offering great value, transparency, and an outstanding customer experience. 
Optimize Our Inventory Selection and Centralization
We will continue to optimize and broaden the selection of new and used powersports vehicles we make available to our customers. Expanding our inventory selection enhances the customer experience by ensuring each visitor, either online or in-store, finds a vehicle that matches his or her preferences. Optimizing our new inventory significantly depends on the allocations of our manufacturers ("OEM"). Optimizing our used inventory selection depends on our ability to source and acquire a sufficient number of appropriate used vehicles, including acquiring more vehicles directly from our customers.
We are also implementing a fulfillment system with near real-time inventory replenishment to make the right powersports unit available in the right quantities at the right locations. This centralization of inventory will launch company-wide virtual selling through access to all company-owned inventory and not just what might be available at an individual location. This will increase the probability that our customers can find their powersports unit on our platform, thereby enhancing the customer experience while eliminating geographic boundaries. With digital inventory integration and over 60 individual websites that share content, RumbleOn will be top-of-mind for powersports searches. All of the technology infrastructure required is under development and will be implemented throughout 2022 and beyond.
Continue to Innovate and Extend Our Technology Leadership
We will continue to make significant investments in improving and adding to our online customer offering. We believe that the complexity of the traditional powersports retail transaction provides substantial opportunity for technology investment and that our leadership and continued growth will enable us to responsibly invest in further enhancing the customer experience.
From our founding, we have been laying the groundwork to offer a friction-free and fully integrated customer experience both online and in-store. We are building the technology engine to enable this integration, while methodically expanding our retail footprint. We plan to begin rolling out our new and innovative technology throughout 2022 and will continuously make improvements to our technology offering. 
In order to truly rebuild the customer experience, we are investing to build the technology engine across the organization. Our Cash Offer Tool is supplying proprietary data on hundreds of thousands of unique Vehicle Identification Number (VIN) inputs, in addition to actual retail sales and transaction data from RideNow and Freedom Powersports' databases. Marrying this data creates a data-driven "market maker" that does not exist in the industry today. Integrating real-time pricing and sales data from in-store transactions will also enable us to further optimize offers and pricing.
Expand Our Geographic Markets
Beyond innovative technology and inventory integration, we will use our retail locations to augment the online experience—and vice versa —to offer a simple, friction-free customer experience. A key component to transforming the customer experience to support our growth strategy is enhancing the in-store experience and we are strategically expanding our geographic retail footprint. Since the business combination with RideNow, we have acquired 14 additional retail locations and are currently operating in 55 retail locations, as shown below. 
We employ three primary considerations for expanding our bricks-and-mortar presence: (1) find great people, (2) identify desired geography, and (3) implement appropriate and balanced brand mix.
Finding Great People. We believe any great customer experience in powersports begins with great people providing consumers the opportunity to fulfill their passion. From our executive team to our customer facing professionals to our back-office and corporate personnel, the RumbleOn team is singularly focused on transforming the customer experience in powersports, both online and in-store. As we expand our physical presence, whether through new retail locations or as we build out our fulfillment “experience” centers, finding great people who believe in our mission.
Identifying Desired Geography. We believe desired geography means more than finding new markets; it also means making sure we can put the right powersports vehicle in the right place at the right price to maximize our return on the asset. This is a key goal of our fulfillment “experience” centers and we anticipate to roll out two such centers during 2022, first in the Dallas Metroplex and then potentially in Arizona, Nevada, Northeast or Florida markets. And of course, we are always looking for strategic acquisition candidates, whether a large group such as Freedom Powersports or a key tuck-in opportunity to improve the capabilities of an existing location.
Implementing Appropriate Brand Mix. Powersports retail provides the opportunity to put many different new brands under one roof along the proper mix of used inventory. Of course, having that opportunity and taking advantage of that opportunity correctly are two different things. In this current supply-constrained environment, we can better control used inventory than new because used is not subject to manufacturers’ production or distribution constraints. We intend to leverage our key used inventory sourcing advantage to keep our retail locations fully stocked with the right mix of preferred brands based on market share, and thereby further enhance the customer experience.
Develop Broad Consumer Awareness of Our Brand
Important to the future of RumbleOn's brand is creating a unified customer experience across all locations, and the foundation will be our technology, our infrastructure, and our corporate culture. We recently unveiled our new regional management structure, with a new National Senior Vice President of Retail overseeing six Regional Directors who will lead the daily operations of multiple facilities primarily based on geographic location. These Regional Directors will share best practices 
in customer service and general operations to enhance the overall performance of our retail locations. This new regional management structure is well-aligned with our growth initiatives and will provide a stable footing for our continued growth. We are in the early days of the rollout, but we are encouraged by the impact on performance and the excitement it has clearly created.
RumbleOn Technology
Innovative technology continues to underpin every endeavor at RumbleOn through our ongoing mission to disrupt the powersports industry and our focus on the customer experience. We leverage technology and data to drive change. At a high-level, we believe there are two main areas where leveraging these innovations provides us a competitive advantage and improves the customer experience: (1) our proprietary supply chain and distribution software and (2) our Omnichannel and mobile-first web application.
 (1) RumbleOn's proprietary supply chain and distribution software:
•Looks at the overall supply chain and reconfigures inventory for the purpose of acquisition and distribution. Our technology aggregates multiple data sources in real-time, tracking and cataloging inventory across the country.
•Analyzes real-time market data to inform our acquisition decisions, continually capturing and archiving such data using advanced algorithms to calibrate pricing and estimate freight and reconditioning expenses. The values are then used in our Cash Offer Tool to quickly determine a fair and reasonable, non-negotiable offer.
 (2) RumbleOn's Omnichannel and mobile-first web application strategy:
•Enhances our website and mobile application to provide a compelling customer experience, from the front-end user interface and powerful search tools to enabling secure data, document, and payment exchanges between parties. We also optimize search engine marketing to provide a lower overall cost of customer acquisition. 
To deliver our supply chain software and Omnichannel strategies, RumbleOn leverages its proprietary and exclusive-use technology portfolio, which includes:
•a series of modeling tools & technologies for consolidating internal and external data to provide profitability estimates for inventory available for purchase;
•a proprietary series of inventory management and business intelligence technologies that tracks the lifecycle of a vehicle from acquisition through delivery;
•an automated photography technology that combines high-quality photos to produce an interactive, 360-degree virtual tour of the vehicle;
•a catalog of website that includes advanced filtering and search technology that assist multi-lead generation across participating partners;
•a dedicated financing company for leveraging leads for faster turn on sales and delivery; and
•a proprietary transportation management system and assignment technology to optimize the transport of purchased inventory for acquisition and dealer distribution.
In addition to our proprietary/exclusive use technology, we also rely on third party technology, including the following:
•a cloud based network infrastructure for hosting websites and inventory data;
•software libraries, development environments, and tools;
•services to allow customers to digitally sign contracts; and
•customer service call center management software.
In short, our business is driven by data and technology at all stages of the process, from acquisition, inventory purchasing, reconditioning, photography, transportation, and annotation through physical through online merchandising, sales, financing, trade-ins, logistics, and delivery.
We protect our technology and other intellectual property through a combination of trademarks, domain names, copyrights, trade secrets, patented technology, and contractual provisions and restrictions on access and use of our proprietary information and technology. We have a portfolio of trademark registrations in the United States, including registrations for "RumbleOn," the RumbleOn logo, "RideNow," and the RideNow logo. We are the registered holder of a variety of domestic and international domain names, including "rumbleon.com."
Operational Structure
The following chart summarizes our organizational structure as of December 31, 2021, but includes Freedom Powersports, which we acquired on February 18, 2022. This chart is provided for illustrative purposes only and does not reflect all legal entities owned or controlled by us:
Seasonality
Historically, both the powersports and automotive industries have been seasonal with traffic and sales strongest in the spring and summer quarters. Sales and traffic are typically slowest in the winter quarter but increase typically in the spring season, coinciding with tax refunds and improved weather conditions. Given this seasonality, we expect our quarterly results of operations, including our revenue, gross profit, net income (loss), and cash flow to vary accordingly. Over time, we expect to normalize to seasonal trends in both segments, using data and logistics to move inventory to the right place, at the right time, at the right price.
Government Regulation
Various aspects of our business are or may be subject, directly or indirectly, to U.S. federal and state laws and regulations. Failure to comply with such laws or regulations may result in the suspension or termination of our ability to do business in affected jurisdictions or the imposition of significant civil and criminal penalties, including fines or the award of significant damages against us and our dealers in class action or other civil litigation.
Vehicle Sales. Our sale and purchase of vehicles, both new and pre-owned, related products and services and third-party finance products, are subject to the state and local dealer licensing requirements in the jurisdictions in which we have retail or wholesale locations. Regulators of jurisdictions where our customers reside, but in which we do not have a dealer or financing license could require that we obtain a license or otherwise comply with various state regulations. Despite our belief 
that we are not subject to the licensing requirements of those jurisdictions in which we do not have a physical presence, regulators may seek to impose punitive fines for operating without a license or demand we seek a license in those jurisdictions, any of which may inhibit our ability to do business in those jurisdictions, increase our operating expenses and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. 
Consumer Finance. The financing we offer customers is subject to federal and state laws regulating the advertising and provision of consumer finance options, the collection of consumer credit and financial information, along with requirements related to online payments and electronic funds transfers, of whether RumbleOn Finance or a third-party is the entity extending credit to such customers. Most states regulate retail installment sales, including setting a maximum interest rate, caps on certain fees, or maximum amounts financed. In addition, certain states require that finance companies file a notice of intent or have a sales finance license or an installment sellers license in order to solicit or originate installment sales in that state.
Logistics and Transportation. Our Wholesale Express logistics operations, which brokers and facilitates the transportation of vehicles primarily between and among dealers, is subject to motor-carrier rules and regulations promulgated by the United States Department of Transportation ("DOT") and the states through which their customers' vehicles are transported. Additionally, the vendors whom Wholesale Express relies upon are subject to federal and state regulation concerning transport vehicle dimensions, transport vehicle conditions, driver motor vehicle record history, driver alcohol and drug testing, and driver hours of serves. More restrictive limitations on vehicle weight and size, condition, trailer length and configuration, methods of measurement, driver qualifications, or driver hours of service may increase the costs charged to Wholesale Express by its vendors, which may adversely affect our financial condition, operating results, and cash flows. If we fail to comply with the DOT regulations or if those regulations become more stringent, we could be subject to increased inspections, audits, or compliance burdens. Regulatory authorities could take remedial action including imposing fines, suspending, or shutting down our Wholesale Express operations. 
Environmental Laws and Regulations. We are subject to a variety of federal, state, and local environmental laws and regulations that pertain to our operations. The regulations concern material storage, air quality, waste handling, and water pollution control. The regulations also regulate our use and operation of gasoline storage tanks, gasoline dispensing equipment, oil tanks, and paint booths among other things. Our business involves the use, handling, and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes, including motor oil, gasoline, solvents, lubricants, paints, and other substances. We manage our compliance through permitting and operational control.
Facilities and Personnel. Our facilities and business operations are subject to laws and regulations relating to environmental protection and health and safety, and our employment practices are subject to various laws and regulations, including complex federal, state, and local wage and hour and anti-discrimination laws. We may also be liable for employee misconduct and violations of laws or regulations to which we are subject. 
Federal Advertising Regulations. The Federal Trade Commission ("FTC") has authority to take actions to remedy or prevent advertising practices that it considers to be unfair or deceptive and that affect commerce in the United States. If the FTC takes the position in the future that any aspect of our business constitutes an unfair or deceptive advertising practice, responding to such allegations could require us to pay significant damages, settlements, and civil penalties, or could require us to make adjustments to our products and services, any or all of which could result in substantial adverse publicity, loss of participating dealers, lost revenue, increased expenses, and decreased profitability.
Federal Antitrust Laws. The antitrust laws prohibit, among other things, any joint conduct among competitors that would lessen competition in the marketplace. Some of the information that we may obtain from dealers may be sensitive and, if disclosed inappropriately, could potentially be pre-owned by dealers to impede competition or otherwise diminish independent pricing activity. A governmental or private civil action alleging the improper exchange of information, or unlawful participation in price maintenance or other unlawful or anticompetitive activity, even if unfounded, could be costly to defend and adversely impact our ability to maintain and grow our business.
In addition, governmental or private civil actions related to the antitrust laws could result in orders suspending or terminating our ability to do business or otherwise altering or limiting certain of our business practices, including the manner in which we handle or disclose pricing information, or the imposition of significant civil or criminal penalties, including fines or the award of significant damages against us in class action or other civil litigation.
Other. In addition to these laws and regulations that apply specifically to our business, we are also subject to laws and regulations affecting public companies, including securities laws and the listing rules of The Nasdaq Stock Market ("Nasdaq"). The violation of any of these laws or regulations could result in administrative, civil, or criminal penalties or in a cease-and-desist order against our business operations, any of which could damage our reputation and have a material adverse effect on 
our business, sales and results of operations. We have incurred and will continue to incur capital and operating expenses and other costs to comply with these laws and regulations.
 The foregoing description of laws and regulations to which we are or may be subject is not exhaustive, and the regulatory framework governing our operations is subject to continuous change. The enactment of new laws and regulations or the interpretation of existing laws and regulations in an unfavorable way may affect the operation of our business, directly or indirectly, which could result in substantial regulatory compliance costs, civil or criminal penalties, including fines, adverse publicity, loss of participating dealers, lost revenue, increased expenses, and decreased profitability. Further, investigations by government agencies, including the FTC, into allegedly anticompetitive, unfair, deceptive or other business practices by us, could cause us to incur additional expenses and, if adversely concluded, could result in substantial civil or criminal penalties and significant legal liability.
