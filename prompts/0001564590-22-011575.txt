Item 1. Business.
OVERVIEW
 We are a clinical-stage, research and development biotechnology company focused on developing novel immunotherapeutic candidates for the treatment of different forms of cancer. We have developed two versatile and enabling platform technologies for rational design of precision immune modulatory drugs. Our lead clinical candidate, APVO436, and preclinical candidates, ALG.APV-527 and APVO603, were developed using our ADAPTIR™ modular protein technology platform. Our preclinical candidate APVO442 was developed using our ADAPTIR-FLEX™ modular protein technology platform.  
 
The versatile and robust ADAPTIR and ADAPTIR-FLEX platforms are designed to generate monospecific, bispecific, and multi-specific antibody candidates that are capable of enhancing the human immune system against cancer cells. ADAPTIR and ADAPTIR-FLEX are both modular platforms, which gives us the flexibility to generate immunotherapeutic candidates with a variety of mechanisms of action. This flexibility in design allows us to potentially generate novel therapeutic candidates that may provide the foundation for the establishment of effective strategies against difficult to treat, as well as advanced forms cancer. We have successfully designed and constructed numerous investigational-stage prototype product candidates based on our ADAPTIR platform. The ADAPTIR platform technology is designed to generate monospecific and bispecific immunotherapeutic proteins that specifically bind to one or more targets, for example, bispecific therapeutic molecules, which may have structural and functional advantages over monoclonal antibodies. The structural differences of ADAPTIR molecules over monoclonal antibodies allow for the development of ADAPTIR immunotherapeutics that are designed to engage immune effector cells and disease targets in a novel manner to produce unique signaling responses and ultimately kill tumors or modulate the immune system to kill tumors.
 
We are skilled at candidate generation, validation, and subsequent preclinical and clinical development using the ADAPTIR platform and have added the ADAPTIR-FLEX platform to generate multi-specific candidates or other candidates to our platform capabilities.  We have developed preclinical candidate based on the ADAPTIR-FLEX platform which is advancing in our pipeline. We are developing our ADAPTIR and ADAPTIR-FLEX molecules by way of our protein engineering, preclinical development, process development, and clinical development capabilities.

STRATEGY
 We seek to grow our business by, among other things: 
 Advancing our lead clinical stage candidate, APVO436, through clinical development to evaluate its therapeutic potential alone and in combination with other therapies. We are continuing enrollment and dosing in a Phase 1b dose expansion study.  This is a multi-center, multi-cohort trial designed to evaluate APVO436 in adult patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) both in monotherapy and in combination with current standard-of care therapies.  Enrollment is on-going at multiple centers across the United States.  The Company is actively recruiting new centers to participate in the trial, and plans to be open in up to 20 clinical sites nationally.
 Advancing our preclinical stage candidate, ALG.APV-527, developed in partnership with Alligator Bioscience AB (Alligator), into clinical stage. Aptevo and Alligator continue to advance preclinical candidate, ALG.APV-527 for the treatment of solid tumors, into the clinic and expect to file an IND with the FDA in the US in the second half of 2022. A first-in-human study is expected to start in the second half of 2022. ALG.APV-527 targets 4-1BB (T lymphocyte co-stimulatory receptor) and 5TA (tumor antigen) and is designed to reactivate antigen-primed T cells.
 Advancing our ADAPTIR and ADAPTIR-FLEX platforms, focusing on immunotherapy and the development of novel bispecific and multi-specific proteins for the treatment of cancer. We focus on product development using our ADAPTIR and ADAPTIR-FLEX platforms. We plan to generate additional monospecific, bispecific, and multi-specific protein immunotherapies for development, potentially with other collaborative partners, to exploit the potential of the ADAPTIR and ADAPTIR-FLEX platforms. We will select novel candidates that have the potential to demonstrate proof of concept early in development and are differentiated in key oncology indications. We expect to continue to expand the ADAPTIR and ADAPTIR-FLEX product pipelines to address areas of unmet medical need. Our goal is to generate monospecific, bispecific, and multi-specific ADAPTIR and ADAPTIR-FLEX proteins to target tumors using the immune system or direct cytokine delivery to selective cell populations or modulate immune cells to treat diseases. We believe these product candidates may have utility in oncology and other therapeutic areas. 
 Continuing to develop new products. We are committed to new product development. We have expertise in molecular and cellular biology, immunology, oncology, pharmacology, translational services, antibody engineering and the development of protein therapeutics. This includes target validation, preclinical proof of concept, cell line development, protein purification, assay and process development and analytical characterization. We believe that these core areas of expertise enable the development of therapeutics based on the ADAPTIR and ADAPTIR-FLEX platform technologies from design, preclinical testing, IND preparation, and clinical development to preparation of a biologics license application, or BLA. 
 Establishing collaborative partnerships to broaden our pipeline and provide funding for research and development. We intend to continue to develop and grow our product portfolio through internal research and development as well as through collaborations with other biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, academia, and non-governmental organizations.

Platform Technology 
 ADAPTIR and ADAPTIR-FLEX Platform Technologies. The ADAPTIR and ADAPTIR-FLEX platform technologies can be used to produce monospecific, bispecific, and multi-specific immunotherapeutic proteins. These protein candidates bind to one or more targets found on tumor cells, immune cells, or other cells in the body or circulation to either amplify, suppress, or regulate the body’s defense mechanisms to treat cancer. We focus on developing drugs for treatment of oncology indications, but also may pursue other indications including autoimmune diseases. We believe we are well positioned for the development of monospecific, bispecific, or multi-specific therapeutics, which are antibody-based molecules that are able to bind one or more targets of therapeutic interest, utilizing our innovative ADAPTIR (modular protein technology) and ADAPTIR-FLEX platform technologies. This allows us to take a novel approach to cancer immunotherapy or for treatment of other diseases.
 Structurally, ADAPTIR and ADAPTIR-FLEX molecules are similar to antibodies; they can exhibit the same biological functions of an antibody but can be easily modified to either eliminate or incorporate new activities, while maintaining a similar size, stability, half-life and manufacturing advantages of a monoclonal antibody. The ADAPTIR molecules are single-chain polypeptides comprising customized elements, including a protein domain that binds to one or more targets connected to the hinge domain and a set of antibody constant domains known as the fragment crystallizable region, or Fc region of a human antibody. A second protein domain can be connected to the Fc region using a linker.  The antibody Fc region can elicit an immune response by binding to the corresponding Fc receptors found on various immune cells such as natural killer (NK) cells, and other cells bearing Fc receptors to mediate antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity resulting in killing the target. With the ADAPTIR platform, the Fc region can be modified to enhance or eliminate these functions. Incorporation of the Fc region into the ADAPTIR platform also provides for an extended serum half-life by engaging recycling via the neonatal Fc receptor or FcRn. A long serum half-life could potentially reduce dosing frequency and dose quantity. The ADAPTIR-FLEX molecules are comprised of at least two polypeptides that are comprised of customized elements similar to ADAPTIR candidates. The Fc region of these molecules can be modified to enable formation of a stable heterodimer. These candidates have similar mutations in the Fc region as ADAPTIR candidates to enable or eliminate binding to Fc receptors but retaining binding to FcRn to provide for an extended serum half-life.  
 The ADAPTIR platform technology enables the design of both monospecific and bispecific bi-valent protein therapeutics.

Bispecific ADAPTIR molecules are similar in structure to monospecific ADAPTIR molecules, with the exception that they have two customized target binding domains on the ends of the Fc region. We have created several bispecific molecules that are able to redirect T-cell cytotoxicity (RTCC). T-cells are white blood cells that fight infections and tumor cells. RTCC ADAPTIR molecules are designed to activate T-cells to specifically kill a tumor. The RTCC ADAPTIR does so by binding to a common component CD3, a receptor complex that activates T cells, when engaging a specific tumor antigen on a specific tumor via the second binding domain, thereby activating the T-cell to kill the tumor.
 Our ADAPTIR-FLEX platform technology extends advantages of ADAPTIR technology to create protein therapeutics with varied specificity and valency and potentially new modes of action.
 
ADAPTIR-FLEX molecules are composed of two different polypeptides that form a dimer through modifying specific sequences in the Fc region of each polypeptide. Each end of the polypeptide may contain one or two different binding domains, enabling the ADAPTIR-FLEX molecules to bind up to four targets. In addition, the ADAPTIR-FLEX platform can be used to modify the valency of binding to each target, which means it can bind a target, through one binding domain or through multiple binding domains, to a specific target to enable modifying the strength of binding to a specific target.  
 We believe that ADAPTIR and ADAPTIR-FLEX are promising platform technologies within the rapidly growing field of immuno-oncology therapeutics. The structural differences between ADAPTIR and ADAPTIR-FLEX molecules and monoclonal antibodies allow for the development of new immunotherapeutics that engage disease targets in a novel manner and produce a unique signaling response. By customizing the binding domains of our molecules, we can select the desired potency, half-life, toxicity and stability/manufacturability. We have the potential to develop products with mechanisms of action including, but not limited to, RTCC, modulating signals through immunostimulatory or immunoinhibitory receptors and targeted cytokine delivery. We can expand our ADAPTIR and ADAPTIR-FLEX platforms to generate monospecifics, bispecifics, or multi-specifics that target tumor antigens in combination with costimulatory molecules, including TNF-Receptor family members and other activating or inhibitory signaling receptors. We believe the ADAPTIR and ADAPTIR-FLEX platform technologies may prove to have advantages over other immunotherapeutics and other bispecific T-cell engaging technologies. In preclinical studies, we gathered data indicating that APVO436, a RTCC ADAPTIR bispecific that binds CD123, may have high potency and activity at low doses, a long half-life, and reduced cytokine release compared to other bispecifics targeting the same tumor antigens and CD3. The ADAPTIR and ADAPTIR-FLEX monospecifics, bispecifics, and multi-specifics can be produced using standard manufacturing practices. Further clinical and preclinical studies may not confirm or establish the anticipated benefits of this platform.
 Our ADAPTIR and ADAPTIR-FLEX platform intellectual property (IP) portfolio consists of IP that we solely own and control, with the exception of non-exclusive licenses to Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell lines and related expression systems, and a non-exclusive license to certain transgenic rodents of Open Monoclonal Technology, Inc.’s OmniAb platform, which we non-exclusively license from various third parties.

 Product Portfolio
 Our current product candidate pipeline is summarized in the table below:


Product Candidates
 Our pipeline includes investigational clinical and preclinical stage anti-cancer drug candidates with clinical impact potential for treating both hematologic malignancies, also known as “liquid” tumors, and solid tumor malignancies.
 APVO436. a bispecific CD3xCD123 ADAPTIR that is designed to engage CD3 and CD123 to redirect T-cells to destroy leukemia cells expressing the target CD123 molecule on their surface. This antibody-like recombinant protein therapeutic is designed to engage both leukemia cells and T-cells of the immune system and activate T cells only when engaging CD3 to trigger the destruction of leukemia cells. Importantly, CD123 is not only expressed on the leukemic blast cells but is also expressed on leukemic stem cells, differentiating it from other tumor antigens. APVO436 has been engineered using Aptevo's proprietary platform technology and is uniquely designed to reduce the likelihood and severity of cytokine release syndrome (CRS). APVO436 has received orphan drug designation ("orphan status") for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) according to the Orphan Drug Act. 
 In Part 2 of APVO436-5001 which is the dose expansion of this Phase 1b multi-center study, 5 cohorts of AML patients are being simultaneously enrolled to evaluate up to 90 adult patients. Cohorts include both monotherapy and combination therapy protocols including current standard of care therapies. The Company anticipates using the outcomes from the Phase 1b trial to inform the APVO436 advanced clinical program. A patient who experienced complete remission was reported on November 23, 2021. On February 9, 2022, Aptevo announced that this patient will proceed to transplant. Complete remission and transplant in patients who have failed prior frontline therapy such as this one, are indicators that the patient is making positive clinical progress in fighting this difficult-to-treat disease. The expansion trial is designed to evaluate the safety and tolerability of APVO436 when it is used as an adjunct to the standard of care and as monotherapy, and to obtain a preliminary assessment of the anti-leukemia activity of APVO436 in both modalities.

Overview of Cohorts: 5 cohorts enrolling in parallel at up to 20 trial sites in the U.S. – up to 18 patients per cohort are planned for a total of 90 patients.
 
 
Cohort | Cohort Therapy Description 
-------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 | Relapsed/refractory AML patients: Combination therapy in relapsed patients and those with primary refractory AML that failed to respond to frontline standard induction chemotherapy. Patients will be treated with the standard chemotherapy drug cytarabine or the standard chemotherapy triple drug combination MEC (mitoxantrone, etoposide, cytarabine) plus APVO436. 
2 | Poor prognostic but fit primary or secondary AML patients who are treatment-naïve, in first relapse or with primary refractory disease will receive APVO436 in combination with venetoclax and azacytidine. 
3 | APVO436 will be administered as monotherapy to AML patients in CR post frontline therapy for consolidation. In addition, patients in first relapse (CR1<1 year) and patients with primary refractory disease will also be enrolled and receive treatment with APVO436. 
4 | AML patients in first remission with a MRD+ status following standard of care frontline therapy will receive APVO436 in combination with oral azacytidine. 
5 | AML patients in second remission with MRD+ status will receive APVO436 as a dose intensive monotherapy regimen. 

 In 2021, the Company completed a Phase 1b open-label, dose-escalation clinical trial in the U.S. evaluating APVO436. Patients received APVO436 by intravenous dosing for up to six 28-day cycles. The objective of the trial was to evaluate safety, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of APVO436 in AML and MDS patients. Forty-six patients with both AML and MDS were enrolled in the trial. A recent presentation at the American Society of Hematology (ASH) revealed the safety profile and some preliminary efficacy data in a heavily pretreated population. APVO436 was generally well tolerated and two patients with unfavorable cytogenetics and/or adverse risk genomic mutations in the cohorts that received 12 mcg and 18 mcg flat dose achieved a complete remission (CR) as their best overall response. Maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was not reached in this study and 18 mcg is now being tested in a multi-center, multi-cohort expansion trial evaluating a total of 90 patients with AML.
 The most common APVO436-related AEs were infusion-related reactions (IRR) occurring in thirteen (28.3%) patients and cytokine release syndrome (CRS) occurring in ten (21.7%). No hematologic DLT was observed in any of the ten dose cohorts. Ten patients experienced twelve episodes of Grade 3 febrile neutropenia and each one of these twelve episodes was reported as not related to APVO436. APVO436-related transient neurotoxicity occurred in five of forty-six patients (10.9%). It was mild with Grade 1 AEs including headache, tremor, dizziness, lethargy, insomnia, memory loss, and confusion. A single case of Grade 3 confusion was encountered on the first day of treatment and resolved within a day. APVO436-associated CRS was generally manageable with standard of care and in most cases it resolved rapidly with the administration of tocilizumab at standard doses combined with dexamethasone. APVO436-related CRS was not required for clinically meaningful responses in R/R AML patients, and it did not affect their survival outcome. Notably patients who developed CRS after APVO436 therapy were not more or less likely to have a favorable response. Among eight AML patients with favorable responses, four experienced a CRS and four did not. APVO436-related CRS was not required for clinically meaningful responses in R/R AML patients, and it did not affect the survival outcome. Prolonged stabilization of disease, partial remissions and complete remissions were achieved in both patients who experienced CRS as well as patients who did not experience CRS after APVO436 infusions. In addition, 3 of 6 evaluable MDS patients developed a marrow CR.

A potential complication associated with treatment using bispecific, T-cell engaging antibodies is a systemic inflammatory syndrome known as Cytokine Release Syndrome. CRS may occur within minutes to hours after infusion of the bispecific T-cell engaging antibody or emerge as a delayed onset complication after several days. Clinical manifestations of CRS may range from mild to severe including hypotension, hypoxia, and uncontrolled systemic inflammatory response with circulatory collapse, vascular leakage, peripheral and/or pulmonary edema, renal failure, cardiac dysfunction, and fatal multiorgan system failure.  Heart failure can also be a consequence of the systemic inflammatory syndrome of CRS.  Another form of systemic inflammation a bispecific T-cell engaging antibody can cause is Hemophagocytic Lymphohistiocytosis (HLH)/Macrophage Activation Syndrome (MAS) which shares many clinical and laboratory features with CRS.  HLH/MAS is considered a form of CRS when it occurs after treatment with a bispecific T-cell engaging antibody.  
 CRS have occurred in some APVO436 patients, which have been effectively treated using the generally recommended standard CRS treatment, which includes the use of tocilizumab and dexamethasone, combined with standard supportive care. This has been confirmed to be effective in the APVO436 patients that have experienced CRS. Several additional treatments for CRS have recently become available, and we are working with key opinion leaders and site investigators to further optimize our algorithm for addressing CRS.
 On November 26, 2019, the FDA granted Orphan Drug Designation for AML to APVO436, which grants us exclusive marketing and development rights, as well as eligibility for market exclusivity upon FDA approval of APVO436.
 ALG.APV-527. a novel investigational bispecific ADAPTIR candidate, developed in partnership with Alligator Bioscience AB (Alligator), featuring a novel mechanism of action designed to simultaneously target 4-1BB (CD137) and 5T4, a tumor antigen overexpressed in a number of different types of cancer. 4-1BB, a costimulatory receptor on T cells, is known to enhance the immune response to cancer through activation of tumor-specific T cells and is believed to be a promising target for new immunotherapeutic approaches. ALG.APV-527 could potentially have utility in the treatment of a broad spectrum of cancers over-expressing the 5T4 tumor antigen, including mesothelioma, non-small-cell-lung, head and neck, pancreatic, renal, ovarian, prostate, breast, cervical, colorectal, endometrial, and bladder cancers. Aptevo and Alligator plan to file an IND with the FDA in the US in 2022 and to subsequently commence first in human study in the second half of 2022.
 APVO603. a preclinical dual agonist bispecific ADAPTIR candidate employing a novel mechanism of action to simultaneously target 4-1BB (CD137) and OX40 (CD134), both members of the TNF-receptor family.  Dual targeting of 4-1BB and OX40 provides synergistic co-stimulation of T cells with the potential to amplify the cytotoxic function of activated T cells and NK cells, potentially leading to more robust anti-tumor responses. APVO603’s combined activation of both the 4-1BB and OX40 TNF receptors represents an attractive approach in potentially overcoming the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. The targeted co-stimulation of 4-1BB and OX40 has the potential to promote an important immunological cascade, enhancing T-cell activation, prolonging T-cell survival, and improving tumor killing. This product candidate is not dependent on any one tumor antigen and has the potential to treat multiple solid tumors.
 APVO442. a novel bispecific candidate based on the ADAPTIR-FLEX platform technology that binds to PSMA with two identical binding domains to PSMA and with one binding domain to CD3 with reduced binding affinity. This candidate was designed to increase biodistribution of drugs to PSMA positive tumors for treatment of prostate cancer. The low-affinity single binding domain to CD3 has the potential to allow for increased concentrations at the tumor due to possibly reducing absorption of the drug by circulating peripheral T cells.  Preclinical studies have been completed demonstrating in vitro RTCC that is directed to PSMA bearing tumor cell lines in vitro and in vivo animal models. 
 Competition 
 We face, and will continue to face, intense competition from both U.S.-based and foreign producers of both large and small molecule immunotherapeutic products, some of which have lower cost structures, greater access to capital, greater resources for research and development, and sophisticated marketing capabilities. Any product candidate that we successfully develop and commercialize is likely to compete with currently marketed products, as well as other novel product candidates that are in development for the same indications.

APVO436: We anticipate that APVO436 would compete with other agents targeting CD123 that are in development if they are also approved. Bispecifics in development targeting CD123 include: flotetuzumab (formerly MGD006, Macrogenics), and JNJ-63709178 (Janssen). There are numerous CAR-T therapies in development: CART123 (University of Penn.), CARTCD123 (NCI/City of Hope), UCART123 (Cellectis), MB-102 (Mustang Bio) and several others in development in China. Other competitive products targeting CD123 are: tagraxofusp (formerly SL-401, an antibody immunotoxin, Stemline), KHK2833 (monoclonal antibody, Kyowa Hakko Kirin Pharma), CSL362 (monoclonal antibody, CSL/Janssen) and IMGN632 (ImmunoGen and Jazz Pharmaceuticals).
 ALG.APV-527:  This asset targets 4-1BB in a bispecific format when cross-linked with the tumor antigen 5T4.  We anticipate that ALG.APV-527 would compete with bispecifics targeting 5T4 and 4-1BB, which are currently in preclinical development (Crescendo Biologics). Bispecific in the clinic targeting 5T4 include GenMab and Abbvie’s (GEN1044), a 5T4 x CD3 DuoBody, in Phase 1/2 trials. In addition, other competitors include bispecifics targeting 4-1BB in combination with other targets such as 4-1BB x FAP (FAP is expressed on tumor associated stomal fibroblasts).  4-1BB x FAP is currently in phase 1 clinical development by Molecular Partners and Amgen (AMG506) and Hoffmann-La Roche (RO7122290) for treatment of advanced solid tumors. Another bispecific targets 4-1BB x HER (Cinrebafusp Alfa, PRS343) which is in phase 2 clinical development by Pieris for treatment of HER2+ solid tumors.
 Furthermore, we face significant competition in the oncology market in general, including from: AbbVie Inc., ABL Bio, Aduro, Inc., Affirmed, Amgen Inc., AnaptysBio, Inc., Astellas Pharma Inc., Bayer AG, Bicycle Therapeutics, Biogen Idec Inc., Boehringer Ingelheim GmbH, F-Star Biotechnology Ltd., Genentech Inc. (a subsidiary of F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd.), Genmab A/S, GlaxoSmithKline plc, Grifols USA LLC, Bristol Myers Squibb, I-Mab Biopharma, ImmunoGen, Inc., Immunomedics, Inc., Janssen BioTech Inc., Johnson & Johnson, Macrogenics, Inc., Novartis International AG, Pieris Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Sanofi-Aventis US LLC, Takeda Pharmaceuticals U.S.A., Inc., Xencor, Inc. and Zymeworks Biopharmaceuticals, Inc. Additionally, there may be other potential competitors or companies developing competitive products that may not be known to us at this time.
 COLLABORATIONS WITH ALLIGATOR BIOSCIENCE 
 On July 20, 2017, our wholly owned subsidiary Aptevo Research and Development LLC (Aptevo R&D), entered into a collaboration and option agreement (the Collaboration Agreement) with Alligator Bioscience AB, (Alligator), pursuant to which Aptevo R&D and Alligator are collaboratively developing ALG.APV-527, a lead bispecific antibody candidate simultaneously targeting 4-1BB (CD137), a member of the TNFR superfamily of a costimulatory receptor found on activated T-cells, and 5T4 a tumor antigen overexpressed in a number of different types of cancer. This product candidate is built on our novel ADAPTIR platform. 
 Subject to certain exceptions for Aptevo R&D’s manufacturing and platform technologies, the parties will jointly own intellectual property generated in the performance of the development activities under the Collaboration Agreement. Under the terms of the Collaboration Agreement, the parties intend to share revenue received from a third-party commercialization partner equally, or, if the development costs are not equally shared under the Collaboration Agreement, in proportion to the development costs borne by each party. 
 The Collaboration Agreement also contains several points in development at which either party may elect to “opt-out” (i.e., terminate without cause) and, following a termination notice period, cease paying development costs for this product candidate, which would be borne fully by the continuing party. Following an opt-out by a party, the continuing party will be granted exclusive rights to continue the development and commercialization of this product candidate, subject to a requirement to pay a percentage of revenue received from any future commercialization partner for this product, or, if the continuing party elects to self-commercialize, tiered royalties on the net sales of this product by the continuing party ranging from the low to mid-single digits, based on the point in development at which the opt-out occurs. The parties have also agreed on certain technical criteria or “stage gates” related to the development of this product that, if not met, will cause an automatic termination and wind-down of the Collaboration Agreement and the activities thereunder, provided that the parties do not agree to continue.
 The Collaboration Agreement contains industry standard termination rights, including for material breach following a specified cure period, and in the case of a party’s insolvency.

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY 
 We rely on a combination of patents, trademarks, trade secrets, and nondisclosure and non-competition agreements to protect our proprietary intellectual property and will continue to do so. We own or exclusively license the patents and patent applications in our patent portfolio that support the ADAPTIR-FLEX platform, ADAPTIR platform and pipeline products with the exception of certain cell line rights and other research tools, which we license on a non-exclusive basis. We practice patent life cycle management by filing patent applications to protect new inventions relating to meaningful improvements to our products and related methods. We primarily seek patent protection for inventions that support our products and product candidates, but from time to time, we may seek patent protection for inventions that could, for instance, support a potential business opportunity or block a competitor from designing around our existing patents.
 In general, and where possible, we pursue patent protection in countries where we believe there will be a significant market for the corresponding product or product candidate. We generally do not seek patent protection in countries where we have reason to believe we would not be able to enforce patents. For instance, we tend to not file in countries that are frequently listed on the Priority Watch List of the Special 301 Report prepared by the Office of the United States Trade Representative, with the exception that we typically file patent applications in China, Russia and India. We may also decide to take a narrower filing approach for secondary and improvement type inventions as compared to inventions that are more foundational to our products. We do not seek patent protection in countries that are on the United Nations, or U.N., list of Least Developed Countries. 
 The term of protection for various patents associated with, and expected to be associated with, our marketed product and product candidates is typically twenty years from the filing date, but may vary depending on a variety of factors, including the date of filing of the patent application or the date of patent issuance and the legal term of patents in the countries in which they are obtained. The protection afforded by a patent varies on a product-by-product basis and country-to-country basis and depends upon many factors, including the type of patent, the scope of its coverage, the availability of regulatory-related extensions, the necessity for terminal disclaimers, the availability of legal remedies in a particular country, and the validity and enforceability of the patents. 
 In some cases, we may decide that the best way to protect our intellectual property is to retain proprietary information as trade secrets and confidential information, rather than to apply for patents, which would involve disclosure of proprietary information to the public. When determining whether to protect intellectual property as a trade secret, we consider many factors including, for instance, our ability to maintain the trade secret, the likelihood that a competitor will independently develop the information, our ability to patent protect the intellectual property and the likelihood we would be able to enforce a resulting patent. 
 We are a party to a number of license agreements under which we license patents, patent applications, and other intellectual property. These agreements impose various commercial diligence and financial payment obligations on us. We expect to continue to enter into these types of license agreements in the future. 
 ADAPTIR and ADAPTIR-FLEX Platforms. We protect the ADAPTIR platform technology through a combination of patents and trade secrets. We own all ADAPTIR and ADAPTIR-FLEX platform intellectual property, with the exception that we have licenses to certain intellectual property related to third party research tools that we use in conjunction with our ADAPTIR platform technology such as cell lines, vectors, expression systems, and transgenic rodents.  For instance, we have a non-exclusive commercial license and research license with Lonza Group AG (Lonza) related to its CHO cell lines and vectors. Under our Lonza research license, we have an option to take a license to use the GS System to develop and manufacture therapeutic proteins for our commercial purposes. We also have a non-exclusive license to certain transgenic rodents of Open Monoclonal Technology, Inc.’s OmniAb platform.  
 The initial version of the ADAPTIR platform technology was originally developed by Trubion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Trubion) prior to its acquisition by Emergent BioSolutions Inc (Emergent). A patent family supporting use of unique linkers in the homodimer (a molecule consisting of two identical halves) version of the ADAPTIR platform was invented jointly by Trubion and Wyeth Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Wyeth) as part of a collaboration between the two companies. Wyeth assigned the rights it had in that platform patent family to Trubion. We subsequently received the rights to the platform patent family upon our spinoff from Emergent.

In order to differentiate our platform inventions from antibodies and other antibody-like constructs that have been publicly disclosed, many of our patents and patent applications are directed to unique aspects or components of our platform such as linkers, targets, or binding domains.
We have patents relating to the ADAPTIR platform issued in the United States, Australia, Israel, Japan, South Korea, Mexico, Malaysia, New Zealand, Philippines, Russia, Singapore, South Africa, and Vietnam. We also have applications pending in various territories including Europe and Brazil. We plan to continue to improve our ADAPTIR platform and to file patent applications on those improvements. Our decision as to where to file any new ADAPTIR improvement inventions will be based in part on the significance of the improvement. If patents issue on the pending ADAPTIR patent applications, the patent term for those patents are estimated to expire between 2027 and 2036.  As our ADAPTIR platform technology evolves, we may decide to allow patent applications and patents to expire if they contain claims that are limited to aspects of the platform that are no longer of value to Aptevo.  
 ADAPTIR-FLEX, our heterodimer platform, is covered by patent application under the Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT) that we filed in 2021. The PCT patent application allows us to file patent applications in PCT member state countries including, for instance, the United States, Europe, Japan, China, Australia, and Canada. If patents claiming priority to the pending ADAPTIR-FLEX patent application are issued, the resulting patents are estimated to expire in 2041.
 We own patent families directed to use of particular binding domains in the ADAPTIR and ADAPTIR-FLEX platforms.  For instance, we have some patents that cover the use of an ADAPTIR therapeutic to target CD3.  We also have pending patent applications that cover ADAPTIR therapeutics containing our preferred humanized CD3 binding domain polypeptide sequences.   
 APVO436. We nationalized our core patent family, which covers the APVO436 product candidate in various countries and territories including the U.S., Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Colombia, Europe, Eurasia, India, Indonesia, Israel, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Philippines, Singapore, South Africa, South Korea, Ukraine, and Vietnam.
 ALG.APV-527. We co-own with Alligator a patent family corresponding to PCT application PCT/EP2018/069850, which covers the ALG.APV-527 product candidate. In January and February of 2020, this patent family was nationalized in various countries. Aptevo and Alligator also co-own U.S. patent 10,239,949, which relates to protein molecules that specifically bind to 5T4 and/or 4-1BB.  
 In addition to the co-owned assets, Alligator owns a patent family corresponding to PCT application PCT/EP2017/059656, which also covers ALG.APV-527. Aptevo has an exclusive license from Alligator to this patent family for the development of the ALG.APV-527 product candidate.
 Preclinical Therapeutic Candidates. We routinely file United States provisional patent applications and/or Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT) patent applications on our preclinical therapeutic assets when we believe we have sufficient data to support a patent application filing.  Aptevo owns pending patent applications, for instance, which support its APVO603 and APVO442 therapeutic candidates. 
 Trademarks owned by Aptevo Therapeutics Inc. and its subsidiaries. Where possible, we pursue registered trademarks for our marketed products in significant markets. We own trademark registrations and pending applications for the marks: APTEVO THERAPEUTICS, APTEVO BIOTHERAPEUTICS, APTEVO RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT, the Aptevo logo, ADAPTIR, and ADAPTIR-FLEX in relevant jurisdictions.
 REGULATION
 Regulations in the United States and other countries have a significant impact on our product development, manufacturing, and marketing activities. Government authorities in the United States, at the federal, state, and local level, and in other countries, extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, approval, manufacture, packaging, storage, recordkeeping, labeling, advertising, promotion, distribution, marketing, import, and export of biopharmaceutical products. In addition, sponsors of biopharmaceutical products participating in Medicaid and Medicare are required to comply with mandatory price reporting, discount, and rebate requirements. The processes for obtaining regulatory approvals in the United States and in foreign countries, along with compliance with applicable statutes and regulations, require the expenditure of substantial time and financial 
 10


resources. In the United States, the FDA regulates biopharmaceutical products under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, the Public Health Services Act, or PHSA, and their implementing regulations. FDA’s requirements and expectations with respect to product development are constantly evolving. By example, in light of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the FDA issued a number of guidance documents to assist companies navigating COVID-19, product development, and manufacturing.
 Product Development for Therapeutics
 Preclinical Testing. Before beginning testing of any compounds with potential therapeutic value in human subjects in the United States, stringent government requirements for preclinical data must be satisfied. Preclinical testing includes both in vitro, or in an artificial environment outside of a living organism, and in vivo, or within a living organism, laboratory evaluation and characterization of the safety and efficacy of a drug and its formulation, as well as its chemistry, pharmacology, and toxicity. We perform preclinical testing on all of our product candidates before we initiate any human trials.
 Investigational New Drug Application. Before clinical testing may begin, the results of preclinical testing, together with manufacturing information, analytical data and any other available clinical data or literature, must be submitted to the United States Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, as part of an Investigational New Drug Application, or IND. The sponsor must also include an initial protocol detailing the first phase of the proposed clinical investigation, together with information regarding the qualifications of the clinical investigators. The provided data must provide an adequate basis for evaluating both the safety and the scientific rationale for the initial clinical studies in human volunteers. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA unless the FDA imposes a clinical hold within that 30-day time period. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. Clinical holds also may be imposed by the FDA at any time before or during trials due to safety concerns or non-compliance. As a result, submission of an IND may not result in FDA authorization to commence a clinical trial.
 Clinical Trials. Clinical trials involve the administration of the drug to healthy human volunteers, or to patients with the target disease or disorder under the supervision of a qualified physician (also called an investigator) pursuant to an FDA-reviewed protocol. Human clinical trials typically are conducted in three sequential phases, although the phases may overlap with one another. Clinical trials must be conducted under protocols that detail the objectives of the study, the parameters to be used to monitor safety and the efficacy criteria, if any, to be evaluated. Each protocol, and any subsequent amendments, must be submitted to the FDA, as part of the IND, or comparable foreign regulatory authorities.

• | Phase 1 clinical trials test for safety, dose tolerance, absorption, bio-distribution, metabolism, excretion, structure activity relationships, mechanism of action, and clinical pharmacology and, if possible, for early evidence regarding efficacy. Phase 1 studies may be conducted in healthy human volunteers or patients with the target disease or condition. Phase 1a is typically a dose escalation trial. Phase 1b may involve cohort expansion at one or more dose levels combinations, or in different population to determine the recommended Phase 2 dose and strategy.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 2 clinical trials are controlled studies that involve a small sample of individuals with the target disease or disorder and seek to assess the efficacy of the drug for specific targeted indications to determine dose response and the optimal dose range and dose regimen and to gather additional information relating to safety and potential adverse effects.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 3 clinical trials are adequate and controlled studies that consist of expanded, large-scale studies of patients, at geographically dispersed sites, with the target disease or disorder to obtain definitive statistical evidence of the efficacy and safety of the proposed product and dosing regimen. The safety and efficacy data generated from Phase 3 clinical trials typically form the basis for FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities approval of the product candidate, as well as product labeling. Typically, two Phase 3 trials are required by the FDA for product approval. Under some limited circumstances, however, the FDA may approve a BLA based upon a single Phase 3 clinical study plus confirmatory evidence or a single large multicenter trial without confirmatory evidence.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 4 clinical trials, if conducted, are conducted after a product has been approved. These trials can be conducted for a number of purposes, including to collect long-term safety information or to collect additional data about a specific population. As part of a product approval, the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may require that certain Phase 4 studies, which are called post-marketing
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 11


 
commitment studies, be conducted post-approval. The results of Phase 4 studies can confirm or refute the effectiveness of a product candidate, and can provide important safety information. 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Additional kinds of data may also help to support a BLA or product development, such as patient experience and real world evidence.  For appropriate indications sought through supplemental BLAs, data summaries may provide marketing application support. For genetically targeted products and variant protein targeted products intended to address an unmet medical need in one or more patient subgroups with a serious or life threatening rare disease or condition, the FDA may allow a sponsor to rely upon data and information previously developed by the sponsor or for which the sponsor has a right of reference, that was submitted previously to support an approved application for a product that incorporates or utilizes the same or similar genetically targeted technology or a product that is the same or utilizes the same variant protein targeted drug as the product that is the subject of the application.
 In addition, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act of 2003, or PREA, BLAs and supplements for a new active ingredient, indication, dosage form, dosage regimen, or route of administration must contain data to assess the safety and efficacy of the product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDA may grant deferrals for submission of data or full or partial waivers. Unless otherwise required by regulation, PREA does not apply to any drug or biologic for an indication for which orphan designation has been granted for the relevant indication.
 Good Clinical Practice. All of the phases of clinical studies must be conducted in conformance with the FDA’s Good Clinical Practices (GCPs) or equivalent standards from comparable foreign regulatory authorities, which are ethical and scientific quality standards for conducting, recording and reporting clinical trials to assure that the data and reported results are credible and accurate and that the rights, safety and well-being of trial participants are protected. GCPs include requirements that all research subjects provide their informed consent in writing for their participation in any clinical trial. Investigators must also provide certain information to the clinical trial sponsors to allow the sponsors to make certain financial disclosures to the FDA. In addition, an Institutional Review Board, or IRB, at each study site participating in the clinical trial or a central IRB must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial, informed consent forms, and communications to study subjects before a study commences at that site. An IRB considers, among other things, whether the risks to individuals participating in the trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits, and whether the planned human subject protections are adequate. The IRB must continue to oversee the clinical trial while it is being conducted. Once an IND is in effect, each new clinical protocol and any amendments to the protocol must be submitted to FDA for review, and to the IRB for approval. If a product candidate is being investigated for multiple intended indications, separate INDs may also be required. Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must also be submitted at least annually to the FDA and the IRB and more frequently if serious adverse events or other significant safety information is found.
 Information about certain clinical trials, including a description of the study and study results, must be submitted within specific timeframes to the National Institutes of Health, or NIH, for public dissemination on their clinicaltrials.gov website. Sponsors or distributors of investigational products for the diagnosis, monitoring, or treatment of one or more serious diseases or conditions must also have a publicly available policy on evaluating and responding to requests for expanded access requests.
 The manufacture of investigational biologics for the conduct of human clinical trials is subject to FDA’s current Good Manufacturing Practice, or cGMP requirements. Investigational biologics and therapeutic substances imported into the United States are also subject to regulation by the FDA. Further, the export of investigational products outside of the United States is subject to regulatory requirements of the receiving country as well as U.S. export requirements under the FDCA.
 Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the product candidate as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, manufacturers must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality, potency, and purity of the final product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested, and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
 12


The FDA may order the temporary, or permanent, discontinuation of a clinical trial at any time, or impose other sanctions, if it believes that the clinical trial either is not being conducted in accordance with FDA requirements or presents an unacceptable risk to the clinical trial patients. An IRB may also require the clinical trial at the site to be halted, either temporarily or permanently, for failure to comply with the IRB’s requirements or if the trial poses an unexpected serious harm to subjects. The FDA or an IRB may also impose conditions on the conduct of a clinical trial. Clinical trial sponsors may also choose to discontinue clinical trials as a result of risks to subjects, a lack of favorable results, or changing business priorities.
 Marketing Approval - Biologics
 Biologics License Application. All data obtained from a comprehensive development program, including research and product development, manufacturing, preclinical and clinical trials, labeling and related information are submitted in a biologics license application, or BLA, to the FDA and in similar regulatory filings with the corresponding agencies in other countries for review and approval. In most cases, the submission of a marketing application is subject to a substantial application user fee. These user fees must be paid at the time of the first submission of the application, even if the application is being submitted on a rolling basis. Fee waivers or reductions are available in certain circumstances.  By example, product candidates that are designated as orphan products, which are further described below, are not subject to application user fees unless the application includes an indication other than the orphan indication.
 The submission of an application is not a guarantee that the FDA will find the application complete and accept it for filing. The FDA may refuse to file the application and request additional information rather than accept the application for filing, in which case the application must be resubmitted with the supplemental information. The resubmitted application is also subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. The FDA has two months to review an application for its acceptability for filing. 
 Once an application is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review.  The Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, establishes a two-tiered review system: Standard Review and Priority Review. When conducting Priority Review, the FDA has a goal to review and act on BLA submissions within six months from the date of the FDA’s acceptance for filing of the application, rather than the ten-month goal under a Standard Review. The FDA gives Priority Review status to product candidates that provide safe and effective therapies where no satisfactory alternative exists or to a product candidate that are intended to treat serious conditions and, if approved, would provide significant improvements in the safety or effectiveness of the treatment, diagnosis, or prevention of the serious condition. The PDUFA date is only a goal, thus, the FDA does not always meet its PDUFA dates. The review process and the PDUFA date may also be extended if the FDA requests or the sponsor otherwise provides substantial additional information or clarification regarding the submission.
 The FDA may refer certain applications to an advisory committee. Before approving a product candidate for which no active ingredient (including any ester or salt of active ingredients) has previously been approved by the FDA, the FDA must either refer that product candidate to an external advisory committee or provide in an action letter, a summary of the reasons why the FDA did not refer the product candidate to an advisory committee. The FDA may also refer other product candidates to an advisory committee if FDA believes that the advisory committee’s expertise would be beneficial. An advisory committee is typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, which review, evaluate, and make a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions.
 The FDA reviews applications to determine, among other things, whether a product candidate meets the agency’s approval standards and whether the manufacturing methods and controls are adequate to assure and preserve the product’s identity, strength, quality, potency, and purity. Before approving a marketing application, the FDA typically will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured, referred to as a Pre-Approval Inspection. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities, including contract manufacturers and subcontractors, are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving a marketing application the FDA will inspect one or more clinical trial sites to assure compliance with GCPs.
 13


In reviewing a BLA, the FDA may grant approval or deny the application through a complete response letter, or CRL, if it determines the application does not provide an adequate basis for approval requesting additional information. A CRL indicates that the review cycle of the application is complete and the application is not ready for approval and describes all of the specific deficiencies that the FDA identified. A CRL generally contains a statement of specific conditions that must be met in order to secure final approval of the marketing application, and may require additional clinical or preclinical testing in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. The deficiencies identified may be minor, for example, requiring labeling changes; or major, for example, requiring additional clinical trials. If a CRL is issued, the applicant may either: resubmit the marketing application, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter; withdraw the application; or request an opportunity for a hearing.  Even if additional information outlined in a CRL is submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the BLA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. 
 The receipt of regulatory approval often takes many years, involving the expenditure of substantial financial resources. The speed with which approval is granted often depends on a number of factors, including the severity of the disease in question, the availability of alternative treatments and the risks and benefits demonstrated in clinical trials. The FDA may also impose conditions upon approval. For example, it may require a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, for a product. This can include various required elements, such as publication of a medication guide, patient package insert, a communication plan to educate health care providers of the drug’s risks and/or restrictions on distribution and use, such as limitations on who may prescribe or dispense the drug. Following product approval, a REMS may also be required by the FDA if new safety information is discovered and the FDA determines that a REMS is necessary to ensure that the benefits of the product outweigh the risks.
 The FDA may also significantly limit the indications or populations approved for a given product, require that contraindications, warnings, or precautions be included in the product labeling, including a boxed warning,  and/or require, as a condition of approval, enhanced labeling, special packaging or labeling, post-approval clinical trials, distribution or other risk management mechanisms, expedited reporting of certain adverse events, pre-approval of promotional materials or restrictions on direct-to-consumer advertising, any of which could negatively impact the commercial success of a drug. The FDA may also not approve label statements that are necessary for successful commercialization and marketing.
 After approval, some types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes, and additional labeling claims, are subject to further testing requirements and FDA review and approval. The FDA may also withdraw the product approval if compliance with the pre- and post-marketing regulatory standards are not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the marketplace. Further, should new safety information arise, additional testing, product labeling, or FDA notification may be required.
 Breakthrough Therapy. Under the provisions of the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act, or FDASIA, the FDA may designate a product as a breakthrough therapy if the product is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other products, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. Products designated as breakthrough therapies are also eligible for accelerated approval. The FDA must take certain actions, such as holding timely meetings and providing advice, intended to expedite the development and review of an application for approval of a breakthrough therapy.
 Orphan Drugs. Under the Orphan Drug Act, an applicant can request the FDA to designate a product as an “orphan drug” in the United States if the drug is intended to treat an orphan, or rare, disease or condition. A disease or condition is considered orphan if it affects fewer than 200,000 people in the United States, or affecting more than 200,000 in the United States and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making the product available in the United States will be recovered from United States sales. Additionally, sponsors must present a plausible hypothesis for clinical superiority to obtain orphan drug designation if there is a product already approved by the FDA that that is considered by the FDA to be the same as the already approved product and is intended for the same indication. This hypothesis must be demonstrated to obtain orphan exclusivity. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting a BLA. Products designated as orphan drugs are eligible for special grant funding for research and development, potential tax credits for research, waived user fees for marketing applications and a seven-year period of market exclusivity after marketing approval. The tax advantages, however, were limited in the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. 
 14


Orphan drug exclusivity (afforded to the first applicant to receive approval for an orphan designated drug) prevents FDA approval of applications by others for the same drug for the designated orphan disease or condition. The FDA may approve a subsequent application from another applicant if the FDA determines that the application is for a different drug or different use, or if the FDA determines that the subsequent product is clinically superior, or that the holder of the initial orphan drug approval cannot assure the availability of sufficient quantities of the drug to meet the public’s need. A grant of an orphan designation is not a guarantee that a product will be approved. On November 26, 2019 FDA granted Orphan Drug Designation to APVO436, a bispecific antibody candidate intended for the treatment of acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). APVO436 is currently being evaluated in a Phase 1b clinical trial in patients with AML and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS).
 Post-Approval Requirements. Any biologic for which we receive FDA approval will be subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, record keeping requirements, reporting of adverse experiences, reporting of deviations and shortages, providing the FDA with updated safety and efficacy information, product sampling and distribution requirements, current good manufacturing practices, or cGMP, and restrictions on advertising and promotion. Adverse events that are reported after marketing approval can result in additional limitations being placed on the product’s distribution or use and, potentially, withdrawal or suspension of the product from the market. In addition, the FDA authority to require post-approval clinical trials and/or safety labeling changes if warranted. In certain circumstances, the FDA may impose a REMS after a product has been approved. 
 Facilities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved products are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, list their manufactured products, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA for compliance with cGMP and other laws. Manufacturers and other parties involved in the supply chain for prescription drug products must also comply with product tracking and tracing requirements and for notifying the FDA of counterfeit, diverted, stolen and intentionally adulterated products or products that are otherwise unfit for distribution in the United States. Recently, the information that must be submitted to FDA regarding manufactured products was expanded through the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security, or CARES, Act to include the volume of drugs produced during the prior year.  Manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the areas of production and quality-control to maintain compliance with cGMPs. Regulatory authorities may withdraw product approvals, require label modifications, or request product recalls, among other actions, if a company fails to comply with regulatory standards, if it encounters problems following initial marketing, or if previously unrecognized problems are subsequently discovered.
 The FDA also closely monitors advertising and promotional materials we may disseminate for our products for compliance with restrictions on off-label promotion and other laws. We may not promote our products for conditions of use that are not included in the approved package inserts for our products. Physicians, in their independent professional medical judgment, however, may prescribe legally available products for unapproved indications that are not described in the product’s labeling and that differ from those tested and approved by the FDA. Certain additional restrictions on advertising and promotion exist for products that have boxed warnings in their approved package inserts.  The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability, including, but not limited to, criminal and civil penalties under the FDCA and False Claims Act, exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs, mandatory compliance programs under corporate integrity agreements, suspension and debarment from government contracts, and refusal of orders under existing government contracts.
 Biosimilars and Exclusivity. The Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009, or BPCIA, creates an abbreviated approval pathway for biological products shown to be highly similar to or interchangeable with an FDA-licensed reference biological product. Biosimilarity sufficient to reference a prior FDA-approved product requires a high similarity to the reference product notwithstanding minor differences in clinically inactive components, and no clinically meaningful differences between the biological product and the reference product in terms of safety, purity, and potency. Biosimilarity must be shown through analytical studies, animal studies, and at least one clinical trial, absent a waiver by the FDA. There must be no difference between the reference product and a biosimilar in mechanism of action, conditions of use, route of administration, dosage form, and strength. A biosimilar product may be deemed interchangeable with a prior approved product if it meets the higher hurdle of demonstrating that it can be expected to produce the same clinical results as the reference product and, for products administered multiple times, the biologic and the reference biologic may be switched after one has been previously administered without increasing safety risks or risks of diminished efficacy relative to exclusive use of the reference biologic.
 15


A reference biologic is granted 12 years of exclusivity from the time of first licensure, and no application for a biosimilar can be submitted for four years from the date of licensure. However, certain changes and supplements to an approved BLA, and subsequent applications filed by the same sponsor, manufacturer, licensor, predecessor in interest, or other related entity do not qualify for the twelve-year exclusivity period. The PHSA also includes provisions to protect reference products that have patent protection. The biosimilar product sponsor and reference product sponsor may exchange certain patent and product information for the purpose of determining whether there should be a legal patent challenge. Based on the outcome of negotiations surrounding the exchanged information, the reference product sponsor may bring a patent infringement suit and injunction proceedings against the biosimilar product sponsor. The biosimilar applicant may also be able to bring an action for declaratory judgment concerning the patent. 
 In an effort to increase competition in the biologic product marketplace, Congress, the executive branch, and FDA have taken certain legislative and regulatory steps. For example, in 2020, FDA finalized a guidance to facilitate drug and biologic product importation. Moreover, the 2020 Further Consolidated Appropriations Act included provisions requiring that sponsors of approved biologic products, including those subject to REMS, provide samples of the approved products to persons developing biosimilar products within specified timeframes, in sufficient quantities, and on commercially reasonable market-based terms. Failure to do so can subject the approved product sponsor to civil actions, penalties, and responsibility for attorney’s fees and costs of the civil action. This same bill also includes provisions with respect to shared and separate REMS programs for reference and generic drug products.
 Patent Term Restoration.  If approved, biologic products may also be eligible for periods of U.S. patent term restoration. If granted, patent term restoration extends the patent life of a single unexpired patent, that has not previously been extended, for a maximum of five years. The total patent life of the product with the extension also cannot exceed fourteen years from the product’ approval date. Subject to the prior limitations, the period of the extension is calculated by adding half of the time from the effective date of an IND to the initial submission of a marketing application, and all of the time between the submission of the marketing application and its approval. This period may also be reduced by any time that the applicant did not act with due diligence.
 
Regulation in the European Union. Product development, the regulatory approval process and safety monitoring of medicinal products and their manufacturers in the European Union proceed broadly in the same way as they do in the United States. Therefore, many of the issues discussed above apply similarly in the context of the European Union. In addition, drugs are subject to the extensive price and reimbursement regulations of the various EU member states. The Clinical Trial Regulation EU 536/2014 (“CTR”) repealed the Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC, as amended (“CTD”) on January 31, 2022, subject to a three-year transition period. The CTR makes it possible within the EU for sponsors to submit a single harmonized electronic submission via a single online platform known as the Clinical Trials Information System (“CTIS”) for approval to conduct a clinical trial in several European countries and have a single assessment process for clinical trials conducted in multiple member states. Under the CTR, sponsors can use the CTIS from January 31, 2022 but are not obliged to use it immediately, in line with a three-year transition period.  Sponsors may use CTIS to apply to conduct a clinical trial under the CTR or may choose to apply to conduct a trial under the CTD until January 30, 2023.  From January 31, 2023, sponsors will need to use CTIS to apply to start a new clinical trial in the EU/EEA.  From January 31, 2025, any trials approved under the CTD that continue running will need to comply with the CTR and their sponsors must have recorded information on such trials in CTIS.
 Healthcare Fraud and Abuse and Anti-Corruption Laws
 Various federal and state laws pertaining to health care “fraud and abuse” exist, including state and federal anti-kickback laws false claims laws, and patent privacy and security laws. Anti-kickback laws make it illegal for a drug manufacturer to knowingly and willfully solicit, offer, receive or pay any remuneration in exchange for, to induce, or in return for, the referral of business that may be reimbursed by a third party payor (including Medicare and Medicaid), including the purchase, prescribing or recommendation of a particular drug. Due to the breadth of the statutory provisions, it is possible that our practices might be challenged under anti-kickback or similar laws. Civil and criminal false claims laws, false statement laws and civil monetary penalty laws prohibit, among other things, anyone from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented for payment, to third-party payors (including Medicare and Medicaid) claims for reimbursed drugs or services that are false or fraudulent, claims for items or services not provided as claimed or claims for medically unnecessary items or services. Our activities relating to the 
 16


sale and marketing of our products may be subject to scrutiny under these laws. Privacy and security laws, such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, create federal criminal and civil liability for executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Additionally, HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health, or HITECH, and their respective implementing regulations, impose certain requirements relating to the privacy, security, and transmission of individually identifiable health information. 
 In addition, as part of the Affordable Care Act, the federal government enacted the Physician Payment Sunshine Act. Manufacturers of drugs biologics and devices that are reimbursed by Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program are required to annually report to CMS payments and transfers of value made to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors) and teaching hospitals, and ownership or investment interest held by physicians and their family members. Effective January 1, 2022, these reporting obligations extend to include transfers of value made to certain non-physician providers (physician assistants, nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, certified registered nurse anesthetists and anesthesiologist assistants, and certified-nurse midwives).
 Our operations are also subject to compliance with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, which prohibits corporations and individuals from directly or indirectly paying, offering to pay, or authorizing the payment of anything of value to any foreign government official or employee, or any foreign political party or political candidate in an attempt to obtain or retain business or to otherwise influence such official, employee, party or candidate in his or her or its official capacity. Our operations are also subject to compliance with the U.K. Bribery Act of 2010, which applies to activities both in the public and private sector, Canada’s Corruption of Foreign Public Officials Act and similar laws and industry codes in other countries where we do business.
 Other Regulation
 Our present and future business has been and will continue to be subject to various other laws and regulations. Various laws, regulations and recommendations relating to safe working conditions, laboratory practices, the experimental use of animals, and the purchase, storage, movement, import, export, use and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances, including radioactive compounds and infectious disease agents used in connection with our product development, are or may be applicable to our activities.

Recruiting and Retention
 We invest in resources to recruit, develop, and retain the talent needed to achieve our business goals. We believe in supporting our employees to reach their full potential and strive to promote internally. We have been successful in attracting and retaining talented personnel to support our business, though competition for personnel in our industry is intense. 
Compensation and Benefits
 Our compensation packages are designed to attract and retain talent, drive Company performance and achieve business goals. In setting appropriate compensation levels, we look at the average base pay rate for each position based on market data. We also offer an annual cash incentive program and long-term equity incentive plans designed to assist in attracting, retaining, and motivating employees and promoting the creation of long-term value for stockholders. Further, all employees are eligible for health insurance and other health benefits, paid and unpaid leaves, retirement benefits with Company match, and life and disability coverage/insurance. We have an unlimited paid time off policy that provides employees with considerable flexibility in scheduling time away from work.
Health & Safety
 Employee safety and well-being is of paramount importance to us and was of continued focus in 2021 in light of the COVID-19 global pandemic. The Company adjusted its working environment and operations since the onset of the COVID-19 global pandemic to ensure only essential employees, which mainly include our research and development team, worked onsite, and transitioned all non-essential employees to remote work. We equipped our employees working remotely with necessary equipment and tools to continue to collaborate and remain productive. To ensure health and safely of on-site employees, we provided them with necessary personal protective equipment and implemented new safety procedures, including social distancing while in the office, and wearing masks while on site.
 Additionally, we have an Environmental, Health and Safety program that focuses on implementing policies and training programs, as well as performing self-audits to enhance work safety. Importantly, during the COVID-19 pandemic, our continuing focus on safe work practices has enabled us to preserve business continuity without sacrificing our commitment to keeping our colleagues and workplace visitors safe.
