 In this discussion, the terms, “we,” “us,” “our” or the “Company” refer to Emmaus Life Sciences, Inc., and its direct and indirect wholly‑owned subsidiaries.
 On January 7, 2019, we announced our entry into an Agreement and Plan of Merger and Reorganization, dated as of January 4, 2019 (as it may be amended, the “MYnd Merger Agreement”), among Emmaus, MYnd Analytics, Inc. (“Parent” or “MYnd”) and Athena Merger Subsidiary, Inc. (“Merger Sub”), pursuant to which Merger Sub will merge (the “Merger”)   with and into Emmaus, with Emmaus surviving as a subsidiary of Parent. For a discussion of risks and uncertainties relating to the Merger, see “Risk Factors – Risks Relating to the Proposed Merger” in this Annual Report.
 Overview
 We are a commercial-stage biopharmaceutical company engaged in the discovery, development, marketing and sale of innovative treatments and therapies, primarily for rare and orphan diseases and a leader in the treatment of sickle cell disease, or SCD. On July 7, 2017, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, approved our lead product, Endari™ (L-glutamine oral powder), to reduce the acute complications of SCD in adult and pediatric patients five years of age and older.
 We began marketing and selling Endari in the United States in January 2018. Endari is reimbursable by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, and every state provides coverage for Endari for outpatient prescriptions to all eligible Medicaid enrollees within their state Medicaid programs. Additionally, Emmaus has distribution agreements in place with the nation’s leading distributors and pharmacy benefits managers, making Endari available at selected pharmacies nationwide. We realized net revenues from Endari™ sales of $0.7 million, $2.4 million and $4.8 million, respectively, in the first three quarters of 2018. We expect net revenues to continue to increase as we expand our marketing and commercialization efforts in the United States and commence marketing and commercialization outside the United States.
 
In January 2018, we filed with the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, an application for marketing authorization of our L-glutamine oral powder in the European Union, or EU, for treating SCD. We expect the EMA’s decision regarding our application in the third quarter of 2019. If approved, we intend to seek to begin marketing and sale of our product in the EU by the end of 2019.
 
In January 2019, we entered into an exclusive license, supply and exclusive distribution agreement with taiba Healthcare, or taiba, to register, commercialize and distribute Endari™ in certain countries throughout the Middle East and North Africa, or MENA, region.
 
Endari has received Orphan Drug designation from the FDA and Orphan Medicinal designation from the European Commission, or EC, which designations generally afford marketing exclusivity for Endari for a seven-year period in the United 
 4

States and for a ten-year period in the EU, respectively, following marketing approval. Endari also will be entitled to an additional two years of marketing exclusivity in the EU based on Emmaus’ accepted pediatric investigation plan.
 
SCD is a rare, debilitating and lifelong hereditary blood disorder that affects approximately 100,000 patients in the U.S. and up to 25 million patients worldwide, the majority of which are of African descent. Approximately one in every 365 African-American children are born with SCD. FDA approval of Endari was based upon the results of a 48-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center Phase 3 clinical trial evaluating the effects of Endari, as compared to placebo in 230 adults and children with SCD. The results demonstrated that Endari reduced the frequency of sickle cell crises by 25% and hospitalizations by 33%. Additional findings included a 41% decrease in cumulative hospital days and greater than 60% fewer incidents of acute chest syndrome in patients treated with Endari.
 
The safety of Endari was based upon data from 298 patients, 187 treated with Endari and 111 patients treated with placebo in Phase 2 and Phase 3 studies. Endari’s safety profile was similar to placebo, and Endari was well-tolerated in pediatric and adult patients alike. The most common adverse reactions, occurring in more than 10% of patients treated with Endari, were constipation, nausea, headache, abdominal pain, cough, pain in extremity, back pain, and chest pain (non-cardiac).
 
On July 4, 2018, the FDA acknowledged receipt of our investigational new drug application, or IND, for the treatment of diverticulosis using the same pharmaceutical-grade L-glutamine oral powder used in Endari. We subsequently received a “Study May Proceed” letter from the FDA, and in April 2019 we intend to commence a Pilot/Phase 1 study of the safety and efficacy of pharmaceutical-grade L-glutamine oral powder in 10 patients at multiple study sites. The study will evaluate the change in the number and size of colonic diverticula and assess safety.
 
An Emmaus-led team at Los Angeles Biomedical Research Institute, or LA BioMed, an independent non-profit biomedical research organization academically affiliated with the David Geffen School of Medicine at University of California, at Los Angeles that works in partnership with Harbor-UCLA Medical Center, is conducting pre-clinical studies of Cultured Autologous Oral Mucosal Epithelial Cell Sheet, or CAOMECS, technology licensed by us from our strategic partner, CellSeed Inc., a Japanese company, which we refer to as CellSeed. Our lead CAOMECS program is for the treatment of corneal diseases. The development of CAOMECS for treating corneal and other diseases is in the early stages.
 Sickle Cell Disease—Market Overview
 
Sickle cell disease is a genetic blood disorder that affects 20 million - 25 million people worldwide and occurs with increasing frequency among those whose ancestors are from regions including sub-Saharan Africa, South America, the Caribbean, Central America, the Middle East, India and Mediterranean regions such as Turkey, Greece and Italy. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that there are as many as 100,000 patients with SCD in the United States, and we estimate there are approximately 80,000 patients in the EU. In regions such as Central Africa, 90% of patients with SCD die by age five and 99% of patients die by age 20. In all regions, SCD requires ongoing physician care and considerable medical intervention. The overall survival of patients in the United States with sickle cell anemia correlates with the severity of their symptoms, especially the number of crises per year.
 SCD is characterized by the production of an altered form of hemoglobin which polymerizes and becomes fıbrous, causing the red blood cells of patients with SCD to become sickle‑shaped, inflexible and adhesive rather than round, smooth and flexible. The complications associated with SCD occur when these inflexible and sticky cells block, or occlude, small blood vessels, which can then cause severe and chronic pain throughout the body due to insufficient oxygen being delivered to tissue, or ischemia, and inflammation. According to an article in Annals of Internal Medicine, “In the Clinic: Sickle Cell Disease” by M.H. Steinberg (September 2011), which we refer to as the Steinberg Article, this leads to long‑term organ damage, diminished exercise tolerance, increased risk of stroke and infection and decreased lifespan.
 Sickle cell crisis, a broad term covering a range of disorders, is one of the most devastating complications of SCD. Types of sickle cell crisis include:
  
• | Vaso‑occlusive crisis, characterized by obstructed blood flow to organs such as the bones, liver, kidney, eye or central nervous system;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Aplastic crisis, characterized by acute anemia typically due to viral infection;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Hemolytic crisis, characterized by accelerated red blood cell death and hemoglobin loss;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 5

 
• | Splenic sequestration crisis, characterized by painful enlargement of the spleen due to trapped red blood cells; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Acute chest syndrome, a potentially life‑threatening obstruction of blood supply to the lungs characterized by fever, chest pain, cough and lung infiltrates.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 According to the Steinberg Article, acute chest syndrome affects more than half of all patients with SCD and is a common reason for hospitalization. Other symptoms and complications of SCD include swelling of the hands and feet, infections, pneumonia, vision loss, leg ulcers, gallstones and stroke.
 A crisis is characterized by excruciating musculoskeletal pain, visceral pain and pain in other locations. These crises occur periodically throughout the life of a person with SCD. In adults, the acute pain typically persists for five or ten days or longer, followed by a dull, aching pain generally ending only after several weeks and sometimes persisting between crises. According to the Steinberg Article, frequency of sickle cell crises varies within patients with SCD from rare occurrences to occurrences several times a month. Approximately 30% of patients have rare crises, 50% have occasional crises, and 20% have weekly or monthly crises. Crisis frequency tends to increase late in the second decade of life and to decrease after the fourth decade. The overall survival of patients in the United States with sickle cell anemia correlates with the severity of their disease state, especially the number of crises per year.
 Treatment of sickle cell crisis is burdensome and expensive for patients and payors, as it encompasses costs for hospitalization, urgent care and emergency room visits and prescription pain medication. Endari enhances nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (“NAD”) synthesis to reduce excessive oxidative stress in sickle red blood cells that induces much of the damage leading to characteristic symptoms of SCD. We believe that Endari, when taken on a daily basis, will decrease the incidence of sickle cell crisis by restoring the flexibility and function of red blood cells in patients with SCD. We believe that regular use of Endari also will reduce the number of costly hospitalizations of patients with SCD, as well as unexpected urgent care and emergency room visits.
 Limitations of the Current Standard of Care
 The other approved pharmaceutical targeting sickle cell crisis is hydroxyurea, which is available in both generic and branded formulations. Hydroxyurea, a drug originally developed as an anticancer chemotherapeutic agent, has been approved as a once‑daily oral treatment for reducing the frequency of sickle cell crisis and the need for blood transfusions in adult patients with recurrent moderate to severe sickle cell crisis. In December 2017, the FDA granted Addmedica a regular approval to hydroxyurea (Siklos) to reduce the frequency of painful crises and the need for blood transfusions in pediatric patients two years of age and older with sickle cell anemia with recurrent moderate to severe painful crises. While hydroxyurea has been shown to reduce the frequency of sickle cell crisis in some patient groups, it is not suitable for many patients due to significant toxicities and side effects. In particular, hydroxyurea can cause a severe decrease in the number of blood cells in a patient’s bone marrow, which may increase the risk that the patient will develop a serious infection or bleeding, or that the patient will develop certain cancers. Another potential treatment option for SCD, bone marrow transplant, is limited in its use due to the lack of availability of matched donors and the risk of serious complications, including graft versus host disease, infection and potentially death, as well as by its high cost.
 6

Upon onset of sickle cell crisis, the current standard of care is focused on symptom management. Narcotics are typically used for the management of acute pain associated with sickle cell crisis. Pain management often starts with oral medications taken at home at the onset of pain. However, if the pain is not relieved, or if it progresses, patients may seek medical attention in a clinic setting or emergency department. Pain that is not controlled in these settings may require hospitalization for more potent pain medications, typically opioids administered intravenously. The patient must stay in the hospital to receive these intravenous pain medications until the sickle cell crisis resolves and the pain subsides. Other supportive measures during hospitalization include hydration, supplemental oxygen and treatment of any concurrent infections or other conditions.
 According to Hematology in Clinical Practice, by Robert S. Hillman et. al. (5th ed. 2011), sickle cell crisis, once it has started, almost always results in tissue damage at the affected site in the body, increasing the importance of preventative measures. While pain medications can be effective in managing pain during sickle cell crisis, they do not affect or resolve the underlying vascular occlusion, tissue ischemia or potential tissue damage. Additionally, opioid narcotics that are generally prescribed to treat pain can also lead to tissue or organ damage and resulting complications and morbidities, prolonged hospital stays and associated continuation of pain and suffering. Given the duration and frequency of sickle cell crises, addiction to these opioid narcotics is also a significant concern.
 Endari, our Solution for SCD
 We believe Endari may provide a safe and effective means for reducing the frequency of sickle cell crisis in patients with SCD and the need for costly hospital stays or treatment with pain medications such as opioid narcotics. Published academic research identifies L-glutamine as a precursor to NAD, which is the major molecule that regulates and prevents oxidative damage in red blood cells. Several published studies have identified that sickle red blood cells have a significantly increased rate of transport of glutamine, which appears to be driven by the cells’ need to promote NAD synthesis, protecting against the oxidative damage and thereby leading to further improvement in their regulation of oxidative stress. In turn this made sickle red blood cells less adhesive to cells of the interior wall of blood vessels. This implied that there is decreased chance of blockage of blood vessels especially the small ones. In summary, improved regulation of oxidative stress appears to lead to less obstruction or blockage of small blood vessels, thereby alleviating a major cause of the problems that patients with SCD face.
 In December 2013, we completed a Phase 3 prospective, randomized, double blind, placebo controlled, parallel group multicenter clinical trial to measure, over a 48-week time frame, as its primary outcome, the reduction in the number of occurrences of sickle cell crises experienced by patients in the trial. All participants other than those who received placebo, including children, received up to 30 grams of Endari daily, dissolved in liquid, split between morning and evening—the same dosage as our Phase 2 clinical trial completed in 2009. Patients were randomized to the study treatment using a 2:1 ratio of Endari to placebo. The randomization was stratified by investigational site and hydroxyurea usage.
 
The clinical trial evaluated the efficacy and safety of Endari in 230 patients (5 to 58 years of age) with sickle cell anemia or sickle β°-thalassemia who had 2 or more painful crises within 12 months prior to enrollment. Eligible patients stabilized on hydroxyurea for at least 3 months continued their therapy throughout the study. The trial excluded patients who had received blood products within 3 weeks, had renal insufficiency or uncontrolled liver disease, or were pregnant (or planning pregnancy) or lactating. Study patients received Endari or placebo for a treatment duration of 48 weeks followed by 3 weeks of tapering.
 
Efficacy was demonstrated by a reduction in the number of sickle cell crises through Week 48 and prior to the start of tapering among patients that received Endari compared to patients who received placebo. A sickle cell crisis was defined as a visit to an emergency room/medical facility for sickle cell disease-related pain which was treated with a parenterally administered narcotic or parenterally administered ketorolac. In addition, the occurrence of chest syndrome, priapism, and splenic sequestration were considered sickle cell crises. Treatment with Endari also resulted in fewer hospitalizations due to sickle cell pain at Week 48, fewer cumulative days in hospital and a lower incidence of acute chest syndrome.

Figure 1. Recurrent Event Time for Sickle Cell Crises by Treatment Group


Endari was studied in 2 placebo-controlled clinical trials (a phase 3 study, n=230 and a phase 2 study, n=70). In these trials, patients with sickle cell anemia or sickle β0-thalassemia were randomized to receive Endari (n=187) or placebo (n=111) orally twice daily for 48 weeks followed by 3 weeks of tapering. Both studies included pediatric and adult patients (5-58 years of age) and 54% were female. The majority of patients were black (97.3%), had a diagnosis of sickle cell anemia (89.9%) and were receiving hydroxyurea at baseline (63.4%). 
 
Treatment discontinuation due to adverse reactions was reported in 2.7% (n=5) of patients receiving Endari. These adverse reactions included one case each of hypersplenism, abdominal pain, dyspepsia, burning sensation, and hot flash.
 
Serious adverse reactions were reported in both treatment groups, more frequently in the placebo group, and were consistent with the underlying disease.
 
Three deaths (3/187=1.6%) occurred during the study in the Endari treatment group as compared to none in the placebo treatment group. None of the deaths were considered to be related to Endari treatment. Adverse reactions occurring in greater than 10% of patients treated with Endari are shown in Table 2 below.

 Commercialization and Distribution
 Endari is marketed in the United States by our contract sales organization. Our primary target physicians are Hematologists who specialize in sickle cell disease located in Sickle Cell Treatment centers as well as community-based Hematologists.
 
Endari is distributed to a limited number of hospitals and several hundred pharmacies via our specialty distributors. AmerisourceBergen, McKesson Plasma and Biologics and Cardinal Specialty.
 
Our combined sales to each of two distributors, AmerisourceBergen Specialty Group and McKesson Plasma and Biologics LLC, accounted for more than 10% of total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2018. On a combined basis, these distributors accounted for approximately 90% of our product sales in 2018, with other distributors and specialty pharmacies making up the remainder.
 Sales and Marketing Plans for Endari
 
Since FDA approval of Endari, we have focused our efforts on building a sales and marketing force through a contract sales organization (CSO) to commercialize Endari in the United States. Our sales and marketing efforts are targeted across several different groups, including patients, physicians, health care providers, hospitals, treatment centers, insurance carriers, nonprofit associations, and potentially, collaborations with other pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies. Our in-house product specialists and our CSO sales representatives will focus on:


• | promote Endari to hematologist /oncologists and key opinion leaders in the area of SCD;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | starting with our 31 Phase 3 clinical trial sites, promote awareness of Endari at all United States community‑based treatment centers;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | develop collateral materials and informational packets about Endari to educate patients and physicians and garner industry support;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | establish collaborative relationships with nonprofit organizations and patient advocacy groups that focus on SCD; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | identify potential licensees and other international opportunities to commercialize Endari, if approved by foreign regulatory authorities.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 In January 2019, we entered into an exclusive license, supply and distribution agreement with taiba to register, commercialize and distribute Endari in certain countries throughout the MENA region. Under the terms of the agreement, Emmaus will be entitled to specified milestones payments and a high, double-digit royalty based upon net sales of Endari in the region. All costs for commercialization in the territory will be borne by taiba, which has its own distribution network in all Gulf Cooperation Council countries, with a regional office in Dubai and headquarters in Oman.
 
Diverticulosis
 
9

Diverticulosis, or the presence of colonic diverticula (i.e., pouches in the colon wall), is very common in industrialized nations, with its prevalence increasing with age. An estimated 40% of 60-year olds and 70% of 80-year olds have diverticulosis. Of these patients, 10% to 25% are expected to develop diverticulitis, the advancement of peridiverticular inflammation and infection, resulting in abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, constipation, diarrhea, fever, and leukocytosis.
 
The pathogenesis of diverticulosis is believed to result from structural abnormalities of the colonic wall, disordered motility and low fiber diets. L-glutamine, a well-known and readily absorbed key intestinal nutrient, has yet to be investigated in the treatment of diverticulosis. However, relationships between glutamine and intestinal physiology have been extensively studied in inflammatory bowel diseases (i.e., ulcerative colitis, Crohn’s disease), short bowel syndrome and as a nutritional therapy for critical illnesses. Overall, glutamine elicits the following mechanisms of action within intestinal cells; promotion of enterocyte proliferation, regulation of tight junction proteins; suppression of pro-inflammatory signaling pathways; suppression of intestinal cell apoptosis and cellular stress; and microbiome regulation. Glutamine also helps to maintain intestinal tissue integrity through various signaling to pathways.
 In April 2019, we intend to commence a Pilot/Phase 1 study of the safety and efficacy of pharmaceutical-grade L-glutamine oral powder in 10 patients at multiple study sites. The study will evaluate the change in the number and size of colonic diverticula and assess safety.
 CellSeed Collaboration
 In June 2016, we entered into a non-exclusive agreement with the Japanese company, CellSeed, Inc. (“CellSeed”), and Dr. Kohji Nishida of the Graduate School of Medicine, Osaka University, Japan, for the development of Cultured Autologous Oral Mucosal Epithelial Cell Sheet (“CAOMECS”) for the treatment of corneal impairments in the United States. Under the agreement, we will be required to pay a single-digit royalty based upon net sales of the technology.
 
A cell sheet is a composite of cells grown and harvested in an intact sheet, rather than as individual cells. These cell sheets can be used for tissue transplantation or to engineer complex multilayer cell sheets composed of different types of cells. CellSeed’s technology involves culturing cells on a surface coated with the poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) temperature responsive polymer. The thinness of this polymer coating is measured at the nanometer scale. The cells cultured on this polymer can be harvested intact as a composite stratified cell sheet to transplant it precisely on the cornea. Using a patient’s own oral mucosal epithelial cells, we are working toward being able to grow and harvest a cell sheet for directly transplanting onto the cornea of the patient’s affected eye to repair the damaged cornea.
 
An Emmaus-led team at LA BioMed has been conducting preclinical studies on corneal cell sheet technology. Our lead CAOMECS program is for treatment of corneal diseases. CAOMECS products are in preclinical development and have not been approved for marketing in the United States or any jurisdiction. The development of therapeutic products based on this cell sheet technology is in its early stages.
 Research and Development
 We spent $1.7 million and $2.8 million, respectively, in 2018 and 2017 on research and development. None of these costs are borne or sponsored by our customers.
 Raw Materials and Manufacturing
 Our SCD treatment uses pharmaceutical grade L‑glutamine (“PGLG”), which differs from non‑pharmaceutical grade L‑glutamine available as a nutritional supplement. There are limited suppliers from which we can obtain PGLG for the manufacturing of Endari and our other PGLG product candidates.
 We currently obtain all of our PGLG, directly or indirectly, from Ajinomoto Health and Nutrition North America, Inc. (“Ajinomoto”), a subsidiary of Ajinomoto North American Holdings, Inc., a food, amino acid and pharmaceutical company. We believe that Ajinomoto produces the majority of the PGLG approved for sale in the United States.
 Ajinomoto provided PGLG to us free of charge for our clinical trials of Endari, including our Phase 3 trial. In return, we have agreed to purchase from Ajinomoto substantially all of our commercial needs for PGLG, subject to certain exceptions. We have no long-term supply agreement with Ajinomoto.
 
On June 12, 2017, we entered into an API supply agreement with Telcon RF Pharmaceutical, Inc. (formerly, Telcon, Inc.), a South Korea-based company, or Telcon, pursuant to which Telcon paid us approximately ₩36.0 billion KRW (approximately $31.8 million USD) in consideration of the right to supply 25% of our requirements for bulk containers of 
 10

PGLG for a 15-year term. On July 12, 2017, we entered into a raw material supply agreement with Telcon which revised certain terms of the API supply agreement, which we refer to as the revised API agreement. The revised API agreement is effective for a term of five years with 10 one-year renewal periods. In the revised API agreement, we have agreed to purchase a total of 940,000 kilograms of PGLG at a fixed price of $50 per kilogram, or a total of $47.0 million, over the 15-year term of the agreement. In September 2018, we entered into an agreement with Ajinomoto and Telcon to permit Telcon to purchase L-glutamine from Ajinomoto for resale to us under the API agreement.
 
On October 15, 2018, EJ Holdings, Inc., a Japanese corporation which is 40% owned by Emmaus, announced that it had entered into an acquisition agreement with Kyowa Hakko Bio Co. Ltd., or Kyowa, a subsidiary of Kyowa Hakko Kirin Co., Ltd., to purchase Kyowa’s facility in Ube, Japan, for the manufacture of L-glutamine and other amino acids. The acquisition is expected to occur in or about December 2019, subject to the facility being compliant with current Good Manufacturing Practices, cGMP and other applicable regulatory requirements and customary closing conditions. Under the agreement, Kyowa will refurbish the plant at its expense and cooperate with us in ensuring cGMP compliance. If the acquisition is completed, we expect to enter into a long-term agreement with EJ Holdings, Inc. for the supply of L-glutamine.
 
Endari and any other commercial products we develop must be packaged by a facility that meets FDA requirements for cGMP. Packaging Coordinators, Inc. of Rockville, Illinois, has been approved by the FDA for packaging our commercial supplies of Endari. Previous compliance with cGMP requirements for the packaging of pharmaceutical products, however, does not guarantee the ability to maintain cGMP compliance for the packaging of pharmaceutical products in the future.
   Competition
 The biopharmaceutical industry is highly competitive and subject to rapid and significant technological change. While we believe that our development experience and scientific knowledge provide us with competitive advantages, we face potential competition from both large and small pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions, governmental agencies (such as the National Institutes of Health) and public and private research institutions. In comparison to us, many of the entities against whom we are competing, or against whom we may compete in the future, have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing approved products. Smaller or early stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. 
 Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries may result in increasing concentration of resources among a smaller number of our competitors. These competitors compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel and establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our product development programs.
 Any product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with existing therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future. The key competitive factors affecting the success of each of our product candidates, if approved, are likely to be their safety, efficacy, convenience, price, the level of proprietary and generic competition, and the availability of coverage and reimbursement from government and other third‑party payors. Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer or more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, or are more convenient or less expensive than any products that we may develop. Our competitors may also obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours, which could result in their establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market.
 Sickle Cell Disease
 Endari is approved as a therapy to reduce the acute complications of SCD in adult and pediatric patients 5 years of age and older. The other approved drug targeting a reduction in the frequency of sickle cell crisis is hydroxyurea, which is available in both generic and branded formulations. While hydroxyurea has been shown to reduce the frequency of sickle cell crisis in some patient groups, it is not suitable for all patients because it can have significant toxicities and side effects. In December 2017, the FDA granted Addmedica approval for hydroxyurea (Siklos) to reduce the frequency of painful crises and the need for blood transfusions in pediatric patients 2 years of age and older with sickle cell anemia with recurrent moderate to severe painful crises.
 
There is a high level of interest in SCD and we understand several academic centers and pharmaceutical companies are researching new treatments and therapies for SCD. There are studies underway testing different compounds that target various 
 11

aspects of SCD pathophysiology. We are aware of two studies targeting the reduction or duration of vaso occlusive crisis events in patients with SCD which are currently in Phase 3 clinical trials sponsored by Global Blood Therapeutics and Pfizer Inc. In addition, Global Blood Therapeutics is expected to seek accelerated approval. Novartis has completed a Phase 2 trial and is expected to file for FDA approval in 2019. Ironwood Pharmaceuticals is conducting a Phase 2 trial.
 
We are also aware of efforts to develop cures for SCD through approaches such as bone marrow transplant and gene therapy. Although bone marrow transplant is currently available for SCD patients, its use is limited by the lack of availability of matched donors and by the risk of serious complications, including graft versus host disease and infection. Attempts to develop a cure through gene therapy remain at an early stage, but if these attempts were to succeed and receive regulatory approval, it could adversely affect the market for Endari.
 Endari may compete with non-prescription grade L-glutamine, which is widely available as a dietary supplement at  substantially lower prices than Endari. Dietary supplements may be marketed without FDA approval, are generally not reimbursed by payors and are not subject to the rigorous quality control standards required by regulatory authorities for prescription drug products. Also, unlike prescription drug products, manufacturers of dietary supplements may not make claims that the supplements will cure, mitigate, treat or prevent disease, and we are not aware of any reports in peer-reviewed literature regarding the effectiveness of L-glutamine supplements in treating SCD in controlled clinical trials.
 


Oral Mucosa Epithelial Cell Sheet
 The development of regenerative medicine products using CAOMECS technology is in the early stages. Although there are many academic centers and biotechnology companies working on regenerative medicine in various fields, we are not aware of any treatments using cell sheet technology that have been approved by the FDA. However, we are aware of academic centers and biotechnology companies that are researching stem cells in various forms, including in cell sheets, with potential applications for the treatment of Limbal Stem Cell deficiency (“LSCD”), a corneal disease.
 For example, academic centers outside the United States researching the transplantation of cells as a treatment for LSCD are using corneal cells to reverse the LSCD. The Centre Hospitalier National d’Ophtalmologie des Quinze Vingts located in Paris, France, who we believe is conducting Phase 2 clinical trials evaluating the survivability of transplanted epithelium, is using limbal stem cells cultured on amniotic membrane to graft the sheet on the patient’s eyes. Such approach is used by different centers around the world such as Royan Institute Teheran (Clinical Trial Phase 2) in Islamic Republic of Iran), the Hospital San Raffaele (Clinical Trail Phase 4) in Milan, Italy, and the Centre Universitaire d'Ophtalmologie CHU de Québec (Clinical Trial Phase 2) in Quebec, Canada. The limitation of this approach is that it can be used when only one cornea is LSCD. We believe the Instituto Universitario de Oftalmobiología Aplicada located in Valladolid, Spain has completed Phase 2 clinical trials looking at the viability and safety of mesenchymal stem cell transplants, but the study results are not published. For all these studies, another limiting factor is the limited access to amniotic membrane. We are also aware of Holostem Terapie Avanzate, an Italian biotechnological company, who we believe is working with autologous cultures of limbal stem cells for corneal regeneration and restoration of visual acuity in patients with severe corneal chemical and thermal burns associated with total unilateral or severe bilateral LSCD. Holostem Terapie Avanzate has received conditional marketing approval from the European Commission for its therapy based on autologous stem cells for patients with severe cornea damage.
 To overcome the use of limbal stem cells and amniotic membrane, others academic centers are using the oral mucosal epithelial cells (“OMECS”) to engineer cell sheet to be grafted on the LSCD patient’s eyes. For example, the Chang Gung Memorial Hospital in South Korea, the He Eye Hospital in China, and the Adisak Wongkajornsilp, Siriraj Hospital in Thailand are conducting phase 2 trial, using the OMECS to reverse the LSCD disease, but the study results are still not available. No clinical trials in the United States was reported using the OMECS or limbal stem cells to reverse the LSCD.
 Currently, the treatment of LSCD patients varies based on the severity of the LSCD. This treatment may include the use of non-invasive procedures such as autologous serum drops, therapeutic scleral lens, corneal scrapping, to more invasive surgical procedures such as limbal stem cells or oral mucosal stem cells graft. In more severe LSCD cases, the treatment plan will include surgery. The initial surgical interventions include management of eyelid positioning with speculum, insertion of punctual plugs into the openings in the eye that allows tears to maintain the eye wet, prior to considering transplantation of healthy limbal tissue or using cultured cells such as CAOMECS. The source of the transplanted tissue can be from the patient’s own cells from their healthy eye, matched living donors, or cadavers. Similar to other transplantations, there is the risk of serious complications, including graft versus host disease when not using the patient’s own tissue or induction of 
 12

LSCD on the healthy donor eye. For these reasons, oral mucosal epithelial cells were used as an alternative source of cells to reverse the LSCD phenotype. The use of oral mucosal epithelial cells overcomes the risk of rejection but also, in the case of LSCD on both eyes, helps to have a source of cells to engineer corneal cell sheets to be transplanted on LSCD patients’ corneas.
 In regenerative medicine and cell‑based therapy, cell transplantation success not only depends on the cells, but also on the carrier/scaffold used, as it is not possible to graft separate cells in a single cell suspension solution. Biodegradable polymers were the key technology for the first generation of cell therapy. Tremendous efforts have been made since to develop biofilms and acellular matrix. For example, cell sheet carriers can be classified in different categories such as biodegradable chemical products such as Siloxane hydrogel and poly(lactide-co-glycolide), blood products (Platelet Poor Plasma), and natural proteins such as Keratin and Fibrin. The development of cell sheet carriers increases the efficacy of the treatment because the cells are delivered precisely to the target site. However, the risks of infection due to blood products or biomaterials cannot be completely denied. It has been repeatedly reported that decomposition of biodegradable transplanted scaffolds used for cell transplantations caused inflammation, foreign body reaction, and cell damage. The use of an innovative temperature‑responsive culture surface vessel technology eliminates these issues and, for the first time, offers the possibility to culture and engineer any type of cell sheets to safely transplant cell sheets to target organs for regenerative purpose, drug delivery, or tissue replacement. The poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) polymer used to engineer temperature‑responsive culture surface vessel allows to detach the biological tissue from the vessels, by lowering the temperature under 32oC. These poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) polymer do not contaminate the biological tissue during the cell sheet harvesting step, eliminating the risk of inflammation due to foreign bodies.
 This cell‑sheet‑based regenerative medicine technology is advanced, simple and has already shown dramatic results in pilot studies in Japan and Europe. For example, oral mucosal epithelial cells were used with success in human studies of 4 eyes of 4 patients at the Osaka University Medical School in Osaka (Japan), and the Hôpital Edouard Herriot in Lyon (France) used this cell sheet technology on 26 eyes of 25 patients, combined with the innovative temperature responsive culture surface vessel technology. An important feature of this novel and innovative cell sheet therapy is that harvested cell sheets retain intact basal membranes and intact extracellular matrix (fibronectin, laminin, collagen type IV), eliminating the inherent risks of suture during transplantation. Another innovative feature of this cell sheet therapy is that it makes possible to layer different types of cell sheets, by harvesting the cell sheet without harmful enzymes use (trypsin or dispase) that may damage the cell‑based therapeutic potential.
 This technology has the unique potential to construct in vitro stratified tissue equivalents by alternately layering different harvested cell sheets to provide regenerated tissue architectures. This novel technique thus holds promise for the study of cell‑cell communications and angiogenesis in reconstructed, three‑dimensional environments, as well as for tissues engineering with complex, multicellular architectures, and finally for drug-screening.
 Government Regulation
 The FDA and the EC have granted L-glutamine Orphan Drug designation and Orphan Medicinal designation, respectively, for the treatment of SCD.
 
Orphan Drug Designation. The FDA has authority under the U.S. Orphan Drug Act to grant Orphan Drug designation to a drug or biological product intended to treat a rare disease or condition. This law defines a rare disease or condition generally as one that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more than 200,000 individuals in the United States and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of the development and distribution of the orphan product in the United States will be recovered from sales of the product. Being granted Orphan Drug designation provides tax benefits to mitigate expenses of developing the orphan product. More importantly, Orphan Drug designation provides seven years of market exclusivity if the product receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it was granted such designation and the indication for which approval is granted matches the indication for which Orphan Drug designation was granted. During the seven-year exclusivity period, Orphan Drug exclusivity precludes FDA approval of a marketing application for the same product for the same indication. Orphan Drug exclusivity is limited and will not preclude the FDA from approving the same product for the same indication if the same product is shown to be clinically superior to the product previously granted exclusivity. For example, if the same product for the same indication is shown to have significantly fewer side effects, the FDA may approve the second product despite the Orphan Drug exclusivity granted to the first product. In addition, a product that is the same as the orphan product may receive approval for a different indication (whether orphan or not) during the exclusivity period of the orphan product. Also, Orphan Drug market exclusivity will not bar a different product intended to treat the same orphan disease or condition from obtaining its own Orphan Drug designation and Orphan Drug exclusivity.
 
13

Orphan Drug status in the EU has similar benefits, including a 10-year marketing exclusivity period following marketing authorization.
 
505(b)(2) Applications.  Under Section 505(b)(2) of the FD&C Act, a person may submit a NDA for which one or more of the clinical studies relied upon by the applicant for approval were not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant does not have a right of reference or use from the person by or for whom the clinical studies were conducted. Instead, a 505(b)(2) applicant may rely on published literature containing the specific information (e.g., clinical trials, animal studies) necessary to obtain approval of the application. The 505(b)(2) applicant may also rely on the FDA’s finding of safety and/or effectiveness of a drug previously approved by the FDA when the applicant does not own or otherwise have the right to access the data in that previously approved application. The 505(b)(2) pathway to market thus allows an applicant to submit to the FDA a NDA without having to conduct its own studies to obtain data that are already documented in published reports or previously submitted NDAs. In addition to relying on safety data from our previously approved drug product, NutreStore, we intend to take advantage of the 505(b)(2) pathway to the extent published literature will further support our new drug marketing application.
 
Regulation by United States and foreign governmental authorities is a significant factor in the development, manufacture and expected marketing of our product candidates and in our ongoing research and development activities. The nature and extent to which such regulation will apply to us will vary depending on the nature of the product candidates we seek to develop.
 
In particular, human therapeutic products, such as drugs, biologics and cell-based therapies, are subject to rigorous preclinical and clinical testing and other preapproval requirements of the FDA and similar regulatory authorities in other countries. Various federal and state statutes and regulations govern and influence pre- and post-approval requirements related to research, testing, manufacturing, labeling, packaging, storage, distribution and record keeping of such products to ensure the safety and effectiveness for their intended uses. The process of obtaining marketing approval and ensuring post approval compliance with the FD&C Act for drugs and biologics (and applicable provisions of the Public Health Service Act for biologics), and the regulations promulgated thereunder, and other applicable federal and state statutes and regulations, requires substantial time and financial resources. Any failure by us or our collaborators to obtain, or any delay in obtaining, marketing approval could adversely affect the marketing of any of our product candidates, our ability to receive product revenues, and our liquidity and capital resources.
 
The manufacture of these products is subject to cGMP regulations. The FDA inspects manufacturing facilities for compliance with cGMP regulations before deciding whether to approve a product candidate for marketing.
 The steps required by the FDA before a new product, such as a drug, biologic or cell-based therapy, may be marketed in the United States include:
 
 
● | completion of preclinical studies (during this stage, the treatment is called a development candidate);


● | the submission to the FDA of a proposal for the design of a clinical trial program for studying in humans the safety and effectiveness of the product candidate. This submission is referred to as a IND. The FDA reviews the IND to ensure it adequately protects the safety and rights of trial participants and that the design of the studies are adequate to permit an evaluation of the product candidate’s safety and effectiveness. The IND becomes effective within thirty days after the FDA receives the IND, unless the FDA notifies the sponsor that the investigations described in the IND are deficient and cannot begin;


● | the conduct of adequate and well controlled clinical trials, usually completed in three phases, to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of the product candidate for its intended use;


● | the submission to the FDA of a marketing application, a NDA, if the product candidate is a drug, that provides data and other information to demonstrate the product is safe and effective for its intended use (“BLA”), if the product candidate is a biologic that provides data and other information to demonstrate that the product candidate is safe, pure, and potent; and


● | the review and approval of the NDA or BLA by the FDA before the product candidate may be distributed commercially as a product.

 
In addition to obtaining FDA approval for each product candidate before we can market it as a product, the manufacturing establishment from which we obtain it must be registered and is subject to periodic FDA post approval inspections to ensure continued compliance with cGMP requirements. If, as a result of these inspections, the FDA determines 
 14

that any equipment, facilities, laboratories, procedures or processes do not comply with applicable FDA regulations and the conditions of the product approval, the FDA may seek civil, criminal, or administrative sanctions and/or remedies against us, including the suspension of the manufacturing operations, recalls, the withdrawal of approval and debarment. Manufacturers must expend substantial time, money and effort in the area of production, quality assurance and quality control to ensure compliance with these standards.
 
Preclinical testing includes laboratory evaluation of the safety of a product candidate and characterization of its formulation. Preclinical testing is subject to Good Laboratory Practice (“GLP”) regulations. Preclinical testing results are submitted to the FDA as a part of an IND which must become effective prior to commencement of clinical trials. Clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases following submission of an IND. In Phase 1, the product candidate under investigation (and therefore often called an investigational product) is initially administered to a small group of humans, either patients or healthy volunteers, primarily to test for safety (e.g., to identify any adverse effects), dosage tolerance, absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion and clinical pharmacology, and, if possible, to gain early evidence of effectiveness. In Phase 2, a slightly larger sample of patients who have the condition or disease for which the investigational product is being studied receive the investigational product to assess the effectiveness of the investigational product, to determine dose tolerance and the optimal dose range, and to gather additional information relating to safety and potential adverse effects. If the data show the investigational product may be effective and has an acceptable safety profile in the targeted patient population, Phase 3 studies, also referred to as pivotal studies or enabling studies, are initiated to further establish clinical safety and provide substantial evidence of the effectiveness of the investigational product in a broader sample of the general patient population, to determine the overall risk benefit ratio of the investigational product, and provide an adequate basis for physician and patient labeling. During all clinical studies, Good Clinical Practice (“GCP”) standards and applicable human subject protection requirements must be followed. The results of the research and product development, manufacturing, preclinical studies, clinical studies, and related information are submitted in a NDA or BLA to the FDA.
 
The process of completing clinical testing and obtaining FDA approval for a new therapeutic product, such as a drug, biologic or cell-based product, is likely to take a number of years and require the expenditure of substantial resources. If a NDA or BLA is submitted, there can be no assurance that the FDA will file, review, and approve it. Even after initial FDA approval has been obtained, post market studies could be required to provide additional data on safety or effectiveness. Additional pivotal studies would be required to support adding other indications to the labeling. Also, the FDA will require post market reporting and could require specific surveillance or risk mitigation programs to monitor for known and unknown side effects of the product. Results of post marketing programs could limit or expand the continued marketing of the product. Further, if there are any modifications to the product, including changes in indication, manufacturing process, labeling, or the location of the manufacturing facility, a NDA or BLA supplement would generally be required to be submitted to the FDA prior to or corresponding with that change, or for minor changes in the periodic safety update report that must be submitted annually to the FDA.
 
The rate of completion of any clinical trial depends upon, among other factors, sufficient patient enrollment and retention. Patient enrollment is a function of many factors, including the size of the patient population, the nature of the trial, the number of clinical sites, the availability of alternative therapies, the proximity of patients to clinical sites, and the eligibility and exclusion criteria for the trial. Delays in planned patient enrollment might result in increased costs and delays. Patient retention could be affected by patient noncompliance, adverse events, or any change in circumstances making the patient no longer eligible to remain in the trial.
 
Failure to adhere to regulatory requirements for the protection of human subjects, to ensure the integrity of data, other IND requirements, and GCP standards in conducting clinical trials could cause the FDA to place a “clinical hold” on one or more studies of a product candidate, which would stop the studies and delay or preclude further data collection necessary for product approval. Noncompliance with GCP standards would also have a negative impact on the FDA’s evaluation of a NDA or BLA. If at any time the FDA finds that a serious question regarding data integrity has been raised due to the appearance of a wrongful act, such as fraud, bribery or gross negligence, the FDA may invoke its Application Integrity Policy (“AIP”) under which it could immediately suspend review of any pending NDA or BLA or refuse to accept the submission of a NDA or BLA as filed, require the sponsor to validate data, require additional clinical studies, disapprove a pending NDA or BLA or withdraw approval of marketed products, as well as require corrective and preventive action to ensure data integrity in future submissions. Significant noncompliance with IND regulations could result in the FDA not only refusing to accept a NDA or BLA as filed but could also result in enforcement actions, including civil and administrative actions, civil money penalties, criminal prosecution, criminal fines and debarment. Whether or not FDA approval has been obtained, approval of a product by regulatory authorities in foreign countries must be obtained prior to the commencement of marketing the product in those countries.
 The requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials and product approvals vary widely from country to country, and the time required for approval might be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval. Although there are some procedures for unified filings for some European countries, in general, each country at this time has its own procedures and requirements.
 15


In most cases, if the FDA has not approved a product candidate for sale in the United States, the unapproved product may be exported to any country in the world for clinical trial or sale if it meets U.S. export requirements and has marketing authorization in any listed country without submitting an export request to the FDA or receiving FDA approval to export the product, as long as the product meets the regulatory requirements of the country to which the product is being exported. Listed countries include each member nation in the European Union or the European Economic Area, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Japan, Israel, Switzerland and South Africa. If an unapproved product is not approved in one of the listed countries, the unapproved product may be exported directly to an unlisted country if the product meets the requirements of the regulatory authority of that country, and the FDA determines that the foreign country has statutory or regulatory requirements similar or equivalent to the United States.
 
In addition to the regulatory framework for product approvals, we and our collaborative partners must comply with federal, state and local laws and regulations regarding occupational safety, laboratory practices, the use, handling and disposition of radioactive materials, environmental protection and hazardous substance control, and other local, state, federal and foreign regulation. All facilities and manufacturing processes used by third parties to produce our product candidates for clinical use in the United States and our products for commercialization must be in compliance with cGMP requirements and are subject to periodic regulatory inspections. The failure of third-party manufacturers to comply with applicable regulations could extend, delay or cause the termination of clinical trials conducted for our product candidates or the withdrawal of our products from the market. The impact of government regulation upon us cannot be predicted and could be material and adverse. We cannot accurately predict the extent of government regulation that might result from future legislation or administrative action.
 Patents, Proprietary Rights and Know‑How
 
Our success will depend in part on our ability to obtain patents and otherwise preserve the intellectual property rights relating to the design, operation, sale and distribution of our products. We intend to seek patents on our products when we deem it commercially appropriate. The process of seeking patent protection can be lengthy and expensive, and there can be no assurance that patents will be issued for currently pending or future applications or that our existing patents or any new patents issued will be of sufficient scope or strength or provide meaningful protection or any commercial advantage to us. We may be subject to, or may initiate, litigation or patent office interference proceedings, which may require significant financial and management resources. The failure to obtain necessary licenses or other rights or the advent of litigation arising out of any such intellectual property claims could have a material adverse effect on our operations.
 
We have relied to date on a combination of patent licenses, trademark rights, trade secret protection, distribution agreements, manufacturing agreements, manufacturing capability and other unpatented proprietary information to protect our intellectual property rights. While we do not currently own any issued patents directed to the treatment of sickle cell anemia, we do own issued patents and patent applications directed to the treatment of diverticulosis, diabetes and hypertriglyceridemia. We furthermore have Orphan Drug market exclusivity for the treatment of sickle cell anemia with Endari in the United States (through July 7, 2024) and in the EU (ten years from the approval date, if approved).
 
We also rely on employee agreements to protect the proprietary nature of our products. We require that our officers and key employees enter into confidentiality agreements that require these officers and employees to assign to us the rights to any inventions developed by them during the course of their employment with us. All of the confidentiality agreements include non-solicitation provisions that remain effective during the course of employment and for periods following termination of employment.
 Patents
 
We have issued patents related to compositions including PGLG and methods involving administration of PGLG for the treatment of diverticulosis in the United States, Japan, Australia, Mexico, China, Indonesia, Korea and Russia. A patent application related to the same subject matter has been allowed in the United States, and associated patent applications are currently pending in the United States, the EU, Brazil, India, Korea and Russia.
 
A patent directed to compositions for decreasing HbA1C levels in individuals who are shown to have average blood sugar levels in the diabetic range has issued in Japan. Associated applications are currently pending in the United States, Europe, Brazil, India, the Philippines, China and Indonesia, and a patent application directed to the treatment of hypertriglyceridemia is pending in Japan.
 16

HbA1C levels are one of the best indicators of whether diabetics and prediabetics have blood sugar levels under control, through therapeutic application of L-glutamine. Diabetes is a chronic disease that occurs when the pancreas is no longer able to make insulin, or when the body cannot make good use of the insulin it produces. People with diabetes have an increased risk of developing a number of serious health problems including cardiovascular disease, kidney failure and blindness. Japan has more than 7 million diagnosed cases of diabetes, which represents about 7.6% of Japanese between the ages of 20 and 79. According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, there are an estimated 29 million Americans living with diabetes and an estimated 86 million Americans with prediabetes, a serious health condition that can increase a person’s risk of developing type 2 diabetes.
 Licenses and Promotional Rights Agreements
 In June 2016, we entered into a non‑exclusive agreement with CellSeed and Dr. Kohji Nishida for the development of CAOMECS technology. Under this license agreement, we are required to pay royalties upon commercialization. The royalties to be paid are based on net sales per annum.
Trademarks
 We currently own U.S. trademark registrations for “Emmaus Medical” and “Endari” and were recently granted a trademark registration for “Xyndari” (as Endari will be marketed if approved) in the EU. This joint proxy statement/prospectus also contains trademarks, service marks, trade names and copyrights of other companies, which are the property of their respective owners. Solely for convenience, trademarks and trade names referred to in this joint proxy statement/prospectus may appear without the® or TM symbols, but such references are not intended to indicate, in any way, that we will not assert, to the fullest extent under applicable law, our rights or the right of the applicable licensor to these trademarks and trade names.
Facilities
 We lease office space under operating leases from unrelated entities. The rent expense for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 amounted to $668,620 and $563,382, respectively.
 We lease 13,734 square feet of office space for our headquarters in Torrance, California, at a base rental of $48,087 per month. In December 2018, we have entered into an amended lease to expand our headquarter by an additional 7,559 square feet commencing June 1, 2019. The base monthly rent for this additional space of $27,590 will be payable commencing January 1, 2020. The amended lease will expire on February 29, 2026. We also lease an additional 1,600 square feet office space in Torrance, California, at a base rent of $2,240 per month and 2,986 square feet office space in New York, New York, at a base rent of $5,500, which leases will expire on January 31, 2020 and December 30, 2019, respectively.
 In addition, we lease 1,322 square feet of office space in Tokyo, Japan, and 465 square feet of office space in Seoul, Korea, which leases will expire on September 30, 2020 and on November 29, 2019, respectively.
 We believe our existing facilities are adequate for our operations at this time and we expect to be able to renew the office lease for our headquarters on commercially reasonable terms. In the event we determine that we require additional space to accommodate expansion of our operations, we believe suitable facilities will be available in the future on commercially reasonable terms as needed.
 Employees
 As of December 31, 2018, we had 31 employees, 28 of whom are full time, and we retained six consultants. We have not experienced any work stoppages and we consider our relations with our employees to be good.
Corporate Information
 We were organized as Orphan Drugs International, LLC on December 20, 2000 and changed our name to Emmaus Medical, LLC in March 2002. In October 2003, we undertook a merger reorganization with Emmaus Medical, Inc., which was originally incorporated in September 2003.
