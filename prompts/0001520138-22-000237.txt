ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Company Overview
 
FingerMotion (FingerMotion or the Company) The Company is a mobile data specialist company incorporated in Delaware, USA, with its head office located at 1460 Broadway, New York, New York, 10036. The Company operates the following lines of business: (i) Telecommunications Products and Services; (ii) Value Added Products and Services (iii) Short Message Services (SMS) and Multimedia Messaging Services (MMS); (iv) a Rich Communication Services (RCS) platform; (v) Big Data Insights; and (vi) a Video Games Division (inactive).
Telecommunications Products and Services
 
The Companys current product mix consisting of payment and recharge services, data plans, subscription plans, mobile phones, loyalty points redemption and other products bundles (i.e. mobile protection plans). Chinese mobile phone consumers often utilize third-party e-marketing websites to pay their phone bills. If the consumer connected directly to the telecommunications provider to pay his or her bill, the consumer would miss out on any benefits or marketing discounts that e-marketers provide. Thus, consumers log on to these e-marketers websites, click into their respective phone providers store, and top up, or pay, their telecommunications provider for additional mobile data and talk time.
 
To connect to the respective mobile telecommunications providers, these e-marketers must utilize a portal licensed by the applicable telecommunication company that processes the payment. We have been granted one of these licenses by China United Network Communications Group Co., Ltd. (China Unicom) and China Mobile Communications Corporation (China Mobile), each of which is a major telecommunications provider in China. We principally earn revenue by providing mobile payment and recharge services to customers of China Unicom and China Mobile.
 
We conduct our mobile payment business through Shanghai JiuGe Technology Co., Ltd. (JiuGe Techology), our contractually controlled affiliate through the entry into a series of agreements known as variable interest agreements (the VIE Agreements) in October 2018. In the first half of 2018, JiuGe Technology secured contracts with China Unicom and China Mobile to distribute mobile data for businesses and corporations in nine provinces/municipalities, namely Chengdu, Jiangxi, Jiangsu, Chongqing, Shanghai, Zhuhai, Zhejiang, Shaanxi, Inner Mongolia, Henan and Fujian. In September 2018, JiuGe Technology launched and commercialized mobile payment and recharge services to businesses for China Unicom. In May 2021, JiuGe Technology signed a volume-based agreement with China Mobile Fujian to offer recharge services to the Fujian province which we have launched and commercialized in November 2021.
 
The JiuGe Technology mobile payment and recharge platform enables the seamless delivery of real-time payment and recharge services to third-party channels and businesses. We earn a rebate from each telecommunications company on the funds paid by consumers to the telecommunications companies we process. To encourage consumers to utilize our portal instead of using our competitors platforms or paying China Unicom or China Mobile directly, we offer mobile data and talk time at a rate discounted from these companies stated rates, which are also the rates we must pay to them to purchase the mobile data and talk time provided to consumers through the use of our platform. Accordingly, we earn income on the rebates we receive from China Unicom and China Mobile, reduced by the amounts by which we discount the mobile data and talk time sold through our platform.
 
FingerMotion started and commercialized its Business to Business (B2B) model by integrating with various e-commerce platforms to provide its mobile payment and recharge services to subscribers or end consumers. In the first quarter of 2019 FingerMotion expanded its business by commercializing its first Business to Consumer (B2C) model, offering the telecommunication providers products and services, including data plans, subscription plans, mobile phones, and loyalty points redemption, directly to subscribers or customers of the e-commerce companies, such as PinDuoDuo (PDD) and TMall (TMALL). The Company is planning to further expand its universal exchange platform by setting up B2C stores on several other major e-commerce platforms in China. In addition to that, we have been assigned as one of Chinas Mobiles loyalty redemption partner where we will be providing the services for their customers via our platform.

Additionally, as previously disclosed, on July 7, 2019, JiuGe Technology, our contractually controlled affiliate, entered into that certain Yunnan Unicom Electronic Sales Platform Construction and Operation Cooperation Agreement (the Cooperation Agreement) with China Unicoms Yunnan subsidiary. Under the Cooperation Agreement, JiuGe Technology is responsible for constructing and operating China Unicoms electronic sales platform through which consumers can purchase various goods and services from China Unicom, including mobile telephones, mobile telephone service, broadband data services, terminals, smart devices and related financial insurance. The Cooperation Agreement provides that JiuGe Technology is required to construct and operate the platforms webpage in accordance with China Unicoms specifications and policies, and applicable law, and bear all expenses in connection therewith. As consideration for the service it provides under the Cooperation Agreement, JiuGe Technology receives a percentage of the revenue received from all sales it processes for China Unicom on the platform. The Cooperation Agreement expires three years from the date of its signature with a yearly auto-renewal clause, but it may be terminated by (i) JiuGe Technology upon three months written notice or (ii) by China Unicom unilaterally.
 
During the recent fiscal year, the Company expanded its offering under their telecommunication product and services by increasing their product line revenue streams. In March 2020, FingerMotion secure a contract with both China Mobile and China Unicom to acquire new users to take up the respective subscription plans Recently, in February 2021, we increased the mobile phones sales to end users using all of our platforms. This business will continue to contribute to the overall revenue for the group as part of our offering to our customers.
 
Value Added Product and Services
 
These are new product and services that the Company will secure and work with the telecommunication provider and all our e-commerce platform partners to market. The current and upcoming value-added product is the Mobile Protection programs which we will launch soon.
 
SMS and MMS Services
 
On March 7, 2019, the Company through JiuGe Technology acquired Beijing XunLian TianXia Technology Co., Ltd. (Beijing Technology), a company in the business of providing mass SMS text services to businesses looking to communicate with large numbers of their customers and prospective customers. With this acquisition, the Company expanded into a second partnership with the telecom companies by acquiring bulk Short Message Service (SMS) and Multimedia Messaging Service (MMS) bundles at reduced prices and offering bulk SMS services to end consumers with competitive pricing. FingerMotions subsidiary, Beijing Technology, retains a license from the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT) to operate the SMS and MMS business in the PRC. Similar to the mobile payment and recharge business, Beijing Technology is required to make a deposit or bulk purchase in advance and has secured business customers, including premium car manufacturers, hotel chains, airlines and e-commerce companies, that utilize Beijing Technologys SMS integrated platform to send bulk SMS text messages monthly. Beijing Technology has the capability to manage and track the entire process, including guiding the Companys customer to meet MIITs guidelines on messages composed, until the SMS messages have been delivered successfully.
 
Rich Communication Services
 
In March 2020, the Company began development of an RCS platform, also known as MaaP (Messaging as a Platform). This RCS platform will be a proprietary business messaging platform that enables businesses and brands to communicate and service their customers on the 5G infrastructure, delivering a better and more efficient user experience at a lower cost. For example, with the new 5G RCS message service, consumers will have the ability to list available flights by sending a message regarding a holiday and will also be able to book and buy flights by sending messages. This will allow telecommunication providers like China Unicom and China Mobile to retain users on their systems, without having to utilize third party apps or log onto the internet, which will increase their user retention. We expect this to open up a new marketing channel for the Companys current and prospective business partners. We have undertaken several beta-testing and are currently waiting for the approval from the telecommunication providers to launch.

Our Video Game Division
 
The video game industry covers multiple sectors and is currently experiencing a move away from physical games towards digital software. Advances in technology and streaming now allow users to download games rather than visiting retailers. Video game publishers are expanding their direct-to-consumer channels with mobile gaming, the current growth leader, and eSports and virtual reality gaining momentum as the next big sectors.
 
In June 2018, we temporarily paused its publishing and operating plans for existing games, and the Companys board of directors decided to re-focus the companys resources into new business opportunities in China, particularly the mobile phone payment and data business.

Corporate Information
 
The Company was initially incorporated as Property Management Corporation of America on January 23, 2014 in the State of Delaware.
 
On June 21, 2017, the Company amended its certificate of incorporation to effect a 1-for-4 reverse stock split of the Companys outstanding common stock, to increase the authorized shares of common stock to 200,000,000 shares and to change the name of the Company from Property Management Corporation of America to FingerMotion, Inc. (the Corporate Actions). The Corporate Actions and the amended certificate of incorporation became effective on June 21, 2017.
 
Our principal executive offices are located at 1460 Broadway, New York, New York 10036, and our telephone number at that address is (347) 349-5339.
 
We are a holding company incorporated in Delaware and not an operating company incorporated in the Peoples Republic of China (the PRC or China). As a holding company, we conduct a significant part of our operations through our subsidiaries and through the VIE Agreements with the VIE based in China. To address challenges resulting from laws, policies and practices that may disfavor foreign-owned entities that operate within industries deemed sensitive by the Chinese government, we use the VIE structure to replicate foreign investment in the PRC-based companies. We own 100% of the equity of a WFOE, Shanghai JiuGe Business Management Co., Ltd., which has entered into the VIE Agreements with the VIE, which is owned by Ms. Li Li the legal representative and general manager, and also the shareholder of the VIE. As a result of our use of the VIE structure, you may never directly hold equity interests the VIE. The securities offered pursuant to this prospectus are securities of the Company, the Delaware holding company, not of the VIE.
 
We fund the registered capital and operating expenses of the VIE by extending loans to the shareholders of the VIE. We believe that we are the primary beneficiary of the VIE because the VIE Agreements governing the relationship between the VIE and our WFOE, which include a consulting services agreement, a loan agreement, a power of attorney agreement, a call option agreement, and a share pledge agreement, enable us to (i) exercise effective control over the VIE, (ii) receive substantially all of the economic benefits of the VIE, and (iii) have an exclusive call option to purchase, at any time, all or part of the equity interests in and/or assets of the VIE to the extent permitted by Chinese laws.

FMCL, a Hong Kong corporation, was formed on April 6, 2016 and is an information technology company that specializes in operating and publishing mobile games. Pursuant to the Share Exchange Agreement, the Company agreed to exchange the outstanding equity stock of FMCL held by the FMCL Shareholders for shares of common stock of the Company. On the closing date of the Share Exchange Agreement, the Company issued 12,000,000 shares of common stock to the FMCL shareholders. In addition, the Company issued 600,000 shares to consultants in connection with the transactions contemplated by the Share Exchange Agreement, and 2,562,500 additional shares to accredited investors, which was a concurrent financing but not a condition of closing the Share Exchange Agreement.
 
As a result of the Share Exchange Agreement and the other transactions contemplated thereunder, FMCL became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. The Company operates its video game division through FMCL. However, in June 2018, the Company decided to pause the operation of the game division as it saw the opportunity in the telecommunication business and have since refocused into this business.

 Because we do not directly hold equity interests in the VIE, we are subject to risks and uncertainties of the interpretations and applications of Chinese laws and regulations, including but not limited to, the validity and enforcement of the VIE Agreements among the WFOE, the VIE and the shareholder of the VIE. We are also subject to the risks and uncertainties about any future actions of the Chinese government in this regard that could disallow the VIE structure, which would likely result in a material change in our operations and may cause the value of our Common Shares to depreciate significantly or become worthless.
 
The VIE Agreements may not be as effective as direct ownership in providing operational control. For instance, the VIE and its shareholders could breach their contractual arrangements with us by, among other things, failing to conduct their operations in an acceptable manner or taking other actions that are detrimental to our interests. The shareholder of the VIE may not act in the best interests of our Company or may not perform their obligations under the VIE Agreements. Such risks exist throughout the period in which we intend to operate certain portions of our business through the VIE Agreements with the VIE. In the event that the VIE or its shareholder fail to perform their respective obligations under the VIE Agreements, we may have to incur substantial costs and expend additional resources to enforce such arrangements. In addition, even if legal actions are taken to enforce the VIE Agreements, there is uncertainty as to whether Chinese courts would recognize or enforce judgments of U.S. courts against us or such persons predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the securities laws of the United States or any state. See Risk Factors—Risks Related to the VIE Agreements. We rely on the VIE Agreements with the VIE and its shareholder for a significant portion of our business operations. The VIE Agreements may not be as effective as direct ownership in providing operational control. Any failure by the VIE or its shareholder to perform their obligations under such contractual arrangements would have a material and adverse effect on our business.
 
As of the date of this prospectus, we and the VIE are not required to seek permissions from the CSRC, the Cyberspace Administration of China (the CAC), or any other entity that is required to approve of the operations of the VIE. Nevertheless, Chinese regulatory authorities may in the future promulgate laws, regulations or implement rules that require us, our subsidiaries or the VIEs to obtain permissions from such regulatory authorities to approve the operations of the VIE or any securities listing.

SMS and MMS Services
 
Short Message Service (SMS) remains the only secure and reliable communication medium that connects all telecommunication operators globally. In 2019, the telecommunications industry in China sent a total of around 1,506 billion SMS,1 equivalent to a market size of RMB 39.2 billion (~$5.85 billion), a year-on-year increase of 37.5% compared to 2018.2 The Company was responsible for 1.2 billion, or 0.08% of market share.
 
There are strict policies imposed by the Chinese government regulating message broadcasting via the SMS protocol. One key metric being monitored is the rate of public complaints on messages received via SMS, with the aim of fighting spam messages and blocking uncensored messages.
 
In early 2019, the Company completed beta testing of its proprietary SMS Integrated System and the commercialization phase began in April 2019. The SMS Integrated System provides a robust back-end control panel for corporate partners to access and manage their own messaging settings. Corporate partners can upload a list of targeted members, compose text or multimedia messages and define broadcasting settings. All messages must be submitted to the ministry for review before being delivered to telecommunication operators back-end for broadcasting.
 

The mass SMS text message service offers bulk SMS services to end consumers with competitive pricing. Beijing Technology retains a license from the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology to operate SMS and MMS business in the PRC. Similar to the mobile payment and recharge business, Beijing Technology is required to make a deposit or bulk purchase in advance and has secured business customers that will utilize Beijing Technologys SMS integrated platform to send bulk SMS text messages monthly. Beijing Technology has the capability to manage and track the entire process, including guiding the Companys customer to meet governments guidelines on messages composed, until the SMS messages have been delivered successfully.

Rich Communication Services (RCS) Platform
 
Telecommunication operators around the world have reached consensus on the need to upgrade the operator messaging service from SMS to Rich Communication Services (RCS) messaging in the 5G era. Worldwide, the GSM Association (GSMA) indicates 90 operators have launched RCS in 60 countries, attracting approximately 421 million users and projecting an estimated value of $15.78 billion by 2027, growing at a CAGR of 18.5%.3
 
On April 8, 2020, Chinas three major telecommunication operators, namely China Mobile, China Telecom and China Unicom, released a 5G messaging white paper outlining their commitment to mandate all compatible handsets sold in the country support RCS.4
 
5G messaging service or RCS can support not only Person-to-Person (P2P) messaging, but also Application-to-Person (A2P) messaging. Through P2P messaging, RCS offers a richer text-messaging system, provides phonebook polling and is capable of transmitting in-call multimedia features. A2P messaging enables businesses and brands to communicate with users via chatbot, facilitates the sharing of high-quality videos but also more direct interfacing with the internet; consumers will no longer have to download multiple mobile apps and can, for instance, directly buy train tickets and book flights by just sending messages.
 
In March 2020, the Companys management allocated resources dedicated for the research and development of a RCS platform – MaaP (Messaging as a Platform). This RCS platform is expected to be a proprietary business messaging platform that enables businesses and brands to communicate and service their customers on 5G infrastructure, delivering better user experience, more efficiently and cost effectively. This is expected to open up a new marketing channel for the Companys current and prospective business partners.
 
In the third quarter of the fiscal year ended 2022, the Company anticipates commercializing the following RCS platforms:

Big Data Insights
 
The Company launched its proprietary platform Sapientus in July 2020 as its big data insights arm to deliver data-driven solutions and insights for businesses within the insurance and financial services industries. Leveraging the Companys strong tech and data backbone, Sapientus specializes in data mining and insights extraction. The Companys flexible data structure is built from the ground up, by transforming raw telco data into basic building blocks, statistical measures and behavioral inferences, while layering in auxiliary contextual information, to extract behavioral insights and power revolutionary applications for insurance and financial services.
 
Sapientus equips insurance industry partners with a range of capabilities such as:
 

■ | Behavior insights and scoring derived from a time series of live telco data, along with an expansive set of auxiliary data, enabling deeper contextual understanding of a customers behavior propensity and risk inclination for more granular segmentation; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
■ | Transactional integration giving real-time feedback enriched with risk and behavior insights on current and prospective customers, thereby further promoting digital transformations in the industry – e.g. online underwriting, claims processing and fraud detection, etc.; and 
■ | Insight-driven data analytic services, sufficiently adaptive to incorporate new information such as emerging claim and marketing data, and synchronize with the Companys partners operating and risk assessment philosophy via continual learning and honing. 

 Sapientus deep bench of insurance and data science expertise is expected to attract an expanding client base, supporting risk calibrations and insights extraction using advanced statistical methods and analytic techniques. The Companys proprietary risk assessment engine offers standard and customized scoring and appraisal services based on multi-dimensional factors, enabled by extensive data coverage through exclusive telco partnerships. The Company augments and shares value with its partners through various big data enabled applications including preferred risk selection, precision marketing, product customization, and claims management (e.g. fraud detection).
 
The Companys mission is to deliver the next generation of data-driven insurance solutions that result in more accurate risk assessments, more efficient processes and a more delightful customer journey.

The Company anticipates development of Sapientus in three key stages:
 

Stage 1: Initialization
 
During the initialization stage, the Companys focus on building its brand and honing its rating framework and analytics. To accomplish this, the Company will be partnering with reinsurers to increase its visibility as well as assimilate its data analytics into the reinsurers value chain. Potential engagements include underwriting enhancement, market segmentation, product design as well as facilitation of claims review and adjudication. Revenue during this time will be sourced mainly from offering proprietary rating system and related services that are customized to fit the Companys reinsurer partners specific needs. Furthermore, establishing collaborative facilities with reinsurers allows the Company to integrate posterior information (claims, underwriting experience, and campaign feedback) for improving its scoring / measurement system.
Stage 2: Expansion
 
The expansion stage shifts the Companys revenue focus from offering rating system alone to earning commissions and profit shares through channel expansion and innovative product designs enabled by more granular customer segmentation. Channel expansion could be achieved by cross-selling through the Companys affiliated company and brokerage arm, supported by leads generation for niche marketing and further upselling. In addition, developing customized product solutions with reinsurers will augment value proposition, offering more personalized and efficient coverage based on the latent risks of individuals. Precision marketing enhances product take-up rates, while preferred risk selection is expected to attract profitable business and improve portfolio results. As such, added value can be generated and shared among Sapientus and its (re)insurer and distribution partners.

Stage 3: Integration
 
As Sapientus matures, the Company enters the integration stage. Behavioral dynamics can prove to be very versatile in supporting many possibilities beyond insurance. Having accumulated more diverse data and insights enriches the Companys rating perspective, enabling it to offer a universal rating platform that can be commonly adopted across the industry. The Companys platform can be readily integrated with other systems, helping the Company extend reach beyond insurance applications. For example, the Companys generalized rating system can help conduct smart underwriting for financial loans or craft out consumer behaviors and risk propensities to inform ecommerce business decisions. The Companys platform can be used standalone as an independent rating tool, as well as offered as part of an integrated system, joining forces with various ecosystem partners on data access, customer relationships, advanced analytics, product and service capabilities. Types of value that can be realized through ecosystems include:

■ | Friction reduction: Creating a one-stop shop or interface for consumers by removing the hassle of switching among multiple providers; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
■ | Network effects: Generating synergy value for stakeholders by pooling and sharing information and resources to serve common needs; and 
■ | Data integration: Mining and analyzing available data, applying learnings to deliver convenience and tangible benefits to customers. 

Growth Strategy
 
The Companys growth strategy is a multi-pronged approach, continually asking Whats next? and consisting of the following:
 

■ | Enhancing PigeonHoles Integration System and the SMS Integrated System. Maintaining a stable and robust platform is expected to give the Company the flexibility to manage new product offering and packages in order to increase revenue. This will be the key critical success factor for the Companys expansion plans. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
■ | Expanding customer base. Along with the stability of the Companys platform and its ability to access working capital, the Companys growth will be based on increasing its market share through expanding its base in its current geographic regions of operations and through expanding its presence into other regions. The Companys offerings can be targeted to a wider group of customers, which should improve overall revenue. 
■ | New Product line expansion. The Company plans to constantly increase its product offerings from its telco partners by designing new packages and offerings in order to differentiate the Company from its competition. New product line and services are expected to be introduced progressively to be offered to the end users via the telco delivery channels. This is expected to expand our revenue base. 
■ | Enhancing values. The Company intends to continue to build brand loyalty and enhance its customer service to ensure customer retention and repeat sales. 
■ | Diversification. Breaking away from the Companys core and traditional business, the Company is moving into the insurance technology (insurtech) space with Sapientus and the Companys big data analytics arm. The Company intends to continue to explore opportunities in the financial technology services (fintech), healthcare and advertising industries. 
■ | Focusing on strength and investing in talent. The Company intends to continue to build the strongest team in all of its various businesses. The Company intends to also continue to build its core values to enhance and differentiate its support and services to ensure it is able to stand out from its competitors.

Sales and Marketing
 

■ | The Companys sales and marketing efforts are focused on promoting brand awareness of its JiuGe telecommunication stores currently operating on most major e-commerce and social media platforms in China. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
■ | The Company is continuously planning, in cooperation with its telco partners, seasonal and targeted marketing events in different provinces and cities. 
■ | Since the inception of JiuGe Technology in 2018, the Company has secured contracts and agreements to work with nine (9) online stores and twenty (20) business partners. The Companys strategy is to expand into the entire China region and to reach out to a wider base of customers and users that can benefit from the Companys product offerings. 
■ | The Company intends to continue to focus on, and expand, its roster of corporate clients to improve sales in its SMS business, and intends to focus on expanding into different industries. 

Research & Development
 

■ | RCS Platform - As a leader in the 5G ecosystem in China, the Company is developing the RCS platform to strengthen its first-mover advantage in MaaP (Messaging as a Platform). This messaging platform enables businesses and brands to communicate and service their customers on 5G infrastructure, delivering a more efficient, more cost efficient, and more robust user experience. This should open up a new marketing channel for the Companys current and prospective business partners. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
■ | Big Data Insights - Beginning in January 2019, the Company has continuously researched industry reports and compiled data published by researchers and have incorporated its findings into its Sapientus data blocks. By integrating with external data sources, the Companys R&D departments can develop innovative insurtech and fintech products to the Companys re-insurance and financial services companies and partners. 

Competition
 
Our industry is highly competitive, rapidly changing, highly innovative and increasingly subject to regulatory scrutiny and oversight. We compete against a wide range of businesses, including those that are larger than we are, have a dominant and secure position or offer other products and services to consumers and merchants that we do not offer. We believe we are in an advantageous position compared to many of our competitors or potential competitors because we have been granted an exclusive license to act as an authorized processor of payments in China for China Unicom and China Mobile.
 
Our mobile payments business competes principally against two alternatives. First, we compete directly with other holders of licenses from the major mobile telecommunications providers in China. We understand there are a limited number of these licenses, but believe that certain other license holders are large, diversified companies with deep financial resources. We also compete with payment processors that are not authorized licensees of the mobile telecommunications companies but nevertheless provide similar services. Separately, and more generally, we compete with all forms and methods of paying for additional data and minutes, including credit and debit cards, other electronic payment platforms and bank transfers.
 
Because we have been awarded a contract to process payments for China Unicom and China Mobile and, are therefore, able to offer services directly to market with value added services, we believe the Company is in an advantageous position as compared to its competition. We look to take advantage of the position that we have been afforded.

Regulation
 
We operate in a rapidly evolving regulatory environment characterized by a heightened regulatory focus on all aspects of the payments industry. That focus continues to become even more heightened as regulators on a global basis focus on such important issues as countering terrorist financing, anti-money laundering, privacy, cybersecurity and consumer protection. Some of the laws and regulations to which we are subject were enacted recently, and the laws and regulations applicable to us, including those enacted prior to the advent of digital and mobile payments, are continuing to evolve through legislative and regulatory action and judicial interpretation. New or changing laws and regulations, including how such laws and regulations are interpreted and implemented, as well as increased penalties and enforcement actions related to non-compliance, could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Therefore, as we grow, we will need to develop the capacity to monitor these areas closely to design compliant solutions for our customers who depend on us.
 
Government regulation impacts key aspects of our business. We are subject to regulations that affect the payments industry in the markets in which we operate.
 
Payments Regulation. Various laws and regulations govern the payments industry in China, where our mobile payment and recharge platform principally operates. Our activities in this regard are, or may be, supervised by one or more financial regulatory authorities, including the Peoples Bank of China. Other national or provincial regulatory agencies may have or assert jurisdiction over our activities, including agencies and authorities outside of China, if our platform is utilized by consumers in such jurisdictions. The laws and regulations applicable to the payments industry in any given jurisdiction are subject to interpretation and change.
 
Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing. FingerMotion is subject to anti-money laundering (AML) laws and regulations in China, the U.S. and other jurisdictions, as well as laws designed to prevent the use of the financial systems to facilitate terrorist activities. As we grow our business, we will need to develop an AML program designed to prevent our payment network from being used to facilitate money laundering, terrorist financing, and other illicit activities, or to do business in countries or with persons and entities included on designated country or person lists promulgated by the U.S. Department of the Treasurys Office of Foreign Assets Controls (OFAC) and equivalent authorities in China and other countries whose jurisdiction we may become subject as a result of our operations. Any AML and sanctions compliance program we put in place will need to involve policies, procedures and internal controls designed to address these legal and regulatory requirements and assist in managing money laundering and terrorist financing risks.
  -17-

 
Data Protection and Information Security. Aspects of our operations or business may be subject to privacy and data protection regulation in China, the U.S. and elsewhere. In the U.S., we are subject to privacy information safeguarding requirements under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act that require the maintenance of a written, comprehensive information security program, among other laws, which we do not currently have in place. Regulatory authorities around the world are considering numerous legislative and regulatory proposals concerning privacy and data protection that may contain additional privacy and data protection obligations than exist today. In addition, the interpretation and application of these privacy and data protection laws in China, the U.S. and elsewhere are often uncertain and in a state of flux.
 
Anti-Corruption. FingerMotion is subject to applicable anti-corruption laws, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act, and similar anti-corruption laws in the jurisdictions in which we operate. Anti-corruption laws generally prohibit offering, promising, giving, accepting or authorizing others to provide anything of value, either directly or indirectly, to or from a government official or private party in order to influence official action or otherwise gain an unfair business advantage, such as to obtain or retain business.
 
Additional Regulatory Developments. Various regulatory agencies continue to examine a wide variety of issues, including virtual currencies, identity theft, account management guidelines, privacy, disclosure rules, cybersecurity and marketing that may impact the Companys business.
 
Compliance with Environmental Laws
 
Compliance with foreign, federal, state and local laws that have been enacted or adopted regulating the discharge of materials into the environment, or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment, have not had a material effect on our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position.
Employees
 
As of February 28, 2022, we had 68 total employees, of whom all were full time. We have approximately 58 employees in China, 4 employees in Malaysia, 2 employees in Hong Kong, 1 employee in Taiwan, 2 employees in USA and 1 employee in Canada. We believe that we enjoy good relations with our employees.
