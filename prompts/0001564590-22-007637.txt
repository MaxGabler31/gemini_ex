Customers
 We sell our products and services to thousands of customers worldwide, in a wide range of end markets. Revenues from our top ten customers accounted for 47%, 44% and 33% of net revenues for 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, with the increasing percentages attributable to increasing semiconductor market sales. As a percentage of net revenues from our top ten customers, semiconductor market revenue accounted for greater than 90% in each of these years. Lam Research Corporation and Applied Materials, Inc. were our top two customers in 2021 and together accounted for approximately 27% of our net revenues. Both of these customers are in the semiconductor market. The semiconductor market has historically experienced cyclical variations in product supply and demand. It is subject to rapid demand shifts, which are difficult to predict, and we cannot be certain as to the timing or extent of future demand or any future weakness in the semiconductor capital equipment industry. For example, our semiconductor market revenue sequentially increased 32% in 2021, sequentially increased 49% in 2020, and sequentially decreased 19% in 2019. We believe net revenues attributable to our semiconductor market customers are affected by the cyclical nature of the semiconductor market.
Sales and Marketing
 Our worldwide sales and marketing organizations are also critical to our strategy of maintaining close relationships with semiconductor capital equipment manufacturers, semiconductor device manufacturers and manufacturers of advanced 
 8


applications. We market and sell our products and services through our global direct sales organization, an international network of independent distributors and sales representatives, our websites and product catalogs. As of December 31, 2021, we had approximately 800 sales and marketing employees worldwide. We maintain a marketing staff that identifies customer requirements, assists in product planning and specifications, and focuses on future trends in the markets we serve.
 Research and Development
 Our products incorporate sophisticated technologies to measure, monitor, deliver, analyze, power, control and improve complex semiconductor and advanced manufacturing processes, thereby enhancing uptime, yield and throughput for our customers. Our products have continuously advanced as we strive to meet our customers’ evolving needs. We have developed, and continue to develop, new products to address industry trends, such as the shrinking of integrated circuit critical dimensions and technology inflections, and, in the flat panel display and solar markets, the transition to larger substrate sizes, which require more advanced processing and process control technology, the continuing drive toward more complex and accurate components and devices within the handset and tablet market, the transition to 5G for both devices and infrastructure, supporting the growth in units and via counts of the High Density Interconnect PCB drilling market, and the industry transition to electric cars in the automotive market. In addition, we have developed, and continue to develop, products that support the migration to new classes of materials, ultra-thin layers, and 3D structures that are used in small geometry manufacturing. 
 We involve our marketing, engineering, manufacturing and sales personnel in the development of new products in order to reduce the time to market for new products. Our employees also work closely with our customers’ development personnel, helping us to identify and define future technical needs on which to focus research and development efforts. We support research at academic institutions targeted at advances in materials science, semiconductor process development and photonics.
 As of December 31, 2021, we had approximately 900 research and development employees located in facilities around the world. Our research and development expenses were $200 million, $173 million and $164 million for 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Our research and development efforts include numerous projects, none of which are individually material, and generally have a duration of 3 to 30 months, depending upon whether the product is an enhancement of existing technology or a new product. Our current initiatives include projects to enhance the performance characteristics of older products, to develop new products and to integrate various technologies into subsystems.  
 Manufacturing
 Manufacturing activities include the assembly and testing of components and subassemblies, which are integrated into our products. Our manufacturing facilities are located in Austria, Canada, China, France, Germany, Israel, Italy, Romania, Singapore, South Korea and the United States. We also rely on significant subcontracted operations in Mexico and selected contract manufacturers in Asia. Our business depends on the timely supply of products and services that meet the rapidly changing technical and volume requirements of our customers, which depends in part on the timely delivery of parts, components and subassemblies from suppliers, including contract manufacturers. We purchase a wide range of electronic, optical, mechanical and electrical components, some of which are designed to our specifications. We consider our lean manufacturing techniques and responsiveness to customers’ significantly fluctuating product demands to be a competitive advantage. As of December 31, 2021, we had approximately 4,200 manufacturing-related employees.
Backlog
 
We generally schedule production of our products based upon our customers’ delivery requirements. Our lead times are very short, as a large portion of our orders are received and shipped within 90 days. In many cases, orders may be subject to cancellation or rescheduling by the customer with limited or no penalty. Our backlog at any particular date, therefore, is not necessarily indicative of actual sales which may be generated for any succeeding period. Historically, our backlog levels have fluctuated based upon the ordering patterns of our customers and changes in our manufacturing capacity. Beginning in 2021, semiconductor market customers generally both increased order volumes and extended lead times. We believe recent ordering patterns reflect our customers’ efforts to mitigate the impact of supply chain constraints and provide us with increased visibility to schedule production and secure materials.
