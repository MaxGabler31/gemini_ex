Overview
Our Mission
Etsy’s mission to “Keep Commerce Human” is rooted in our belief that, although automation and commoditization are parts of modern life, human creativity cannot be automated and human connection cannot be commoditized. We believe that consumers are demanding more of the businesses they support and that companies that build win-win solutions that are good for people, the planet, and profit will be best positioned to succeed. We are committed to growing sustainably by aligning our mission and business strategy to help create economic impact through entrepreneurship. You can read more about Etsy’s Impact and environmental, social, and governance (“ESG”) strategies beginning on page 18, where we report on metrics aligned with both our self-identified Impact priorities and widely accepted third-party frameworks.
About our Company
Etsy operates two-sided online marketplaces that connect millions of passionate and creative buyers and sellers around the world. These marketplaces - which collectively create a “House of Brands” - share our mission, common levers for growth, similar business models, and a strong commitment to use business and technology to strengthen communities and empower people.
Our primary marketplace, Etsy.com, is the global destination for unique and creative goods made by independent sellers. The Etsy marketplace connects creative artisans and entrepreneurs with thoughtful consumers looking for items that are a joyful expression of their taste and values. Our sellers are the heart and soul of Etsy, and our technology platform allows our sellers to turn their creative passions into economic opportunity. We have a seller-aligned business model: we make money when our sellers make money. We offer Etsy.com sellers a marketplace with tens of millions of buyers along with a range of seller tools and services that are specifically designed to help our creative entrepreneurs generate more sales and scale their businesses.
In addition to our core Etsy marketplace, our “House of Brands” consists of Reverb Holdings, Inc. (“Reverb”), our musical instrument marketplace acquired in 2019, Depop Limited (“Depop”), our fashion resale marketplace, and Elo7 Serviços de Informática S.A. (“Elo7”), our Brazil-based marketplace for handmade and unique items. Both Depop and Elo7 were acquired in July 2021. Our marketplaces primarily operate independently, although some of our functions in key areas such as finance, legal, and human resources, for example, support all four marketplaces to some extent. The Reverb, Depop, and Elo7 marketplaces are included in all financial and other metrics discussed in this report, unless otherwise noted, from their respective dates of acquisition. 
Our sellers generated $13.5 billion of Gross Merchandise sales (“GMS”) in 2021. Of this, the Etsy marketplace represented 90.6%, and the Reverb, Depop, and Elo7 marketplaces represented 7.0%, 2.2%, and 0.2%, respectively (the latter two marketplaces having been owned by Etsy for just less than half of 2021). We anticipate that the Etsy marketplace will continue to be the primary driver of our overall financial performance for the foreseeable future.
Here are a few key statistics about our marketplaces:
•The Etsy, Reverb, Depop, and Elo7 marketplaces collectively connected a total of 7.5 million active sellers to 96.3 million active buyers as of December 31, 2021.
•Collectively our marketplaces had over 120 million items for sale as of December 31, 2021.
•Our top six retail categories on the Etsy marketplace in 2021 continued to be homewares and home furnishings, jewelry and personal accessories, apparel, craft supplies, paper and party supplies, and beauty and personal care. These categories, excluding masks, represented approximately $10 billion, or 87% of 2021 GMS. Reverb provides a significant presence in the market for musical instruments, Depop extends our apparel offering into the resale space, and Elo7 expands our geographic opportunity with a local brand in Brazil.
•We are a global company, and 42% of our consolidated 2021 GMS was generated when a seller or buyer, or both, were located outside of the United States.
•Approximately 64% of our 2021 consolidated GMS came from purchases made on mobile devices, with mobile app being the fastest growing device for the Etsy marketplace.
