Our telephone number is 212-465-6400, our website is http://www.msgnetworks.com and the investor relations section of our website is http://investor.msgnetworks.com. We make available, free of charge through the investor relations section of our website, annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), as well as proxy statements, as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file such material with, or furnish it to, the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). References to our website in this report are provided as a convenience and the information contained on, or available through, our website is not part of this or any other report we file with or furnish to the SEC.
On September 30, 2015 (the “Distribution Date”), the Company distributed to its stockholders all of the outstanding common stock of The Madison Square Garden Company (“MSG”) (the “Distribution”). Following the Distribution, the Company no longer consolidates the financial results of MSG for purposes of its own financial reporting and the historical financial results of MSG through the Distribution Date, as well as transaction costs related to the Distribution, have been classified in the Company’s consolidated financial statements as discontinued operations for all periods presented. 
Our Company
The Company, an industry leader in sports production, and content development and distribution, owns and operates two award-winning regional sports and entertainment networks, MSG Network (“MSGN”) and MSG+, collectively “MSG Networks.” For 50 years, we have been a pioneer in regional sports programming, setting a standard of excellence, creativity and technological innovation. Today, our exclusive, award-winning programming continues to be a valuable differentiator for our viewers, advertisers and the cable, satellite, telephone, and other platforms that distribute our networks (“Distributors”). Our networks are widely distributed throughout all of New York State and significant portions of New Jersey and Connecticut, as well as parts of Pennsylvania, collectively our “Regional Territory.” Our networks are also carried nationally by certain Distributors on sports tiers or in similar packages.
We continually seek to enhance the value that our networks provide to viewers, advertisers and Distributors by delivering high-quality, best-in-class content and live viewing experiences, utilizing state-of-the-art technology. We operate in the nation’s largest television market, the New York Designated Market Area (“DMA”), and attract an important and coveted viewer demographic. Our unique position in this major media market, as the provider of exclusive live local games of top professional sports teams and other sports programming, allows us to optimize distribution revenue and partner with marquee brands to capture advertising sales and explore new content opportunities. We also distribute programming through our companion streaming service, MSG GO. In addition, we utilize a dedicated website and social media platforms to promote our brands by sharing content, spotlighting on-air talent, and providing in-depth information about the teams and athletes featured on our networks. 
Programming
MSGN debuted as the first regional sports network in the country on October 15, 1969. During the last 50 years, we have been at the forefront of the industry, pushing the boundaries of regional sports coverage. In the process, our networks have become a powerful platform for some of the world’s greatest athletes and entertainers. 
With our commitment to programming excellence, we have earned a reputation for best-in-class programming, production, marketing, and technical innovation. We have won more than 140 New York Emmy Awards (“Emmys”) for live sports and original programming during the last decade, which is more than any other single station or network in the region over that time frame.
The foundation of our programming is our professional sports coverage. MSGN and MSG+ feature a wide range of compelling sports content, including exclusive live local games and other programming of the New York Knicks (the “Knicks”) of the National Basketball Association (“NBA”); the New York Rangers (the “Rangers”), New York Islanders (the “Islanders”), New Jersey Devils (the “Devils”) and Buffalo Sabres (the “Sabres”) of the National Hockey League (“NHL”); as well as significant coverage of the New York Giants (the “Giants”), and Buffalo Bills (the “Bills”) of the National Football League (“NFL”). Our arrangements include long-term media rights agreements with all of our NBA and NHL teams.

MSGN and MSG+ collectively aired more than 450 live professional games this past year, along with a comprehensive lineup of other sporting events, including college football and basketball, as well as original programming designed to give fans behind-the-scenes access and insight into the teams and players they love. This content includes comprehensive pre- and post-game coverage throughout the seasons, along with team-related programming that features coaches, players and more, all of which enable us to capitalize on the extraordinary enthusiasm of our teams’ fans. Further distinguishing these shows is our roster of renowned analysts and on-air talent, which include Mike Breen, Walt Frazier, Sam Rosen, Joe Micheletti, Al Trautwig, Bill Pidto, and Kenny Albert, among others. As the regional sports home of both the Giants and the Bills, our networks feature extensive content specifically for fans of both teams, which, during the 2018-19 NFL season, included pre- and post-game content and other team-related programming. 
In addition to our live games and team-related programming, we offer an evolving slate of compelling content to appeal to our existing audiences, while seeking to attract new viewers. This includes the continued expansion of our “MSG Shorts” programming block, which features short-form content, targeted to a younger audience, that is suited for our linear networks as well as digital and social platforms. Programming highlights this past year included original productions such as “Unfiltered,” “Verified,” “Connections,” and “Conference Room B,” which provided access to players, coaches, and celebrity guests with unique points of view; as well as popular shows such as “Sneaker Shopping” and “Hot Ones” from Complex, a global lifestyle media brand. As part of our MSG Shorts programming, we also launched themed content specials throughout the year — “Food Week,” “Wellness Week,” and “Sneaker Week” — that provided fans with an inside look into how these popular interests relate to the lives of athletes, coaches, and celebrities. This past year we also debuted “MSG 150” — an original production that aired weeknights for more than 10 weeks and offered viewers 150 minutes of content surrounding our teams and New York sports, covering important topics such as the NBA lottery, the NBA and NHL drafts and free agency, and the start of Giants mini-camp. 
Our networks also showcase a wide array of other sports and entertainment programming, which this past year included New York Red Bulls soccer; Westchester Knicks basketball; New York Streets arena football; Hofstra Men’s basketball; New York Lizards lacrosse; Bundesliga soccer; as well as tennis, mixed martial arts, and boxing programs.
In addition to MSGN and MSG+, the Company distributes programming through our companion streaming service, MSG GO. MSG GO allows subscribers to access MSGN and MSG+ and on demand content in a subscriber’s geographic region, using their smartphones, tablets and computers. MSG GO is currently available to subscribers of all of our major Distributors. 
Revenue 
The Company generates revenues principally from affiliation fees charged to Distributors for the right to carry our networks, as well as from the sale of advertising. The following customers each accounted for more than 10% of consolidated revenues for the year ended June 30, 2019: Altice USA, AT&T, Charter, and Verizon.
Affiliation Fee Revenue
Our networks are distributed pursuant to carriage agreements that are typically structured as multi-year agreements with staggered expiration dates and generally provide for annual contractual rate increases. We primarily earn revenue under these agreements based on the number of each Distributor’s subscribers or subscribers that receive our networks. Our affiliation agreements include certain protections relating to the manner in which our networks are carried, and the compensation for such carriage. Examples of such protections include: carriage requirements; penetration minimums (which require that our networks are made available to significant percentages of our Distributors’ basic subscribers); tag-along requirements (which require that MSGN and MSG+ are carried on the same tier as certain other networks); and/or payment minimums (which require us to be compensated based on significant percentages of our Distributors’ subscribers). Affiliation fee revenue constituted approximately 90% of our consolidated revenues for the year ended June 30, 2019.
MSGN and MSG+ are widely carried by major Distributors in our region, with an average combined reach of approximately 6.5 million viewing subscribers (as of the most recent available monthly information) in our Regional Territory. Our networks also enjoy national distribution with certain Distributors on sports tiers or in similar packages. 
Advertising Revenue
The Company’s programming, Regional Territory and viewer demographics make our networks attractive to advertisers. Our networks operate in the largest television market in the country, the New York DMA, and, with our exclusive live game coverage, offer advertisers an increasingly scarce asset in today’s evolving media landscape — the ability to reach engaged audiences on a live basis. MSG Networks’ viewers, a significant portion of whom are between the ages of 25-54 with high household incomes, also offer an appealing demographic for advertisers.

In addition, we benefit from our advertising sales representation agreement with MSG, which provides for the packaged sale of certain network advertising inventory as part of team and arena marketing and sponsorship sales. 
The Company’s advertising revenue is derived largely from the sale of inventory in its live professional sports programming. The value of this inventory is dependent upon a number of factors, including team performance, ratings, and general economic conditions. Advertising time is sold both in advance and in scatter markets.
Garden of Dreams Foundation
Our Company has a close association with the Garden of Dreams Foundation (the “Foundation”), a non-profit charity that has brightened the lives of more than 375,000 children and their families. The Foundation, which started in 2006, works with 30 partner organizations throughout the tristate area, including hospitals, wish organizations and community-based organizations, to reach children who are facing challenges, such as homelessness, extreme poverty, illness, and foster care. The Foundation takes pride in its commitment to truly change lives, hosting more than 500 events and programs each year. The Company and the Foundation present “MSG Classroom,” an award-winning educational program to teach high school students about the media industry. The eight-week program provides a hands-on opportunity for students to develop skills, including broadcasting, script writing and production, and culminates with the students creating their own programming feature. The MSG Classroom program has been recognized with multiple Beacon Awards in the “Education” category, as well as a New York Emmy Award in the “Community Service” category. 
Regulation
The Federal Communications Commission (“FCC”) imposes regulations directly on programming networks and also imposes regulations on certain distributors that affect programming networks indirectly. The rules, regulations, policies and procedures affecting our business are subject to change. The following paragraphs describe the existing legal and regulatory requirements that are most significant to our business today; they do not purport to describe all present and proposed laws and regulations affecting our business.
Closed Captioning
Our programming networks must provide closed captioning of video programming for the hearing impaired and meet certain captioning quality standards. The FCC and certain of our affiliation agreements require us to certify compliance with such standards. We are also required to provide closed captioning on certain video content delivered via the Internet.
Commercial Loudness
FCC rules require multichannel video programming distributors (“MVPDs”) to ensure that all commercials comply with specified volume standards, and certain of our affiliation agreements require us to certify compliance with such standards.
Advertising Restrictions on Children’s Programming
Any programming and associated Internet websites intended primarily for children 12 years of age and under that we may offer must comply with certain limits on commercial content.
Obscenity Restrictions
Distributors are prohibited from transmitting obscene programming, and certain of our affiliation agreements require us to refrain from including such programming on our networks.
Packaging and Pricing
The FCC periodically considers examining whether to adopt rules regulating how programmers package and price their networks, such as whether programming networks require distributors to purchase and carry undesired programming in return for the right to carry desired programming and, if so, whether such arrangements should be prohibited. 
Effect of “Must-Carry” Requirements
The FCC’s implementation of the statutory “must-carry” obligations requires cable and satellite distributors to give broadcasters preferential access to channel space. This may reduce the amount of channel space that is available for carriage of our networks and the amount of funds that Distributors have to pay us for our programming networks.

Website and Mobile Application Requirements
We maintain various websites and mobile applications that may be subject to third-party application store requirements, as well as a range of federal, state and local laws such as privacy, accessibility for persons with disabilities, and consumer protection regulations.
Competition
Distribution of Programming Networks
The business of distributing programming networks is highly competitive. Our programming networks face competition from other programming networks, including other regional sports networks, for the right to be carried by a particular distributor, and for the right to be carried on the service tier(s) that will attract the most subscribers. Once a programming network of ours is carried by a distributor, that network competes for viewers not only with the other programming networks available through the distributor, but also with pay-per-view programming and video on demand offerings, as well as Internet and online streaming and on demand services, mobile applications, social media and social networking platforms, radio, print media, motion picture theaters, home video, and other sources of information, sporting events and entertainment. Each of the following competitive factors are important to our networks: the prices we charge for our programming networks, the quantity, quality (in particular, the performance of the sports teams whose media rights we control), and the variety of the programming offered on our networks, and the effectiveness of our marketing efforts.
Our ability to successfully compete with other programming networks for distribution may be hampered because the distributors may be affiliated with other programming networks. In addition, because such affiliated distributors may have a substantial number of subscribers, the ability of such competing programming networks to obtain distribution on affiliated distributors may lead to increased subscriber and advertising revenue for such networks because of their increased penetration compared to our programming networks. Even if such affiliated distributors carry our programming networks, there is no assurance that such distributors will not place their affiliated programming network on more desirable tier(s), thereby giving the affiliated programming network a competitive advantage over our own.
New or existing programming networks that are owned by or affiliated with broadcast networks such as NBC, ABC, CBS or Fox may have a competitive advantage over our networks in obtaining distribution through the “bundling” of agreements to carry those programming networks with the agreement giving the distributor the right to carry a broadcast station owned by or affiliated with the network.
In addition, content providers (such as certain broadcast and cable networks) and new content developers, distributors and syndicators (such as Amazon and Netflix), are distributing programming directly to consumers on an “over-the-top” (“OTT”) basis. Such direct-to-consumer OTT distribution of content may facilitate consumers eliminating or downgrading their pay television subscription, which can result in certain consumers not receiving our programming networks. 
See “Item 1A. Risk Factors — Our Business Faces Intense and Wide-Ranging Competition Which May Have a Material Negative Effect on Our Business and Results of Operations” and “— We May Not Be Able to Adapt to New Content Distribution Platforms and to Changes in Consumer Behavior Resulting From Emerging Technologies, Which May Have a Material Negative Effect on Our Business and Results of Operations.” See also “Part II — Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Business Overview — Revenue Sources.” 
Sources of Programming
We also compete with other networks and other distribution outlets to secure desired programming, including sports-related programming. Competition for programming increases as the number of programming networks and distribution outlets, including, but not limited to, streaming outlets, increases. Other programming networks, or distribution outlets, that are affiliated with or otherwise have larger relationships with programming sources such as sports teams or leagues, movie or television studios, or film libraries may have a competitive advantage over us in this area.
Competition for Sports Programming Sources
Because the loyalty of the sports viewing audience to a sports programming network is primarily driven by loyalty to a particular team or teams, access to adequate sources of sports programming is particularly critical to our networks. In connection with the Distribution, the Company entered into long-term media rights agreements with MSG providing us with the exclusive media rights to Knicks and Rangers games, and the Company has long-term media rights agreements with the Islanders, Devils and Sabres. Our rights with respect to these professional teams may be limited in certain circumstances due to rules imposed by the leagues in which they compete. Our programming networks compete for telecast rights for other teams or events principally with national or regional programming networks that specialize in or carry sports programming; local and 
6

national commercial broadcast television networks; independent syndicators that acquire and resell such rights nationally, regionally and locally; and Internet and mobile-based distributors of programming. Some of our competitors may own or control, or are owned or controlled by, sports teams, leagues or sports promoters, which gives them an advantage in obtaining telecast rights for such teams or sports. For example, two professional sports teams located in New York have ownership interests in programming networks featuring the games of their teams. Distributors may also contract directly with the sports teams in their local service areas for the right to distribute games on their platforms.
The increasing amount of sports programming available on a national basis, including pursuant to national media rights arrangements (e.g., NBA on ABC, ESPN, and TNT and NHL on NBC and NBC Sports Network), as part of league-controlled sports programming networks (e.g., NBA TV and NHL Network), in out-of-market packages (e.g., NBA League Pass and NHL Center Ice), league and other websites, mobile applications and streaming outlets, may have an adverse impact on our competitive position as our programming networks compete for distribution and for viewers.
Competition for Advertising Revenue
The level of our advertising revenue depends in part upon unpredictable and volatile factors beyond our control, such as viewer preferences, the quality and appeal of the competing programming and the availability of other entertainment activities. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors — We Derive Substantial Revenues From the Sale of Advertising Time and Those Revenues Are Subject to a Number of Factors, Many of Which Are Beyond Our Control.”
Employees
As of June 30, 2019 we had approximately 180 full-time union and non-union employees and 640 part-time union and non-union employees. As of June 30, 2019, approximately 75% of the Company’s workforce is subject to collective bargaining agreements (“CBAs”). As of June 30, 2019, approximately 52% of the Company’s workforce that is subject to a CBA is covered by a CBA that has expired. In addition, as of June 30, 2019, approximately 15% of the Company’s workforce that is subject to a CBA is covered by a CBA that expires within the next fiscal year. Labor relations in general and in the sports and entertainment industry in particular can be volatile, though we believe that our current relationships with our unions taken as a whole are positive. 
Financial Information about Segments and Geographic Areas
The Company operates and reports financial information in one segment. Substantially all revenues and assets of the Company are attributed to or located in the United States, and are primarily concentrated in the New York City metropolitan area. Financial information for each of the years ended June 30, 2019, 2018, and 2017 is set forth in “Part II — Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” and “Part II — Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
