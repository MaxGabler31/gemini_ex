Durable companion cordless barcode scanners. During 2016 and 2017, we introduced our DuraScan® line of durable cordless barcode scanners in 4 models: linear imager (D700), laser (D730) and 2D imagers (D740 and D750). The D740 is an entry level 2D model. Using the same ergonomic form factor, these stand-alone barcode scanners have an IP54 durability rating, improved usability features including light indicators for battery and Bluetooth connection status and longer battery life. Our durable barcode scanners replaced earlier models and come in industrial colors: construction orange, safety green and utility gray.
 
Standard companion cordless barcode scanners. Our 7 Series standard barcode scanners are lightweight and ergonomically designed for easy handling as a stand-alone cordless barcode scanner. Our 7 Series come in 6 vivid colors: blue, gray, green, red, white and yellow. During 2017 we incorporated the improved features of our durable barcode scanners into a new SocketScan™ line of standard barcode scanners, linear imager (S700), laser (S730) and 2D imager (S740) that will replace current standard models during 2018.
 
Attachable cordless barcode scanners. Our SocketScan Series of attachable cordless barcode scanners (S800 linear imager and S850 2D imager) are attachable to smartphones, tablets and other mobile devices for more integrated barcode scanning. They attach with an easily detachable clip or may be used stand-alone. During 2016, we introduced a “DuraCase” sleeve solution designed to keep an iPod or smartphone and an 800 Series barcode scanner together, enabling both devices to be used and charged simultaneously and be held and operated with a single hand.
 
Contactless RFID/NFC reader writer. In 2017, Socket Mobile began offering a Contactless SmartTag Reader/Writer version of our durable handheld barcode scanner, (Model D600). The D600 can read and write many different types of electronic SmartTags or transfer data with other NFC enabled devices using Near Field Communications. SmartTags are used in many applications today, including applications for loyalty cards, identification cards, payment cards, coupons, event tickets and others which leverage the exchange of electronic “tokens”. These tokens can be exchanged via NFC enabled devices. Many smartphones support NFC communications and are expected to enable third party applications to transfer tokens utilizing NFC.
 
Software Developer Kit (Capture SDK). Our Software Developer Kit (Capture SDK) supports all our data capture devices with a single installation, making it easy for a developer to integrate our data capture capabilities into their application. Installing our data capture software enables their customers to choose any of our products that work best for them. Socket Mobile’s Capture SDK enables the developer to modify captured data, control the placement of the barcoded or RFID data in their application, and control the feedback to the user that the transaction and transmission was successfully completed. Socket Mobile’s Capture SDK also supports the built-in camera in a customer’s smartphone or tablet to be used for occasional or lower volume data collection requirements. The Capture SDK is upgraded from time to time to use tools integrated with software build environments such as CocoaPods, Maven and NuGet, to add support for high level frameworks such as Xamarin, Cordova and Java, and to add other features to make it easier for developers to integrate our data capture software into their applications.

Competition and Competitive Risks
 
The overall market for mobile handheld data capture solutions is both complex and competitive. Our barcode scanning hardware products compete with similar hardware products in all our markets in the United States, Europe and Asia and we differentiate our products with our software developer kit and our underlying data capture software designed to work with smartphones, tablets and other mobile computers running the Apple, Android and Windows operating systems. Our longtime focus on creating innovative mobile solutions for the mobile workforce has resulted in good brand name recognition and reputation. We believe that our brand name identifies our products as durable, dependable, ergonomic, and easy to use, all features designed for a mobile worker while mobile, and the breadth of our product offerings, including the extensive advanced features of our software and software developer kit, will continue to differentiate us relative to our competitors.
 
Cordless Barcode Scanning. We offer a full range of handheld cordless barcode scanners connecting to smartphones, tablets and other computing devices over Bluetooth. Our Software Developer Kit (Capture SDK) enables registered third party application developers to integrate the features of our Data Capture software into their applications and helps differentiate our products. Our Cordless Barcode Scanners face competition from similar products from Koamtec, Code Corporation and Opticon (Japan). Barcodes may also be scanned using the built-in camera in smartphones or tablets with applications from Scandit or Manatee Works. However, scanning using the built-in camera is typically slower and harder to aim, especially as the camera pixel count gets larger. Users may choose a barcode scanner that connects directly to an Apple tablet, iPhone or computer such as offered by Infinite Peripherals and Honeywell. Users also may choose more rugged barcode scanners as an alternative, some of which are integrated into computing devices from manufacturers such as Datalogic, Honeywell®, and Zebra Technologies. Many of these devices are not Apple certified. Many connect to Apple devices over Bluetooth in keyboard emulation mode and do not offer extensive tools for software developers such as our software developer kit (Capture SDK) to integrate features of our sophisticated data collection scanning software into data capture applications.
 
Contactless RFID/NFC Reader/Writer. Socket Mobile developed and commenced sales in 2017 of a Contactless RFID/NFC Reader/Writer, D600 version of our durable handheld barcode scanner. The D600 can read and write many different types of electronic SmartTags, including NFC. SmartTags are used in many applications today, like digital wallet applications for loyalty cards, identification cards, payment cards, coupons, event tickets and others which leverage the exchange of electronic “tokens”. We are an early entrant into this market and do not face significant head to head competition from alternative reader/writer devices.
 
Proprietary Technology and Intellectual Property
 
We have been granted 34 U.S. patents and 10 design patents and have other patent applications under review. We have registered trademarks with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office for the mark “Socket”, our logo, DuraScan, and SocketScan. We have a trademark application pending in China for the Socket logo.
 
We have developed technological building blocks that enhance our ability to design new hardware and software products, to offer products which run on multiple software and hardware platforms, and to manufacture and package products efficiently.
