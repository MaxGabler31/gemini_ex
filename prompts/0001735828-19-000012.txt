ITEM 1. | BUSINESS


References in this annual report on Form 10-K to “Legacy Reserves,” “Legacy,” “we,” “our,” “us,” or like terms refer to Legacy Reserves Inc. and its subsidiaries for the periods after September 19, 2018, the date the Corporate Reorganization was consummated (as defined below). For the periods prior to September 20, 2018, unless the context requires otherwise or unless otherwise noted, all references to “Legacy Reserves,” “Legacy LP,” “Legacy,” the “Company,” “we,” “us,” “our” or like terms are to Legacy Reserves LP and its subsidiaries.


Legacy Reserves Inc.

Legacy Reserves Inc. is a Delaware corporation incorporated in 2018 in connection with the Corporate Reorganization, as defined below. We are an independent energy company engaged in the development, production and acquisition of oil and natural gas properties in the United States. Our current operations are focused on the horizontal development of unconventional plays in the Permian Basin and the cost-efficient management of shallow-decline oil and natural gas wells in the Permian Basin, East Texas, Rocky Mountain and Mid-Continent regions.

Our oil and natural gas production and reserve data as of December 31, 2018 are as follows:

• | we had proved reserves of approximately 164.9 MMBoe, of which 63% were natural gas, 37% were oil and natural gas liquids (“NGLs”) and 96% were classified as proved developed producing; and


• | our proved reserves to production ratio was approximately 9.5 years based on the annualized production volumes for the three months ended December 31, 2018.

We have built a diverse portfolio of oil and natural gas reserves primarily through the acquisition of producing oil and natural gas properties and the development of properties in established producing trends. These acquisitions, along with our ongoing development activities and operational improvements, have allowed us to achieve significant production and reserve growth over the last decade.
On September 20, 2018, we completed our transition to a corporation pursuant to the Amended and Restated Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated July 9, 2018, by and among Legacy Inc., Legacy LP, Legacy Reserves GP, LLC (the “General Partner”) and Legacy Reserves Merger Sub LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Legacy Inc. (“Merger Sub”), and the GP Purchase Agreement, dated March 23, 2018, by and among Legacy Inc., the General Partner, Legacy LP, Lion GP Interests, LLC, Moriah Properties Limited, and Brothers Production Properties, Ltd., Brothers Production Company, Inc., Brothers Operating Company, Inc., J&W McGraw Properties, Ltd., DAB Resources, Ltd. and H2K Holdings, Ltd. (such transactions referred to herein collectively as the “Corporate Reorganization”). Upon the consummation of the Corporate Reorganization:

• | Legacy, which prior to the Corporate Reorganization, was a wholly owned subsidiary of the General Partner, acquired all of the issued and outstanding limited liability company interests in the General Partner and became the sole member of the General Partner with the General Partner becoming a subsidiary of Legacy; and


• | Legacy LP merged with Merger Sub, with Legacy LP continuing as the surviving entity and as a subsidiary of Legacy, the limited partner interests of Legacy LP, other than the incentive distribution units in Legacy LP, were exchanged for shares of Legacy’s common stock, par value $0.01 (“common stock”) and the general partner interest remained outstanding.

2018 and Current Highlights

• | Deployed $229.5 million of development capital expenditures, primarily focused on the drilling and completion of our Permian Basin horizontal development assets;


• | Increased revenue 27%, relative to 2017, to $554.9 million;


• | Increased oil production 32% relative to 2017, to 18,162 Bbls/d;


• | Completed our transition to a corporation and commenced trading as Legacy Reserves Inc.

• | In March 2019, we extended the term on our Credit Agreement through May 31, 2019.

Business Strategy

The key elements of our business strategy are to:

• | Prudently deploy capital in development opportunities that maximize value;


• | Identify, acquire and exploit additional opportunities to broaden our operational footprint and enrich our future growth potential;


• | Utilize our extensive Permian portfolio of small-tract acreage to increase our drillable footprint;


• | Maintain efficient operations to minimize production declines, improve lifting costs and well economics;


• | Rationalize our asset base by regularly reviewing our asset portfolio and divesting non-core assets; and


• | Maintain capital budget flexibility to preserve liquidity.

2019 Operating Focus 
In 2019, we plan to focus on the development of our Permian Basin horizontal drilling inventory. Our development capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $135 million, subject to any limitations contained in the agreements governing our indebtedness, compared to approximately $229.6 million in 2018 and $176.8 million in 2017. We expect to fund our 2019 investments from cash flow from operations. Should projected commodity prices deviate from our current outlook, we may elect to make adjustments to our level of capital expenditures.
Operating Regions
Permian Basin. The Permian Basin, one of the largest and most prolific oil and natural gas producing basins in the United States, was discovered in 1921 and extends over 100,000 square miles in West Texas and southeast New Mexico. It is characterized by oil and natural gas fields with long production histories and multiple producing formations. These stacked formations have been further drilled and produced following the advent and refinement of horizontal drilling. Currently, the majority of the rigs running in the Permian Basin are drilling horizontal wells. The Permian Basin has historically been our largest operating region and still contains the majority of our drilling locations and development projects. Our producing wells in the Permian Basin are generally characterized as oil wells that also produce high-Btu casinghead gas with significant NGL content.
East Texas. We entered the East Texas region through our July 2015 acquisitions in Anderson, Freestone, Houston, Leon, Limestone, Robertson and Shelby counties. The properties in East Texas consist of mature, low-decline natural gas wells. The East Texas properties are supported by over 600 miles of natural gas gathering system and a treating plant we acquired as part of those acquisitions.
Rocky Mountain. Our Rocky Mountain region was originally comprised by acquisitions in the Big Horn, Wind River and Powder River Basins in Wyoming largely consisting of mature oil wells with a natural water drive producing primarily from the Dinwoody-Phosphoria, Tensleep and Minnelusa formations. We expanded our footprint with our acquisition of oil properties in North Dakota and Montana in 2012 and our acquisition of non-operated natural gas properties in Colorado in 2014. The North Dakota properties produce primarily from the Madison and Bakken formations, while the Montana properties produce mostly from the Sawtooth and Bowes formations. The Colorado properties produce primarily from the Williams Fork formation.

Mid-Continent. Our properties in the Mid-Continent region are located in Oklahoma. These properties were acquired in 2007.

Our proved reserves by operating region as of December 31, 2018 are as follows: 

Proved Reserves by Operating Region as of December 31, 2018
Operating Regions | Oil (MBbls) | Natural Gas (MMcf) | | NGLs(MBbls) | Total (MBoe) | % Liquids | | % PDP | % Total
Permian Basin | 44,671 | | 116,879 | | 660 | | 64,811 | | 70 | % | 90 | % | 39 | %
East Texas | 103 | | 292,249 | | 211 | | 49,022 | | 1 | % | 100 | % | 30 | %
Rocky Mountain | 6,479 | | 206,541 | | 7,257 | | 48,160 | | 29 | % | 100 | % | 29 | %

Total | 52,077 | | 621,720 | | 9,211 | | 164,909 | | 37 | % | | | 100 | %

Development Activities
 Our development projects are primarily focused on drilling and completing new wells, but also include accessing additional productive or improving existing formations in existing well-bores, and artificial lift equipment enhancement, as well as secondary (waterflood) and tertiary recovery projects.
The table below details the activity in our PUD locations from December 31, 2017 to December 31, 2018: 

 | Gross Locations | | Net Locations | | Net Volume (MBoe)
Balance, December 31, 2017 | 40 | | | 20.1 | | 7,963 | 
PUDs converted to PDP by drilling | (19 | ) | | (9.5 | ) | (5,807 | )
PUDs removed due to performance (a) | (2 | ) | | (0.3 | ) | (89 | )
PUDs removed from future drilling schedule (b) | (3 | ) | | (1.0 | ) | (570 | )
Extensions and discoveries (a) | 16 | | | 10.8 | | 4,659 | 
Other | — | | | 0.3 | | 40 | 
Balance, December 31, 2018 | 32 | | | 20.4 | | 6,196 | 

________________

(a) | PUDs removed due to performance or added due to extensions and discoveries are those PUDs removed or added, as applicable, due to new or revised engineering, geologic and economic evaluations such as offset well production data, the drilling of offset wells, new geologic data or changes in projected capital costs or product prices. PUDs are removed or added depending on whether the technical criteria for the proved undeveloped reserve classification is satisfied and, in the case of additions due to performance, whether the well is scheduled to be drilled within five years after initial recognition as proved reserves.

The increases in PUDs due to extensions and discoveries were driven by offset drilling in connection with our drilling program in the Permian Basin, which includes the horizontal Spraberry, horizontal Wolfcamp and horizontal Bone Spring wells.
The reduction in PUDs due to performance was due to the removal of PUDs as they became uneconomic as of December 31, 2018 based on offset well performance. 

(b) | These PUD locations were removed from our PUD inventory because of non-consenting working interest owners. Due to their ownership level, their consent is required in order to develop the PUD.

As of December 31, 2018, we identified 10 gross (6.4 net) recompletion and fracture stimulation projects.
Excluding any potential acquisitions, we expect to make capital expenditures of approximately $135 million during the year ending December 31, 2019 subject to any limitations contained in the agreements governing our indebtedness.
A significant portion of our horizontal operated development activity in the Permian Basin has been pursued through our development agreement (as amended, the "Development Agreement") entered into in 2015 with Jupiter JV, LP ("Investor"), which 
 3

was formed by certain of TPG Sixth Street Partners' investment funds. Our capital resources and liquidity have benefitted from our interest in the development activity under the Development Agreement as described below.
On August 1, 2017, we, along with Investor, entered into the First Amended and Restated Development Agreement (the “Restated Agreement”), which amended and restated the Development Agreement pursuant to which we and Investor agreed to participate in the funding, exploration, development and operation of certain of our undeveloped oil and gas properties in the Permian Basin. Under the Restated Agreement and through subsequent elections, the parties committed to develop a tranche of 26 wells plus 9 wells in the Restated Agreement's area of mutual interest (the “Second Tranche”). Investor’s share of its development costs was limited to $80 million.
In connection with the Restated Agreement in 2017, we made a payment of $141 million (the “Acceleration Payment”) to cause the reversion of Investor's working interest from 80% to 15% of the parties' combined interests in the 48 wells contained in the first tranche such that our working interest reverted from 20% to 85% of the parties' combined working interests in all such wells, and all undeveloped assets subject to the terms of the Restated Agreement reverted back to us. The reversion of interests as a result of the Acceleration Payment was accounted for as an asset acquisition. Pursuant to the Restated Agreement, Investor funded 40% of the costs to the parties' combined interests to develop the wells in the Second Tranche in exchange for an undivided 33.7% working interest of our original working interest in the wells, subject to a reversionary interest of 6.3% of our original working interest in the wells upon the occurrence of Investor achieving a 15% internal rate of return in the aggregate with respect to such tranche of wells. No additional development is expected to occur pursuant to the Restated Agreement. 
The Acceleration Payment was funded by a $145 million draw under our Term Loan Credit Agreement.
During 2018, we completed several individually immaterial divestitures totaling $55.0 million net of costs subject to customary post-closing obligations. These divestitures consisted of dispositions of unproved leasehold acreage and low-volume, high-cost producing properties and resulted in a gain on disposal of assets of $23.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018.
Oil and Natural Gas Derivative Activities

Our business strategy includes entering into oil and natural gas derivative contracts which are designed to mitigate price risk for a portion of our oil, NGL and natural gas production from time to time. At December 31, 2018, we had in place oil and natural gas derivatives covering portions of our estimated future oil and natural gas production. Our derivative contracts are in the form of fixed price swaps and enhanced swaps for NYMEX WTI oil; fixed price swaps for NYMEX Henry Hub; and fixed price swaps for the Midland-to-Cushing oil differential.
Marketing and Major Purchasers 

 For the year ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, Legacy sold oil, NGL and natural gas production representing 10% or more of total revenues to the purchasers as detailed in the table below. For the year ended December 31, 2016, Legacy did not sell oil, NGL or natural gas production representing 10% or more of total revenue to any one customer.

 | 2018 | 2017 | 2016
Plains Marketing, LP | 20% | 10% | 6% 
Rio Energy International Inc | 13% | 9% | 3% 

 Our oil sales prices are based on formula pricing and calculated either using a discount to NYMEX WTI oil or using the appropriate buyer’s posted price less a regional differential and transportation fee.

Although we believe we could identify a substitute purchaser if we were to lose any of our oil or natural gas purchasers, the loss could temporarily cause a loss or deferral of production and sale of our oil and natural gas in that particular purchaser’s service area. However, if one or more of our larger purchasers ceased purchasing oil or natural gas altogether, the loss of any such purchaser could have a detrimental impact on our short-term production volumes and our ability to find substitute purchasers for our production volumes in a timely manner, though we do not believe this would have a long-term material adverse effect on our operations.

Competition

We operate in a highly competitive environment for acquiring leases and properties, securing and retaining trained personnel and service providers and marketing oil and natural gas. Our competitors may be able to pay more for leases, productive oil and natural gas properties and development projects and to evaluate, bid for and purchase a greater number of properties and prospects than our financial or personnel resources permit. Our ability to acquire additional properties and to find and develop reserves in the future will depend on our ability to evaluate and select suitable properties and to consummate transactions in a highly competitive environment.
Seasonal Nature of Business

The demand for oil and natural gas can be seasonal based on motor vehicle driving patterns and heating and cooling demands related to weather. Our Rockies' oil prices suffer relative to WTI in the winter due to reduced demand for asphaltic crude. Refinery turnarounds in the Permian typically occur in the first quarter, and, historically, we have experienced wider oil differentials during this time.
Environmental Matters and Regulation

General. Our operations are subject to stringent and complex federal, state and local laws and regulations governing environmental protection as well as the discharge of materials into the environment. These laws and regulations may, among other things:

• | require the acquisition of various permits before drilling commences;


• | restrict the types, quantities and concentration of various substances that can be released into the environment in connection with oil and natural gas drilling and production activities;


• | limit or prohibit drilling activities on certain lands lying within wilderness, wetlands and other protected areas; and


• | require remedial measures to mitigate pollution from former and ongoing operations, such as requirements to close pits and plug abandoned wells.

 These laws, rules and regulations may also restrict the rate of oil and natural gas production below the rate that would otherwise be possible. The regulatory burden on the oil and natural gas industry increases the cost of doing business in the industry and consequently affects profitability. Additionally, Congress and federal and state agencies frequently revise environmental laws and regulations, and any changes that result in more stringent and costly waste handling, disposal and cleanup requirements for the oil and natural gas industry could have a significant impact on our operating costs.

The following is a summary of some of the existing laws, rules and regulations to which our operations are subject.

Waste Handling. The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, or RCRA, and comparable state statutes, regulate the generation, transportation, treatment, storage, disposal and cleanup of hazardous and non-hazardous wastes. Under the auspices of the United States Environmental Protection Agency, or the EPA, the individual states administer some or all of the provisions of RCRA, sometimes in conjunction with their own, more stringent requirements. Drilling fluids, produced waters, and most of the other wastes associated with the exploration, development, and production of crude oil or natural gas are currently regulated under RCRA’s non-hazardous waste provisions. However, it is possible that certain oil and natural gas drilling and production wastes now classified as non-hazardous could be classified as hazardous wastes in the future. Any such change could result in an increase in our costs to manage and dispose of wastes, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position.

Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act. The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, or CERCLA, also known as the Superfund law, may impose joint and several liability, without regard to fault or legality of conduct, on classes of persons who are considered to be responsible for the release of a hazardous substance into the environment. These persons include the owner or operator of the site where the release occurred and anyone who disposed or arranged for the disposal of a hazardous substance released at the site. Under CERCLA, such persons may be subject to joint and several liability for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances that have been released into the environment, for damages to natural resources and for the costs of certain health studies. In addition, it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third-parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the hazardous substances released into the environment.
 5


We currently own, lease, or operate numerous properties that have been used for oil and natural gas development and production for many years. Although we believe that we have utilized operating and waste disposal practices that were standard in the industry at the time, hazardous substances, wastes, or hydrocarbons may have been released on or under the properties owned or leased by us, or on or under other locations, including off-site locations, where such substances have been taken for disposal. In addition, most of our properties have been operated by third parties or by previous owners or operators whose treatment and disposal of hazardous substances, wastes, or hydrocarbons were not under our control. These properties and the substances disposed or released on them may be subject to CERCLA, RCRA, and analogous state laws. Under such laws, we could be required to remove previously disposed of substances and wastes, remediate contaminated property, or perform remedial plugging or pit closure operations to prevent future contamination.

Water Discharges. The Federal Water Pollution Control Act, or the Clean Water Act, and analogous state laws, impose restrictions and strict controls with respect to the discharge of pollutants, including spills and leaks of oil and other substances, into waters of the United States. The discharge of pollutants into regulated waters is prohibited, except in accordance with the terms of a permit issued by the EPA or an analogous state agency. Federal and state regulatory agencies can impose administrative, civil and criminal penalties for non-compliance with discharge permits or other requirements of the Clean Water Act and analogous state laws and regulations.

 The Oil Pollution Act of 1990, as amended or OPA, which amends the Clean Water Act, establishes strict liability for owners and operators of facilities that cause a release of oil into waters of the United States. In addition, owners and operators of facilities that store oil above threshold amounts must develop and implement spill response plans.

Safe Drinking Water Act. Our injection well facilities may be regulated under the Underground Injection Control, or UIC, program established under the Safe Drinking Water Act, or SDWA. The state and federal regulations implementing that program require mechanical integrity testing and financial assurance for wells covered under the program. The federal Energy Policy Act of 2005 amended the UIC provisions of the federal SDWA to exclude hydraulic fracturing from the definition of underground injection. From time to time, Congress has considered bills to repeal this exemption. The EPA conducted a study of hydraulic fracturing and issued a final report in December 2016. This study and other studies that may be undertaken by EPA or other federal agencies could spur initiatives to further regulate hydraulic fracturing under the SDWA or other statutory and/or regulatory mechanisms.
Endangered Species Act. Additionally, environmental laws such as the Endangered Species Act, or ESA, may impact exploration, development and production activities on public or private lands. The ESA provides broad protection for species of fish, wildlife and plants that are listed as threatened or endangered in the United States, and prohibits taking of endangered species. Federal agencies are required to ensure that any action authorized, funded or carried out by them is not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of listed species or modify their critical habitat. Some of our facilities may be located in areas that are designated as habitat for endangered or threatened species. Though the rule listing the Lesser Prairie Chicken was vacated, portions of our properties in New Mexico and west Texas are enrolled in Habitat Conservation Plans and as a result we are subject to certain practices and restrictions designed to protect the habitat of the Lesser Prairie Chicken. We believe that we are in substantial 
compliance with the ESA and the practices and restrictions related to the Lesser Prairie Chicken should not result in material costs or constraints to our operations. However, the designation of previously unidentified endangered or threatened species could cause us to incur additional costs or become subject to operating restrictions or bans in the affected areas.
Air Emissions. The Federal Clean Air Act, and comparable state laws, regulates emissions of various air pollutants through air emissions permitting programs and the imposition of other requirements. In addition, the EPA has developed, and continues to develop, stringent regulations governing emissions of toxic air pollutants at specified sources including pursuing the energy extraction sector under a National Compliance Initiative. Federal and state regulatory agencies can impose administrative, civil and criminal penalties for non-compliance with air permits or other requirements of the Federal Clean Air Act and associated state laws and regulations. In addition, more stringent federal, state and local regulations, such as the EPA rules issued in May 2016 regarding the aggregation of exploration and production equipment as a single source could result in increased costs and the need for operational changes. Finally, the EPA issued rules in May 2016 covering methane emissions from new oil and natural gas industry operations which could result in additional costs and restrictions on our operations.

OSHA and Other Laws and Regulation. We are subject to the requirements of the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSHA) and comparable state statutes. The OSHA hazard communication standard, the EPA community right-to-know regulations under Title III of CERCLA and similar state statutes require that we organize and/or disclose information about hazardous materials used or produced in our operations. We believe that we are in compliance with these applicable requirements and with other OSHA and comparable requirements.

 6

In 2009, the EPA began to adopt regulations that would require a reduction in emissions of greenhouse gases from certain stationary sources and has required monitoring and reporting for other stationary sources, including the oil and natural gas production industry. In May 2016, the EPA finalized regulations that establish new controls for emissions of methane and volatile organic compounds from oil and natural gas operations. Additional regional, federal or state requirements may be imposed in the future. New legislation or regulatory programs that restrict emissions of greenhouse gases in areas in which we conduct business could have an adverse effect on our operations and demand for our products. Currently, our operations are not adversely impacted by existing state and local climate change initiatives and, at this time, it is not possible to accurately estimate how potential future laws or regulations addressing greenhouse gas emissions would impact our business. Finally, it should be noted that some scientists have concluded that increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases in the Earth’s atmosphere may produce climate changes that have significant physical effects, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, floods and other climatic events; if any such effects were to occur, they could have an adverse effect on our exploration and production operations.

We believe that we are in substantial compliance with all existing environmental laws and regulations applicable to our current operations and that our continued compliance with existing requirements will not have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. For instance, we did not incur any material capital expenditures for remediation or pollution control activities for the year ended December 31, 2018. Additionally, as of the date of this document, we are not aware of any environmental issues or claims that require material capital expenditures during 2019. However, we cannot assure investors that the passage of more stringent laws or regulations in the future will not have a negative impact on our financial position or results of operations.
National Environmental Policy Act and Activities on Federal Lands.  Oil and natural gas exploitation and production activities on federal lands are subject to NEPA. NEPA requires federal agencies, including the Department of the Interior, to evaluate major agency actions having the potential to significantly impact the environment. In the course of such evaluations, an agency will typically prepare an Environmental Assessment to assess the potential direct, indirect and cumulative impacts of a proposed project and, if necessary, will prepare a more detailed Environmental Impact Statement that may be made available for public review and comment. Our current production activities, as well as proposed development plans, on federal lands require governmental permits or similar authorizations that are subject to the requirements of NEPA. This process has the potential to delay, limit or increase the cost of developing oil and natural gas projects. Authorizations under NEPA are also subject to protest, appeal or litigation, any or all of which may delay or halt projects. 
Federal, State or Native American Leases.  Our operations on federal, state, or Native American oil and natural gas leases are subject to numerous restrictions, including nondiscrimination statutes. Such operations must be conducted pursuant to certain on-site security regulations and other permits and authorizations issued by the Bureau of Land Management, or BLM, and other agencies. For example, in September 2018, the BLM finalized regulations which update standards to reduce venting and flaring from oil and gas production on public lands.
Other Regulation of the Oil and Natural Gas Industry

The oil and natural gas industry is extensively regulated by numerous federal, state and local authorities. Legislation affecting the oil and natural gas industry is under constant review for amendment or expansion, frequently increasing the regulatory burden. Also, numerous departments and agencies, both federal and state, are authorized by statute to issue rules and regulations binding on the oil and gas industry and its individual members, some of which carry substantial penalties for failure to comply. Although the regulatory burden on the oil and natural gas industry increases our cost of doing business and, consequently, affects our profitability, these burdens generally do not affect us any differently or to any greater or lesser extent than they affect other companies in the oil and natural gas industry with similar types, quantities and locations of production.

Legislation continues to be introduced in Congress and development of regulations continues in the Department of Homeland Security and other agencies concerning the security of industrial facilities, including oil and natural gas facilities. Our operations may be subject to such laws and regulations. Presently, it is not possible to accurately estimate the costs we could incur to comply with any such facility security laws or regulations, but such expenditures could be substantial.

Drilling and Production. Our operations are subject to various types of regulation at federal, state and local levels. These types of regulation include requiring permits for the drilling of wells, drilling bonds and reports concerning operations. Most states, and some counties and municipalities, in which we operate also regulate one or more of the following:

• | the location of wells;


• | the method of drilling and casing wells;

 7


• | the surface use and restoration of properties upon which wells are drilled;


• | the plugging and abandoning of wells; and


• | notice to surface owners and other third parties.

State laws regulate the size and shape of drilling and spacing units or pro-ration units governing the pooling of oil and natural gas properties. Some states allow forced pooling or integration of tracts to facilitate exploration while other states rely on voluntary pooling of lands and leases. In some instances, forced pooling or unitization may be implemented by third parties and may reduce our interest in the unitized properties. In addition, state conservation laws establish maximum rates of production from oil and natural gas wells, generally regulate and seek to restrict the venting or flaring of natural gas and impose requirements regarding the ratability of production. These laws and regulations may limit the amount of oil and natural gas we can produce from our wells or limit the number of wells or the locations at which we can drill. Moreover, each state generally imposes a production or severance tax with respect to the production and sale of oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids within its jurisdiction.

Natural gas regulation. The availability, terms and cost of transportation significantly affect sales of natural gas. The interstate transportation and sale or resale of natural gas is subject to federal regulation, including regulation of the terms, conditions and rates for interstate transportation, storage and various other matters, primarily by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, or the FERC. Federal and state regulations govern the price and terms for access to natural gas pipeline transportation. The FERC’s regulations for interstate natural gas transmission in some circumstances may also affect the intrastate transportation of natural gas.

Although natural gas prices are currently unregulated, Congress historically has been active in the area of natural gas regulation. We cannot predict whether new legislation to regulate natural gas might be proposed, what proposals, if any, might actually be enacted by Congress or the various state legislatures, and what effect, if any, the proposals might have on the operations of the underlying properties. Sales of condensate and natural gas liquids are not currently regulated and are made at market prices.

State regulation. The various states regulate the drilling for, and the production, gathering and sale of, oil and natural gas, including imposing severance taxes and requirements for obtaining drilling permits. For example, Texas currently imposes a 4.6% severance tax on oil production and a 7.5% severance tax on natural gas production. New Mexico currently imposes a 3.75% severance tax on both oil and natural gas production. States also regulate the method of developing new fields, the spacing and operation of wells and the prevention of waste of natural gas resources. States may regulate rates of production and may establish maximum daily production allowable from natural gas wells based on market demand or resource conservation, or both. States do not regulate wellhead prices or engage in other similar direct economic regulation, but there can be no assurance that they will not do so in the future. The effect of these regulations may be to limit the amounts of natural gas that may be produced from our wells, and to limit the number of wells or locations we can drill.

The petroleum industry is also subject to compliance with various other federal, state and local regulations and laws. Some of those laws relate to resource conservation and equal employment opportunity. We do not believe that compliance with these laws will have a material adverse effect on us.

Employees

As of December 31, 2018, we had 337 employees, none of whom are subject to collective bargaining agreements. We also contract for the services of independent consultants involved in land, engineering, regulatory, accounting, financial and other disciplines as needed. We believe that we have a favorable relationship with our employees.
Offices

Our principal offices are located in Midland, Texas at 303 W. Wall Street. In addition to our principal offices, we have regional offices located in Cody, Wyoming and in The Woodlands, Texas.
