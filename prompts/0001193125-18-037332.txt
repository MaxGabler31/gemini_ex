 We intend to leverage our core strengths, including our advantaged geographic footprint, market leadership positions and portfolio of iconic brands and innovation platforms, to grow our people, grow our business and grow our impact.

 | Grow our Business: We aim to deliver strong, profitable long-term growth by accelerating our core snacks business and expanding the reach of our Power Brands globally. Leveraging our Power Brands (including Oreo, LU and belVita biscuits; Milka, Cadbury Dairy Milk and Toblerone chocolate; Trident gum and Halls candy) and our innovation platforms, we plan to innovate boldly and connect with our consumers wherever they are. As consumers seek out foods that have better well-being credentials, we are actively evolving our portfolio by expanding the well-being brands in our portfolio, enhancing the nutrition and ingredient profile of our Power Brands and inspiring consumers to snack mindfully by providing more portion control treats. We plan to reach consumers in new markets around the world, using both traditional and digital channels. While we already have a strong presence in modern grocery stores, we are increasing our presence in higher growth non-grocery channels, including e-commerce. To fuel these investments, we have been working to optimize our cost structure. These efforts include reinventing our supply chain, including adding and upgrading to more efficient production lines, while reducing the complexity of our product offerings, ingredients and number of suppliers. We also continue to aggressively manage our overhead costs. We have embedded zero-based budgeting practices across the organization to identify potential areas of cost reductions and capture and sustain savings within our ongoing operating budgets. Through these actions, we are leveraging our brands, platforms and capabilities to drive long-term value and return on investment for our shareholders.

 | Grow our Impact: We are focused on helping people snack in balance and enjoy life with products that are safely and sustainably sourced, produced and delivered. We are committed to driving business growth while making positive change in the world. We use our global scale and focus where we can have the greatest impact on people and planet - including communities, safety, sustainability and well-being snacks. This includes reducing our environmental footprint, empowering farmers in our supply chain and supporting the communities where our snacks are sourced, produced and sold.

Reportable Segments 
 Our operations and management structure are organized into four reportable operating segments: 
 
 | Latin America
--+--------------


 | Asia, Middle East, and Africa (AMEA)
--+---------------------------------------


 | Europe
--+-------


 | North America
--+--------------

 On October 1, 2016, we integrated our Eastern Europe, Middle East, and Africa (EEMEA) operating segment into our Europe and Asia Pacific operating segments to further leverage and optimize the operating scale built within the Europe and Asia Pacific regions. Russia, Ukraine, Turkey, Belarus, Georgia and Kazakhstan were combined within our Europe region, while the remaining Middle East and African countries were combined within our Asia Pacific region to form the AMEA operating segment. We have reflected the segment change as if it had occurred in all periods presented. 
 We manage our operations by region to leverage regional operating scale, manage different and changing business environments more effectively and pursue growth opportunities as they arise in our key markets. Our regional management teams have responsibility for the business, product categories and financial results in the regions. 
 We use segment operating income to evaluate segment performance and allocate resources. We believe it is appropriate to disclose this measure to help investors analyze segment performance and trends. For a definition and reconciliation of segment operating income to consolidated pre-tax earnings as well as other information on our segments, see Note 16, Segment Reporting. 
 Our segment net revenues for each of the last three years were:

 The deconsolidation of our global coffee business in 2015, the deconsolidation of our Venezuela operations beginning with our 2016 results, currency and other items significantly affect the comparability of our consolidated and segment operating results from year to year. Please see Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for a review of our operating results. 
 Our brands span five product categories: 
 
 | Biscuits (including cookies, crackers and salted snacks)

Significant Divestitures and Acquisitions 
 For information on our significant divestitures and acquisitions, please refer to Note 2, Divestitures and Acquisitions, and specifically, in connection with our global coffee business deconsolidation, see the discussions under JDE Coffee Business Transactions and Keurig Transaction. 
 Customers 
 No single customer accounted for 10% or more of our net revenues from continuing operations in 2017. Our five largest customers accounted for 15.6% and our ten largest customers accounted for 21.4% of net revenues from continuing operations in 2017. 
Seasonality 
 Demand for our products is generally balanced over the first three quarters of the year and increases in the fourth quarter primarily because of holidays and other seasonal events. Depending on when Easter falls, Easter holiday sales may shift between the first and second quarter. We build inventory based on expected demand and typically fill customer orders within a few days of receipt so the backlog of unfilled orders is not material. Funding for working capital items, including inventory and receivables, is normally sourced from operating cash flows and short-term commercial paper borrowings. For additional information on our liquidity, working capital management, cash flow and financing activities, see Liquidity and Capital Resources, Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, and Note 7, Debt and Borrowing Arrangements, appearing later in this 10-K filing. 
 Competition 
 We face competition in all aspects of our business. Competitors include large multinational as well as numerous local and regional companies. Some competitors have different profit objectives and investment time horizons than we do and therefore approach pricing and promotional decisions differently. We compete based on product quality, brand recognition and loyalty, service, product innovation, taste, convenience, nutritional value, the ability to identify and satisfy consumer preferences, effectiveness of sales and marketing, routes to market and distribution networks, promotional activity and price. Improving our market position or introducing a new product requires substantial research, development, advertising and promotional expenditures. We believe these investments lead to better products for the consumer and support our growth and market position. 
 
4 
 
Distribution and Marketing 
 Across our segments, we generally sell our products to supermarket chains, wholesalers, supercenters, club stores, mass merchandisers, distributors, convenience stores, gasoline stations, drug stores, value stores and other retail food outlets. We distribute our products through direct store delivery, company-owned and satellite warehouses, distribution centers and other facilities. We use the services of independent sales offices and agents in some of our international locations. 
 Consumers are also increasingly shopping online. And we are building a global e-commerce organization and capabilities to pursue online growth with partners in key markets around the world, including both pure e-tailers and brick-and-mortar retailers. We continue to invest in both talent and capabilities. Our e-commerce channel strategies will play a critical role in our ambition to be the best snacking company in the world. 
 We conduct marketing efforts through three principal sets of activities: (i) consumer marketing and advertising including on-air, print, outdoor, digital and social media and other product promotions; (ii) consumer sales incentives such as coupons and rebates; and (iii) trade promotions to support price features, displays and other merchandising of our products by our customers. 
 Raw Materials and Packaging 
 We purchase and use large quantities of commodities, including cocoa, dairy, wheat, palm and other vegetable oils, sugar and other sweeteners, flavoring agents and nuts. In addition, we purchase and use significant quantities of packaging materials to package our products and natural gas, fuels and electricity for our factories and warehouses. We monitor worldwide supply, commodity cost and currency trends so we can cost-effectively secure ingredients, packaging and fuel required for production. 
 A number of external factors such as weather conditions, commodity market conditions, currency fluctuations and the effects of governmental agricultural or other programs affect the cost and availability of raw materials and agricultural materials used in our products. We address higher commodity costs and currency impacts primarily through hedging, higher pricing and manufacturing and overhead cost control. We use hedging techniques to limit the impact of fluctuations in the cost of our principal raw materials; however, we may not be able to fully hedge against commodity cost changes, and our hedging strategies may not protect us from increases in specific raw material costs. 
 While the costs of our principal raw materials fluctuate, we believe there will continue to be an adequate supply of the raw materials we use and that they will generally remain available from numerous sources. For additional information on our commodity costs, refer to the Commodity Trends section within Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 
 Intellectual Property 
 Our intellectual property rights (including trademarks, patents, copyrights, registered designs, proprietary trade secrets, technology and know-how) are material to our business. 
 We own numerous trademarks and patents in many countries around the world. Depending on the country, trademarks remain valid for as long as they are in use or their registration status is maintained. Trademark registrations generally are for renewable, fixed terms. We also have patents for a number of current and potential products. Our patents cover inventions ranging from basic packaging techniques to processes relating to specific products and to the products themselves. Our issued patents extend for varying periods according to the date of patent application filing or grant and the legal term of patents in the various countries where patent protection is obtained. The actual protection afforded by a patent, which can vary from country to country, depends upon the type of patent, the scope of its coverage as determined by the patent office or courts in the country, and the availability of legal remedies in the country. While our patent portfolio is material to our business, the loss of one patent or a group of related patents would not have a material adverse effect on our business. 
 
5 
 
From time to time, we grant third parties licenses to use one or more of our trademarks, patents and/or proprietary trade secrets in connection with the manufacture, sale or distribution of third party products. Similarly, we sell some products under brands, patents and/or proprietary trade secrets we license from third parties. In our agreement with Kraft Foods Group, Inc. (Kraft Foods Group, which is now part of The Kraft Heinz Company), we each granted the other party various licenses to use certain of our and their respective intellectual property rights in named jurisdictions following the spin-off of our North American grocery business. 
 Research and Development 
 We pursue four objectives in research and development: product safety and quality, growth through new products, superior consumer satisfaction and reduced costs. Our innovation efforts focus on anticipating consumer demands and adapting quickly to changing market trends. Wellness products and healthy snacking are a significant focus of our current research and development initiatives. These initiatives aim to accelerate our growth and margins by addressing consumer needs and market trends and leveraging our global innovation platforms, Power Brands and breakthrough technologies. In September 2016, we announced our plan to invest $65 million over 2017-2018 to build out and modernize our network of global research and development facilities. We are focusing our technical resources at nine large locations to drive global growth and innovation. We celebrated the official opening of our Wroclaw Poland Technical Center in 2017. Our global Technical Centers will enable greater effectiveness, improved efficiency and accelerated project delivery. These locations are in Curitiba, Brazil; Suzhou, China; Thane, India; Mexico City, Mexico; East Hanover, New Jersey; Wroclaw, Poland; Jurong, Singapore; Bournville, United Kingdom and Reading, United Kingdom. 
 At December 31, 2017, we had approximately 2,450 scientists and engineers, of which 1,900 are primarily focused on research and development and the remainder are primarily focused on quality assurance and regulatory affairs. Our research and development expense was $366 million in 2017, $376 million in 2016 and $409 million in 2015. 
 Regulation 
 Our food products and ingredients are subject to local, national and multinational regulations related to labeling, health and nutrition claims, packaging, pricing, marketing and advertising, privacy and related areas. In addition, various jurisdictions regulate our operations by licensing and inspecting our manufacturing plants and facilities, enforcing standards for select food products, grading food products, and regulating trade practices related to the sale and pricing of our food products. Many of the food commodities we use in our operations are subject to government agricultural policy and intervention, and the scrutiny of human rights issues in industry supply chains has led to developing regulation in many countries. These policies have substantial effects on prices and supplies and are subject to periodic governmental and administrative review. 
 Examples of laws and regulations that affect our business include selective food taxes, labeling requirements such as front-of-pack labeling and nutrient profiling, marketing restrictions, potential withdrawal of trade concessions as dispute settlement retaliation and sanctions on sales or sourcing of raw materials. We will continue to monitor developments in laws and regulations. At this time, we do not expect the cost of complying with new laws and regulations will be material. Also refer to Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  Currency Translation and Highly Inflationary Accounting, for additional information on government regulations and currency-related impacts on our operations in the United Kingdom, Argentina and other countries. 
 Environmental Regulation 
 Throughout the countries in which we do business, we are subject to local, national and multinational environmental laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment. We have programs across our business units designed to meet applicable environmental compliance requirements. In the United States, the laws and regulations include the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act. Based on information currently available, we believe that our compliance with environmental laws and regulations will not have a material effect on our financial results.

Sustainability 
 A key strategic goal for us is to Grow our Impact. Building positive impact for people and our planet is at the core of who we are. We call our commitment to drive business growth with positive change in the world Impact For Growth. Many of the challenges facing people and the planet are interrelated. Our core programs and initiatives holistically address both by working to reduce our environmental footprint, empower farmers and support the communities where our snacks are sourced. We continue to leverage our global operating scale to secure sustainable raw materials and work with suppliers to drive meaningful social and environmental changes, focusing on where we can make the most impact. For example, we launched our Cocoa Life program in 2012 and will continue to invest up to $400 million through 2022 to build a sustainable cocoa supply. We are also improving sustainability in our wheat supply by working with farmers in North America and through our Harmony program in Europe.
 Our 2020 sustainability goals aim to place us at the forefront in the fight against climate change with ambitious targets for an end-to-end approach to reduce our carbon footprint, including reducing our absolute CO2 emissions from manufacturing and addressing deforestation in key raw material supply chains. We are working to cut our absolute water footprint in manufacturing, focusing on priority sites where water is most scarce. We are also working to reduce waste in manufacturing and packaging. 
 We have been recognized for our ongoing economic, environmental and social contributions. This year we were again listed on the Dow Jones Sustainability Index (DJSI)  World and North American Indices. The DJSI selects the top 10% of global companies and top 20% of North American companies based on an extensive review of financial and sustainability programs within each industry. We are at the 92nd percentile of our industry and achieved perfect scores in health and nutrition and environmental reporting. 
 We also participate in the CDP Climate and Water disclosures and continue to work to reduce our carbon and water footprints. We are committed to continue this and other related work in the areas of sustainable resources and agriculture, well-being snacks, community partnerships and safety of our products and people. 
 Employees 
 We employed through our consolidated subsidiaries approximately 83,000 people worldwide at December 31, 2017 and approximately 90,000 at December 31, 2016. Employees represented by labor unions or workers councils represent approximately 64% of our 71,000 employees outside the United States and approximately 28% of our 12,000 U.S. employees. Our business units are subject to various local, national and multinational laws and regulations relating to their relationships with their employees. In accordance with European Union requirements, we also have established a European Workers Council composed of management and elected members of our workforce. We or our subsidiaries are a party to numerous collective bargaining agreements and we work to renegotiate these collective bargaining agreements on satisfactory terms when they expire. 
International Operations 
 Based on where we sell our products, we generated 75.8% of our 2017 net revenues, 75.6% of our 2016 net revenues and 78.7% of our 2015 net revenues from continuing operations outside the United States. We sell our products to consumers in approximately 160 countries. At December 31, 2017, we had operations in more than 80 countries and made our products at approximately 140 manufacturing and processing facilities in 51 countries. Refer to Note 16, Segment Reporting, for additional information on our U.S. and non-U.S. operations. Refer to Item 2, Properties, for more information on our manufacturing and other facilities. Also, for a discussion of risks related to our operations outside the United States, see Item 1A, Risk Factors.
