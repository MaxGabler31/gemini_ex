ITEM 1 BUSINESS
General
 
Elite Pharmaceuticals, Inc., a Nevada corporation (the “Company”, “Elite”, “Elite Pharmaceuticals”, the “registrant”, “we”, “us” or “our”) was incorporated on October 1, 1997 under the laws of the State of Delaware, and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Elite Laboratories, Inc. (“Elite Labs”), was incorporated on August 23, 1990 under the laws of the State of Delaware. On January 5, 2012, Elite Pharmaceuticals was reincorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada.
 
We are a specialty pharmaceutical company principally engaged in the development and manufacture of oral, controlled-release products, using proprietary know-how and technology, particularly as it relates to abuse resistant products and the manufacture of generic pharmaceuticals. Our strategy includes improving off-patent drug products for life cycle management, developing generic versions of controlled-release drug products with high barriers to entry and the development of branded and generic products that utilize our proprietary and patented abuse resistance technologies.
 
We own and occupy manufacturing, warehouse, laboratory and office space at 165 Ludlow Avenue and 135 Ludlow Avenue in Northvale, NJ (the “Northvale Facility”). The Northvale Facility operates under Current Good Manufacturing Practice (“cGMP”) and is a United States Drug Enforcement Agency (“DEA”) registered facility for research, development, and manufacturing.
 
Strategy
 
We focus our efforts on the following areas: (i) development of our pain management products; (ii) manufacturing of a line of generic pharmaceutical products with approved Abbreviated New Drug Applications (“ANDAs”); (iii) development of additional generic pharmaceutical products; (iv) development of the other products in our pipeline including the products with our partners; (v) commercial exploitation of our products either by license and the collection of royalties, or through the manufacture of our formulations; and (vi) development of new products and the expansion of our licensing agreements with other pharmaceutical companies, including co-development projects, joint ventures and other collaborations.
 
Our focus is on the development of various types of drug products, including branded drug products which require New Drug Applications (“NDAs”) under Section 505(b)(1) or 505(b)(2) of the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984 (the “Drug Price Competition Act”) as well as generic drug products which require ANDAs.
 
We believe that our business strategy enables us to reduce its risk by having a diverse product portfolio that includes both branded and generic products in various therapeutic categories and to build collaborations and establish licensing agreements with companies with greater resources thereby allowing us to share costs of development and improve cash-flow.

Lodrane D®
 
On September 27, 2011, the Company, along with ECR Pharmaceuticals (“ECR”), launched Lodrane D®, an immediate release formulation of brompheniramine maleate and pseudoephedrine HCl, an effective, low-sedating antihistamine combined with a decongestant.
 
Lodrane D® is marketed under the Over-the-Counter Monograph (the “OTC Monograph”) and accordingly, under the Code of Federal Regulations can be lawfully marketed in the US without prior approval of the United States Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”). Within the past few years, the FDA has revised its enforcement policies, significantly limiting the circumstances under which these unapproved products may be marketed. If the FDA determines that a company is distributing an unapproved product that requires approval, the FDA may take enforcement action in a variety of ways, including, without limitation, product seizures and seeking a judicial injunction against distribution.
 
ECR products have since been divested, and there have been several mergers relating to ECR and successor entities and transfer of brand name ownership, so that Lodrane D® is promoted and distributed in the United States of America (“U.S.”) now by Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc. Lodrane D® is available over-the-counter but also has physician promotion. Lodrane D® is one of the only adult brompheniramine containing products available to the consumer at this time.

Filed products under FDA review
 
SequestOx™ - Immediate Release Oxycodone with sequestered Naltrexone
 
SequestOx™ is our lead abuse-deterrent candidate for the management of moderate to severe pain where the use of an opioid analgesic is appropriate. SequestOx™ is an immediate-release Oxycodone Hydrochloride containing sequestered Naltrexone which incorporates 5mg, 10mg, 15mg, 20mg and 30mg doses of oxycodone into capsules.
 
In January 2016, the Company submitted a 505(b)(2) New Drug Application for SequestOx™, after receiving a waiver of the $2.3 million filing fee from the FDA. In March 2016, the Company received notification of the FDA’s acceptance of this filing and that such filing has been granted priority review by the FDA with a target action under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (“PDUFA”) of July 14, 2016.
 
On July 15, 2016, the FDA issued a Complete Response Letter, or CRL, regarding the NDA. The CRL stated that the review cycle for the SequestOx™ NDA is complete and the application is not ready for approval in its present form.
 
On December 21, 2016, the Company met with the FDA for an end-of-review meeting to discuss steps that the Company could take to obtain approval of SequestOx™. Based on the FDA response, the Company believes that there is a clear path forward to address the issues cited in the CRL. The Company believes that the meeting minutes, received from the FDA on January 23, 2017, supported a plan to address the issues cited by the FDA in the CRL by modifying the SequestOx™ formulation. Such plan includes, without limitation, conducting bioequivalence and bioavailability fed and fasted studies, comparing the modified formulation to the original formulation.
 
On July 7, 2017, the Company reported topline results from a pivotal bioequivalence fed study for or SequestOx™. The mean Tmax (the amount of time that a drug is present at the maximum concentration in serum) of SequestOxTM was 4.6 hr. with a range of 0.5 hr. to 12 hr. and the mean Tmax of the comparator, Roxicodone®, was 3.4 hr. with a range of 0.5 hr. to 12 hr. A key objective for the study was to determine if the reformulated SequestOxTM had a similar Tmax to the comparator when taken with a high fat meal. Based on these results, the Company paused clinical trials for this formulation of SequestOx™. On January 30, 2018, the Company reported positive topline results from a pilot study conducted for a modified SequestOx™ wherein, based on the results of this pilot study, the modified SequestOx™ formulation is expected to achieve bioequivalence with a Tmax range equivalent to the reference product when conducted in a pivotal trial under fed conditions. The Company intends to review these study results with the FDA and discuss pharmacokinetic study requirements for a re-submission of the NDA. The Company will continue to pursue extended release products with its proprietary abuse deterrent technology.

There can be no assurances of the success of any future clinical trials, or if such trials are successful, there can be no assurances that an intended future resubmission of the NDA product filing, if made, will be accepted by or receive marketing approval from the FDA, and accordingly, there can be no assurances that the Company will earn and receive the additional $7.5 million or future license fees (see “Licensing, Manufacturing and Development Agreements; Sales and Distribution Licensing Agreement with Epic Pharma LLC for SequestOx™” below). If the Company does not receive these payments or fees, it will materially and adversely affect our financial condition. In addition, even if marketing authorization is received, there can be no assurances that there will be future revenues or profits, or that any such future revenues or profits would be in amounts that provide adequate return on the significant investments made to secure this marketing authorization.

Each of the products referenced in the twelve approved ANDAs require manufacturing site approval with the FDA. We believe that the site transfers qualify for Changes Being Effected in 30 Days (“CBE 30”) review, with one exception, which would allow for the product manufacturing transfer on an expedited basis. However, we can give no assurances that all will qualify for CBE 30 review, or on the timing of these transfers of manufacturing site, or on the approval by the FDA of the transfers of manufacturing site.
 
As of the date of filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the following products included in the Mikah Purchase Agreement have successfully achieved manufacturing site transfers:
 

· | Phendimetrazine 35mg
--+---------------------


· | Isradipine 2.5mg and Isradipine 5mg
--+------------------------------------

Manufacturing and License Agreement with Epic Pharma LLC
 
On October 2, 2013, we executed the Epic Pharma Manufacturing and License Agreement (the “Epic Manufacturing and License Agreement”). This agreement granted Epic certain rights to manufacture, market and sell in the United States and Puerto Rico the twelve approved ANDAs acquired by us pursuant to the Mikah Thirteen ANDA Acquisition. Of the twelve approved ANDAs, Epic will have the exclusive right to market six products as listed in Schedule A of the Epic Manufacturing and License Agreement, and a non-exclusive right to market six products as listed in Schedule D of the Epic Manufacturing and License Agreement. Epic will manufacture the products and is responsible for all regulatory and pharmacovigilance matters related to the products and for all costs related to the site transfer for all products. We have no further obligations or deliverables under the Epic Manufacturing and License Agreement. Pursuant to the Epic Manufacturing and License Agreement, we will receive a license fee and milestone payments. The license fee will be computed as a percentage of the gross profit, as defined in the Epic Manufacturing and License Agreement, earned by Epic a result of sales of the products. The manufacturing cost used for the calculation of the license fee is a predetermined amount per unit plus the cost of the active pharmaceutical ingredient (“API”) and the sales cost for the calculation is predetermined based on net sales.
 
If we manufacture any product for sale by Epic, then Epic shall pay us the same predetermined manufacturing cost per unit plus the cost of the API. The license fee is payable monthly for the term of the Epic Manufacturing and License Agreement. Epic shall pay to us certain milestone payments as defined by the Epic Manufacturing and License Agreement. The term of the Epic Manufacturing and License Agreement is five years and may be extended for an additional five years upon mutual agreement of the parties. Twelve months following the launch of a product covered by the Epic Manufacturing and License Agreement, we may terminate the marketing rights for any product if the license fee paid, by Epic, falls below a designated amount for a six-month period of that product. We may also terminate the exclusive marketing rights if Epic is unable to meet the annual unit volume forecast for a designated product group for any year, subject to the ability of Epic, during the succeeding six-month period, to achieve at least one-half of the prior year’s minimum annual unit forecast. The Epic Manufacturing and License Agreement may be terminated by mutual agreement, as a result of a breach by either party that is not cured within 60 days’ notice of the breach, or by us as a result of Epic Pharma becoming a party to a bankruptcy, reorganization or other insolvency proceeding that continues for a period of 30 days or more.
 
The Epic Manufacturing and License Agreement expires on October 2, 2018. The Company is evaluating options available for the manufacture and marketing of products included in this agreement, with such options including, without limitation, extension of the agreement by mutual consent of Epic and Elite, marketing and/or manufacturing by a third party other than Epic, marketing and/or manufacturing by Elite, marketing and/or manufacturing by Epic under a new agreement. While Epic has launched four of the six exclusive products and Elite has collected $1.0 million of the $1.8 million total fee, collection of the remaining $800,000 is contingent upon Epic filing the required supplements with and receiving approval from the FDA for the remaining exclusive generic products. As the Epic Generic Agreement expires on October 2, 2018, it is unlikely that Epic will secure the required FDA approvals related to their payment to Elite of the remaining $800,000 milestones.

Pursuant to the Precision Dose License Agreement, Elite will receive a license fee and milestone payments. The license fee will be computed as a percentage of the gross profit, as defined in the Precision Dose License Agreement, earned by Precision Dose as a result of sales of the products. The license fee is payable monthly for the term of the Precision Dose License Agreement. The milestone payments will be paid in six installments. The first installment was paid upon execution of the Precision Dose License Agreement. The remaining installments are to be paid upon FDA approval and initial shipment of the products to Precision Dose. The term of the Precision Dose License Agreement is 15 years and may be extended for 3 successive terms, each of 5 years.

On January 10, 2018, the Company reported positive topline results from pivotal bioequivalence studies for an undisclosed extended-release generic product in co-development with SunGen Pharma. The topline results indicate that the generic product is bioequivalent to the branded product. The studies were single dose crossover comparative bioavailability studies in healthy male and female volunteers in both the fed and fasting states. A fasting study with product beads sprinkled on to applesauce also demonstrated bioequivalence to the branded product. MS Health reported approximately $1.6 billion in revenue for the generic market for this product in 2017.
 
On February 8, 2018, the Company filed an ANDA with the FDA for a generic version of an immediate release central nervous system (“CNS”) stimulant. The ANDA represents the first filing for a product co-developed with SunGen Pharma LLC (“SunGen”) under the Development and License Agreement between SunGen and the Company dated August 24, 2016 (the “SunGen Agreement”). According to IMS Health data, the branded product and its equivalents had total U.S. sales of more than $400 million for the twelve months ended September 30, 2017. The Company has not yet received a response from the FDA on this filing.
 
On May 24, 2018, the Company filed an ANDA with the FDA for a generic version of an extended release CNS stimulant. The ANDA represents the second filing for a product co-developed with SunGen under the SunGen Agreement. According to IMS Health data, the branded product and its equivalents had total U.S. sales of approximately $1.6 billion for the twelve months ended September 30, 2017. The Company has not yet received a response from the FDA on this filing.
 
There can be no assurances that any of these products will receive marketing authorization and achieve commercialization within this time period, or at all. In addition, even if marketing authorization is received, there can be no assurances that there will be future revenues of profits, or that any such future revenues or profits would be in amounts that provide adequate return on the significant investments made to secure these marketing authorizations.
 
Strategic Marketing Alliance with Glenmark Pharmaceuticals, Inc. USA
 
On May 29, 2018, we entered into a license, manufacturing and supply agreement with Glenmark Pharmaceuticals Inc. USA (“Glenmark”) to market the two Elite generic products described below in the United States with the option to add products in the future (the “Glenmark Alliance”).
 
Pursuant to the Glenmark Alliance, Glenmark will purchase the products from Elite and then sell and distribute them. In addition to the purchase prices for the products, Elite will receive license fees well in excess of 50% of gross profits. Gross profits is defined as net sales less the price paid to Elite for the products, distribution fees (less than 10%) and shipping costs. Glenmark will have semi-exclusive marketing rights to the ANDA approved generic product, phendimetrazine 35mg tablets, and exclusive marketing rights to an undisclosed generic version of a synthetic narcotic analgesic indicated for the management of pain, currently under review by the FDA with an expected approval date in the third quarter of calendar year 2018. Collectively, the brand products and their generic equivalents had total annual sales of approximately $33.6 million in 2017, according to Quintiles IMS Health data. The Agreement has an initial term of three years and automatically renews for one year periods absent prior written notice of non-renewal. In addition to customary termination provisions, the Agreement permits Glenmark to terminate with regard to a product on at least three months’ prior written notice if it determines to stop marketing and selling such product, and it permits Elite to terminate with regard to a product if at anytime after the first twelvemonths from the first commercial sale, the average license fee paid by Glenmark for such product is less than a defined minimum amount.
 
Products Under Development
 
Elite’s research and development activities are primarily focused on developing its proprietary abuse deterrent technology and the development of a range of abuse deterrent opioid products that utilize this technology or other approaches to abuse deterrence.
 
Elite’s proprietary abuse-deterrent technology utilizes the pharmacological approach to abuse deterrence and consists of a multi-particulate capsule which contains an opioid agonist in addition to naltrexone, an opioid antagonist used primarily in the management of alcohol dependence and opioid dependence. When this product is taken as intended, the naltrexone is designed to pass through the body unreleased while the opioid agonist releases over time providing therapeutic pain relief for which it is prescribed. If the multi-particulate beads are crushed or dissolved, the opioid antagonist, naltrexone, is designed to release. The absorption of the naltrexone is intended to block the euphoria by preferentially binding to same receptors in the brain as the opioid agonist and thereby reducing the incentive for abuse or misuse by recreational drug abusers.
 
We filed an NDA for the first product to utilize our abuse deterrent technology, Immediate Release Oxycodone 5mg, 10mg, 15mg, 20mg and 30mg with sequestered Naltrexone (collectively and individually referred to as “SequestOx™”), on January 14, 2016. Please see “Filed products under FDA review; SequestOx™ - Immediate Release Oxycodone with sequestered Naltrexone” above.
 
On August 9, 2016, the Company filed an ANDA with the FDA for a generic version of Percocet® (oxycodone hydrochloride and acetaminophen, USP CII) 5mg, 7.5mg and 10mg tablets with 325mg of acetaminophen (“Generic Oxy/APAP”). Please see “Filed products under FDA review; Oxycodone hydrochloride and acetaminophen USP CII (generic version of Percocet®)” above. Please note that there can be no assurances of this product receiving marketing authorization or achieving commercialization. In addition, even if marketing authorization is received and the product is commercialized, there can be no assurances of future revenues or profits in such amounts that would provide adequate return on the significant investments made to secure marketing authorization for this product.

On December 12, 2016, the Company filed an ANDA with the FDA for a generic version of Norco® (hydrocodone bitartrate and acetaminophen tablets USP CII) 2.5mg/325mg, 5mg/325mg, 7.5mg/325mg and 10mg/325mg tablets (“Generic Hydrocodone/APAP”). Please see “Filed products under FDA review; Hydrocodone bitartrate and acetaminophen tablets USP CII (generic version of Norco)” above. Please note that there can be no assurances of this product receiving marketing authorization or achieving commercialization.

On April 4, 2017, the Company filed an ANDA with the FDA for a generic version of a synthetic narcotic analgesic indicated for the management of pain. The branded product and its equivalents have annual sales in excess of $30 million according to IMS Health Data. The Company expects a response from the FDA relating to this ANDA during the third quarter of the calendar year ended December 31, 2018. This product is an identified product in the Glenmark Alliance pursuant to which, subsequent to ANDA approval by the FDA, it will be manufactured by Elite and marketed/distributed by Glenmark. Please see the section above titled “Strategic Marketing Alliance with Glenmark Pharmaceuticals, Inc. USA” for further details. Please note that there can be no assurances of this product receiving marketing authorization or achieving commercialization. In addition, even if marketing authorization is received and the product is commercialized, there can be no assurances of future revenues or profits in such amounts that would provide adequate return on the significant investments made to secure marketing authorization for this product.
 
On September 20, 2017, the Company filed an ANDA with the FDA for generic version of Oxycontin® (extended release Oxycodone Hydrochloride). Please see “Filed products under FDA review; Oxycodone Hydrochloride extended release (generic version of Oxycontin®” above. Please note that there can be no assurances of this product receiving marketing authorization or achieving commercialization. In addition, even if marketing authorization is received and the product is commercialized, there can be no assurances of future revenues or profits in such amounts that would provide adequate return on the significant investments made to secure marketing authorization for this product.
 
On February 8, 2018, the Company filed an ANDA with the FDA for a generic version of an immediate release central nervous system (“CNS”) stimulant. The ANDA represents the first filing for a product co-developed with SunGen Pharma LLC (“SunGen”) under the SunGen Agreement. Please see “Filed products under FDA review Generic version of immediate release Central Nervous System stimulant” above. Please note that there can be no assurances of this product receiving marketing authorization or achieving commercialization. In addition, even if marketing authorization is received and the product is commercialized, there can be no assurances of future revenues or profits in such amounts that would provide adequate return on the significant investments made to secure marketing authorization for this product. Please also see the section below titled “Master Development and License Agreement with SunGen Pharma LLC”.
 
On May 30, 2018, the Company filed an ANDA with the FDA for a generic version of an extended release CNS stimulant. The ANDA represents the second filing for a product co-developed with SunGen under the SunGen Agreement. Please see “Filed products under FDA review Generic version of extended release Central Nervous System stimulant” above. Please note that there can be no assurances of this product receiving marketing authorization or achieving commercialization.

Please also see the section below titled “Master Development and License Agreement with SunGen Pharma LLC”.
 
The Company believes that the abuse deterrent technology can be applied to and incorporated into a wide range of opioids used today for pain management and has, to date, identified 10 additional products for potential development. All of these products are at early stages of development, with research and development activities mainly consisting of in-house process development and laboratory studies. Extensive efficacy and safety studies, similar to those conducted for SequestOx™, Generic Oxy/APAP and Generic Hydrocodone/APAP, have not yet been conducted for these other products. As a result, costs incurred in relation to the development of these 10 products have not been material.
 
Research and development costs were $9.6 million, $8.3 million, and $12.4 million for years ended March 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. Costs incurred during the prior fiscal years relate almost entirely to the development of the abuse deterrent opioid product, SequestOx™ and the ongoing development of our abuse deterrent opioid and other products in addition to a focus on clinical trials for generic products. Costs incurred during the current fiscal year relate to bio equivalency and pilot studies for SequestOx™ and related costs, various clinical trials and studies relating to the development of multiple generic products, resulting in the filing of four ANDAs since the conclusion of the prior fiscal year, and costs relating to the development of additional generic products and the transfer of manufacturing operations of ANDAs previously approved.
 
On June 4, 2015, the Company entered into a sales and distribution licensing agreement which included a non-refundable payment of $5.0 million to Elite for prior research and development activities, with such representing the first material net cash inflows being generated by ELI-200. On January 14, 2016, the Company filed an NDA with the FDA for SequestOx™, thereby earning a non-refundable $2.5 million milestone. An additional $7.5 million non-refundable milestone is due upon the FDA’s approval of Elite’s NDA. Please see the section above titled “Licensing, Manufacturing and Development Agreements – Sales and Distribution Licensing Agreement with Epic Pharma LLC for SequestOx™” for further details. Please also note that the non-receipt by the Company of these payments and or fees may materially and adversely affect our financial condition.

Please note that, while the FDA is required to review applications within certain timeframes, during the review process, the FDA frequently requests that additional information be submitted. The effect of such request and subsequent submission can significantly extend the time for the NDA review process. Until an NDA is actually approved, there can be no assurances that the information requested and submitted will be considered adequate by the FDA to justify approval. The packaging and labeling of our developed products are also subject to FDA regulation. Based on the foregoing, it is impossible to anticipate the amount of time that will be needed to obtain FDA approval to market any product. In addition, there can be no assurances of the Company filing the required application(s) with the FDA or of the FDA approving such application(s) if filed, and the Company’s ability to successfully develop and commercialize products incorporating its abuse deterrent technology is subject to a high level of risk as detailed in “Item 1A-Risk Factors-Risks Related to our Business” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
 
Abuse-Deterrent and Sustained Release Opioids
 
The abuse-deterrent opioid products utilize our patented abuse-deterrent technology that is based on a pharmacological approach. These products are combinations of a narcotic agonist formulation intended for use in patients with pain, and an antagonist, formulated to deter abuse of the drug. Both, agonist and antagonist, have been on the market for a number of years and sold separately in various dose strengths. We have filed INDs for two abuse resistant products under development and have tested products in various pharmacokinetic and efficacy studies. We expect to continue to develop multiple abuse resistant products. Products utilizing the pharmacological approach to deter abuse such as Suboxone®, a product marketed in the United States by Reckitt Benckiser Pharmaceuticals, Inc., and Embeda®, a product marketed in the United States by Pfizer, Inc., have been approved by the FDA and are being marketed in the United States.
 
We have developed, licensed to Epic the marketing rights to SequestOx™, immediate release Oxycodone with Naltrexone, and retain the rights to the remainder of these abuse resistant and sustained release opioid products. We may license these products at a later date to a third party who could provide funding for the remaining clinical studies and who could provide sales and distribution for the product.
 
We also developed controlled release technology for oxycodone under a joint venture with Elan which terminated in 2002. According to the Elan Termination Agreement, we acquired all proprietary, development and commercial rights for the worldwide markets for the products developed by the joint venture, including the sustained release opioid products. Upon licensing or commercialization of an oral controlled release formulation of oxycodone for the treatment of pain, we will pay a royalty to Elan pursuant to the Elan Termination Agreement. If we were to sell the product itself, we will pay a 1% royalty to Elan based on the product’s net sales, and if we enter into an agreement with another party to sell the product, we will pay a 9% royalty to Elan based on our net revenues from this product. We are allowed to recoup all development costs including research, process development, analytical development, clinical development and regulatory costs before payment of any royalties to Elan.
 
Patents
 
Since our incorporation, we have secured the following patents, of which two have been assigned for a fee to another pharmaceutical company. Our patents are:

We also have pending applications for three additional U.S. patents non-provisional patents and one provisional patent and one foreign patent. We intend to apply for patents for other products in the future; however, there can be no assurance that any of the pending applications or other applications which we may file will be granted. We have also filed corresponding foreign applications for key patents.
 
Prior to the enactment in the United States of new laws adopting certain changes mandated by the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (“GATT”), the exclusive rights afforded by a U.S. Patent were for a period of 17 years measured from the date of grant. Under GATT, the term of any U.S. Patent granted on an application filed subsequent to June 8, 1995 terminates 20 years from the date on which the patent application was filed in the United States or the first priority date, whichever occurs first. Future patents granted on an application filed before June 8, 1995, will have a term that terminates 20 years from such date, or 17 years from the date of grant, whichever date is later.

Under the Drug Price Competition Act, a U.S. product patent or use patent may be extended for up to five years under certain circumstances to compensate the patent holder for the time required for FDA regulatory review of the product. Such benefits under the Drug Price Competition Act are available only to the first approved use of the active ingredient in the drug product and may be applied only to one patent per drug product. There can be no assurance that we will be able to take advantage of this law.
 
Also, different countries have different procedures for obtaining patents, and patents issued by different countries provide different degrees of protection against the use of a patented invention by others. There can be no assurance, therefore, that the issuance to us in one country of a patent covering an invention will be followed by the issuance in other countries of patents covering the same invention, or that any judicial interpretation of the validity, enforceability, or scope of the claims in a patent issued in one country will be similar to the judicial interpretation given to a corresponding patent issued in another country. Furthermore, even if our patents are determined to be valid, enforceable, and broad in scope, there can be no assurance that competitors will not be able to design around such patents and compete with us using the resulting alternative technology.
 
Trademarks
 
SequestOx™ is a trademark owned by Elite, which received a Notice of Allowance by the United States Patent and Trademark Office on December 22, 2015.
 
We currently plan to license at least some of our products to other entities in the marketing of pharmaceuticals but may also sell products under our own brand name in which case we may register trademarks for those products.
Terminated Agreements
 
Terminated Agreement – Mikah Development Agreement
 
On January 28, 2015, The Development and License Agreement dated August 27, 2010 and between the Company and Mikah Pharma LLC (the “Mikah Development Agreement”) was terminated by mutual agreement of the Company and Mikah Pharma LLC.
 
Pursuant to the Mikah Development Agreement, Mikah Pharma LLC (“Mikah”) made advance consideration payments to the Company totaling $200,000 in exchange for product development services to be provided at a future date. Subsequent to the execution of the Mikah Development Agreement, and before any development milestones were achieved, the sole owner of Mikah, Mr. Nasrat Hakim, became the President and CEO of the Company. Mikah has accordingly ceased operating and is in the process of winding down and liquidating its assets.
 
Any further development of the product related to this agreement will belong to the Company, although there can be no assurances that such development will occur or be successful.
 
The Mikah Development Agreement requires that the consideration paid in advance to the Company be refunded in the event of no milestones being achieved. Mr. Hakim, as owner of Mikah, has directed that the $200,000 refund due to Mikah not be paid currently, but rather be added to the amounts due under the Hakim Credit Line.
 
For further details on the Mikah Development Agreement, please see Exhibit 10.6 of the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on November 14, 2010, with such filing being herein incorporated by reference.
 
For further details on the termination of the Mikah Development Agreement, please see Exhibit 10.84 of the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, filed with the SEC on February 17, 2015, with such filing being herein incorporated by reference.

Terminated Agreement – Methadone Manufacturing and Supply Agreement
 
On December 31, 2017, the Methadone Manufacturing and Supply Agreement terminated in accordance with the terms of the agreement.
 
Other Business Factors and Details
 
Government Regulation and Approval
 
The design, development, and marketing of pharmaceutical compounds, on which our success depends, are intensely regulated by governmental regulatory agencies, in particular the FDA. Non-compliance with applicable requirements can result in fines and other judicially imposed sanctions, including product seizures, injunction actions and criminal prosecution based on products or manufacturing practices that violate statutory requirements. In addition, administrative remedies can involve voluntary withdrawal of products, as well as the refusal of the FDA to approve ANDAs and NDAs. The FDA also has the authority to withdraw approval of drugs in accordance with statutory due process procedures.
 
Before a drug may be marketed, it must be approved by the FDA either by an NDA or an ANDA, each of which is discussed below.
 
Lodrane D® which is an immediate release product that is different from the Lodrane Products that were included in the list of products removed from the market by the FDA, is marketed under the Over-the-Counter Monograph (the “OTC Monograph”) and accordingly, under the Code of Federal Regulations can be lawfully marketed in the U.S. without prior approval. Under the Federal Food Drug and Cosmetic Act (“FDCA”), FDA regulations and statements of FDA policy, certain drug products are permitted to be marketed in the U.S. without prior approval. Within the past few years, the FDA has revised its enforcement policies, significantly limiting the circumstances under which these unapproved products may be marketed. If the FDA determines that a company is distributing an unapproved product that requires approval, the FDA may take enforcement action in a variety of ways, including, without limitation, product seizures and seeking a judicial injunction against distribution.
 
NDAs and NDAs under Section 505(b) of the Drug Price Competition Act
 
The FDA approval procedure for an NDA is generally a two-step process. During the Initial Product Development stage, an investigational new drug application (“IND”) for each product is filed with the FDA. A 30-day waiting period after the filing of each IND is required by the FDA prior to the commencement of initial clinical testing. If the FDA does not comment on or question the IND within such 30-day period, initial clinical studies may begin. If, however, the FDA has comments or questions, they must be answered to the satisfaction of the FDA before initial clinical testing may begin. In some instances, this process could result in substantial delay and expense. Initial clinical studies generally constitute Phase I of the NDA process and are conducted to demonstrate the product tolerance/safety and pharmacokinetic in healthy subjects.
 
After Phase I testing, extensive efficacy and safety studies in patients must be conducted. After completion of the required clinical testing, an NDA is filed, and its approval, which is required for marketing in the United States, involves an extensive review process by the FDA. The NDA itself is a complicated and detailed application and must include the results of extensive clinical and other testing, the cost of which is substantial. However, the NDA filings contemplated by us, which are already marketed drugs, would be made under Sections 505 (b)(1) or 505 (b)(2) of the Drug Price Competition Act, which do not require certain studies that would otherwise be necessary; accordingly, the development timetable should be shorter. While the FDA is required to review applications within a certain timeframe, during the review process, the FDA frequently requests that additional information be submitted. The effect of such request and subsequent submission can significantly extend the time for the NDA review process. Until an NDA is actually approved, there can be no assurance that the information requested and submitted will be considered adequate by the FDA to justify approval. The packaging and labeling of our developed products are also subject to FDA regulation. It is impossible to anticipate the amount of time that will be needed to obtain FDA approval to market any product.
 
Whether or not FDA approval has been obtained, approval of the product by comparable regulatory authorities in any foreign country must be obtained prior to the commencement of marketing of the product in that country. We intend to conduct all marketing in territories other than the United States through other pharmaceutical companies based in those countries. The approval procedure varies from country to country, can involve additional testing, and the time required may differ from that required for FDA approval. Although there are some procedures for unified filings for certain European countries, in general each country has its own procedures and requirements, many of which are time consuming and expensive. Thus, there can be substantial delays in obtaining required approvals from both the FDA and foreign regulatory authorities after the relevant applications are filed. After such approvals are obtained, further delays may be encountered before the products become commercially available.

ANDAs
 
The FDA approval procedure for an ANDA differs from the procedure for an NDA in that the FDA waives the requirement of conducting complete clinical studies, although it normally requires bioavailability and/or bioequivalence studies. “Bioavailability” indicates the rate and extent of absorption and levels of concentration of a drug product in the blood stream needed to produce a therapeutic effect. “Bioequivalence” compares the bioavailability of one drug product with another, and when established, indicates that the rate of absorption and levels of concentration of the active drug substance in the body are equivalent for the generic drug and the previously approved drug. An ANDA may be submitted for a drug on the basis that it is the equivalent of a previously approved drug or, in the case of a new dosage form, is suitable for use for the indications specified.
 
The timing of final FDA approval of an ANDA depends on a variety of factors, including whether the applicant challenges any listed patents for the drug and whether the brand-name manufacturer is entitled to one or more statutory exclusivity periods, during which the FDA may be prohibited from accepting applications for, or approving, generic products. In certain circumstances, a regulatory exclusivity period can extend beyond the life of a patent, and thus block ANDAs from being approved on the patent expiration date.
 
In May 1992, Congress enacted the Generic Drug Enforcement Act of 1992, which allows the FDA to impose debarment and other penalties on individuals and companies that commit certain illegal acts relating to the generic drug approval process. In some situations, the Generic Drug Enforcement Act requires the FDA to not accept or review ANDAs for a period of time from a company or an individual that has committed certain violations. It also provides for temporary denial of approval of applications during the investigation of certain violations that could lead to debarment and also, in more limited circumstances, provides for the suspension of the marketing of approved drugs by the affected company. Lastly, the Generic Drug Enforcement Act allows for civil penalties and withdrawal of previously approved applications. Neither we nor any of our employees have ever been subject to debarment. We do not believe that we receive any services from any debarred person.
 
Controlled Substances
 
We are also subject to federal, state, and local laws of general applicability, such as laws relating to working conditions. We are also licensed by, registered with, and subject to periodic inspection and regulation by the Drug Enforcement Agency (“DEA”) and New Jersey state agencies, pursuant to federal and state legislation relating to drugs and narcotics. Certain drugs that we currently develop or may develop in the future may be subject to regulations under the Controlled Substances Act and related statutes. As we manufacture such products, we may become subject to the Prescription Drug Marketing Act, which regulates wholesale distributors of prescription drugs.
 
cGMP
 
All facilities and manufacturing techniques used for the manufacture of products for clinical use or for sale must be operated in conformity with cGMP regulations issued by the FDA. We engage in manufacturing on a commercial basis for distribution of products and operate our facilities in accordance with cGMP regulations. If we hire another company to perform contract manufacturing for us, we must ensure that our contractor’s facilities conform to cGMP regulations.
 
Compliance with Environmental Laws
 
We are subject to comprehensive federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations that govern, among other things, air polluting emissions, waste water discharges, solid and hazardous waste disposal, and the remediation of contamination associated with current or past generation handling and disposal activities, including the past practices of corporations as to which we are the legal successor or in possession. We do not expect that compliance with such environmental laws will have a material effect on our capital expenditures, earnings, or competitive position in the foreseeable future. There can be no assurance, however, that future changes in environmental laws or regulations, administrative actions or enforcement actions, or remediation obligations arising under environmental laws will not have a material adverse effect on our capital expenditures, earnings, or competitive position.
Competition
 
We have competition with respect to our principal areas of operation. We develop and manufacture generic products, products using controlled-release drug technology, products utilizing abuse deterrent technologies, and we develop and market (either on our own or by license to other companies) generic and proprietary controlled-release and abuse deterrent pharmaceutical products. In both areas, our competition consists of those companies which develop controlled-release, abuse deterrent drugs and alternative drug delivery systems. We do not represent a significant presence in the pharmaceutical industry.

An increasing number of pharmaceutical companies have become interested in the development and commercialization of products incorporating advanced or novel drug delivery systems. Some of the major pharmaceutical companies have invested and are continuing to invest significant resources in the development of their own drug delivery systems and technologies and some have invested funds in such specialized drug delivery companies. Many of these companies have greater financial and other resources as well as more experience than we do in commercializing pharmaceutical products. Certain companies have a track record of success in developing controlled-release drugs. Significant among these are, without limitation, Pfizer, Sandoz (a Novartis company), Durect Corporation, Mylan Laboratories, Inc., Par Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Alkermes, Inc., Teva Pharmaceuticals Industries Ltd., Impax Laboratories, Inc., and Allergen. Each of these companies has developed expertise in certain types of drug delivery systems, although such expertise does not carry over to developing a controlled-release version of all drugs. Such companies may develop new drug formulations and products or may improve existing drug formulations and products more efficiently than we can. In addition, almost all of our competitors have vastly greater resources than we do. While our product development capabilities and, if obtained, patent protection may help us to maintain our market position in the field of advanced drug delivery, there can be no assurance that others will not be able to develop such capabilities or alternative technologies outside the scope of our patents, if any, or that even if patent protection is obtained, such patents will not be successfully challenged in the future.
 
In addition to competitors that are developing products based on drug delivery technologies, there are also companies that have announced that they are developing opioid abuse-deterrent products that might compete directly or indirectly with Elite’s products. These include, but are not limited to Pfizer Inc., Pain Therapeutics (which has an agreement with Durect Corporation and Pfizer Inc.), Collegium Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Purdue Pharma LP, and Acura Pharmaceuticals, Inc.
 
We also face competition in the generic pharmaceutical market. The principal competitive factors in the generic pharmaceutical market include: (i) introduction of other generic drug manufacturers’ products in direct competition with our products under development, (ii) introduction of authorized generic products in direct competition with any of our products under development, particularly if such products are approved and sold during exclusivity periods, (iii) consolidation among distribution outlets through mergers and acquisitions and the formation of buying groups, (iv) ability of generic competitors to quickly enter the market after the expiration of patents or exclusivity periods, diminishing the amount and duration of significant profits, (v) the willingness of generic drug customers, including wholesale and retail customers, to switch among pharmaceutical manufacturers, (vi) pricing pressures and product deletions by competitors, (vii) a company’s reputation as a manufacturer and distributor of quality products, (viii) a company’s level of service (including maintaining sufficient inventory levels for timely deliveries), (ix) product appearance and labeling and (x) a company’s breadth of product offerings.
 
Sources and Availability of Raw Materials; Manufacturing
 
A significant portion of our raw materials may be available only from foreign sources. Foreign sources can be subject to the special risks of doing business abroad, including:

· | greater possibility for disruption due to transportation or communication problems;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the relative instability of some foreign governments and economies;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------


· | interim price volatility based on labor unrest, materials or equipment shortages, export duties, restrictions on the transfer of funds, or fluctuations in currency exchange rates; and,
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | uncertainty regarding recourse to a dependable legal system for the enforcement of contracts and other rights.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
While we currently obtain the raw materials that we need from over 20 suppliers, some materials used in our products are currently available from only one supplier or a limited number of suppliers. The FDA requires identification of raw material suppliers in applications for approval of drug products. If raw materials were unavailable from a specified supplier, FDA approval of a new supplier could delay the manufacture of the drug involved.
 
We have acquired pharmaceutical manufacturing equipment for manufacturing our products. We have registered our facilities with the FDA and the DEA.
 
Please see the Risk Factor in Part I, Item 1A entitled “We are dependent on a small number of suppliers for our raw materials and any delay or unavailability of raw materials can materially adversely affect our ability to produce products”.
 
Dependence on One or a Few Major Customers
 
Each year we have had one or a few customers that have accounted for a large percentage of our limited revenues, therefore the termination or restructuring of a contract with a customer may result in the loss of material amount or substantially all of our revenues. We are constantly working to develop new relationships with existing or new customers, but despite these efforts we may not, at the time that any of our current contracts expire, have other contracts in place generating similar or material revenue. We have agreements with Epic, Precision Dose and Ascend for the licensing, sales and distribution of products that we manufacture. We are currently renegotiating a licensing contract with Epic, which may result in the termination of an existing contract or an amended licensing contract that is materially different from that already in place. We receive revenues to manufacture these products and also receive a profit split or royalties based on in-market sales of the products. Please see the Risk Factor in Part I, Item 1A entitled “We depend on a limited number of customers and any reduction, delay or cancellation of an order from these customers or the loss of any of these customers could cause our revenue to decline.”

Our Reporting Segments
 
We currently operate in two segments, which are products whose marketing approvals were secured via an ANDA and products whose marketing approvals were secured via an NDA. ANDA products are referred to as generic pharmaceuticals and NDA products are referred to as branded pharmaceuticals. For the years ended March 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 revenue from our ANDA segment was $6.5 million, $8.6 million and $9.2 million, respectively. For the years ended March 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 revenue from our NDA segment was $1.0 million, $1.0 million and $3.3 million, respectively.
 
Segment information is consistent with the financial information regularly reviewed by our chief operating decision maker, who we have determined to be the chief executive office, for the purposes of making decisions about allocating resources and assessing performance of the Company. There are currently no intersegment revenues. Asset information by operating segment is not presented below since the chief operating decision maker does not review this information by segment.
 
Employees
 
As of June 7, 2018, we had 43 full time employees. Full-time employees are engaged in operations, administration, research, and development. None of our employees is represented by a labor union and we have never experienced a work stoppage. We believe our relationship with our employees to be good. However, our ability to achieve our financial and operational objectives depends in large part upon our continuing ability to attract, integrate, retain, and motivate highly qualified personnel, and upon the continued service of our senior management and key personnel.
