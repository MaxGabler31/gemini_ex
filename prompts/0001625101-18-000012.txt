 Item 1. Business
 General
 Pulse Biosciences is a clinical stage electroceutical, an electrical energy based therapeutic, company pursuing commercial applications of its proprietary Nano-Pulse Stimulation (NPS) technology. NPS has the potential to significantly benefit patients in a wide variety of medical applications including applications in immuno-oncology and dermatology, and we may pursue many other applications in the future.
 Nano-Pulse Stimulation is a non-thermal, precise, focal drug-free electroceutical treatment technology that initiates cell death (the ceasing of biological cellular function) within treated tissue. NPS utilizes nanosecond (billionth of a second) range pulsed electric fields to induce cell signaling and the activation of cellular pathways by creating transient nanopores (a nanometer (billionth of a meter) size hole) in cellular membranes and organelles. Once created, these temporary nanopores allow ions, such as calcium (Ca+), potassium (K+), and sodium (Na+), to pass through these membranes, and in turn disrupt cellular function and initiate cell death. NPS cell death has the potential to eliminate treated tissue cells with a minimal inflammatory response, leading to a favorable healing process and the replacement of treated tissue cells with healthy tissue cells. NPS has demonstrated an excellent safety profile in human clinical studies treating benign (non-cancerous) lesions with 71 patients receiving 736 treatment cycles to date, where a cycle is defined as an electrode deployment in tissue and the delivery of a predefined series of NPS pulses, with no adverse events reported. These treatments have been in healthy skin and benign skin lesions in dermatology.
 In pre-clinical models of cancerous lesions, NPS has been shown to induce immunogenic cell death (ICD), a process that leads to the exposure of the unique cancer cell antigens to the immune system, resulting in the generation of cytotoxic T-cells and the mounting of an adaptive immune response targeted against those cells, without any observed toxic side effects. Based on this pre-clinical research, we believe NPS has the potential to offer a novel tumor treatment therapy, as a monotherapy and in combination with other therapies. 
 The PulseTxTM System (PulseTx) is our proprietary NPS delivery platform comprised of a tunable nanosecond pulse generation system and interchangeable tissue applicators, designed to enable the application of NPS across a variety of tissue treatment applications. We believe the unique biological response of cells to our novel NPS technology enables Pulse Biosciences the opportunity to pursue therapeutic applications across a wide array of tissues types, including cancerous lesions. The favorable healing characteristics of NPS, on non-cancerous tissue afford opportunities in applications such as dermatology and aesthetics, while the ability to initiate ICD holds promise in key applications such as immuno-oncology.

     ﻿
 Pulse Biosciences strategy is to deploy the PulseTx System in pilot clinical studies to help identify those applications where NPS represents a high value opportunity. Based on the results of the planned pilot studies and the market opportunity, we will pursue the required regulatory clearances and ultimately commercialize these opportunities.
 Our Proprietary Nano-Pulse Stimulation Technology
 We are developing a therapeutic tissue treatment platform based upon our proprietary NPS technology. NPS is a local, non-thermal, drug-free, and potentially drug compatible, treatment that can stimulate programmed cell death, a process in which cells systematically eliminate themselves to make way for new cells. The NPS cell death process triggers a cascade of cellular events that in preclinical models, results in tumor destruction and lasting immunity against future tumor growth.
 Programmed cell death is a normal process exhibited by many cells in the human body when they are no longer functioning properly. It involves a slow “digestion” of cellular proteins and DNA in the cells that are then recognized and removed by the immune system. When this process results in immunogenic cell death, it stimulates the immune system to generate an immune response that actively seeks out and destroys any similar cells in the body. Pre-clinical studies suggest that NPS can stimulate programmed cell death in non-cancerous cells and ICD in cancer cells. 
 We believe the unique characteristics of NPS to induce programmed cell death may translate to positive clinical outcomes and may establish NPS as a superior treatment modality across a variety of potential applications, including oncology, dermatology, and other minimally invasive applications where current treatment modalities do not provide benefits comparable to those afforded by NPS. 
 Cells are the most basic building units of life and are the primary components of tumors and lesions, cancerous and non-cancerous. The function of a cell is dependent on the proper functioning of the cellular organelles, which are a number of smaller cellular structural subunits responsible for carrying out all cellular functions, and include, among others, the mitochondria (cellular energy production), Golgi complex (intracellular cellular transport functions), and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (protein coding and production). The disruption of the function of one or more of these cellular organelles can result in the dysfunction of the cell as a whole and initiate the programmed cell death process.
 It is this nanoporation effect discussed below on disruption of internal cellular membranes and organelle damage that differentiates NPS technology from other energy-based therapies, such as irreversible electroporation (IRE) and radiofrequency ablation (RFA).
 NPS exerts an electrical force on water molecules, driving them into the lipid bilayer of the plasma cell membrane and the membranes of the intracellular organelles, producing transient water-filled nanopores. It is this nanoporation effect on internal cellular membranes that differentiates our technology from other energy-based therapies, such as irreversible electroporation (IRE) and radiofrequency ablation (RFA).

﻿ | 
 | The water molecule induced transient pores allow ions to pass through them, and this can have several immediate effects including the release of calcium ions from the endoplasmic reticulum, termination of the mitochondrial membrane potential and disruption of the Golgi apparatus. Downstream effects of NPS include initiating a signaling cascade that we believe results in ICD in immunogenic lesions. ICD is a process by which cells are induced to die in a manner that activates the immune system to both clear the dying tumor cell and enroll immune system cells, such as cytotoxic T cells (CD8+) to recognize and eliminate cells of the same tumor type Alternatively, in non-immunogenic lesions, we believe NPS can initiate a positive healing with minimal inflammatory response.

  The cellular response to NPS is believed to occur in the following steps:

· | Water induced transient nanopores form within the plasma and intracellular membranes immediately resulting in the release of sequestered calcium into the cytoplasm and extracellular space within one second;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

· | Phosphatidylserine (PS), a cell signaling compound, is externalized to the cell surface within several seconds and is one marker used by the immune system to target and phagocytose (digest, process and present to the immune system) unhealthy cells;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation occurs within approximately one minute;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Pyknosis and DNA fragmentation are stimulated within approximately 10 minutes (pyknosis is the shrinking of a cell nucleus along with condensation of the tissue in a cell that is undergoing necrosis or programmed cell death);
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Calreticulin protein is externalized to the cell surface to become a second marker used by the immune system to target and phagocytose cells within approximately two hours;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Caspase activation occurs within approximately three hours (caspases are a family of cellular proteins that are normally inactive but can be activated during programmed cell death to degrade other cellular proteins); and

· | We believe an adaptive immune response to the treated tumor can be triggered over a period of 14-28 days, as demonstrated in pre-clinical models showing the presence of CD8 + T cells.

  Potential Benefits of NPS Technology:

--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Induction of ICD, which can induce an adaptive immune response that targets malignant cells;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Focal elimination of unwanted tissue with a favorable healing profile;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Reduction of collateral damage to adjacent tissue because non-thermal NPS targets cells, and spares nearby non-cellular tissue;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Utilization as a monotherapy or in combination with other therapeutics such as checkpoint inhibitor therapies (αPD-1, αPD-L1, αCTLA-4).

  Side Effects of NPS Technology
 During the course of conducting human clinical studies in dermatology with the NPS investigational device, 71 patients experienced 736 NPS treatment cycles, with no adverse events reported and dermatologist-confirmed normal healing responses over the time course of the studies. Subsequent histological review of the treated human tissues revealed a predictable and consistent cellular healing response across a wide range of skin types and patient demographics.  
 Our Proprietary NPS Delivery System
 The PulseTx System refers to our newly designed clinical device that delivers our NPS therapies and treatments in our ongoing pre-clinical and clinical trials. The PulseTx is a first-of-its-kind nanosecond pulse generator with interchangeable applicator systems designed to adapt NPS treatments and therapies across multiple clinical and research applications and anatomical targets The PulseTx is comprised of two primary components:
· | The PulseTx Generator: a novel and proprietary tunable pulse generator capable of delivering treatments with varying pulse amplitude, duration, frequency and number. These are the key NPS parameters for stimulating cell death and ICD in tissue. The ability to tune these parameters with the PulseTx generator enables the customization of treatments and therapies for a variety of applications and tissue types.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | PulseTx Applicator Suite; a suite of interchangeable NPS treatment applicators that deliver NPS directly to the tissue being treated. We are designing a suite of single and multiple use PulseTx Applicators tailored to specific applications, including open or minimally invasive surface, surgery or solid tissue treatments.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  We believe that the design of the PulseTx System will allow the system to be deployed in a standard clinic or hospital setting, without the need for special facilities or installation requirements. The first human clinical studies in dermatology utilized the PulseTx device exclusively along with treatment applicators designed for skin treatments, and deployed a wide range of NPS pulse amplitude, duration, frequency and number settings with no system failures reported and positive physician reports for ease-of-use.  
 We submitted a United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) 510(k) for the PulseTx System for soft tissue ablation during the first quarter of 2017. The strategy at that time was to obtain a general clearance for soft tissue ablation as a first step in our regulatory path, knowing that prior to commercialization of the PulseTx System we would require additional regulatory approvals for specific indications, either through the 510(k) process or through the Pre-Market Approval process. The decision to pursue the 510(k) for soft tissue ablation at that time was based on timing of our clinical 

     
5

 
     development programs and the belief that it could provide a foundation for pursuing specific indications as we identified the indications we would initially pursue with the PulseTx System. After significant interaction with the FDA during the 510(k) review process we elected to withdraw our submission during the third quarter of 2017 after concluding that we would not be able to provide sufficient and reasonable data requested by the FDA within the review process timeline.
 Based on continued communication with FDA, consultation with regulatory experts, recent clinical progress and our clinical program plans, we have decided to focus our regulatory efforts on directly obtaining specific clinical indications as opposed to first pursuing a general soft tissue ablation clearance through the 510(k) process. Though we believe we can generate the data required for a soft tissue ablation clearance, at this time we do not feel it will provide the advantages it may have previously and is not the most expeditious and efficient path to getting a product to market in the indications we feel are going to bring the most value to stakeholders, specifically in immuno-oncology. It is our belief at this time that the most efficient and effective use of our resources is to work with FDA in pursuit of a specific indication in immuno-oncology, and potentially other indications we may wish to pursue, such as dermatology. These specific indications may go through the 510(k), De Novo, or Pre-Market Approval processes at FDA.

 Applications
 Oncology
 We believe that NPS may afford a new immunotherapy treatment modality in certain cancers, either as a standalone therapy or in combination with other therapies currently available and in development. It is well established that cancer cells can be recognized by the immune system. Under normal circumstances, these cancer cells will be detected by the immune surveillance system and eliminated. However, when cancer cells either evade or defeat the immune surveillance system, tumors grow and spread in an unregulated manner resulting in malignancies and, over time, may even cause the lack or loss of response to treatments.  
 We believe that NPS may offer a novel approach to treating tumors as a monotherapy and in combination with other therapies. Pre-clinical research demonstrates that NPS can eliminate treated tumors, can disrupt the tumor microenvironment of treated tumors and can induce immunogenic cell death in a drug-free manner. It is believed that ICD stimulates the immune system’s ability to detect tumor cell antigens and mount an immune response specifically against those tumor cells that were treated with NPS. 
 Specifically, when tumors are treated with NPS, the cellular transient nanopores in individual tumor cells trigger endoplasmic reticulum stress, the release of intracellular calcium, ROS is produced and the emission of danger-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), signals that alert the innate immune system to unscheduled cell death. As a result, these tumor cells undergo ICD, which is a unique form of cell death that is responsible for recruiting immune cells to the site of the NPS-treated tumors for antigen processing and presentation. 
 ICD is a desirable form of cell death in cancer therapy as it exhibits a preference for the cross-presentation of tumor cell antigens in the lymph nodes. The hallmark of ICD and cross-presentation is the generation of an adaptive immune response including CD4+ helper-T cells and, more important for killing cancer cells, CD8+ cytotoxic-T cells. In effect, NPS may serve as an in situ personalized cancer vaccination against an individual’s own tumors. Furthermore, based on preclinical studies, we believe the microenvironment in NPS-treated tumors is modified and that the protective mechanisms surrounding the tumor are reduced and possibly eliminated.
 The ability of NPS to initiate an immune response against cancerous tumors and the related cancer microenvironment may lend itself more favorably to immunogenic cancers. Cancer immunogenicity reflects a tumor’s ability to stimulate an immune response. It has been hypothesized that cancer immunogenicity increases with mutation rate, meaning the more mutations a tumor has, the greater the chance of mutations generating an immune response. Cancers with the highest mutation rates include melanoma, certain lung cancers, and bladder cancer.  
 Relative to existing immune therapies, we believe that NPS therapy will activate the adaptive immune response specific to an individual’s tumors in a non-toxic, targeted manner. Given the many different approaches to modulating an immune response and the ability of an immune response to access tumors, significant potential exists for NPS to be synergistic with existing therapies and therapies in development.  
 Our previously published pre-clinical work demonstrated the ability of NPS to treat and eliminate targeted melanoma tumors and that NPS-treated tumor cells can be used as a vaccine to protect mice against fibrosarcoma subdermal allografts. Additional pre-clinical studies conducted to date confirm the elimination of NPS treated tumors along with the generation of an adaptive immune response against various other tumor types. We continue to develop NPS, delineate the

     immune response and explore additional applications in oncology using pre-clinical animal models in preparation for upcoming clinical studies. 

During 2017 we advanced our pre-clinical immuno-oncology research into companion animals and initiated our first investigatory and feasibility study of NPS in veterinary medicine for the treatment of advanced canine oral melanoma. The study was designed to investigate the safety, local tumor control and to look for signs of an immune response as a result of NPS treatment in canines with oral melanoma at stage 3 or above, meaning those dogs with evidence of metastatic disease. The follow-up period of this study was 112 days.
 In 2017 five animals were treated under a protocol with this study design. The five animals treated during 2017 underwent a total of 11 procedures and 224 individual NPS treatment cycles. All cycles were successfully delivered using the PulseTx System and there were no serious adverse events reported during the study. The animals returned home the day of treatment. There was a single adverse event noted in one dog several weeks after treatment, where the mandible bone was exposed inside the oral cavity and showed signs of damage where the tumor infiltrated the bone and was treated with NPS.
 The five canines treated had tumors ranging from 2.5cm to 6.1cm in their longest dimension. All NPS treatments resulted in acute reduction of the tumor volume, demonstrating that NPS can reduce tumor volume in this disease state. Two animals survived through the 112-day follow-up period, with one animal having no visible tumor at last report, which was seven months post initial NPS treatment. Three of the five animals had progressive disease during the 112-day follow-up period and were euthanized prior to the end of the study due to progressive disease. Though there were no definitive conclusions that can be drawn in this small number of animals with regard to an immune response we did observe immune cell changes in the lymph nodes and peripheral blood of the two animals that completed the study follow up that provide some evidence of potential immune response to the NPS treatment. Based on the local tumor control results and the demonstrated safety profile of NPS we have observed across all of our studies, and the confidence established with our veterinary oncology clinicians during this study, we are preparing to commence a follow-on canine study evaluating NPS in the treatment of stage I and stage II canine oral melanoma and expect to initiate the study during 2018. We believe treating earlier in the disease progression will provide enhanced opportunities to demonstrate the potential of NPS in treating the primary tumor and the initiation and progression of an immune response.   
 We are in the early stages of planning to initiate our first human clinical oncology study in patients with unresectable in-transit melanoma. We continue working with our KOLs to finalize the study design in preparation for what will likely be an investigational device exemption filing with the FDA during the second half of 2018.
 ﻿
 Dermatology/Aesthetics
 We believe NPS has high potential to offer improved clinical outcomes for a broad range of dermatology conditions and aesthetic skin applications for which targeted removal of skin lesions is medically or cosmetically desirable. Current dermatology procedures to remove lesions or undesired skin tissue typically involve either excision (e.g. surgery) or the use of extreme heat (e.g. lasers or radiofrequency energy) or extreme cold (e.g. cryoablation). 
 Our novel NPS non-thermal mechanism for removing undesired skin lesions has the potential for both minimizing collateral damage to surrounding healthy tissue and minimizing the inflammatory response as compared to standard treatment modalities, both of which can help contribute to cosmetically desired appearance of the skin when the lesion is eliminated, and the skin is healed.

     During 2017 we completed our first-in-human study utilizing our NPS technology and the PulseTx in a healthy tissue, pre-abdominoplasty (commonly known as a “tummy tuck”) study. This human skin safety and dose response study allowed for evaluation of tissue effects of a wide range of NPS energy doses on healthy skin that was scheduled for subsequent removal. Over 170 individual sections of skin were tested during the course of the study, with no adverse events reported over the maximum 90-day evaluation period.  Treatments were well tolerated with standard local anesthesia. The analysis of investigator evaluations, clinical photographs, and microscopic examination of tissue samples consistently demonstrated a pattern of controlled programmed cell death of targeted tissue in the upper layer of the skin (the epidermis) where many skin lesions are located, and a tissue sparing effect in the dermal skin layer. This finding of selective epidermal effects was consistent and apparent in the study across tested NPS delivery settings which adjusted pulse amplitude, frequency, duration and number of pulses. An independent dermatopathologist concluded NPS has a low risk of undesired dermal damage and noted a quantifiable restoration of a normal population of the melanocytes that produce skin pigment in the epidermis.  These important first studies of human safety and mechanisms of action in skin confirm a broad efficacy dose-response curve, and evidence of a wide range of settings that could be utilized to elicit desired responses in future studies of treating abnormal skin conditions, and a unique non-thermal cellular mechanism of action not seen with thermal-based energy treatments. In addition, a specialized immunohistochemistry stain called Caspase-3 provided the first human evidence of programmed cell death, which clearly confirms a unique cellular mechanism of action that is more commonly seen with chemotherapeutic agents or radiation emitting devices.
 Based on the promising results from our NPS abdominoplasty dose-response study, during 2017 we initiated and completed treatments and primary follow-up in a multi-center, 58-patient study of NPS for the treatment of a common benign skin lesion, Seborrheic Keratosis (SK). Each patient underwent treatment on three separate SK lesions with one lesion left untreated as a comparative control. Treatments were well tolerated with standard local anesthesia, and no adverse events were reported. Study results have been accepted for presentation at the 38th American Society for Laser Medicine & Surgery Annual Conference on Energy-Based Medicine & Science being held in Dallas, Texas on April 11 to 15, 2018.
 We continue to evaluate potential clinical targets in dermatology and to assess the effects of NPS on various tissue and skin types having recently completed a dose-response ranging study evaluating NPS clinical safety and histological effects on facial skin planned for excision in a subsequent facelift procedure. Patient tolerance of facial skin treatment was excellent, and there were no adverse events reported for the entire range of tested energy settings.  
 We intend to pursue clinical studies of NPS in dermatology applications during 2018 with the longer-term plan of demonstrating the benefits of NPS in a range of dermatology conditions. We have identified multiple, potentially high value applications in dermatology for which the non-thermal effects of NPS in skin lesion disorders may lead to improved patient experiences and improved outcomes when compared to existing more destructive lesion removal methods. Potential application candidates in dermatology beyond Seborrheic Keratosis include; sebaceous hyperplasia, keloid scars, warts, Basal Cell Carcinoma, Squamous Cell Carcinoma (SCC), and Actinic Keratosis. Key considerations in prioritizing our initial clinical applications for study include, a substantial market size for skin treatments that are more typically paid directly by patients, a likelihood of favorable clinical outcomes based on the continued analysis of our dose response study data and unique cellular mechanisms, comparisons to the current standards of care for lesion removal. In addition, these first human studies of NPS dose response for various skin conditions provide important experience that guide device design, dose-response decisions, and mechanism of action insights that will guide future use for oncology applications and provide important evidence of safety that will support future regulatory filings.    Strategy
 ﻿

We have consolidated several different entities working on nanosecond pulsed electric fields, and we now own or license 60 issued patents and 66 filed patent applications in the United States and worldwide. This novel platform technology with IP protection allows us to follow a broad, platform-based approach to introducing our NPS technology and related therapies and devices.
 Our strategy is to:

· | Develop a general purpose NPS platform for use across a broad array of applications. We have developed and continue developing a versatile nanosecond pulse generation system, the PulseTx System, that can produce pulses of variable number, width, amplitude, and frequency and can be used with various applicator types and deployed into a wide range of applications;

 Intellectual Property
 We believe that our current and any future patents and other proprietary rights we own or license are and will be essential to our business and create an important competitive advantage for us. We also rely on trade secrets, know-how, continuing technological innovations and licensing opportunities to develop, maintain and strengthen our competitive position. We seek to protect our intellectual property, in part, through confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants and other parties, patent registration and access control to sensitive information. Our success also will depend on the ability of our licensors to obtain, maintain (including making periodic filings and payments) and enforce confidentiality agreements and patent protection for their intellectual property, in particular, those patents and other intellectual property to which we have secured rights.
 We own or license 60 issued patents and 66 filed patent applications in the United States and worldwide to protect the intellectual property on which nanosecond pulsed electric field technology is based. Our United States issued patents are set to expire between 2020 and 2034.
 As we expand our business internationally, we will seek patent, trademark and copyright protections as appropriate and available and conduct our business with the protections of confidentiality and trade secrets. Depending on the jurisdiction, we may not be able to obtain the scope of protections we seek, in which event we will need to balance the available protections against the importance of such market to us.
 Research and Development
 We are currently conducting research and development activities in pursuit of commercial applications for our NPS technology but have not yet commercialized or recognized revenue from our technology. Therefore, the majority of our business activities are devoted to research, including clinical trials, related to our core technologies and development of devices and products based on those technologies. Research and development expenses totaled $9.6 million, $5.5 million, and $2.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015. Research and development expenses are expected to increase substantially during the fiscal year ending 2018, reflecting the increased growth in our operational activities and expansion of our clinical trial programs.  
 Our R&D development team incorporates data and feedback obtained from our clinical and research programs into the development of the PulseTx NPS System and further inform our clinical strategies. We believe that developing and leveraging relationships among clinicians is a key element in driving the adoption of our technology in clinical studies in the short-term and enhances the potential for possible commercial systems in the future.
 Competition
 The applications we intend to target are subject to intense competition from rapidly evolving companies and new scientific discoveries. We compete against well-established incumbent technologies offering products in oncology, dermatology and aesthetics, minimally invasive treatments, and veterinary applications. Given the broad scope of our technology, we face competition ranging from large manufacturers with multiple business lines to small companies with focused products, as well as providers of other medical therapies and therapeutics for conditions that we intend to treat. Our future success will depend on our ability to establish and maintain a competitive position in current and future technologies.
 In immuno-oncology, we compete with multiple new technologies stimulating the immune system to target cancer. An increased understanding of the multiple mechanisms by which cancer or precancerous cells can evade the immune system has helped researchers develop drugs including those that target immune inhibitors or stimulate T-cell production. For example, approved checkpoint inhibitor therapeutics are administered systemically and modulate the immune system in a more global way, which can lead to significant side effects including autoimmune diseases. Companies with approved checkpoint inhibitors include: Bristol-Myers Squibb and Merck. CAR-T cell therapy has gained attention recently; including a first ever FDA approval; which refers to a therapy where T cells are removed from a patient and modified to express receptors on its surface that are specific to a cancer type. These cells are then cultured and infused back into the body. 
 We compete with multiple tissue removal technologies. These technologies cause immediate cell necrosis, as compared

     to programmed cell death, killing cells within seconds to hours following exposure and triggering inflammation. Our technology is unique and differentiated in that NPS stimulates primarily intracellular cell death which we believe would be less traumatic to treated tissue and would result in less scarring or collateral damage to surrounding tissues. Tissue removal technologies include RFA, microwave ablation, cryoablation, laser therapies and irreversible electroporation (IRE).
 IRE uses pulsed electric fields at a high voltage in hundreds of microsecond pulse widths. These pulses cause irreversible damage to cell membranes, resulting in necrosis (death) of the tumor cells. However, this technology stimulates nerves and muscles in a manner that makes it common for clinicians to use general anesthesia and muscle blockade during treatment. In contrast, NPS utilizes nano pulses up to 1,000 times shorter than micro pulses. In pre-clinical and clinical studies of over 70 patients, NPS use in fully conscious patients has not required the use of muscle blockade or general anesthesia. Moreover, our NPS technology transiently permeabilizes internal organelles which can lead to a signaling cascade ending in immunogenic cell death as opposed to the primarily necrotic cell death associated with IRE pulsed energy, which is not associated with a lasting immune response.
 Tissue ablation companies for therapeutic applications include: Medtronic, Boston Scientific, AngioDynamics and St. Jude Medical. Ablation companies for dermatologic and aesthetic applications include: Alma Lasers, Cutera and Syneron Medical.
 Government Regulation
 In general, medical device companies must navigate a challenging regulatory environment. The FDA regulates the medical device market to ensure the safety and efficacy of these products. The FDA allows for two primary pathways for a medical device to gain approval for commercialization: a successful pre-market approval, or PMA application or 510(k) clearance. A completely novel product must go through the more rigorous premarket approval, or PMA, process if it cannot receive authorization through a 510(k). The FDA has established three different classes of medical devices that indicate the level of risk associated with using a device and consequent degree of regulatory controls needed to govern its safety and efficacy. Level I and Level II devices are considered lower risk and often can gain approval for commercial distribution by submitting a notification request to the FDA, generally known as the 510(k) process. The devices regarded as the highest risk by the FDA are designated Class III status and generally require the submission of a PMA application for approval to commercialize a product. These generally include life-sustaining, life-supporting, or implantable devices or devices without a known predicate technology already approved by the FDA.
 The 510(k) clearance path can be significantly less time-consuming than PMA approval, making this route preferable for a medical device company. Through a 510(k), a company must provide documentation that its device is safe and effective by showing it is substantially equivalent to a device already cleared through a 510(k) or in distribution before May 28, 1976 for which the FDA has not yet required a PMA submission. The FDA has a 90-calendar day review goal from the date of the 510(k) submission to authorize or decline commercial distribution of the device. However, similar to the PMA process, approval may take longer than this 90-day goal. If the FDA resolves that the product is not substantially equivalent to a predicate device, a clearance will not be granted. 
 A PMA application must be accompanied by substantial data that supports the safety and efficacy of the device, which includes the provision of preclinical, clinical, technical, manufacturing and labeling information. If the FDA deems the application acceptable to pass through the first level of scrutiny, it has 180 days to review the submission, but it can typically take longer (up to several years) as this regulatory body can request additional information or clarifications. The FDA may also impose additional regulatory hurdles for a PMA, including the institution of an outside advisory panel of experts to assess the application or provide recommendations as to whether to approve the device. Although the FDA in the end approves or disapproves the device, in nearly all cases the FDA follows the recommendation from the independent panel concerning approvability of the new device. As part of this process, the FDA will also inspect the manufacturing operations of the company requesting approval to verify compliance with quality control regulations. Significant changes in the fabrication of a device, or alterations in the labeling or design of a product require new PMA applications or PMA supplements for a product originally approved under a PMA.
 ﻿
 Pervasive and Continuing Regulation
 After a device is placed on the market, numerous regulatory requirements continue to apply. These include:
 ﻿

· | The FDA’s Quality System Regulation (QSR) which requires manufacturers, including third-party manufacturers, to follow stringent design, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures during all aspects of the manufacturing process;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  ﻿

     
10

 
     
· | labeling regulations and FDA prohibitions against the promotion of products for uncleared, unapproved or off-label uses;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  ﻿

· | clearance or approval of product modifications that could significantly affect safety or efficacy or that would constitute a major change in intended use;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  ﻿

· | medical device reporting (MDR), regulations, which require that manufacturers report to the FDA if their device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if the malfunction were to recur; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  ﻿

· | post-market surveillance regulations, which apply when necessary to protect the public health or to provide additional safety and effectiveness data for the device.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  After a device receives 510(k) clearance or PMA approval, any modification that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a major change in its intended use, will require a new clearance or approval. The FDA requires each manufacturer to make this determination initially, but the FDA can review any such decision and can disagree with a manufacturer’s determination. If the FDA disagrees with the determination not to seek a new 510(k) clearance or PMA, the FDA may retroactively require a new 510(k) clearance or premarket approval. The FDA could also require a manufacturer to cease marketing and distribution and/or recall the modified device until 510(k) clearance or premarket approval is obtained. Also, in these circumstances, it may be subject to significant regulatory fines, penalties, and warning letters.
 ﻿
 The MDR regulations require that we report to the FDA any incident in which our product may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or in which our product malfunctioned and, if the malfunction were to recur, would likely cause or contribute to death or serious injury.
 The FDA has broad post-market and regulatory enforcement powers. We may be subject to unannounced inspections by the FDA and the Food and Drug Branch of the California Department of Public Health to determine our compliance with the QSR and other regulations, and these inspections may include the manufacturing facilities of our suppliers. 
 Failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can result in enforcement action by FDA, which may include any of the following sanctions:
 ﻿

· | warning letters, fines, injunctions, consent decrees and civil penalties;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------

  ﻿

· | repair, replacement, refunds, recall or seizure of our products;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------

  ﻿

 Regulatory System for Medical Devices in Europe
 The European Union consists of 28-member states and has a coordinated system for the authorization of medical devices. The E.U. Medical Devices Directive, or MDD, sets out the basic regulatory framework for medical devices in the European Union. This directive has been separately enacted in more detail in the national legislation of the individual member states of the European Union.
 The system of regulating medical devices operates by way of a certification for each medical device. Each certificated device is marked with Conformité Européene (CE) mark which shows that the device has a Certificat de Conformité. There are national bodies known as Competent Authorities in each member state which oversee the implementation of the MDD within their jurisdiction. The means for achieving the requirements for CE mark varies according to the nature of the device. Devices are classified in accordance with their perceived risks, similarly to the U.S. system. The class of a product determines the requirements to be fulfilled before CE mark can be placed on a product, known as a conformity assessment.

     Conformity assessments for our products are carried out as required by the MDD. Each member state can appoint Notified Bodies within its jurisdiction. If a Notified Body of one member state has issued a Certificat de Conformité, the device can be sold throughout the European Union without further conformance tests being required in other member states.

 Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act
 The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, established for the first time comprehensive federal protection for the privacy and security of health information. The HIPAA standards apply to three types of organizations, or Covered Entities: health plans, healthcare clearing houses, and healthcare providers which conduct certain healthcare transactions electronically. Title II of HIPAA, the Administrative Simplification Act, contains provisions that address the privacy of health data, the security of health data, the standardization of identifying numbers used in the healthcare system and the standardization of certain healthcare transactions. The privacy regulations protect medical records and other protected health information by limiting their use and release, giving patients the right to access their medical records and limiting most disclosures of health information to the minimum amount necessary to accomplish an intended purpose. The HIPAA security standards require the adoption of administrative, physical, and technical safeguards and the adoption of written security policies and procedures. HIPAA requires Covered Entities to obtain a written assurance of compliance from individuals or organizations who provide services to Covered Entities involving the use or disclosure of protected health information (“Business Associates”).
 On February 17, 2009, Congress enacted Subtitle D of the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, provisions of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. HITECH amends HIPAA and, among other things, expands and strengthens HIPAA, creates new targets for enforcement, imposes new penalties for noncompliance and establishes new breach notification requirements for Covered Entities and Business Associates. Regulations implementing major provisions of HITECH were finalized on January 25, 2013 through publication of the HIPAA Omnibus Rule, or the Omnibus Rule. The Omnibus Rule contained significant changes for Covered Entities and Business Associates with respect to permitted uses and disclosures of Protected Health Information.
 Under HITECH’s new breach notification requirements, Covered Entities must report breaches of protected health information that has not been encrypted or otherwise secured in accordance with guidance from the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, or the Secretary. Required breach notices must be made as soon as is reasonably practicable, but no later than 60 days following discovery of the breach. Reports must be made to affected individuals and to the Secretary and in some cases, they must be reported through local and national media, depending on the size of the breach. We are currently subject to the HIPAA regulations. We are subject to audit under the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, HITECH-mandated audit program. We may also be audited in connection with a privacy complaint. We are subject to prosecution and/or administrative enforcement and increased civil and criminal penalties for non-compliance, including a new, four-tiered system of monetary penalties adopted under HITECH. We are also subject to enforcement by state attorneys general who were given authority to enforce HIPAA under HITECH. To avoid penalties under the HITECH breach notification provisions, we must ensure that breaches of protected health information are promptly detected and reported within the company, so that we can make all required notifications on a timely basis. However, even if we make required reports on a timely basis, we may still be subject to penalties for the underlying breach.
 In addition to the federal privacy regulations, there are a number of state laws regarding the privacy and security of health information and personal data that are applicable to clinical laboratories. The compliance requirements of these laws, including additional breach reporting requirements, and the penalties for violation vary widely and new privacy and security laws in this area are evolving. Requirements of these laws and penalties for violations vary widely. We believe that we have taken the steps required of us to comply with health information privacy and security statutes and regulations in all jurisdictions, both state and federal. However, we may not be able to maintain compliance in all jurisdictions where we do business. Failure to maintain compliance, or changes in state or federal laws regarding privacy or security, could result in civil and/or criminal penalties and could have a material adverse effect on our business.
 If we or our operations are found to be in violation of HIPAA, HITECH or their implementing regulations, we may be subject to penalties, including civil and criminal penalties, fines, and exclusion from participation in U.S. federal or state health care programs, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations. HITECH increased the civil and criminal penalties that may be imposed against Covered Entities, their Business Associates and possibly other persons, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorney’s fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions.
 In addition to federal privacy regulations, there are a number of state laws governing confidentiality of health information that are applicable to our operations. New laws governing privacy may be adopted in the future as well. We have taken steps to comply with health information privacy requirements that are applicable to us.

 Federal, State and Foreign Fraud and Abuse Laws
 Because of the significant federal funding involved in Medicare and Medicaid, Congress and the states have enacted, and actively enforce, a number of laws to eliminate fraud and abuse in federal healthcare programs. Our business is subject to compliance with these laws. In March 2010, the Recipient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Healthcare and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act, which we refer to collectively as the Affordable Care Act, was enacted in the United States. The provisions of the Affordable Care Act are effective on various dates. The Affordable Care Act expands the government’s investigative and enforcement authority and increases the penalties for fraud and abuse, including amendments to both the Anti-Kickback Statute and the False Claims Act, to make it easier to bring suit under these statutes. The Affordable Care Act also allocates additional resources and tools for the government to police healthcare fraud, with expanded subpoena power for HHS, additional funding to investigate fraud and abuse across the healthcare system and expanded use of recovery audit contractors for enforcement.
 Anti-Kickback Statutes. The federal healthcare programs’ Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in exchange for or to induce either the referral of an individual, or the furnishing or arranging for a good or service, for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program such as Medicare or Medicaid.
 The definition of “remuneration” has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value, including, for example, gifts, certain discounts, the furnishing of free supplies, equipment or services, credit arrangements, payment of cash and waivers of payments. Several courts have interpreted the statute’s intent requirement to mean that if any one purpose of an arrangement involving remuneration is to induce referrals of federal healthcare covered businesses, the statute has been violated. Penalties for violations include criminal penalties and civil sanctions such as fines, imprisonment and possible exclusion from Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs. In addition, some kickback allegations have been claimed to violate the Federal False Claims Act, discussed in more detail below.
 The Anti-Kickback Statute is broad and prohibits many arrangements and practices that are otherwise lawful in businesses outside of the healthcare industry. Recognizing that the Anti-Kickback Statute is broad and may technically prohibit many innocuous or beneficial arrangements, Congress authorized the Office of Inspector General, or OIG, of HHS to issue a series of regulations known as “safe harbors.” These safe harbors set forth provisions that, if all their applicable requirements are met, will assure healthcare providers and other parties that they will not be prosecuted under the Anti-Kickback Statute. The failure of a transaction or arrangement to fit precisely within one or more safe harbors does not necessarily mean that it is illegal or that prosecution will be pursued. However, conduct and business arrangements that do not fully satisfy an applicable safe harbor may result in increased scrutiny by government enforcement authorities such as OIG.
 Many states have adopted laws similar to the Anti-Kickback Statute. Some of these state prohibitions apply to referral of recipients for healthcare items or services reimbursed by any source, not only the Medicare and Medicaid programs.
 Government officials have focused their enforcement efforts on the marketing of healthcare services and products, among other activities, and recently have brought cases against companies, and certain individual sales, marketing and executive personnel, for allegedly offering unlawful inducements to potential or existing customers in an attempt to procure their business.
 Federal False Claims Act. Another development affecting the healthcare industry is the increased use of the federal False Claims Act, and in particular, action brought pursuant to the False Claims Act’s “whistleblower” or “qui tam” provisions. The False Claims Act imposes liability on any person or entity that, among other things, knowingly presents, or causes to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment by a federal healthcare program. The qui tam provisions of the False Claims Act allow a private individual to bring actions on behalf of the federal government alleging that the defendant has violated the False Claims Act and to share in any monetary recovery. In recent years, the number of suits brought against healthcare providers by private individuals has increased dramatically. In addition, various states have enacted false claims laws analogous to the False Claims Act, and many of these state laws apply where a claim is submitted to any third-party payor and not just a federal healthcare program.
 When an entity is determined to have violated the False Claims Act, it may be required to pay up to three times the actual damages sustained by the government, plus civil penalties of between $5,500 and $11,000 for each separate instance of false claim. As part of any settlement, the government may ask the entity to enter into a corporate integrity agreement, which imposes certain compliance, certification and reporting obligations. There are many potential bases for liability under the False Claims Act. Liability arises, primarily, when an entity knowingly submits, or causes another to submit, a false claim for 

     
13

 
     reimbursement to the federal government. The federal government has used the False Claims Act to assert liability on the basis of inadequate care, kickbacks and other improper referrals, and improper use of Medicare numbers when detailing the provider of services, in addition to the more predictable allegations as to misrepresentations with respect to the services rendered. In addition, the federal government has prosecuted companies under the False Claims Act in connection with off-label promotion of products. Our future activities relating to the reporting of wholesale or estimated retail prices of our products, the reporting of discount and rebate information and other information affecting federal, state and third-party reimbursement of our products and the sale and marketing of our products may be subject to scrutiny under these laws.
 While we are unaware of any current matters, we are unable to predict whether we will be subject to actions under the False Claims Act or a similar state law, or the impact of such actions. However, the costs of defending such claims, as well as any sanctions imposed, could significantly affect our financial performance.
 The Sunshine Act. The Physician Payment Sunshine Act, or the Sunshine Act, which was enacted as part of the Affordable Care Act, requires all entities that operate in the United States and manufacturers of a drug, device, biologic or other medical supply that is covered by Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program to report annually to the Secretary of HHS: (i) payments or other transfers of value made by that entity, or by a third-party as directed by that entity, to physicians and teaching hospitals or to third parties on behalf of physicians or teaching hospitals; and (ii) physician ownership and investment interests in the entity. The payments required to be reported include the cost of meals provided to a physician, travel reimbursements and other transfers of value, including those provided as part of contracted services such as speaker programs, advisory boards, consultation services and clinical trial services. The final rule implementing the Sunshine Act required data collection on payments to begin on August 1, 2013. The first annual report, comprised of data collected from August 1, 2013 to December 31, 2013, was due March 31, 2014. The statute requires the federal government to make reported information available to the public starting September 2014, which it has. Failure to comply with the reporting requirements can result in significant civil monetary penalties ranging from $1,000 to $10,000 for each payment or other transfer of value that is not reported (up to a maximum per annual report of $150,000) and from $10,000 to $100,000 for each knowing failure to report (up to a maximum per annual report of $1.0 million). Additionally, there are criminal penalties if an entity intentionally makes false statements in such reports. We are subject to the Sunshine Act and the information we disclose may lead to greater scrutiny, which may result in modifications to established practices and additional costs. Additionally, similar reporting requirements have also been enacted on the state level domestically, and an increasing number of countries worldwide either have adopted or are considering similar laws requiring transparency of interactions with healthcare professionals.
 Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, prohibits any United States individual or business from paying, offering, or authorizing payment or offering of anything of value, directly or indirectly, to any foreign official, political party or candidate for the purpose of influencing any act or decision of the foreign entity in order to assist the individual or business in obtaining or retaining business. The FCPA also obligates companies whose securities are listed in the United States to comply with accounting provisions requiring us to maintain books and records that accurately and fairly reflect all transactions of the corporation, including international subsidiaries, if any, and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls for international operations.
 International Laws. In Europe, various countries have adopted anti-bribery laws providing for severe consequences, in the form of criminal penalties and/or significant fines, for individuals and/or companies committing a bribery offense. Violations of these anti-bribery laws, or allegations of such violations, could have a negative impact on our business, results of operations and reputation. For instance, in the United Kingdom, under the Bribery Act 2010, which went into effect in July 2011, a bribery occurs when a person offers, gives or promises to give a financial or other advantage to induce or reward another individual to improperly perform certain functions or activities, including any function of a public nature. Bribery of foreign public officials also falls within the scope of the Bribery Act 2010. Under the new regime, an individual found in violation of the Bribery Act of 2010, faces imprisonment of up to 10 years. In addition, the individual can be subject to an unlimited fine, as can commercial organizations for failure to prevent bribery.
 There are also international privacy laws that impose restrictions on the access, use, and disclosure of health information. All of these laws may impact our business. Our failure to comply with these privacy laws or significant changes in the laws restricting our ability to obtain required patient information could significantly impact our business and our future business plans.

 U.S. Healthcare Reform
 Changes in healthcare policy could increase our costs and subject us to additional regulatory requirements that may interrupt commercialization of our current and future solutions. Changes in healthcare policy could increase our costs, decrease our revenues and impact sales of and reimbursement for our current and future solutions. The Affordable Care Act 

     
14

 
     substantially changes the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers, and significantly impacts our industry. The Act contains a number of provisions that impact our business and operations, some of which in ways we cannot currently predict, including those governing enrollments in federal healthcare programs and reimbursement changes.
 There will continue to be proposals by legislators at both the federal and state levels, regulators and third-party payors to reduce costs while expanding individual healthcare benefits. Certain of these changes could impose additional limitations on the prices we will be able to charge for our current and future solutions or the amounts of reimbursement available for our current and future solutions from governmental agencies or third-party payors. While in general it is too early to predict specifically what effect the Affordable Care Act and its implementation or any future healthcare reform legislation or policies will have on our business, current and future healthcare reform legislation and policies could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.
 ﻿
 Third-Party Reimbursement
 Payment for patient care in the United States is generally made by third-party payors, including private insurers and government insurance programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid. The Medicare program, the largest single payor in the United States, is a federal governmental health insurance program administered by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, and covers certain medical care expenses for eligible elderly and disabled individuals. Because a large percentage of the population with PAD includes Medicare beneficiaries, and private insurers may follow the coverage and payment policies of Medicare, Medicare’s coverage and payment policies are significant to our operations. 
 ﻿
 Environmental
 We are subject to federal, state and local laws, rules, regulations and policies governing the use, generation, manufacture, storage, air emission, effluent discharge, handling and disposal of certain hazardous and potentially hazardous substances used in connection with our operations. Although we believe that we have complied with these laws and regulations in all material respects and, to date, have not been required to take any action to correct any noncompliance, there can be no assurance that we will not be required to incur significant costs to comply with environmental regulations in the future.    ﻿ Insurance
 We maintain product and clinical trial liability insurance coverage which includes a maximum of per claim and an annual aggregate policy limits, subject to self-insured retentions. The policy covers, subject to policy conditions and exclusions, claims of bodily injury and property damage from any product manufactured by us or from trial-related adverse events.
 There is no assurance that our level of coverage is adequate. We may not be able to sustain or maintain our current level of coverage and cannot assure you that adequate insurance coverage will continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. A successful product liability claim may exceed our existing coverages and may make future coverages significantly more expensive, if available at all.
 ﻿
 Employees
 As of December 31, 2017, we had 33 full-time employees. Of these employees, 24 were in research and development and nine were in general and administration.
