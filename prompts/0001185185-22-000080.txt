Historical Development



America Great Health, formerly Crown Marketing, is a Wyoming corporation (the "Company"). A change of control of the Company was completed on January 19, 2017 from Jay Hooper, the former officer and director of the Company and its former majority shareholder. Control was obtained by the sale of 16,155,746,000 shares of Company common stock from Mr. Hooper to an investor group led by Mike Q. Wang. In connection with the change of control, the Company sold to its former majority shareholder a subsidiary for $100 and another subsidiary in exchange for the cancellation of all payables and accrued expenses. After December 31, 2016, the Company’s operations are determined and structured by the new investor group. As such, the Company accounted for all of its assets, liabilities and results of operations up to January 1, 2017 as discontinued operations.

Our Business



Prior to the change in control on January 19, 2017, the Company sold consumer products. It acquired electronic products from manufacturers and then sold them directly to consumers so as to be more competitive in price. As of December 31, 2016, the Company ceased operations in this line of business.



The Company under the new management has focused its business in the health industry. With the asset acquisition from Wang’s Property Investment &Management LLC, the Company will diversify its business into property investment and management.



Apart from the acquisition of Purecell and the setting up of the JV Company, the Company is planning to make additional acquisitions. We have approached several health related companies in Asia Pacific and met the management of potential acquisition targets. Rapid economic advances in Asia Pacific in the last 20 years have greatly improved the living standards in Asia Pacific. This in turn brings demand in healthcare products and services. The Company feels strongly that despite the challenges of cross border business, it might be able to acquire some good growth companies and bring good values to our stockholders.



Employees and Outside Services



The company has 13 full-time employees as of report date. Remaining administrative (non-policy making) officers and consultants and technical personnel such as marketing specialists are being compensated as independent contractors. We pay these persons on a contract basis as required.
