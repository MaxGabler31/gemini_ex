 ITEM 1.    BUSINESS
 As used in this Annual Report on Form 10-K (“Annual Report”), unless the context indicates otherwise, the terms “Centric Brands,” “we,” “us,” “our,” and “the Company” refer to Centric Brands Inc. (formerly Differential Brands Group, Inc.) and our subsidiaries and affiliates. Centric Brands Inc. is a Delaware corporation that was incorporated in 1987. Overview
 Centric Brands is a leading lifestyle brands collective, bringing together creative minds from the worlds of fashion and commerce, sourcing, technology, marketing, digital and entertainment. We design, produce, merchandise, manage, and market kidswear, accessories, and men’s and women’s apparel under owned, licensed and private label brands and distribute our products across all retail and digital channels in North America and in international markets.
 We license over 100 brands or produce private label products across our core product categories including kids, accessories, and men’s and women’s apparel. Licensed brands include Calvin Klein, Under Armour, Tommy Hilfiger, Nautica, Spyder, BCBG, Joe’s, Buffalo, Frye, Michael Kors, Kate Spade, AllSaints and Cole Haan, and entertainment properties including Disney, Marvel and Nickelodeon, among others. Our products are sold through a cross section of leading retailers such as Walmart, Macy’s, Kohl’s, TJX Companies, Costco, Nordstrom, Dillard’s, Ross, Target, JC Penney, and Amazon. We also sell our products over the web through retail partners such as Walmart.com, Macy’s.com and Nordstrom.com. We also distribute apparel and other products through our own retail stores, ecommerce websites, and partner shop-in-shops.
 We began our operations in April 1987 as Innovo, Inc., a Texas corporation, in the consumer products industry. Since that time, we have changed our corporate name several times to reflect our evolution. Our corporate name has changed from Innovo Group Inc. in 1990, to Joe’s Jeans Inc. in 2007, to Differential Brands Group Inc. in 2016 and most recently, Centric Brands Inc. in October 2018. As part of this progression, in September 2013, we acquired the Hudson brand, which is a designer and marketer of men’s and women’s premium branded denim apparel. In January 2016, we acquired the Robert Graham brand, which is engaged in the design, development, sales and licensing of sophisticated, eclectic apparel products and accessories. In July 2016, we acquired the SWIMS brand, a Scandinavian-based business engaged in the design, development, sales and licensing of footwear, apparel and accessories. Most recently, in October 2018, we completed the acquisition of a significant portion of Global Brands Group Holding Limited’s (“GBG”) North American licensing business. Concurrent with the closing of the GBG Acquisition (as defined below), we changed our name to Centric Brands Inc., reflecting our position as a leading lifestyle brands collective platform.
 GBG Acquisition
 On October 29, 2018 (the “Closing Date”), we acquired from GBG and GBG USA Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of GBG (“GBG USA”), a significant part of GBG’s North American business, including the wholesale, retail and ecommerce operations, comprising all of their North American kids business, all of their North American accessories

business and a majority of their West Coast and Canadian fashion businesses (the “GBG Business”) for a purchase price of approximately $1.18 billion (the “GBG Acquisition”). The GBG Business licenses brands such as Calvin Klein, Under Armour, Tommy Hilfiger, BCBG, Joe’s, Buffalo David Bitton, Frye, Michael Kors, Kate Spade, All Saints and Cole Haan, and entertainment properties including Disney, Marvel and Nickelodeon, among others. For more information on the financing transactions in connection with the GBG Acquisition, see “Part II, Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations— Liquidity and Capital Resources” and “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.”
 SWIMS® Acquisition
 On July 18, 2016, we completed the acquisition of all of the outstanding share capital of Norwegian private limited company (aksjeselskap) SWIMS AS. We purchased SWIMS for aggregate consideration of (i) $12.0 million in cash, (ii) 702,943 shares of our common stock and (iii) warrants to purchase an aggregate of 150,000 shares of our common stock with an exercise price of $5.47 per share. 
 Robert Graham® Merger
 On January 28, 2016, we completed the acquisition of all of the outstanding equity interests of Robert Graham for an aggregate of $81.0 million in cash and 8,825,461 shares of our common stock (the “RG Merger”). Robert Graham is engaged in the design, development, sales and licensing of lifestyle apparel products and accessories that bear the brand name Robert Graham®.
 Effective upon consummation of the RG Merger, we effected a reverse stock split (the “Reverse Stock Split”) of our issued and outstanding common stock such that each 30 shares of our issued and outstanding common stock were reclassified into one share of our issued and outstanding common stock. The Reverse Stock Split did not change the par value or the amount of authorized shares of our common stock. The primary purpose of the Reverse Stock Split was to increase the per-share market price of our common stock in order to maintain our listing on The NASDAQ Capital Market maintained by The NASDAQ Stock Market LLC (“NASDAQ”). All share amounts in this Annual Report reflect the Reverse Stock Split. 
 Our Brands and Products
 Our products are focused on kids’ products, accessories products, and men’s and women’s apparel. Historically, our principal business activity was the design, development and worldwide marketing of apparel, footwear and lifestyle products bearing the Hudson®, Robert Graham® and SWIMS® (“Owned Brands”) labels as described further below.
 As a result of the GBG Acquisition, we now license, manage and operate a diversified portfolio of complementary consumer brands where we act as a licensee for certain trademarks owned by third parties and produce private label products for certain customers. We also acquired certain trademarks for other owned brands pursuant to the GBG Acquisition that we do not expect to be significant to our operating results. We strive to combine consumer insight with our design, marketing, and imaging skills to offer broad lifestyle collections with a unified vision. Due to the GBG Acquisition, we now benefit from a balanced mix of licensed brands anchored by the following licensed brands:

Reportable Segments
 Prior to the GBG Acquisition, we organized our business into the following three reportable segments: Wholesale, Consumer Direct and Corporate and other. Upon completing the GBG Acquisition, we resegmented our reportable segments to reflect our expanded organizational structure, including the operations of the newly acquired GBG Business. Accordingly, we realigned our business into the following three reportable segments: Kids, Accessories, and Men’s & Women’s Apparel. This new segment structure is consistent with how our chief operating decision maker establishes our overall business strategy, allocates resources, and assesses performance. All prior period segment information has been reclassified to reflect the realignment of our segment reporting structure. We will continually evaluate changes in the structure of the organization to determine whether our operating segments have changed when events or circumstances necessitate such an exercise. 
 The results of operations of the GBG Acquisition were only included in our results of operations for the year ended December 2018 for the period from October 29, 2018 through December 31, 2018. Therefore, our 2018 results of operations and associated metrics are not necessarily indicative of future results, which will include the impact of the GBG Acquisition for the full periods presented. For more information see “Part II, Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations”.
 Our Kids segment accounted for approximately 36.3% of our Fiscal 2018 net revenues and is comprised of over 350 brands sold to over 700 customers. Licensed brands in this category, include but are not limited to, Calvin Klein®, Lucky Brand®, Marvel®, Nautica®, Nickelodeon®, Spyder®, Tommy Hilfiger®, Under Amour® and Walt Disney®.

 Our Men’s & Women’s Apparel segment accounted for approximately 47.4% of our Fiscal 2018 net revenues, and is comprised of our Owned Brands and five licensed brands: BCBG, bebe, Herve Leger, Joe’s and Buffalo. We sell Men’s and Women’s apparel to over 1,000 customers in North America and throughout the world. As of December 31, 2018, the Company operated a total of 89 retail stores as discussed in “Part I, Item 2. Properties” of this Annual Report.
 Product Design, Development and Sourcing
 Our product development is managed internally by designers. The designers lead the respective design teams responsible for the creation, development and coordination of the product group offerings. We typically develop four collections per year for (i) spring, (ii) summer, (iii) fall/back to school, and (iv) winter/holiday with certain core basic styles offered throughout the year. The key designers are an instrumental part of our design process. The loss of any key designer would not change any rights we have to the designs or intellectual property. We believe that if any key designers terminate their employment with us, alternative sources are available for the development and design of the product, as applicable.
 Our products are primarily produced by, and purchased or procured from, third party manufacturing contractors, many of whom are located outside of the United States. For Fiscal 2018, substantially all of the products we purchased were attributable to manufacturing contractors located outside of the United States, with purchases primarily procured from manufacturing contractors located in countries such as China, Mexico, Cambodia, Vietnam and India among others. No single manufacturing contractor represented at least ten percent of our total purchases of our products for Fiscal 2018. We do not have a long-term supply agreement with any of our third-party manufacturers or contractors, and we believe that there are available resources of overseas and domestic contractors that could fulfill our requirements in the event that one of our existing manufacturers would not be able to do so. We procure production in order to ensure quality and timely deliveries. See “Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors—Risks Related to our Business and Industry—We are dependent on third parties to source and manufacture products and any disruption in relationships with these parties or in their businesses may materially adversely affect our business” and “—Problems with the third-party distribution system could harm our ability to meet customer expectations, manage inventory, complete sales and achieve targeted operating efficiencies.”
 We do not enter into any long term agreements with our suppliers, nor are we substantially dependent on any one of them. Currently, we utilize Li & Fung Group (“Li & Fung”) as a sourcing agent to source a portion of our products pursuant to the Transition Services Agreement. We expect to enter into a formal sourcing agreement with Li & Fung to source our products during 2019. We also explore sourcing strategies designed to improve our gross margins. However, there can be no assurance that any change in sourcing will result in enhanced profit margins, similar quality or timely deliveries, but we do believe that continuing to monitor this expense can be beneficial for growth. See “Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors—Risks Related to our Business and Industry—Increases in the price of raw materials or their reduced availability could increase our cost of goods and decrease our profitability” and “—We are dependent on third parties to source and manufacture products and any disruption in relationships with these parties or in their businesses may materially adversely affect our business.”
 In the event we terminate any of our relationships with third-party suppliers or the economic climate or other factors result in a significant reduction in the number of suppliers, our business could be negatively impacted. At this time, we believe that we would be able to find alternative sources for production if this were to occur; however, no assurances can be given that a transition would not involve a disruption to our business.
 We generally purchase our products in United States dollars. However, because we use overseas or non-United States suppliers, the cost of these products may be affected by changes in the value of the relevant currencies. Certain of our apparel purchases in the international markets will be subject to the risks associated with the importation of these types of products. See “—Import and Export Restrictions and Other Governmental Regulations” below.
 While we attempt to mitigate our exposure to manufacturing risks, the use of independent suppliers reduces our control over production and delivery and exposes us to customary risks associated with sourcing products from independent suppliers. Transactions with foreign manufacturers and suppliers are subject to the typical risks of doing business abroad, such as the cost of transportation and the imposition of import duties and restrictions. The countries in which our products are manufactured may, from time to time, impose new duties, tariffs or other restrictions, or adjust presently prevailing 

 
  11

 

duties or tariff levels, which could affect our operations and our ability to import products at current or increased levels. We cannot predict the likelihood or frequency of any such events occurring. See “Part I, Item 1. Business—Import and Export Restrictions and Other Governmental Regulations.” Furthermore, the inability of a manufacturer to ship orders of our products in a timely manner or to meet our quality standards could cause us to miss the delivery date requirements of our customers for those items, which could result in cancellation of orders, refusal to accept deliveries or a reduction in purchase prices. Due to the seasonality of our business, and the apparel and fashion business in particular, the dates on which customers require shipments of products from us are critical, as styles and consumer tastes change so rapidly. Because quality is a leading factor when customers and retailers accept or reject goods, any decline in quality by our third-party manufacturers could be detrimental, not only to a particular order, but also to our future relationship with that particular customer.
 Trademarks and License Agreements
 We own a variety of pending applications and registrations throughout the world for a variety of trademarks in addition to the common law rights associated therewith for our various Owned Brands as well as brands we acquired as a result of the GBG Acquisition. We regard our trademarks and other intellectual property rights as valuable assets of our business and important to the success of our brands in the marketplace. We vigorously protect our trademarks and other intellectual property rights against infringement.
 For the trademarks that we own, we selectively license some of our brands for certain product categories or for retail stores in foreign jurisdictions. Licensing broadens and enhances the products available under the brand name or their availability in other geographical areas. We receive royalty payments on net sales or purchases of products for sale at the retail stores without incurring significant capital investments or incremental operating expenses. There are certain minimum net sales that the licensees are required to meet, and the agreements generally have renewal rights. See “Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors—Our licensing arrangements may not be successful and may make us susceptible to the actions of third parties who may not comply with our product quality, manufacturing standards, marketing and other requirements, which may have an adverse effect on our brand equity, reputation or business and our trademark and other intellectual property rights may not be adequately protected and some of our products are targets of counterfeiting.”
 As a result of the GBG Acquisition, we also act as a licensee for certain trademarks owned by third parties and acquired for numerous license agreements and the sale of licensed product has become an increasingly critical element of our growth strategy. Under our license agreements, we are generally required to achieve minimum net sales of licensed products, pay guaranteed minimum royalties, make specified royalty and advertising payments (usually based on a percentage of net sales of licensed products), and receive prior approval of the licensor as to all design and other elements of a product prior to production. See “Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors—The failure to maintain our license agreements could cause us to lose significant revenues and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.”
 Our ability to renew the current term of a license agreement may be subject to the discretion of the licensor or to attaining minimum sales and/or royalty levels and to our compliance with the provisions of the agreement. Brand owners may be looking to consolidate the number of licensees they engage to develop product and to choose licensees who have a successful track record of developing brands, selling and resources. We continue to seek opportunities to enter into license agreements in order to expand our product offerings under well-known labels and broaden the markets that we serve.
 Sales and Distribution
 Wholesale
 Our wholesale operations include sales of products licensed by us from third parties, as well as sales of products under our Owned Brands and private label brands. Our products are sold through a cross section of leading retailers such as Walmart, Macy's, Target, Burlington, Kohl's, TJX Companies, Costco, Nordstrom, Dillard's, Ross, Target, JC Penney, and Amazon. We also sell our products over the web through retail partners such as Walmart.com, Macy's.com and Nordstrom.com.

 We generally sell our products through our own showrooms. At our showrooms, retailers review the latest collections offered and place orders. We also sell a limited number of products internationally through distributors in various countries that are managed by us or through licensed stores. We continue to evaluate our options and review relationships in the marketplace to create a strategy to grow international sales.
 Direct to Consumer
 We sell our Owned Brands to consumers through 19 Robert Graham® brand full-price retail stores and 12 outlet stores. We sell SWIMS® products through one full-price retail store and two outlet stores. We also sell our Owned Brand products through our online ecommerce sites at www.hudsonjeans.com, www.robertgraham.us and www.swims.com.
 In connection with the GBG Acquisition, we also assumed 41 leases operated under our BCBG name, 12 leases operated under the Joe’s Jeans name, one lease operated under the Herve Leger name, and one lease operated under the bebe name. Also in connection with the GBG Acquisition, we now own and operate the following online ecommerce sites: www.bcbg.com, www.herveleger.com, www.buffalojeans.com, www.joesjeans.com, and www.bebe.com. 
 In addition, we utilize partner shop-in-shops for certain of our brands to enhance brand recognition, to permit more complete merchandising of our lines by department stores, and to differentiate the presentation of our products.
 We have organized our retail store operations into geographic areas or districts that each have a district manager. District managers are responsible for several stores and monitor and supervise individual store managers. Each store manager is responsible for overseeing the daily operations of one of our stores. In addition to a store manager, the staff of a typical store includes a combination of some or all of the following positions: an assistant store manager and full and part-time sales associates.
 An essential requirement for the success of our stores is our ability to attract, train and retain talented, highly motivated area managers, store managers and other key employees. In addition to management training programs for both newly hired and existing employees, we have a number of retention programs that offer qualitative and quantitative performance-based incentives to district-level managers, store managers and full-time sales associates.
 Advertising, Marketing and Promotion
 Our products are sold primarily to department, specialty and mass merchant retail stores in the United States. We sell to thousands of customers, ranging from national and regional chains to small specialty stores. We also distribute our products through our retail stores, our brand websites, and our retail partners’ websites.
 For our Owned Brands and ecommerce websites that we operate, we utilize marketing tools through our websites, mobile applications, email campaigns, search engines, affiliates, influencers and various other social media. We refresh our marketing periodically to effect the most cutting edge changes in fashion and culture. We rely on these features, as well as the brand recognition criteria by our direct marketing activity, to draw customers to our distribution channels.
 We believe we have developed awareness of our other owned or licensed labels primarily through our reputation, consumer acceptance and the fashion press. We primarily rely on our reputation and relationships to generate business in the private label portion of our business. We believe we have developed a significant customer following and positive reputation in the industry as a result of, among other things, our standards of quality control, on-time delivery, competitive pricing and merchandising of our products.
 Brand name products sold by us pursuant to a license agreement are promoted by brand and product advertisements placed by the licensor. Our license agreements generally require us to pay the licensor a fee, based on percentage of net sales of licensed products, and to pay for a portion of these advertising costs. We may also be required to spend a specified percentage of net sales of a licensed product on advertising placed by us.

 Company Operations
 Distribution    We utilize the services of third-party logistics service providers across 16 facilities in California, Florida, New Jersey, and Canada, for approximately 2.4 million square feet of space in their respective facilities, which are used to distribute merchandise to our domestic customers. Operations at these facilities include direct to consumer and wholesale fulfillment services, including inventory warehousing, receiving, value added services and customer shipping.
 We lease approximately 69,000 square feet and approximately 26,000 square feet of space in two fulfillment and distribution facilities in New Jersey and Sweden, respectively. Operations at these facilities support distribution to domestic and international customers and includes direct to consumer and wholesale fulfillment services, including inventory warehousing, receiving, value added services and customer shipping.
 In connection with the GBG Acquisition, on October 29, 2018, we entered into a Transition Services Agreement with GBG USA (the “Transition Services Agreement”) providing us access to approximately 500,000 of additional square feet at GBG and third-party logistic facilities in California, Florida, and New Jersey. Operations at these facilities support distribution of the newly acquired GBG Business domestically and internationally and include direct to consumer and wholesale fulfillment services, inventory warehousing, receiving and customer shipping.
 Information Systems
 The Transition Services Agreement provides us with access and support on specific IT applications related to the operations of the GBG Business. This includes continued access and support on certain shared business applications, enterprise resource planning systems, product lifecycle management systems, workflow systems, procurement systems, time and expense reporting, retail reporting, vendor compliance, communications, data, data infrastructure, and network services. We are currently working on expanding our own IT infrastructure to integrate the GBG Business. The remainder of our business operates on our existing IT infrastructure. Customers
 Our products are sold to consumers through our own retail stores, partner shop-in-shops  and ecommerce websites, as well as major department stores, specialty stores, mass market retailers, other ecommerce websites primarily in the United States and Canada and select locations throughout the world. We do not enter into long term agreements with any of our customers. Instead, we receive individual purchase order commitments. A decision by the controlling owner of a group of stores or any other significant customer, including our private label customers, whether motivated by competitive conditions, financial difficulties or otherwise, to decrease the amount of merchandise purchased from us, to change their manner of doing business with us, to cancel orders previously placed in advance of shipment dates or a decision to cease carrying our products could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
 For Fiscal 2018, the ten largest customers and customer groups for our business, in the aggregate, accounted for approximately 47% of our net sales. During Fiscal 2018, only our largest customer represented over 10 percent of our net sales.
 We believe that should we lose a major customer, it could impact our overall net sales. See “Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors—A substantial portion of our net sales and gross profit is derived from a small number of large customers, and the loss of any of these large customers could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.”
 Order Book
 A portion of our orders consist of short-term purchase orders from customers who place orders on an as-needed basis. Information relative to open purchase orders at any date may also be materially affected by, among other things, the 

 
  14

 

timing of the initial showing of apparel to customers, as well as by the timing of recording of orders and shipments. As a result, we do not believe that disclosure of the amount of our unfilled customer orders at any time is meaningful.
 The amount of outstanding customer purchase orders at a particular time is influenced by numerous factors, including the product mix, timing of the receipt and processing of customer purchase orders, shipping schedules for the product and specific customer shipping windows. Due to these factors, a comparison of outstanding customer purchase orders from period to period is not necessarily meaningful and may not be indicative of actual shipments.
 Seasonality of Business and Working Capital
 Products are designed and marketed primarily for the following principal selling seasons: spring, summer, fall/back-to-school and winter/holiday. We have historically experienced, and expect to continue to experience, seasonal fluctuations in our net sales. A significant amount of our net sales are realized during the third and fourth fiscal quarters when we ship orders taken during earlier months for the back-to-school and holiday seasons. For Fiscal 2018, we funded our liquidity needs through cash generated from operations, cash available under our financing agreements and entry into the financing arrangements described in “Part II, Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources” below. In Fiscal 2019, we plan to continue to fund our liquidity needs through the same sources. If sales are materially different from seasonal norms, our annual operating results could be materially affected. Accordingly, our results for the individual quarters are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the entire year. See “Part II, Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources” for further discussion of our financing agreements and our liquidity position. Credit and Collection
 We currently extend credit to a majority of our larger customers, who purchase our products from us at wholesale prices. Our decision to extend credit is based on credit approval under our factoring arrangements, past credit history, and reputation of creditworthiness within our industry. The vast majority of our customers are guaranteed through credit insurance purchased through our factor securing the receivables sold to a financial institution. As such, we generally extend credit without requiring collateral. 
 A small percentage of our customers are required to pay by either credit card or cash before delivery or are secured by a letter of credit, which is also based on considerations such as lack of credit history, reputation within our industry and/or prior payment history. For those customers to whom we extend credit, terms generally range from upon goods receipt to net 60 days. Based on industry practices, financial awareness of the customers with whom we conduct business, and business experience of our industry, our management exercises professional judgment in determining which customers will be extended credit. We are exposed to some collection risk for receivables which were factored with recourse where our factor did not accept the credit risk. However, the aggregate amount of exposure is generally low and, therefore, we believe that the credit risk associated with our extension of credit is minimal. We partner with our factor to ensure timely collections for all open accounts receivables. Retail and ecommerce sales carry no material credit risk as payment is tendered at or before product is taken or delivered by/to the customer.
 Competition
 The industries in which we operate are fragmented and highly competitive in the United States and on a worldwide basis. We compete for consumers with a large number of apparel companies. We do not hold a dominant competitive position, and our ability to sell our products is dependent upon the anticipated popularity of our designs and brand names, the price and quality of our products and our ability to meet our customers’ delivery schedules. We believe the design, merchandising, assortment, cost, quality and uniqueness of our designs differentiates us from our competitors, and we believe that we are competitive with companies producing goods of like quality and pricing. We believe that we can maintain our competitive position through new product development, creating product identity and brand awareness and competitive pricing. Many of our competitors may possess greater financial, technical and other resources, and the intense competition and the rapid changes in consumer preferences constitute significant risk factors in our operations. As we 

 
  15

 

expand globally, we will continue to encounter additional sources of competition. See “Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors—We face intense competition in the denim, footwear and premium lifestyle apparel industries, and if we are unable to compete effectively, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be negatively impacted.”
 Manufacturing and Distribution Relationships
 We contract for the manufacture of our products and do not own or operate any production facilities. Approximately 350 different manufacturers worldwide produce our products, with no one manufacturer providing more than 10% of our total production during Fiscal 2018. We source both finished products and raw materials. Raw materials include fabric and trim. Finished products consist of products ready for shipment to our customers when purchased by us. In Fiscal 2018, over 95% of our products (by dollar value) were produced outside of the United States, primarily in China, Mexico, Cambodia, Vietnam, and India. 
 Most of our businesses must commit to the manufacturing of our products before we sell finished goods, whether to consumer direct channels or to wholesale customers. If we overestimate our primary customers' demand for a particular product, we primarily sell the excess products or garments at a discounted price in our factory stores or through other secondary distribution channels.
 All products are produced according to our and our licensors’ or brands’ specifications and standards. Production and quality assurance staff monitor manufacturing at supplier facilities in order to correct problems prior to shipment of the final product. Procedures have been implemented under our vendor certification and compliance programs so that quality assurance is reviewed during the production process, allowing merchandise to be received at the distribution facilities and shipped to customers with minimal interruption.
 Import and Export Restrictions and Other Governmental Regulations
 Transactions with our foreign manufacturers and suppliers are subject to the general risks of doing business abroad. Imports into the United States are affected by, among other things, the cost of transportation and the imposition of import duties and restrictions. The countries in which our products might be manufactured may, from time to time, impose, duties, tariffs or other restrictions, or adjust present, duties or tariff levels, which could adversely affect our operations and our ability to import products at current or increased levels. We cannot predict the likelihood or frequency of any such events occurring. The United States government recently imposed tariffs on certain imports, and it is unclear what effects such tariffs (including any retaliatory tariffs imposed by other countries on United States exports) will have on retail markets. The enactment of any additional duties or restrictions could result in material increases in the cost of our products generally and may adversely affect our sales and profitability.
 Our import operations are subject to international trade agreements and regulations such as the North American Free Trade Agreement (“NAFTA”) and other bilateral textile agreements between the United States and a number of foreign countries, including China, Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Italy, Jordan, Korea, Morocco, Peru, Philippines, Portugal, Taiwan, Turkey and Vietnam. Some of these agreements impose restrictions on the amount and type of goods that can be imported into the United States from these countries. Such agreements also allow the United States to impose, at any time, restraints on the importation of categories of merchandise that, under the terms of the agreements, are not subject to specified limits. Some of our imported products are also subject to United States customs duties and, in the ordinary course of business, we are from time to time subject to claims by the United States Customs Service for duties and other charges. In addition, exports of our products to certain countries are subject to certain duties, tariffs or other restrictions that could result in increases in the cost of our products generally and might adversely affect our sales and profitability. For more information, see “Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors—Risks Related to our Business and Industry—Potential changes in international trade relations between the United States and countries in which our products are sourced could have a material adverse effect on our business, cash flows and operating results” and “—We are dependent on third parties to source and manufacture products and any disruption in relationships with these parties or in their businesses may materially adversely affect our business.”
