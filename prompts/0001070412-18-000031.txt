ITEM 1. | Business

General
CNX Resources Corporation, (CNX or the Company) is one of the largest independent oil and natural gas companies in the United States and is focused on the exploration, development, production, gathering, processing and acquisition of natural gas properties in the Appalachian Basin. Our operations are centered on unconventional shale formations, primarily the Marcellus Shale and Utica Shale.
CNX was incorporated in Delaware in 1991 under the name CONSOL Energy Inc. (CONSOL Energy), but its predecessors had been mining coal, primarily in the Appalachian Basin, since 1864. CNX entered the natural gas business in the 1980s initially to increase the safety and efficiency of its Virginia coal mines by capturing methane from coal seams prior to mining, which makes the mining process safer and more efficient. The natural gas business grew from the coalbed methane production in Virginia into other unconventional production, including hydraulic fracturing in the Marcellus Shale and Utica Shale in the Appalachian Basin. This growth was accelerated with the 2010 asset acquisition of the Appalachian Exploration & Production business of Dominion Resources, Inc.
On November 28, 2017, CNX completed the tax-free spin-off of its coal business resulting in two independent, publicly traded companies: CONSOL Energy, a coal company, formerly known as CONSOL Mining Corporation; and CNX, a natural gas exploration and production company. As a result of the separation of the two companies, CONSOL Energy and its subsidiaries now hold the coal assets previously held by CNX, including its Pennsylvania Mining Complex, Baltimore Marine Terminal, its direct and indirect ownership interest in CONSOL Coal Resources LP, formerly known as CNXC Coal Resources LP, and other related coal assets previously held by CNX. To effect the separation, CNX's shareholders received one share of CONSOL Energy common stock for every eight shares of CNX's common stock held as of the close of business on November 15, 2017, the record date for the separation and distribution. The coal company, previously reported as the Company's Pennsylvania Mining Operations division, has been reclassified in the Audited Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K (the Form 10-K) to discontinued operations for all periods presented.
CNX operates, develops and explores for natural gas primarily in Appalachia (Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Ohio, and Virginia). Our primary focus is the continued development of our Marcellus Shale acreage and delineation and development of our unique Utica Shale acreage and stacked pay opportunity set. We believe that our concentrated operating area, our legacy surface acreage position, our regional operating expertise, our extensive data set from development, as well as from non-operated participation wells and our held-by-production acreage position provides us a significant operating advantage over our competitors. Over the past ten years, CNX's natural gas business has grown by approximately 625% to produce a total of 407.2 net Bcfe in 2017. 
 Our land holdings in the Marcellus Shale and Utica Shale plays cover large areas, provide multi-year drilling opportunities and, collectively, have sustainable lower risk growth profiles. We currently control approximately 530,000 net acres in the Marcellus Shale and approximately 652,000 net acres that have Utica Shale potential in Ohio, West Virginia, and Pennsylvania. We also have approximately 2.2 million net acres in our coalbed methane play.
Highlights of our 2017 production include the following:

• | Total average production of 1,115,523 Mcfe per day;


• | 90% Natural Gas, 10% Liquids; and


• | 59% Marcellus, 20% Utica, 16% coalbed methane, and 5% other.

 At December 31, 2017, our proved natural gas, NGL, condensate and oil reserves (collectively, "natural gas reserves") had the following characteristics:

• | 7.6 Tcfe of proved reserves;


• | 93.9% natural gas;


• | 58.2% proved developed;


• | 95.5% operated; and


• | A reserve life ratio of 18.62 years (based on 2017 production).

The following map provides the location of CNX's E&P operations by region: 
CNX defines itself through its core values which serve as the compass for our road map and guide every aspect of our business as we strive to achieve our corporate mission:

• | Responsibility: Be a safe and compliant operator; be a trusted community partner and respected corporate citizen; act with pride and integrity;


• | Ownership: Be accountable for our actions and learn from our outcomes, both positive and negative; be calculated risk-takers and seek creative ways to solve problems; and


• | Excellence: Be prudent capital allocators; be a lean, efficient, nimble organization; be a disciplined, reliable, performance-driven company.

These values are the foundation of CNX's identity and are the basis for how management defines continued success. We believe CNX's rich resource base, coupled with these core values, allows management to create value for the long-term. The electric power industry generates approximately two-thirds of its output by burning fossil fuels. Because of this we believe that the use of natural gas will continue for many years as one of the principal fuel sources for electricity in the United States. Additionally, we believe that as worldwide economies grow, the demand for electricity from fossil fuels will grow as well, which could result in the expansion of worldwide demand for our natural gas. Natural gas is also the dominant choice for primary heating fuel in the domestic residential sector. CNG (compressed natural gas)-powered vehicles are already in use in many major cities, saving money on fuel and reducing emission levels, while the demand for CNG is expected to grow further through additional fleet conversion to this cleaner-burning fuel. Finally, plentiful natural gas feedstock is creating emerging opportunities for chemicals and plastics manufacturing (in addition to the other uses previously noted) in the United States and abroad as the United States becomes a net exporter of the fuel. 
CNX's Strategy
CNX's strategy is to increase shareholder value through the development and growth of its existing natural gas assets and selective acquisition of natural gas and natural gas liquid acreage leases within its footprint. Our mission is to empower our team to embrace and drive innovative change that creates long-term value for our shareholders, while enhancing our communities and 
7

delivering energy solutions for today and tomorrow. We also will continue to focus on monetization of non-core assets to accelerate value creation and to minimize the shortfall between operating cash flows and our growth capital requirements.
We expect natural gas to become a more significant contributor to the domestic electric generation mix, while fueling industrial growth in the U.S. economy. With the recent growth of natural gas exports to Mexico and Canada and the United States becoming a net exporter of natural gas in 2016, we expect new markets to open up in the coming years. We feel that our significant increases in natural gas production, our reductions in drilling and operating costs and our vast acreage position will allow CNX to take advantage of these markets.
CNX's Capital Expenditure Budget
In 2018, CNX expects capital expenditures of approximately $790-$880 million. The 2018 budget includes $515-$580 million of drilling and completion ("D&C") capital and approximately $275-$300 million of capital associated with land, midstream, and water infrastructure. The 2018 D&C capital budget is allocated approximately 65% to the Marcellus Shale and 35% to the Utica Shale.  
DETAIL OPERATIONS 
Our operations are located throughout Appalachia and include the following plays:
Marcellus Shale 
We have the rights to extract natural gas in Pennsylvania, West Virginia, and Ohio from approximately 530,000 net Marcellus Shale acres at December 31, 2017. 
The Upper Devonian Shale formation, which includes both the Burkett Shale and Rhinestreet Shale, lies above the Marcellus Shale formation in southwestern Pennsylvania and northern West Virginia. The Company holds a large number of acres that have Upper Devonian potential; however, these acres have not been disclosed separately as they generally coincide with our Marcellus acreage.
In December 2016, CNX terminated the 50-50 Joint Venture that was formed in 2011, with Noble Energy, Inc., for the exploration, development, and operation of primarily Marcellus Shale properties in Pennsylvania and West Virginia. As a result of the termination, each party now owns and operates a 100% interest in its properties and wells in two separate operating areas; and each party will now have independent control and flexibility with respect to the scope and timing of future development over its operating area. In June 2017, Noble Energy announced that it has closed on a transaction divesting its upstream assets in northern West Virginia and southern Pennsylvania to HG Energy II Appalachia, LLC, a portfolio company of Quantum Energy Partners.
On January 3, 2018, the Company acquired the remaining 50% membership interest in CONE Gathering LLC (which has since been renamed CNX Gathering LLC), which holds the general partner interest and incentive distribution rights in CNXM, the entity that constructs and operates the gathering system for most of our Marcellus shale production. See "Midstream Gas Services" for a more detailed explanation.
Utica Shale
We have the rights to extract natural gas in Pennsylvania, West Virginia, and Ohio from approximately 652,000 net Utica Shale acres at December 31, 2017. Approximately 341,000 Utica acres coincide with Marcellus Shale acreage in Pennsylvania, West Virginia, and Ohio.
 Coalbed Methane (CBM)
We have the rights to extract CBM in Virginia from approximately 267,000 net CBM acres in Central Appalachia. We produce CBM natural gas primarily from the Pocahontas #3 seam.
We also have the rights to extract CBM in West Virginia, southwestern Pennsylvania, and Ohio from approximately 906,000 net CBM acres. In central Pennsylvania we have the right to extract CBM from approximately 260,000 net CBM acres. In addition, we control approximately 584,000 net CBM acres in Illinois, Kentucky, Indiana, and Tennessee. We also have the right to extract CBM on approximately139,000 net acres in the San Juan Basin in New Mexico. We have no current plans to drill CBM wells in these areas in 2018.
8

Other Gas 
We have the rights to extract natural gas from other shale and shallow oil and gas positions primarily in Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and West Virginia from approximately 1,360,000 net acres at December 31, 2017. The majority of our shallow oil and gas leasehold position is held by production and all of it is extensively overlain by existing third-party gas gathering and transmission infrastructure.

_________

(1) | Net acres include acreage attributable to our working interests in the properties. Additional adjustments (either increases or decreases) may be required as we further develop title to and further confirm our rights with respect to our various properties in anticipation of development. We believe that our assumptions and methodology in this regard are reasonable.


(2) | Acreage amounts are only included under the target strata CNX expects to produce with the exception of certain CBM acres governed by separate leases, although the reported acres may include rights to multiple gas seams (e.g. we have rights to Marcellus segment that are disclosed under the Utica segment and we have rights to Utica segment that are disclosed under the Marcellus segment). We have reviewed our drilling plans, our acreage rights and used our best judgment to reflect the acres in the strata we expect to primarily produce. As more information is obtained or circumstances change, the acreage classification may change.

Producing Wells and Acreage 
Most of our development wells and proved acreage are located in Virginia, West Virginia, Ohio and Pennsylvania. Some leases are beyond their primary term, but these leases are extended in accordance with their terms as long as certain drilling commitments or other term commitments are satisfied. 
The following table sets forth, at December 31, 2017, the number of producing wells, developed acreage and undeveloped acreage: 

 | Gross | Net(1)
Producing Gas Wells (including gob wells) | 17,013 | | 12,853 
Producing Oil Wells | 171 | | 12 
Net Acreage Position: | | 
Proved Developed Acreage | 551,900 | | 543,937 
Proved Undeveloped Acreage | 41,066 | | 40,703 
Unproved Acreage | 4,434,714 | | 3,817,015
Total Acreage | 5,027,680 | | 4,401,655

The following table represents the terms under which we hold these acres:    

 | Gross Unproved Acres | Net Unproved Acres | | Net Proved Undeveloped Acres
Held by production/fee | 4,278,446 | | 3,736,526 | | 25,688
Expiration within 2 years | 94,486 | | 43,118 | | 8,447 
Expiration beyond 2 years | 61,782 | | 37,371 | | 6,568 
Total Acreage | 4,434,714 | | 3,817,015 | | 40,703

The leases reflected above as Gross and Net Unproved Acres with expiration dates are included in our current drill plan or active land program. Leases with expiration dates within two years represent approximately 1% of our total net unproved acres and leases with expiration dates beyond two years represent approximately 1% of our total net unproved acres. In each case, we deemed this acreage to not be material to our overall acreage position. Additionally, based on our current drill plans and lease management we do not anticipate any material impact to our consolidated financial statements from the expiration of such leases.
Development Wells (Net) 
During the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, we drilled 90.0, 36.0 and 132.8 net development wells, respectively. Gob wells and wells drilled by operators other than our primary joint venture partners at that time are excluded from net development wells. In 2017, there were 3.9 net development wells and 1.8 exploratory wells drilled but uncompleted. There were no dry development wells in 2017, 2016, or 2015. As of December 31, 2017, there are 13.0 gross completed developmental wells ready to be turned in-line. The following table illustrates the net wells drilled by well classification type:

Reserves 
The following table shows our estimated proved developed and proved undeveloped reserves. Reserve information is net of royalty interest. Proved developed and proved undeveloped reserves are reserves that could be commercially recovered under current economic conditions, operating methods and government regulations. Proved developed and proved undeveloped reserves are defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

Discounted Future Net Cash Flows 
The following table shows our estimated future net cash flows and total standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows at 10%: 

 | Discounted Future

Total PV-10 measure of pre-tax discounted future net cash flows (1) | $ | 4,140 | | $ | 1,559 | $ | 1,659
Total standardized measure of after tax discounted future net cash flows | $ | 3,131 | | $ | 955 | $ | 1,019

____________

(1) | We calculate our present value at 10% (PV-10) in accordance with the following table. Management believes that the presentation of the non-Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) financial measure of PV-10 provides useful information to investors because it is widely used by professional analysts and sophisticated investors in evaluating oil and gas companies. Because many factors that are unique to each individual company impact the amount of future income taxes estimated to be paid, the use of a pre-tax measure is valuable when comparing companies based on reserves. PV-10 is not a measure of the financial or operating performance under GAAP. PV-10 should not be considered as an alternative to the standardized measure as defined under GAAP. We have included a reconciliation of the most directly comparable GAAP measure-after-tax discounted future net cash flows.

Average Sales Price and Average Lifting Cost 
The following table sets forth the total average sales price and the total average lifting cost for all of our natural gas and NGL production for the periods indicated. Total lifting cost is the cost of raising gas to the gathering system and does not include depreciation, depletion or amortization. See Part II Item 7 Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in this Form 10-K for a breakdown by segment. 

 | For the Year 
 | Ended December 31,
 | 2017 | | 2016 | 2015
Average Sales Price - Gas (Mcf) | $ | 2.59 | | $ | 1.92 | $ | 2.17 
(Loss) Gain on Commodity Derivative Instruments - Cash Settlement- Gas (Mcf) | $ | (0.11 | ) | $ | 0.70 | $ | 0.68 
Average Sales Price - NGLs (Mcfe)* | $ | 4.03 | | $ | 2.42 | $ | 2.05 
Average Sales Price - Oil (Mcfe)* | $ | 7.56 | | $ | 6.15 | $ | 7.99 
Average Sales Price - Condensate (Mcfe)* | $ | 6.59 | | $ | 4.58 | $ | 4.42 
Total Average Sales Price (per Mcfe) Including Effect of Derivative Instruments | $ | 2.66 | | $ | 2.63 | $ | 2.81 
Total Average Sales Price (per Mcfe) Excluding Effect of Derivative Instruments | $ | 2.76 | | $ | 2.01 | $ | 2.22 
Average Lifting Costs Excluding Ad Valorem and Severance Taxes (per Mcfe) | $ | 0.22 | | $ | 0.24 | $ | 0.37 
Average Sales Price - NGLs (Bbl) | $ | 24.18 | | $ | 14.52 | $ | 12.30
Average Sales Price - Oil (Bbl) | $ | 45.36 | | $ | 36.90 | $ | 47.94
Average Sales Price - Condensate (Bbl) | $ | 39.54 | | $ | 27.48 | $ | 26.52

*Oil, NGLs, and Condensate are converted to Mcfe at the rate of one barrel equals six Mcf based upon the approximate relative energy content of oil and natural gas.
Sales of NGLs, condensates and oil enhance our reported natural gas equivalent sales price. Across all volumes, when excluding the impact of hedging, sales of liquids added $0.17 per Mcfe, $0.09 per Mcfe, and $0.05 per Mcfe for 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively, to average gas sales prices. CNX expects to continue to realize a liquids uplift benefit as additional wells are brought online in the liquid-rich areas of the Marcellus shale. We continue to sell the majority of our NGLs through the large midstream companies that process our natural gas. This approach allows us to take advantage of the processors’ transportation efficiencies and diversified markets. Certain of CNX’s processing contracts provide for the ability to take our NGLs “in-kind” and market them directly if desired. The processed purity products are ultimately sold to industrial, commercial, and petrochemical markets. 
We enter into physical natural gas sales transactions with various counterparties for terms varying in length. Reserves and production estimates are believed to be sufficient to satisfy these obligations. In the past, we have delivered quantities required under these contracts. We also enter into various natural gas swap transactions. These gas swap transactions exist parallel to the underlying physical transactions and represented approximately 312.2 Bcf of our produced gas sales volumes for the year ended December 31, 2017 at an average price of $2.60 per Mcf. The notional volumes associated with these gas swaps represented approximately 264.9 Bcf of our produced gas sales volumes for the year ended December 31, 2016 at an average price of $3.04 per Mcf. As of January 15, 2018, we expect these transactions will represent approximately 388.6 Bcf of our estimated 2018 production at an average price of $2.77 per Mcf, 273.0 Bcf of our estimated 2019 production at an average price of $2.74 per Mcf, 198.3 Bcf of our estimated 2020 production at an average price of $2.78 per Mcf, approximately 166.5 Bcf of our estimated 2021 production at an average price of $2.62 per Mcf, and approximately 153.4 Bcf of our estimated 2022 production at an average price of $2.83 per Mcf.

The hedging strategy and information regarding derivative instruments used are outlined in Part II, Item 7A Qualitative and Quantitative Disclosures About Market Risk and in Note 17 - Derivative Instruments in the Notes to the Audited Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.

Midstream Gas Services 
CNX has traditionally designed, built and operated natural gas gathering systems to move gas from the wellhead to interstate pipelines or other local sales points. In addition, CNX has acquired extensive gathering assets. CNX now owns or operates approximately 5,000 miles of natural gas gathering pipelines as well as 250,000 horsepower of compression, of which, approximately 75% is wholly owned with the balance being leased. Along with this compression capacity, CNX owns and operates a number of natural gas processing facilities. This infrastructure is capable of delivering approximately 750 billion cubic feet per year of pipeline quality gas.
On January 3, 2018, CNX closed its previously announced acquisition of Noble Energy’s (Noble) 50% membership interest in CONE Gathering LLC (CONE or CONE Gathering), which holds the general partner interest and incentive distribution rights in CONE Midstream Partners LP. In conjunction with the closing, CONE Midstream Partners LP was renamed CNX Midstream Partners LP (CNX Midstream or CNXM) and CONE Gathering LLC was renamed CNX Gathering LLC (CNX Gathering) (See Note 21 - Subsequent Event in the Notes to the Audited Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for more information). Also on January 3, 2018, the Company’s board of directors authorized CNX Midstream to enter into an amendment to its gas gathering agreement with CNX Gas Company LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of CNX.
CNX Gathering develops, operates and owns substantially all of CNX’s Marcellus Shale gathering systems. Prior to its acquisition of Noble’s interest, CNX operated this equity affiliate. Subsequent to the acquisition, CNX is the single sponsor of CNXM, and beginning in the first quarter of 2018 CNX Gathering will be fully consolidated into the Company’s financial statements. We believe that the network of right-of-ways, vast surface holdings, experience in building and operating gathering systems in the Appalachian basin, and increased control and flexibility will give CNX Gathering an advantage in building the midstream assets required to execute our Marcellus Shale development plan.
In the Utica Shale, we and our joint venture partner, Hess, primarily contract with third-parties for gathering services. 
CNX has developed a diversified portfolio of firm transportation capacity options to support its production growth plan. CNX plans to selectively acquire firm capacity on an as-needed basis, while minimizing transportation costs and long-term financial obligations. In the near term, if appropriate, CNX also plans to optimize and/or release firm transportation to others. CNX also benefits from the strategic location of our primary production areas in southwestern Pennsylvania, northern West Virginia, and eastern Ohio. These areas are currently served by a large concentration of major pipelines that provide us with the capacity to move our production to the major gas markets, and it is expected that recently-approved and pending pipeline projects will increase the take-away capacity from our region. In addition to firm transportation capacity, CNX has developed a processing portfolio to support the projected volumes from its wet production areas and has operational and contractual flexibility to potentially convert a portion of currently processed wet gas volumes to be marketed as dry gas volumes.
CNX has the advantage of having gas production from CBM, which can be lower Btu than pipeline specification, as well as higher Btu Marcellus and Utica shale production. These types of gas can be complementary by reducing and in some cases eliminating the need for the costly processing of CBM. In addition, our lower Btu CBM and dry Marcellus and Utica production offer an opportunity to blend ethane back into the gas stream when pricing or capacity in ethane markets dictate. In developing a diversified approach to managing ethane, CNX has entered into ethane supply agreements and regularly assesses future outlet opportunities with ethane customers and midstream companies. These different gas types allow us more flexibility in bringing Marcellus and Utica shale wells on-line at qualities that meet interstate pipeline specifications. 
Natural Gas Competition
The United States natural gas industry is highly competitive. CNX competes with other large producers, as well as a myriad of smaller producers and marketers. CNX also competes for pipeline and other services to deliver its products to customers. According to data from the Natural Gas Supply Association and the Energy Information Agency (EIA), the five largest U.S. producers of natural gas produced about 14% of dry natural gas production during the first nine months of 2017. The EIA reported 552,506 producing natural gas wells in the United States at December 31, 2016 (the latest year for which government statistics are available), which is approximately four percent lower than 2015.
CNX expects natural gas to be a significant contributor to the domestic electric generation mix in the long-term, as well as to fuel industrial growth in the U.S. economy. According to the EIA, based on preliminary results, natural gas represented 32% of U.S. electricity generation during 2017 compared with 34% in 2016. With the recent growth of natural gas exports to Mexico, increased liquefied natural gas exports, and declining pipeline imports from Canada, the U.S. became a net exporter of gas in 2016 and is projected by the EIA to be a net exporter of gas for 2017 and 2018. CNX also expects the high level of U.S. gas exports to continue in the future. In addition, there is potential for natural gas to become a significant contributor to the transportation market. 
14

The EIA expects overall demand for U.S. natural gas to be 4.3% higher in 2018 compared with 2017. Our increasing gas production will allow CNX to participate in these growing markets.
CNX gas operations are primarily located in the eastern United States. The gas market is highly fragmented and not dominated by any single producer. We believe that competition within our market is based primarily on natural gas commodity trading fundamentals and pipeline transportation availability to the various markets.
Continued demand for CNX's natural gas and the prices that CNX obtains are affected by natural gas use in the production of electricity, pipeline capacity, U.S. manufacturing and the overall strength of the economy, environmental and government regulation, technological developments, the availability and price of competing alternative fuel supplies, and national and regional supply/demand dynamics.
Other Operations
CNX provides other services, including both land and water services, to both our own operations and to others. 
Non-Core Mineral Assets and Surface Properties
CNX owns significant natural gas assets that are not in our short or medium term development plans. We continually explore the monetization of these non-core assets by means of sale, lease, contribution to joint ventures, or a combination of the foregoing in order to bring the value of these assets forward for the benefit of our shareholders. We also control a significant amount of surface acreage. This surface acreage is valuable to us in the development of the gathering system for our Marcellus Shale and Utica Shale production. We also derive value from this surface control by granting rights of way or development rights to third-parties when we are able to derive appropriate value for our shareholders.
Water Division
CNX Water Assets LLC, doing business as CONVEY Water Systems LLC, is a wholly-owned subsidiary of CNX and supplies turnkey solutions for water sourcing, delivery and disposal for our natural gas operations, and supplies solutions for water sourcing as well as delivery and disposal for third-parties. In coordination with our midstream operations, CONVEY Water Systems works to develop solutions that coincide with our midstream operations to offer gas gathering and water delivery solutions in one package to third-parties. 
Employee and Labor Relations 
At December 31, 2017, CNX had 561 employees, none of which are subject to a collective bargaining agreement. 
Industry Segments 
Financial information concerning industry segments, as defined by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 is included in Note 19 - Segment Information in the Notes to the Audited Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K and incorporated herein.

Laws and Regulations
Overview
Our natural gas operations are subject to various types of federal, state and local laws and regulations. Regulations relating to our operations include permitting, bonding and other licensing requirements; water withdrawal and procurement for well stimulation purposes; well drilling, casing and hydraulic fracturing; stormwater management; well production; well plugging; venting or flaring of natural gas; pipeline compression and transmission of natural gas and liquids; reclamation and restoration of properties after natural gas operations are completed; handling, storage, transportation and disposal of materials used or generated by natural gas operations; the calculation, reporting and disbursement of taxes; gathering of natural gas production in certain circumstances; air quality standards; protection of wetlands; crossing of waterways; endangered plant and wildlife protection; use of public roads; and employee health and safety. Numerous governmental permits, authorizations and approvals under these laws and regulations are required for natural gas operations. Lastly, the electric power generation industry is subject to extensive regulation regarding the environmental impact of its power generation activities, which could affect demand for our natural gas.
We endeavor to conduct our natural gas operations in compliance with all applicable federal, state and local laws and regulations. However, because of extensive and comprehensive regulatory requirements against a backdrop of variable geologic and seasonal conditions, permit exceedances and violations during natural gas operations can and do occur. The possibility exists that new legislation or regulations may be adopted which would have a significant impact on our natural gas operations or our customers' ability to use our natural gas and may require us or our customers to change their operations significantly or incur substantial costs.
In July 2010, U.S. Congress enacted the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Dodd-Frank Act), which established federal oversight and regulation of the over-the-counter derivative market and entities, such as the Company, that participate in that market. The Dodd-Frank Act requires the Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), the SEC and other regulatory agencies to promulgate rules and regulations implementing this legislation. As of the filing date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the CFTC has finalized certain regulations that impose regulatory obligations on all market participants, including the Company, while other regulations remain to be finalized or implemented. Because certain CFTC rules relevant to natural gas hedging activities have yet to be promulgated, it is not possible at this time to predict the extent of the impact of the regulations on the Company’s hedging program or regulatory compliance obligations. The Company has experienced, and expects to continue to experience, increased compliance costs in connection with changes to current market practices as participants continue to adapt to a changing regulatory environment.
Environmental Laws
CNX has established protocols for ongoing assessments to identify potential environmental exposures. These assessments evaluate compliance with laws and regulations and other industry and internal best management practices, and include evaluation of compliance by waste management facilities and other third-party service providers.
Clean Air Act and Related Regulations. The federal Clean Air Act (CAA) and corresponding state laws and regulations regulate air emissions primarily through permitting and/or emissions control requirements. This affects natural gas production and processing operations. The federal CAA and corresponding state laws and regulations regulate air emissions primarily through permitting and/or emissions control requirements. This affects natural gas production and processing operations. Various activities in our operations are subject to regulation, including pipeline compression, venting and flaring of natural gas, hydraulic fracturing and completion processes, and fugitive emissions. We obtain permits, typically from state or local authorities, to conduct these activities. Additionally, we are required to obtain pre-approval for construction or modification of certain facilities, to meet stringent air permit requirements, or to use specific equipment, technologies or best management practices to control emissions. Further, some states and the federal government have proposed that emissions from certain sources should be aggregated to provide for regulation and permitting of a single, major source. Federal and state governmental agencies continue to investigate the potential for emissions from oil and natural gas activities, and further regulation could increase our cost or restrict our ability to produce.
We are required to obtain pre-approval for construction or modification of certain facilities, to meet stringent air permit requirements, or to use specific equipment, technologies or best management practices to control emissions. On August 16, 2012, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) published final revisions to the New Source Performance Standards (NSPS) to regulate emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and sulfur dioxide (SO2) from various oil and gas exploration, production, processing and transportation facilities. Additionally, revisions were made to the National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAPS) to further regulate emissions from the oil and natural gas production sector and the transmission and storage of natural gas. Section 111 of the CAA authorized the EPA to develop technology based standards which apply to specific 
16

categories of stationary sources. On June 3, 2016, the EPA finalized updates to the final New Source Performance Standards (NSPS) that created new standards for the regulation of methane and VOC emission sources. The rule includes requirements for new fugitive emission and leak detection testing and reporting requirements. Also on June 3, 2016, the EPA published the final Source Determination Rule which clarified the use of the term “adjacent” in determining Title V air permitting requirements as they apply to the oil and natural gas industry for major sources of air emissions. On August 1, 2016 these updates to the NSPS were challenged in the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals by industry and state associations and a request for administrative reconsideration was also filed. Additionally, 15 states filed suit and asked the Court of Appeals to review the need for the changes.
The CAA requires the EPA to set National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for certain pollutants and the CAA identifies two types of NAAQS. Primary standards provide public health protection, including protecting the health of "sensitive" populations such as asthmatics, children, and the elderly. Secondary standards provide public welfare protection, including protection against decreased visibility and damage to animals, crops, vegetation, and buildings. On October 1, 2015, the EPA finalized the NAAQS for ozone pollution and reduced the limit to 70 parts per billion (ppb) from the previous 75 ppb standard. The final rule could have a large impact on the oil and gas industry as states would be required to update their permitting standards to meet these potentially unachievable limits. Six states have now filed a petition for review in the Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit.
On July 6, 2011, the EPA finalized a rule known as the Cross-State Air Pollution Rule (CSAPR). CSAPR regulates cross-border emissions of criteria air pollutants such as SO2 and NOX, as well as byproducts, fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and ozone by requiring states to limit emissions from sources that "contribute significantly" to noncompliance with air quality standards for the criteria air pollutants. If the ambient levels of criteria air pollutants are above the thresholds set by the EPA, a region is considered to be in "nonattainment" for that pollutant and the EPA applies more stringent control standards for sources of air emissions located in the region. In April 2014, the Supreme Court reversed a decision of the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals that vacated the rule. Following remand and briefing the D.C. Circuit Court of appeals, in October 2014, granted a motion to lift a stay of the rule and allow the EPA to modify the CSAPR compliance deadline by three-years, setting the stage for issuance of the proposed rule. Implementation of CSAPR Phase 1 began in 2015, with Phase 2 scheduled to begin in 2017. On September 7, 2016, the EPA finalized an update to the CSAPR for the 2008 ozone NAAQS by issuing the final CSAPR Update. Starting in May 2017, this rule will reduce summertime (May - September) NOX emissions from power plants in 22 states in the eastern United States.
On January 8, 2014, the EPA re-proposed NSPS for CO2 for new fossil fuel fired power plants and rescinded the rules that were proposed on April 12, 2012. On September 20, 2013, the EPA issued a new proposal to control carbon emissions from new power plants. Under the Clean Power Plan (CPP) proposal, the EPA would establish separate NSPS for CO2 emissions for natural gas-fired turbines and coal-fired units. However, in April 2017, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit granted the EPA’s motion to hold a pending appeal in abeyance while the EPA undertakes a review of the proposal. The proposed “Carbon Pollution Standard for New Power Plants” replaces the earlier proposal released by the EPA in 2012. On August 3, 2015, the EPA finalized the Carbon Pollution Standards to cut carbon emissions from new, modified and reconstructed power plants, which would have become effective on October 23, 2015.
Climate Change. Climate change continues to be a legislative and regulatory focus. There are a number of proposed and final laws and regulations that limit greenhouse gas emissions, and regulations that restrict emissions could increase our costs should the requirements necessitate the installation new equipment or the purchase of emission allowances. Additional regulation could also lead to permitting delays and additional monitoring and administrative requirements, as well as to impacts on electricity generating operations.
On November 30, 2016, the EPA finalized amendments to the Petroleum and Natural Gas Systems source category (Subpart W) of the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program (GHGRP). This final rule adds new monitoring methods for detecting leaks from oil and gas equipment in the petroleum and natural gas systems source category consistent with the leak detection methods in the NSPS. The action also adds emission factors for leaking equipment to be used in conjunction with these monitoring methods to calculate and report greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions resulting from equipment leaks. The NSPS final rule would add reporting of GHG emissions from certain gathering and boosting systems, completions and workovers of oil wells using hydraulic fracturing, and blowdowns of natural gas transmission pipelines.
Clean Water Act. The federal Clean Water Act (CWA) and corresponding state laws affect our natural gas operations by regulating discharges into surface waters. Permits requiring regular monitoring and compliance with effluent limitations and reporting requirements govern the discharge of pollutants into regulated waters. The CWA and corresponding state laws include requirements for: improvement of designated "impaired waters" (i.e., not meeting state water quality standards) through the use of effluent limitations; anti-degradation regulations which protect state designated "high quality/exceptional use" streams by restricting or prohibiting discharges; stormwater controls; and requirements to dispose of produced wastes and other oil and gas wastes at approved disposal facilities. These requirements impact the development of infrastructure, well-drilling, and hydraulic 
17

fracturing operations. The CWA and similar state laws provide for civil, criminal and administrative penalties for unauthorized discharges of pollutants or reportable quantities of oil and/or other hazardous substances. The Spill Prevention, Control and Countermeasure (SPCC) requirements of the CWA apply to operations that use or produce fluids of threshold quantities and require the implementation of plans to prevent and contain spills. These requirements (or changes to current regulations) may cause CNX to incur significant additional costs that could adversely affect our operating results, financial condition and cash flows.
CNX utilizes pipelines extensively for its natural gas and water businesses. Mitigation permits from the Army Corps of Engineers (ACOE) are typically required for certain impacts these pipelines cause to streams and wetlands, including the crossing of such streams and wetlands. Any expansion of the scope of regulation of pipeline development to include previously non-jurisdictional streams, wetlands and waters, could adversely affect our operating results, financial condition and cash flows.
Endangered Species Act. The Endangered Species Act and related state regulation protect plant and animal species that are threatened or endangered. New or additional species that may be identified as requiring protection or consideration may lead to delays in permits and/or other restrictions.
Safety of Gas Transmission and Gathering Pipelines. On April 8, 2016, The U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) published in the Federal Register a Notice of Proposed Rule Making (NPRM) that would significantly modify existing regulations related to reporting, impact, design, construction, maintenance, operations and integrity management of gas transmission and gathering pipelines. The proposed rule addresses four congressional mandates and six recommendations by the National Transportation Safety Board. The proposed rule broadens the scope of safety coverage both by adding new assessment and repair criteria for gas transmission pipelines, and by expanding these protocols to include pipelines not formerly regulated by the federal standards. This means extending regulatory requirements to transmission and gathering pipelines of eight inches and greater in rural class 1 areas, which could increase time frames and cost to complete projects. It is unclear what action may be taken on this proposal in the new administration. Additionally, certain states, such as West Virginia, also maintain jurisdiction over intrastate natural gas lines.
Resource Conservation and Recovery Act. The federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) and corresponding state laws and regulations affect natural gas operations by imposing requirements for the management, treatment, storage and disposal of hazardous and non-hazardous wastes, including wastes generated by natural gas operations. Facilities at which hazardous wastes have been treated, stored or disposed of are subject to corrective action orders issued by the EPA that could adversely affect our financial results, financial condition and cash flows. On December 28, 2016 the EPA entered into a consent order to resolve outstanding litigation brought by environmental and citizen groups regarding the applicability of RCRA to wastes from oil and gas development activities. The consent order requires the EPA to revise the applicability determination by March 15, 2019.
Federal Regulation of the Sale and Transportation of Natural Gas
 Regulations and orders issued by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) impact our natural gas business to a certain degree. Although the FERC does not directly regulate our natural gas production activities, the FERC has stated that it intends for certain of its orders to foster increased competition within all phases of the natural gas industry. Additionally, the FERC has jurisdiction over the transportation of natural gas in interstate commerce, and regulates the terms, conditions of service, and rates for the interstate transportation of our natural gas production. The FERC possesses regulatory oversight over natural gas markets, including anti-market manipulation regulation. The FERC has the ability to assess civil penalties, order disgorgement of profits and recommend criminal penalties for violations of the Natural Gas Act or the FERC’s regulations and policies thereunder.

Section 1(b) of the Natural Gas Act exempts natural gas gathering facilities from regulation by the FERC. However, the distinction between federally unregulated gathering facilities and FERC-regulated transmission facilities is a fact-based determination, and the classification of facilities is the subject of ongoing litigation. We own certain natural gas pipeline facilities that we believe meet the traditional tests which the FERC has used to establish a pipeline's status as a gatherer not subject to the FERC jurisdiction. 
Natural gas prices are currently unregulated, but Congress historically has been active in the area of natural gas regulation. We cannot predict whether new legislation to regulate natural gas sales might be enacted in the future or what effect, if any, any such legislation might have on our operations. 
Health and Safety Laws
Occupational Safety and Health Act. Our natural gas operations are subject to regulation under the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSHA) and comparable state laws in some states, all of which regulate health and safety of employees at our natural gas operations. Additionally, OSHA's hazardous communication standard, the EPA community right-to-know 
18

regulations under Title III of the federal Superfund Amendment and Reauthorization Act and comparable state laws require that information be maintained about hazardous materials used or produced by our natural gas operations and that this information be provided to employees, state and local governments and the public.
Other State and Local Laws Related to Our Natural Gas Business
Regulation Affecting Gas Operations. Our natural gas operations are also subject to regulation at the state and in some cases, county, municipal and local governmental levels. Such regulation includes requiring permits for the siting and construction of well pads, impoundments, tanks and roads; pooling and unitizations; drilling of wells; bonding requirements; protection of ground water and surface water resources and protection of drinking water supplies; the method of drilling and casing wells; the surface use and restoration of well sites; gas flaring; the plugging and abandoning of wells; the disposal of fluids used in connection with operations; and natural gas operations producing coalbed methane in relation to active mining. A number of states have either enacted new laws or may be considering the adequacy of existing laws affecting gathering rates and/or services. Other state regulation of gathering facilities generally includes various safety, environmental and in some circumstances, nondiscriminatory take requirements but does not generally entail rate regulation. Thus, natural gas gathering may receive greater regulatory scrutiny of state agencies in the future. Our gathering operations could be adversely affected should they be subject in the future to increased state regulation of rates or services, although we do not believe that they would be affected by such regulation any differently than other natural gas producers or gatherers. However, these regulatory burdens may affect profitability, and we are unable to predict the future cost or impact of complying with such regulations.
Regulation of Horizontal Drilling. State regulations for horizontal well drilling and well site construction have been proposed and finalized. In September 2015, Pennsylvania published a final rulemaking on the revisions to the Environmental Protection Performance Standards at Oil and Gas Well Sites (Chapters 78 and 78a). Chapter 78 rules affecting conventional drillers were eliminated under SB279, and may be readdressed by the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection in 2018. Chapter 78a rules are the subject of pending litigation, with oral argument before the Pennsylvania Supreme Court in October 2017. Ohio passed Horizontal Well Site Construction Rules which became effective in July 2015. Ohio is also in the process of reviewing and possibly adopting additional horizontal development rules. Additionally, West Virginia adopted Rules Governing Horizontal Well Development.
 Ownership of Mineral Rights. CNX acquires ownership or leasehold rights to oil and gas properties prior to conducting operations on those properties. The legal requirements of such ownership or leasehold rights generally are established by state statutory or common law. As is customary in the natural gas industry, we have generally conducted only a summary review of the title to oil and gas rights that are not yet in our development plans, but which we believe we control. This summary review is conducted at the time of acquisition or as part of a review of our land records. However, our ownership of certain oil and gas rights, particularly some of the rights we acquired in 2010, as part of an acquisition, may be less developed. As we continue to conduct our standard review of land records and confirm title in anticipation of development, we expect that adjustments to our ownership position (either increases or decreases) will be required.
Prior to the commencement of development operations on natural gas and coalbed methane properties, we conduct a thorough title examination and perform curative work with respect to significant title defects. We generally will not commence operations on a property until we have cured any material title defects on such property. We are typically responsible for the cost of curing any title defects. In addition, the acquisition of the necessary rights to affect such a cure may not be feasible in some cases. Our discovering title defects which we are unable to cure may adversely impact our ability to develop those properties and we may have to reduce our estimated gas reserves including our proved undeveloped reserves. In accordance with the foregoing, we have completed title work on substantially all of our natural gas and coalbed methane properties that are currently producing, and believe that we have satisfactory title to our producing properties in accordance with standards generally accepted in the industry.
