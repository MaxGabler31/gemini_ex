We are in the business of acquiring private corporations in the business of in recycling, sales and distribution of reusable plastics. The goal of recycling plastic is to reduce high rates of plastic pollution while putting less pressure on virgin materials to produce brand new plastic products. This approach helps to conserve resources and diverts plastics from landfills or unintended destinations such as oceans. Our vision incorporates the spirit of social responsibility, not only on a local community basis but also on a global scale.
 
The impact of social distancing requirements due to Covid-19 has affected all industries not only plastic recycling industry. There has been a strong demand for plastic for several years and converting waste plastic materials into commercially viable products, utilizing environmentally friendly recycling and manufacturing methods has been a focused by the global awareness in clean environment, a trend many expect to continue even after Covid-19 restrictions are lifted.
 
The Company intends to implement its business plan upon raising capital. Subject to available capital, the Company intends to invest in:
 
Development
 

● | building of the recycling and extrusion facility 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------
● | on-site contractor services during facility preparation 
● | local engineering and acquisition of lab equipment and supplies 

Implementation
 

● | Promoting international understanding/international-mindedness and/or global awareness/understanding 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Being active in global engagement/global or world citizenship 
● | Increasing intercultural understanding and respect for difference 
● | Encouraging tolerance and commitment to peace 
● | Marketing & Sales development, Operations expenditures 

 
The analysis will be undertaken by or under the supervision of our management. As of the date of this filing, we have not entered into definitive agreements. In our continued efforts to analyze potential business plan, we intend to consider the following factors:
 

● | Potential for growth, indicated by anticipated market expansion or new technology; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Competitive position as compared to other plastic recycling plants of similar size and experience within the segment as well as within the industry as a whole; 
● | Strength and diversity of management, and the accessibility of required management expertise, personnel, services, professional assistance and other required items; 
● | Capital requirements and anticipated availability of required funds, to be provided by the Company or from operations, through the sale of additional securities or convertible debt, through joint ventures or similar arrangements or from other sources; 
● | The extent to which the business opportunity can be advanced in the marketplace; and 
● | Other relevant factors 

 
In applying the foregoing criteria, management will attempt to analyze all factors and circumstances and make a determination based upon reasonable investigative measures and available data. Due to our limited capital available for investigation, we may not discover or adequately evaluate adverse facts about the opportunity to be acquired. Additionally, we will be competing against other entities that may have greater financial, technical, and managerial capabilities for identifying and completing our business plan.
 
We are unable to predict when we will, if ever, identify and implement our business plan. We anticipate that proposed business plan would be made available to us through personal contacts of our directors, officers and principal stockholders, professional advisors, broker-dealers, venture capitalists, members of the financial community and others who may present unsolicited proposals. In certain cases, we may agree to pay a finder’s fee or to otherwise compensate the persons who introduce the Company to business opportunities in which we participate.
 
As of the time of this filing, the Company has not implemented its business plan.

We expect that our due diligence will encompass, among other things, meetings with incumbent management of the target business and inspection of its facilities, as necessary, as well as a review of financial and other information, which is made available to the Company. This due diligence review will be conducted either by our management or by third parties we may engage. We anticipate that we may rely on the issuance of our common stock in lieu of cash payments for services or expenses related to any analysis.
 
We may incur time and costs required to select and evaluate our business structure and complete our business plan, which cannot presently be determined with any degree of certainty. Any costs incurred with respect to the indemnification and evaluation of a prospective plastic recycling program that is not ultimately completed may result in a loss to the Company. These fees may include legal costs, accounting costs, finder’s fees, consultant’s fees and other related expenses. We have no present arrangements for any of these types of fees.
 
We anticipate that the investigation of specific business opportunities and the negotiation, drafting and execution of relevant agreements, disclosure documents and other instruments will require substantial management time and attention and substantial cost for accountants, attorneys, consultants, and others. Costs may be incurred in the investigation process, which may not be recoverable. Furthermore, even if an agreement is reached for the participation in a specific business opportunity, the failure to consummate that transaction may result in a loss to the Company of the related costs incurred.
 
Competition
 
Our company expects to compete with many countries in the plastic recycling industry. In addition, there are several competitors that are larger and more profitable than SGLA. We expect that the quantity and composition of our competitive environment will continue to evolve as the industry matures. Additionally, increased competition is possible to the extent that new geographies enter the marketplace as a result of continued enactment of regulatory and legislative changes. We believe that diligently establishing and expanding our funding sources will establish us in an already established industry. Additionally, we expect that establishing our product offerings on new platforms are factors that mitigate the risk associated with operating in a developing competitive environment. Additionally, the contemporaneous growth of the industry as a whole will result in new competitor entering the plastic recycling marketplace, thereby further mitigating the impact of competition on our future operations and results.
 
Compliance with plastic recycling standards and guidelines will increase development costs and the cost of operating our business. In turn, we may not be able to meet the competitive price point for our products dictated by the market and our competitors.
 
Again, these are forward looking statements and not an indication of past performance. There is no guarantee that we will be able to implement our business plan and have no merger candidates as of the time of this filing.
 
Employees
 
As of December 31, 2021, we had two officers, directors and no employees. We anticipate that we will begin to fill out our management team as and when we raise capital to begin implementing our business plan. In the interim, we will utilize independent consultants to assist with accounting and administrative matters. We currently have no employment agreements and believe our consulting relationships are satisfactory. We plan to continue to hire independent consultants from time to time on an as-needed basis.
