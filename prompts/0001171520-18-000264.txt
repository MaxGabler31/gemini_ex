ITEM 1 | BUSINESS
-------+---------

 
Sono-Tek Corporation (the “Company”, “Sono-Tek”, “We” or “Our”) is the world leader in the design and manufacture of ultrasonic coating systems for applying precise, thin film coatings to protect, strengthen or smooth surfaces on parts and components for the microelectronics/electronics, alternative energy, medical, industrial and emerging research & development/other markets. We design and manufacture custom-engineered ultrasonic coating systems and also provide patented nozzles and generators for manufacturers’ equipment. Our fiscal year ends on February 28. We refer to the fiscal year ended February 28, 2018 as “fiscal 2018” and use similar protocol for previous fiscal years.
 Our ultrasonic nozzle systems use high frequency ultrasonic vibrations that atomize liquids into minute drops that can be applied to surfaces at low velocity providing microscopic layers of protective materials over a wide variety of surfaces, including glass. Our solutions are environmentally-friendly, efficient and highly reliable. They enable dramatic reductions in overspray, savings in raw material, water and energy usage and provide improved process repeatability, transfer efficiency, high uniformity and reduced emissions. We serve a variety of industries and applications and have a broad base of customers with no single customer that provides more than 10% of our revenue. Our largest customer accounted for 8% of revenue in fiscal 2018.
 The applications that are employing our unique coating technology and expertise have been expanding as the advantages of ultrasonic coatings are more broadly recognized. The original application of our technology was to coat the inner surface of blood collection tubes used for medical diagnostic testing. Our products enable the application of a thin and uniform coating of material that prevents coagulation of blood. Following that initial breakthrough, our technology was then used for applying uniform flux coatings to printed circuit boards, a critical part of the fabrication process for all electronic devices. A later application for much larger surfaces was to address the many challenges that glass manufacturers faced. They needed a solution for specialized glass applications in the construction and automotive industries. Among other things, our ultrasonic nozzles are used to provide coatings that improve durability, create filters, increase clarity, reduce reflection, enable conductivity, and enhance safety.
 Our corporate offices are located in Milton, New York where our production facilities are co-located. We also have a sales and service office in Hong Kong and an equipment demonstration room in Shenzen, China. We are ISO 9001 qualified since registering in September 1998 and we have been recertified annually since then.
 
We were founded by the inventor of the ultrasonic nozzle and incorporated in New York on March 21, 1975. We became a public company in 1987 and our stock is traded on the OTCQX U.S. tier of the OTC exchange under the ticker symbol “SOTK”.

 Our principal customers include original equipment manufacturers, distributors and end users of our products in the industries that we serve.
 
Our products are sold primarily through select independent distributors and sales representatives around the world that are trained on our technologies and products. Our distributors are typically experts in their industries and recognize the significant value our technology provides their customers. We provide extensive training and on-site support with our direct sales force and application engineers, who also respond to leads generated by our web sites and the trade shows in which we participate. To grow sales, we have strengthened our team of application engineers and expanded our process development laboratory.
 
We also provide application consulting services enabling our customers to rely on our surface coating expertise and specific customer process optimization.

Our Strategy
 
We are focused on the further development of technologies that enable the microscopic coating of surfaces to enable better outcomes for our customers’ products and processes. We believe product superiority is imperative in all that we produce and that it is developed through the extensive experience we have in the coatings industry, our proprietary manufacturing know-how and skills, and our unique work force we have built over the years.
 
We intend to leverage our innovative technologies, proprietary know-how, unique talent and experience, and global reach to:
 

· | Grow the business globally by reaching new markets and further penetrating the markets and customers we currently serve;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Improve our earnings power through lean manufacturing processes, automation and continuous improvement;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Develop new and unique technologies that solve our customers’ most challenging problems;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Meet or exceed our customers’ expectations; and
--+------------------------------------------------


· | Provide an acceptable return to our shareholders.
--+--------------------------------------------------

 To accomplish these objectives, we believe we must judiciously deploy our monetary and human capital, in order to expand our presence in our targeted markets and create a broader offering for our customers.
 
Availability of Raw Materials and Working Capital Practices
 
Historically, we have not been adversely impacted by the availability of raw materials or components used in the manufacture of our products. All raw materials used in our products are readily available from many different domestic suppliers. We purchase circuit board assemblies and sheet metal components from a wide range of suppliers throughout the world.
 
We carefully manage our inventory using lean manufacturing processes. We provide a limited warranty on all our products covering parts and labor for a period of one year from the date of sale.
 
Research and Development
 
We believe that our long-term growth and stability are linked to the development and release of products that provide solutions to customer needs across a wide spectrum of industries, while advancing the utility of our core technology. During fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017, we spent $1,280,000 and $1,276,000, respectively, on research and development activities related to new products and services and the ongoing improvement of existing products and services.
Intellectual Property
 
Our business is based in part on the technology covered by our U.S. patents. We also rely on unpatented know-how in the design and production of our nozzle systems, subsystems and complete solutions. We have executed non-disclosure and non-compete agreements with all of our employees to safeguard our intellectual property. We execute reciprocal non-disclosure agreements with our key customers to safeguard any jointly developed intellectual property.

Competition
 
We operate in competitive markets in many of our industry segments. We compete against alternative coating technologies, as well as global and regional manufacturers of nozzles and other products based on price, quality, product features and follow up service. We maintain our competitive position by providing highly effective solutions that meet our customers’ requirements and needs. In several emerging markets, we encounter less competition based on the uniqueness of our ultrasonic technology in these applications.
Information Regarding Sales Outside the United States 
 
During fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017, sales to customers outside the U.S. accounted for approximately $6,303,000, or 57% of total revenue, and $6,052,000, or 63% of total revenue, respectively.
