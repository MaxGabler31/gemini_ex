ITEM 1. | BUSINESS
--------+---------

 Emerge Energy Services LP (“Emerge”) is a Delaware limited partnership that completed its initial public offering (“IPO”) on May 14, 2013, to become a publicly traded partnership. Emerge was formed prior to the closing of its IPO, when Insight Equity Management Company LLC and its affiliated investment funds and its controlling equity owners, Ted W. Beneski and Victor L. Vescovo (collectively “Insight Equity”) conveyed all of the interests in Superior Silica Sands LLC (“SSS”) and Allied Energy Company LLC (“AEC”) to Emerge who conveyed its interest in SSS and AEC to its subsidiary Emerge Energy Services Operating LLC (“Emerge Operating”).
 On August 31, 2016, Emerge completed the sale of its Fuel business pursuant to an Amended and Restated Purchase and Sale Agreement, dated August 31, 2016 (the “Fuel Business Purchase Agreement”), with Susser Petroleum Operating Company LLC and Sunoco LP (together, “Sunoco”).  Sunoco paid Emerge a purchase price of $167.7 million in cash (subject to certain working capital and other adjustments in accordance with the terms of the Fuel Business Purchase Agreement), of which $14.25 million was placed into several escrow accounts to satisfy potential claims from Sunoco for indemnification under the Restated Purchase Agreement.  Any escrowed funds remaining after certain periods of time set forth in the Fuel Business Purchase Agreement will be released to Emerge, provided that no unsatisfied indemnity claims exist at such time.   See Note 5 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.
 References to the “Partnership,” “we,” “our” or “us” when used for dates or periods ended on or after the IPO, refer collectively to Emerge and all of its subsidiaries.
 Overview
 We are a publicly-traded limited partnership formed in 2012 by management and affiliates of Insight Equity.  We are engaged in the business of mining, processing, and distributing silica sand, a key input for the hydraulic fracturing of oil and gas wells.  We conduct our operations through our subsidiary SSS, and we believe our SSS brand has name recognition and enjoys a positive reputation with our customers.
 Our principal offices are located at 5600 Clearfork Main Street, Suite 400, Fort Worth, Texas 76109. Our telephone number is (817) 618-4020 and our website address is www.emergelp.com.
 Reorganization and Chapter 11 Proceedings
 On April 18, 2019, we entered into a Restructuring Support Agreement pursuant to which we have agreed to the principal terms of a proposed financial restructuring of the Partnership.  Please see “Item 1A. Risk Factors” and “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources.”
 On July 15, 2019, Emerge, Emerge Energy Services GP LLC, Emerge Operating, SSS and Emerge Energy Services Finance Corporation (collectively, the “Debtors”), filed voluntary petitions for relief (collectively the “Petitions” and, the cases commenced thereby, the “Chapter 11 Cases”) under chapter 11 of title 11 of the United States Code (the “Bankruptcy Code”) in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware (the “Bankruptcy Court”).  The Chapter 11 Cases are jointly administered under the caption “In re: Emerge Energy Services LP, et al.” The Debtors will continue to operate their business as “debtors-in-possession” under the jurisdiction of the Bankruptcy Court and in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Bankruptcy Code and orders of the Bankruptcy Court. The Chapter 11 Cases were filed in order to effect the Debtors’ joint plan of reorganization (as amended from time to time, the “Plan”).
 On September 11, 2019, the Bankruptcy Court entered the Order (I) Approving the Disclosure Statement, (II) Establishing the Voting Record Date, Voting Deadline and Other dates, (III) Approving Procedures for Soliciting, Receiving and Tabulating Votes on the Plan and for Filing objections to the Plan and (IV) Approving the Manner and Forms of Notice and Other Related Documents, (V) Approving Procedures for Assumption of Contracts and Leases and Form and Manner of Assumption Notice, and (VI) Granting Related Relief  (the “Disclosure Statement Order”).  Among other things, the Disclosure Statement Order approved the Disclosure Statement for the First Amended Joint Plan of Reorganization for Emerge Energy Services LP and its Affiliate Debtors Under Chapter 
 1


11 of the Bankruptcy Code (as may be amended from time to time, the “Disclosure Statement”).  The Disclosure Statement Order also approved the Company’s solicitation procedures with respect to the Plan.  Pursuant to the terms of the Plan, only (a) holders of claims arising from, under or in connection with the certain Note Purchase Agreement (the “Prepetition Notes Agreement”) by and among the Partnership, certain of the Partnership’s subsidiaries, HPS, in its capacity as administrative notes agent and collateral agent, and certain noteholders party thereto (such claims, the “Class 5 Prepetition Notes Claims”) and (b) holders of general unsecured claims (such claims, the “Class 6 General Unsecured Claims”) are entitled to vote to accept or reject the Plan.  The Company commenced solicitation for the Plan on September 13, 2019 by distributing, among other things, the Plan, the Disclosure Statement, and ballots to vote to accept or reject the Plan to holders of Class 5 Prepetition Notes Claims and Class 6 General Unsecured Claims.   
 As further provided in the Plan and pursuant to the terms of the Plan, if and only if at least two-thirds (2/3) in dollar amount and more than one-half (1/2) in number of Class 6 General Unsecured Claims vote to accept the Plan, then each holder of equity interests in the Partnership (the “Class 9 Old Emerge LP Equity Interests”) shall receive, in full satisfaction, settlement, discharge and release of, and in exchange for, such allowed Class 9 Old Emerge LP Equity Interests, its pro rata share of new warrants contemplated under that certain new warrants agreement (the “New Warrants Agreement”)1 representing five percent (5%) of new limited partnership interests in the Partnership, as reorganized pursuant to the Plan (the “New Limited Partnership Interests”), issued and outstanding on the effective date of the Plan, prior to dilution by equity issued in connection with the new management incentive plan.  As further provided in the Plan and pursuant to the terms of the Plan, if less than two-thirds (2/3) in dollar amount or fewer than one-half (1/2) in number of Class 6 General Unsecured Claims vote to accept the Plan, Class 6 will have rejected the Plan, in which case the holders of Class 9 Old Emerge LP Equity Interests shall not receive any distribution or retain any property on account of such equity interests in the Partnership and such equity interests in the Partnership will be cancelled without further notice.
 In addition, and as further provided in the Plan and pursuant to the terms of the Plan, if and only if at least two-thirds (2/3) in dollar amount and more than one-half (1/2) in number of Class 6 General Unsecured Claims vote to accept the Plan, then (a) each holder of an allowed Class 5 Prepetition Notes Claim shall receive in full satisfaction, settlement, discharge and release of, and in exchange for, such claim, its pro rata share of: (1) secured notes contemplated under that certain new second lien notes agreement (the “New Second Lien Notes”), if any; (2) ownership interests (“New Emerge GP Equity Interests”) in the new general partner of the Partnership, as reorganized pursuant to the Plan; (3) preferred interests (the “Preferred Interests”) in the Partnership, as reorganized pursuant to the Plan less any Preferred Interests issued to satisfy claims in connection with the DIP Facility (as defined below); and (4) ninety-five percent (95%) of the New Limited Partnership Interests issued and outstanding on the effective date of the Plan, prior to dilution by equity issued in connection with the new management incentive plan and any issuances pursuant to the New Warrants Agreement; and (b) each holder of an allowed Class 6 General Unsecured Claim shall receive, in full satisfaction, settlement, discharge and release of, and in exchange for, such allowed Class 6 General Unsecured Claim: its pro rata share of: (1) five percent (5%) of the New Limited Partnership Interests issued and outstanding on the effective date prior to dilution by the new management incentive plan and any issuances pursuant to the New Warrants Agreement; and (2) new warrants contemplated under the New Warrants Agreement representing ten percent (10%) of the New Limited Partnership Interests issued and outstanding on the effective date prior to dilution by the new management incentive plan.  As further provided in the Plan and pursuant to the terms of the Plan, if less than two-thirds (2/3) in dollar amount or fewer than one-half (1/2) in number of Class 6 General Unsecured Claims vote to accept the Plan, Class 6 will have rejected the Plan in which case (a) each holder of an allowed Class 5 Prepetition Notes Claims shall receive, in full satisfaction, settlement, discharge and release of, and in exchange for, such claim, its pro rata share of: (1) the New Second Lien Notes, if any; (2) the New Emerge GP Equity Interests; (3) the Preferred Interests less any Preferred Interests issued to satisfy claims in connection with the DIP Facility; and (4) one hundred percent (100%) of the New Limited Partnership Interests issued and outstanding on the Effective Date prior to dilution by equity issued in connection with the new management incentive plan; and (b) Class 6 General Unsecured Claims will be discharged without further notice and each holder of a Class 6 General Unsecured Claim shall not receive any distribution or retain any property on account of such Class 6 General Unsecured Claim. 
 In addition, subject to certain exceptions, under the Bankruptcy Code, the Debtors may assume, assign, or reject certain executory contracts and unexpired leases subject to the approval of the Bankruptcy Court and certain other conditions. Generally, the rejection of an executory contract or unexpired lease is treated as a pre-petition breach of such executory contract or unexpired lease and, subject

to certain exceptions, relieves the Debtors of performing their future obligations under such executory contract or unexpired lease but entitles the contract counterparty or lessor to a pre-petition general unsecured claim for damages caused by such deemed breach. Counterparties to such rejected contracts or leases may assert claims against the applicable Debtor's estate for such damages. Generally, the assumption of an executory contract or unexpired lease requires the Debtors to cure existing monetary defaults under such executory contract or unexpired lease and provide adequate assurance of future performance. Accordingly, any description of an executory contract or unexpired lease with the Debtors in this Annual Report, including where applicable a quantification of our obligations under any such executory contract or unexpired lease with the Debtors is qualified by any overriding rejection rights we have under the Bankruptcy Code. Further, nothing herein is or shall be deemed an admission with respect to any claim amounts or calculations arising from the rejection of any executory contract or unexpired lease and the Debtors expressly preserve all of their rights with respect thereto.
In connection with the Chapter 11 Cases, on July 17, 2019, the Debtors received interim authorization from the Bankruptcy Court to enter into the DIP Facility (as defined below) and on August 14, 2019 the Debtors received final authorization from the Bankruptcy Court to enter into the DIP Facility.  In connection with the Chapter 11 Cases, on August 14, 2019, the Debtors also received authorization from the Bankruptcy Court to reject certain executory contracts and unexpired leases, including but not limited to the Debtors’ rail car lease agreements, nunc pro tunc to July 15, 2019, and to enter into certain new rail car lease agreements nunc pro tunc to July 15, 2019.

DIP Facility
 In connection with the Chapter 11 Cases, on July 19, 2019 (the “DIP Closing Date”), the Debtors entered into a senior secured priming and superpriority debtor-in-possession credit and security agreement (the “DIP Facility”) with HPS Investment Partners, LLC, as administrative agent and collateral agent (the “DIP Administrative Agent”) and the financial institutions from time to time party thereto.
 The DIP Facility contains various covenants and restrictive provisions which also require the maintenance of certain financial and other related covenants such as the following:
  
• | A minimum liquidity requirement of $5.0 million at all times;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------


• | A minimum consolidated EBITDA of no less than negative $70.0 million, commencing with the fiscal quarter ending June 30, 2019; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Delivery of at least weekly budgets, including cash disbursements, cash receipts and net cash flow (the “DIP Budget”), which is subject to a permitted variance (the “Permitted Variance”) of (a) 10% on a weekly basis and (b) (i) prior to the resumption of operations at the San Antonio facility 10% on a cumulative bi-weekly basis or (ii) from and after the resumption of operations at the San Antonio facility, 5% on a cumulative 4-week basis.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 In addition, the DIP Facility contains various milestone requirements related to the Chapter 11 case along with disclosure requirements which include, but not limited to:
  
• | No later than August 31, 2019, the Debtors shall have filed the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | No later than August 31, 2019, the Debtors shall have filed the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2019; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | No later than September 30, 2019, the Debtors shall have filed the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2019, in each case, of Emerge and its subsidiaries with the Securities Exchange Commission.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The Debtors have exceeded the Permitted Variance with respect to net cash flow for the week of August 26, 2019 and September 2, 2019 and the bi-weekly period ending August 30, 2019 and have breached milestone requirements in the DIP Facility related to the filing of the Annual Report and the Quarterly Report for the quarter ended March 31, 2019, both constituting events of default that allow for the lenders to exercise rights and remedies, including but not limited to declaring outstanding principal, fees and interest thereunder immediately due and payable.  In addition, due to these events of default, the lenders are charging default interest equal to an additional 2% on all obligations thereunder.  The DIP Facility permits advances during an event of default, in the DIP Administrative Agent’s sole discretion.  Additionally, we did not meet the milestone requirement for filing the Quarterly Report for the quarter ended June 30, 2019, which would also constitute an event of default under the DIP Facility.
 Proceeds of the DIP Facility can be used by the Debtors for, among other things, the Debtors’ general business purposes, including working capital requirements during the pendency of the Chapter 11 Cases and to pay certain fees and expenses of professionals retained by the Debtors, in each case subject to certain limitations provided in the DIP Facility. Further information on the terms of the DIP Facility is included below under “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations–Liquidity and Capital Resources–DIP Facility.”
 Previous Acquisition Developments
 On May 11, 2018, we signed a 25-year lease deal for the mining rights to approximately 600 acres located in Kingfisher County, Oklahoma, about 60 miles northwest of Oklahoma City.  We purchased 40 acres of land adjoining the leased acreage on which to construct wet and dry processing plants expected to have a capacity of 1.5 million tons per year.  This facility will serve the Mid-Continent region.  Construction of the wet and dry processing plants is temporarily suspended due to cash flow restrictions from our lenders.  We are working with our lenders and hope to move ahead with this project.
 On April 12, 2017, we acquired substantially all of the assets of Materials Holding Company, Inc., Osburn Materials, Inc., Osburn Sand Co. and South Lehr, Inc. (San Antonio operations) for $20 million.  This site is located 25 miles south of San Antonio, Texas and previously produced and sold construction, foundry and sports sands, but did not serve the energy markets.  We upgraded the existing 
 4


operations for conversion into frac sand production and commenced frac sand production in July 2017.  As part of our expansion strategy in San Antonio, we constructed new wet and dry plants on the site.  The new dry plant commenced operations in late April 2018.  Full construction of the dry and wet plant was completed in January 2019.
 On June 21, 2019, a levee breach incident occurred at our San Antonio facility.  A section of the wall in the facility’s mud retention pond failed causing an inundation of water and sediment to the mine.  No injuries occurred as a result of the breach and representatives from MSHA were given notice of the incident.  MSHA issued a Section 103(k) order on the entire mine area, meaning we could not access any part of the impacted mine.  During the order, the primary production lines at the mine and wet processing plant remained idle, but we restarted a small wet processing line not impacted by the Section 103(k) order.  We are also purchasing higher-cost third party wet feed to supplement our own internal feed.  
 In spite of the primary mining and wet plant operations in San Antonio having been shut down since June 21, 2019 as a result of the incident described above, we are able to continue operating our dry plant and delivering product to customers. On September 16, 2019, we were notified that the Section 103(k) order has been lifted.  We expect that the facility will be fully operational in the near term.  We are assessing our claims under insurance coverage.
 On October 11, 2019, one of the dryer exhaust stacks on the facility’s dry plant collapsed in a high wind event.  The Company immediately ceased operations at the dry plant in order to protect the work force, assess the damages, and determine necessary repairs. If the dry facility is non-operable for a significant period of time, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, liquidity or results of operations. 
 Business Strategies
 The primary components of our business strategy are:
  
• | Liquidity preservation. The preservation of cash and liquidity remains a significant priority for us in the current market environment. We have taken steps to lower our costs in all categories of our business, and we have made significant progress in that regard. We are working with our providers to lower our fixed cost obligations, particularly for our logistics operations. In January 2019, we engaged a Chief Restructuring Officer and other advisors to assist in efforts to restructure our various long-term contracts. There is no assurance that we will be able to negotiate significant price concessions and purchase commitment amendments from our major vendors. In order to reduce our operating costs and conserve liquidity, we have temporarily idled our higher cost plants and operated our Wisconsin wet mines for a shortened season. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Respond to changing market conditions. Although total demand for frac sand increased in 2018, commodity prices fell in the second half of the year, prompting oil and gas companies to pull back on drilling and completion activity. This, in turn, caused a softening in demand for frac sand to finish the year. Drilling and Completion activity levels have remained soft through the middle of 2019 given volatile commodity prices and strict budget discipline from oil and gas companies. We continue to believe that the frac sand market offers attractive long-term growth fundamentals once commodity prices stabilize as North American energy companies have lowered their overall cost of production through technological innovation to better compete on a global scale. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Expansion of Sand Resources. We are continually focused on growing our resource base and responding to the changing needs of the market and our customers. Over the past few years, the adoption of in-basin sand by oil and gas companies has increased. Although in-basin sand is typically lower quality than northern white sand, some oil and gas companies have determined that in-basin sand has adequate physical properties for a portion of their well designs, and the delivered cost advantages of in-basin sand can economically justify its usage. This trend has caused us to become a more diversified supplier of high quality northern white sand and in-basin sand. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 On May 11, 2018, we signed a 25-year lease for the mining rights to approximately 600 acres located in Kingfisher County, Oklahoma, about 60 miles northwest of Oklahoma City.  We purchased 40 acres of land adjoining the leased acreage on which to construct wet and dry processing plants expected to have a capacity of 1.5 million tons per year.  The site contains American Petroleum Institute (“API”) specification, strategic reserves (40/140 mesh sands), which will serve the Mid-
 5


Continent region.  Construction of the wet and dry processing plants is temporarily suspended due to cash flow restrictions from our lenders.  We are working with our lenders and hope to move ahead with this project.
 On April 12, 2017, we acquired our San Antonio operations.  The San Antonio site is located approximately 25 miles south of San Antonio, Texas and previously produced and sold construction, foundry and sports sands, but did not serve the energy markets.  We upgraded the existing operations for conversion into frac sand production and commenced frac sand production in July 2017.  As part of our expansion strategy in San Antonio, we constructed new wet and dry plants on the site.  The new dry plant commenced operations in late April 2018.  Full construction of the dry and wet plants was completed in January 2019.  Our San Antonio reserves contain API specification, strategic reserves (40/70 and 100 mesh sands) that bolster our presence with in-basin local sands and balance our portfolio of northern white to local sands.  With the close proximity of the San Antonio plant to the Eagle Ford Shale, we sell all of the frac sand produced at the San Antonio plant into the Eagle Ford Shale, which is currently the second most active in the United States.
  
• | Focus on profitability and improving financial condition. We are applying financial discipline to all aspects of our business, with the primary goals of maximizing profits, controlling costs, prudently deploying capital for growth projects, and generating positive cash flow. We are constantly focused on lowering our production costs by efficiently operating our mines and dry plants, investing in operational projects that offer high returns, minimizing waste, and working closely with third-party contractors and vendors. Furthermore, we routinely negotiate price concessions and purchase commitment amendments from our major vendors, such as railcar lessors, rail transportation providers, mine operators, transload facility operations, and professional service providers. We often enter into multi-year contracts with third parties for agreements that include railcar leases, transload terminal leases, and minimum volume mining contracts. During periods of business expansion, we typically enter into new arrangements with various third parties, or we increase commitments with existing third parties. During periods of business contraction, we work with our providers to lower our fixed cost obligations. With the market shift from northern white sand and terminal sales, we determined we had excess railcars. Through negotiations with contract counterparties we effectuated a rightsizing of our fleet and transload capacity by rejecting all railcar leases, select leases for transload facilities and certain other executory contracts and unexpired leases, as well as entering into new, amended railcar leases with three select lessors through the Chapter 11 Cases on new terms to match the fleet size and economics for our railcars to the current market environment. See “Item 7. Management’s Discuss and Analysis—Liquidity and Capital Resources.”

• | Build long-term customer relationships and execute on customer contracts. We seek to develop long-term customer relationships by providing a secure source of sand supply for our customers with a high level of service. We are constantly working to secure or renew long-term take-or-pay, fixed-volume, and efforts-based contracts with existing and new customers in order to cover the majority of our production capacity. In 2018, total sales to customers under long-term contracts, including efforts-based, fixed-volume, and take-or-pay arrangements, accounted for 60% of our sand sales volumes. As of December 31, 2018, we had 4.06 million tons under long-term contract, primarily efforts-based arrangements, with a weighted average remaining of 2.11 years.

Competitive Strengths
 We believe that we are well positioned to successfully execute our business strategies because of the following competitive strengths:
  
• | High quality, strategically located assets. Our Texas operations provide us in-basin local sands to satisfy customers who prefer such sand for economic reasons, while our Wisconsin operations provide high-quality northern white sand for those customers favoring quality over cost. We currently operate several scalable frac sand production facilities in San Antonio, Texas, and Kosse, Texas, and in and around Barron County, Wisconsin. Our facility in San Antonio, Texas is supported by 39.3 million tons of proven recoverable frac sand reserves and 18.1 million tons of probable frac sand reserves; our facility in Kosse, Texas is supported by 21.5 million tons of proven recoverable sand reserves; and our facilities in Wisconsin are supported by 69.7 million tons of proven recoverable sand reserves. We believe that our Texas and Wisconsin reserves provide us access to a balanced amount of coarse sand (16/30, 20/40, and 30/50 mesh sands) and fine sand (40/70 and 100 mesh) compared to other frac sand producers. Our San Antonio and Kosse, Texas operations primarily consist of fine sand product, which affords us significant flexibility of serving our customers with their desired product type. Our sample boring data and production data indicate that our Wisconsin reserves contain deposits of nearly 35% 40 mesh or coarser substrate, with our Barron reserves being comprised of more than 60% 50 mesh or coarser substrate. Our mine deposits in Wisconsin can be targeted to extract finer grades when the market dictates such demand. With the shift of some customers electing to use lower cost, in-basin sands, we have a diversified mix of product types to meet the needs of our customer base. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Strong relationships with our customers and other constituencies. Our management and operating teams have developed longstanding relationships with our customers and other constituencies. Based on our track record of dependability, timely delivery and high-quality products that consistently meet customer specifications, we believe that we are well positioned to secure additional contracted commitments in the future, and that our product mix and customer service will continue to benefit our reputation within the frac sand industry. We also believe we are known in the communities in which we operate, which generally serves us well in hiring new employees. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Competitive operating cost structure. With the completion of our wet plant in San Antonio in 2019, we believe our in-basin operations will have a competitive cost structure as we will be utilizing our own wet feed. Further, our Wisconsin operations’ competitiveness has improved with restructuring fixed logistics and mining agreements. Our competitive cost structure is a result of the following key attributes: 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | close proximity of our in-basin sand operations (San Antonio and Kosse, Texas) to oil and gas producing regions;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | close proximity of our silica sand reserves to our processing plants, which reduces operating costs;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | expertise in designing, building, maintaining and operating advanced frac sand processing, storage and loading facilities;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a large proportion of the costs we incur in our production of sand are only incurred when we produce saleable frac sand;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | open dialogue with key vendors, allowing for cost reductions;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------


• | proximity to major sand and logistics infrastructure, minimizing transportation and fuel costs and headcount needs;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | enclosed dry plant operations which allow full run rates during winter months, thereby increasing plant utilization; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a diversified and growing customer base spread across nearly every major shale play in North America.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Experienced management team and employee base with industry specific operating and technical expertise. Our senior management team and employees have extensive industry experience in managing and operating industrial mineral production facilities. They have managed numerous frac sand mining and processing plants, successfully led acquisitions in the industry and developed multiple greenfield industrial mineral processing facilities. We believe that our customers value our commitment to customer service, our reliable delivery, and our focus on high-quality product.

Our Business
 We mine, process and distribute high quality silica sand, a key input for the hydraulic fracturing of oil and gas wells.  Our San Antonio facility consists of a dry plant with a permitted capacity of 4.0 million finished tons per year.  Our sand reserves in San Antonio supply the wet plant and the dry plant with local Texas sand.  We also have a dry plant in Kosse, Texas, with a capacity of 600,000 tons per year that is supplied by a separate mine and wet plant that processes local Texas sand.  Our Wisconsin facilities consist of three dry plants located in Arland, Barron and New Auburn, Wisconsin with a total permitted capacity of 6.3 million finished tons per year, and five wet plants and mine complexes that supply the dry plants with northern white silica sand, which we believe is the highest quality raw frac sand available.  As of December 31, 2018, we also had 13 transload facilities located throughout North America in the key basins where we deliver our sand, as well as a fleet of 5,186 railcars.
 Our business experienced rapid growth from 2011 to 2014 due to technological advances in horizontal drilling and the hydraulic fracturing process that have made the extraction of large volumes of oil and natural gas from domestic unconventional hydrocarbon formations economically feasible.  Demand for frac sand decreased during 2015 and 2016 as a result of the industry downturn.  However, commodity prices stabilized in the middle of 2016, leading to an improvement in drilling activity during the third quarter of 2016, and into 2017 and 2018.  The market for frac sand began to soften in early August 2018, due to a decline in well completion activities as well as oil and natural gas exploration and production companies’ budget exhaustions.  These factors, along with the new production from in-basin frac sand competitors discussed below, led the sand market to quickly turn from a state of short supply in the first half of the year to oversupply in the second half of 2018 and into 2019.  As a result, the entire industry has experienced pricing pressure, particularly on the northern white product.  We believe that the premium geologic characteristics of our Wisconsin sand reserves, the strategic location of our in-basin sand mines, our location on multiple Class 1 rail lines, our transload and logistics network, the industry experience of our senior management team, and the reputation that SSS has with our customers position us as a highly attractive source of frac sand to the oil and natural gas industry.
 The production of our sand consists of three basic processes: mining, wet plant operations, and dry plant operations.  All mining activities take place in an open pit environment, whereby we remove the topsoil, which is set aside, and then remove other non-economic minerals, or “overburden,” to expose the sand deposits.  At certain sites, we then “bump” the sand using explosives on the mine face, which causes the sand to fall into the pit, where it is then carried by truck to the wet plant operations.  We also utilize a process called hydraulic mining whereby we use high pressure water cannons to dislodge the sandstone, and transport the sand and water mixture via pipeline to the wet plant.  Where the geology is suitable, this technique minimizes the use of heavy excavation machinery, thereby lowering operating costs.  We introduced dredging mining techniques to our Kosse mine in 2018, whereby sand deposits are extracted from the ground with water.  The resulting slurry is transported via pipeline to the wet processing facility.  Once we have mined out a portion of the reserves, we then either return the land to its previous contours or to a more usable contour.  We also replace the topsoil in Wisconsin.  At our wet plants, the mined sand goes through a series of processes designed to separate the sand from unusable materials.  The resulting wet sand is then conveyed to a wet sand stockpile where most of the water is allowed to drain into our on-site recycling facility, while the remaining fine grains and other materials, if any, are separated through a series of settlement ponds.  We reuse all of the water that does not evaporate in our wet process.  Wet sand from our stockpile is then conveyed or trucked to our dry plants where the sand is dried, screened into specific mesh categories, and stored in silos.  From the silos, we load sand directly into railcars or trucks, which we then ship to one of our transload facilities or directly to one of our customers.
 Our mine, wet plant and dry plants in San Antonio, Texas operate year-round.  We currently operate our facilities with crews of 18 employees who work twelve-hour shifts and average 42 hours a week.  As part of our expansion strategy in San Antonio, we constructed an additional plant on the site which was operational in January 2019.  Our San Antonio reserves contain API-specification, strategic reserves (40/70 and 100 mesh sands) that bolster our presence with in-basin local sands and balance our portfolio of northern white to local sands.  With the close proximity of the San Antonio plant to the Eagle Ford basin, we sell all the frac sand produced at the San Antonio plant into the Eagle Ford basin, which is currently the second most active in the United States.
 Our mine, wet plant, and dry plant in Kosse, Texas operates year-round.  The reserves primarily consist of API-specific finer mesh grades, which strategically complement the coarser grades from our Wisconsin deposits.  We operate our Kosse facilities with crews of four to six employees who work twelve-hour shifts and average 40 hours per week.  This allows us to optimize facility utilization.

Our frac sand facilities are located in Barron County and Chippewa County, Wisconsin, and San Antonio and Kosse, Texas.  Based on the reports of third-party independent engineering firms, we have 155.2 million tons of proven recoverable reserves.  We are currently capable of producing up to 13.5 million tons and 10.9 million tons of wet and dry sand per year, respectively, from our current facilities.  We believe that the coarseness, conductivity, sphericity, acid-solubility, and crush-resistant properties of our Wisconsin reserves and our facilities' connectivity to rail and other transportation infrastructure afford us an advantage over our competitors and make us one of a select group of sand producers capable of delivering high volumes of frac sand that is optimal for oil and natural gas production to all major unconventional resource basins currently producing throughout North America and abroad.
 Our Wisconsin sand reserves give us access to a range of high-quality sand that meets or exceeds all API specifications and includes a mix between concentrations of coarse grades (16/30, 20/40 and 30/50 mesh sands) and finer grades (40/70 and 100 mesh).  While our Wisconsin reserves provide us access to a high amount of coarse sand compared to other northern white deposits located in Wisconsin’s Jordan and Wonewoc formations, we have the ability to target certain locations in our deposits to obtain finer sands.  Our sample boring data and our historical production data have indicated that our Wisconsin reserves contain deposits of nearly 35% 40 mesh or coarser substrate, with our FLS, Church Road, LP Mine and Thompson Hills reserves being comprised of more than 60% 50 mesh or coarser substrate.  We are also one of a select number of mine operators that can offer commercial amounts of 16/30 mesh sand, the coarsest grade of widely-used frac sand on the market.  Our Wisconsin dry plants are fully enclosed, which means that we are capable of running year-round, regardless of the weather.  Under normal market conditions, we operate our Wisconsin plants with work crews of four to six employees.  These crews work 40-hour weeks, with shifts between eight and twelve hours, depending on the employee’s function.  Because raw sand cannot be wet-processed during extremely cold temperatures, we typically mine and wet-process frac sand eight months out of the year at our Wisconsin locations.
 Future development
 On May 11, 2018, we signed a 25-year lease for the mining rights to approximately 600 acres located in Kingfisher County, Oklahoma, about 60 miles northwest of Oklahoma City.  We purchased 40 acres of land adjoining the leased acreage on which to construct wet and dry processing plants expected to have a capacity of 1.5 million tons per year.  This facility will serve the Mid-Continent region.  Construction of the wet and dry processing plants is temporarily suspended due to cash flow restrictions from our lenders.  We are working with our lenders and hope to move ahead with this project.
 Each of our facilities undergoes regular maintenance to minimize unscheduled downtime and to ensure that the quality of our frac sand meets applicable International Organization for Standardization (“ISO”) and API standards and our customers' specifications.  In addition, we make capital investments in our facilities as required to support customer demand and our internal performance goals.
 The following table provides information regarding our frac sand production facilities as of December 31, 2018.

Mineral Reserves
 We believe that our strategically located mines and facilities provide us with a large, high-quality, and diversified mineral reserve base.  The coarseness and high crush strength of the northern white frac sand that we mine in Wisconsin offers superior physical properties compared to in-basin, finer-mesh sand that we offer from our San Antonio and Kosse, Texas locations.  Certain customers prefer our higher quality sand mined in Wisconsin because it can enhance the recovery of hydrocarbons in certain geological formations, particularly higher stress and deeper wells.  However, other customers prefer the lower quality sand mined at our Texas locations as this product has adequate physical characteristics for certain shallower well formations and offers a lower landed cost to the wellsite given the mines’ proximity to active drilling regions.
 Our reserves are categorized as proven or probable recoverable in accordance with and subject to the definitions in SEC Industry Guide 7, and our third-party geologists and mining engineers apply those definitions to estimate the sand reserves that could be extracted at a cost that is economically and legally feasible.  As of December 31, 2018, we had a total of 155.2 million tons of estimated proven recoverable mineral reserves.  The quantity and nature of the mineral reserves at each of our properties are estimated by third-party geologists and mining engineers, and we internally track the depletion rate on an interim basis.  Cooper Engineering Company, Inc. prepared estimates of our proven mineral reserves at our Wisconsin mine locations, while Westward Environmental, Inc. prepared estimates of our proven mineral reserves at our Kosse and San Antonio facilities, each as of December 31, 2018.  Our Oklahoma proven reserve estimates were prepared by Westward Environmental, Inc. in September 2018.  
 Our third-party geologists and engineers annually update our estimates of sand reserves that are economically and legally feasible to extract, making necessary adjustments for operations at each location during the year, additions or reductions due to property acquisitions and dispositions, quality adjustments and mine plan updates. The third-party geologists and engineers apply a number of factors in making such adjustments, including analysis of our current mining methods and processing techniques and physical inspection of mine characteristics and accessibility. 
 The SEC recently adopted Final Rule 13-10570, Modernization of Property Disclosures for Mining Registrants, which will replace the mining property disclosure requirements of Industry Guide 7. We will be required to comply with the new rules starting with the fiscal year beginning January 1, 2021, at which point Industry Guide 7 will be rescinded.  In connection with the pending updates to mining property disclosure requirements, reserves estimates disclosed in our future Annual Reports will include an analysis of operating costs, capital costs and long-term anticipated sales volume and price in evaluating the economic viability of our reserves.
 Our mineral reserve leases in Wisconsin with third-party landowners expire at various times between 2036 and 2038.  Our mineral reserve lease in Kingfisher, Oklahoma expires in 2043.  We do not anticipate any issues in renewing these leases should we decide to do so.  Consistent with industry practice, we conduct only limited investigations of title to the leased properties prior to leasing.  Title to lands and reserves of the lessors or grantors and the boundaries of our leased properties are not completely verified until we prepare to mine those reserves.
 Mines and Wet Plants
 Our San Antonio deposits are Eocene-aged Carrizo sand formations which can be used in a variety of specialized sand applications including frac sand.  Prior to our acquisition in April 2017, our San Antonio plant produced and sold construction, foundry and sports sands, but did not serve the energy markets.  We upgraded the existing operations for conversion into frac sand production and commenced frac sand production in July 2017.
 10


Our Kosse plant mines sands from the Simsboro deposits consisting of mostly sand units, including some mudstones, silts and clays.  In addition to frac sand, Kosse also produces industrial sands for foundry, construction, and masonry.
 The deposits found in our open-pit Wisconsin-based mines are Cambrian quartz sandstone deposits that produce high-quality northern white frac sand and have a minimum silica content of 99%.  Mining takes place in phases lasting from six months to one year in duration, after which the property is reclaimed in a manner that typically provides the landowners with additional cropland.  Due to the current northern white sand market conditions, we have idled our higher cost mines and plants in order to reduce our operating costs and conserve liquidity.
 San Antonio
 In April 2017, we acquired the mineral rights to a 634 acre mineral deposit located in San Antonio, Texas, adjacent to our San Antonio dry plant.  San Antonio has API-specification, strategic reserves that bolster our presence with in-basin local sands and balance our portfolio of northern white to local sands.  As of December 31, 2018, our San Antonio deposit contained 39.3 million tons of proven recoverable reserves and 18.1 million tons of probable frac sand reserves.  San Antonio proven recoverable reserve estimates were adjusted in 2018 for the reduction of the coarser 30/40 material.  Based on the current market demand, there is no longer a market for the coarser 30/40 in-basin material, and it is therefore considered waste.  Thus, our 2018 reserve estimates were updated based on a revised average recovery factor for the site.  As part of our expansion strategy in San Antonio, we constructed a wet plant on the site.  Construction of this wet plant was completed in January 2019, and has a capacity to produce 4.5 million tons of wet sand per year.  With the completion of our wet plant in San Antonio in 2019, we believe that our operations have a low cost structure when mining internal feed.
 On June 21, 2019, a levee breach incident occurred at our San Antonio facility.  A section of the wall in the facility’s mud retention pond failed causing an inundation of water and sediment to the mine.  No injuries occurred as a result of the breach and representatives from MSHA were given notice of the incident.  MSHA issued a Section 103(k) order on the entire mine area, meaning we could not access any part of the impacted mine.  During the order, the primary production lines at the mine and wet processing plant remained idle, but we restarted a small wet processing line not impacted by the Section 103(k) order.  We are also purchasing higher-cost third party wet feed to supplement our own internal feed. On September 16, 2019, we were notified that the Section 103(k) order has been lifted and we expect that the facility will be fully operational in the near term.  We are assessing our claims under insurance coverage.  
 On October 11, 2019, one of the dryer exhaust stacks on the facility’s dry plant collapsed in a high wind event.  The Company immediately ceased operations at the dry plant in order to protect the work force, assess the damages, and determine necessary repairs. If the dry facility is non-operable for a significant period of time, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, liquidity or results of operations.
Kosse
 We own the mineral rights to a 225 acre mineral deposit located in Kosse, Texas, adjacent to our Kosse dry plant.  As of December 31, 2018, the Kosse mineral deposit contained 21.5 million tons of proven recoverable reserves which we process into a high-quality, 100 mesh frac sand.  Kosse proven recoverable reserve estimates were adjusted in 2018 for the reduction of the coarser 20/40 material.  Based on the current market demand, there is no longer a market for in-basin 20/40 material, and it is therefore considered waste.  Thus, our 2018 reserve estimates were updated based on a revised average recovery factor for the site.  Also, as a result of introducing dredging mining techniques in 2018, we can mine material that was previously considered overburden, thus resulting in an addition to the total reserve in 2018.  The wet plant at our Kosse facility is capable of producing up to 1.6 million tons of wet sand per year.  We are not obligated to make royalty payments in connection with our mining operations at this location.  We use heavy equipment to mine sand from the open pit.
Auburn
 Our Auburn wet plant can process up to 2.0 million tons of wet sand per year.  It is located in Chippewa County, Wisconsin, 12 miles from our New Auburn dry plant, to which we have year-round trucking access.  The mine site consists of 240 acres adjacent to our 
 11


New Auburn wet plant.  The site contains 15.5 million tons of proven recoverable sand reserves.  Due to the current northern white market conditions, we do not plan to reopen this mine in 2019.
 Church Road
 Our Church Road wet plant can process up to 1.2 million tons of wet sand per year.  It is located less than one mile from our Arland dry plant.  The mine site is situated on 80 acres.  The site contains 5.3 million tons of proven recoverable sand reserves.  The 2018 reserves were updated due to a revision in the mine plan and property line setbacks.  Due to the current northern white sand market conditions, we do not plan to reopen this mine in 2019.
 FLS mine
 Our FLS wet plant can process up to 1.4 million tons of wet sand per year.  It is located 12 miles from our Barron dry plant.  The mine site is situated on 364 acres and consists of a series of five adjacent mineral deposits in Barron County, Wisconsin.  The site contains 8.8 million tons of proven recoverable sand reserves.  We started seasonal production in May 2019 but ran the plant for a shortened mining season in 2019 due to the current northern white sand market conditions. 
 LP Mine
 Our LP wet plant can process up to 1.2 million tons of wet sand per year.  It is located 2 miles from our Arland dry plant.  The mine site is situated on 145 acres.  The site contains 3.3 million tons of proven recoverable sand reserves.  We use hydraulic mining method at this site. Due to the current northern white sand market conditions, we do not plan to reopen this mine in 2019.
 Thompson Hills
 Our Thompson Hills wet plant can process up to 1.6 million tons of wet sand per year.  It is located 15 miles from our New Auburn dry plant and 26 miles from our Barron dry plant.  The mine site is situated on 580 acres and consists of a series of seven leases in Barron County, Wisconsin.  The site contains 36.8 million tons of proven recoverable sand reserves.
 We completed construction of the mine and wet plant in September 2014.  We incorporated two features into the wet plant that we believe provide the plant with higher quality sand within a more environmentally sound footprint.  The first is that we wash our sand both before and after we run the wet sand through the hydrosizer.  The resulting sand has low turbidity, which results in less fugitive dust both at our facilities and at the drilling site for our customers.  The second is that we separate our fines and other unusable material without the use of settling ponds, which enables us to use less water in our wet plant.  We use hydraulic mining method at this site.  We started seasonal production in June 2019 but ran the plant for a shortened mining season in 2019 due to current northern white sand market conditions.
 Oklahoma
 On May 11, 2018, we signed a 25-year lease for the mining rights to approximately 535 acres located in Kingfisher County, Oklahoma, about 60 miles northwest of Oklahoma City.  This site contains 24.7 million tons of proven reserves.  Construction of the wet plant is temporarily suspended due to cash flow restrictions from our lenders.  We are working with our lenders and hope to move ahead with this project.
Dry Plant Facilities
 San Antonio
 In April 2017, we completed the asset acquisition of our San Antonio site which is located 25 miles south of San Antonio, Texas.  The San Antonio dry plant previously produced and sold construction, foundry and sports sands, but did not serve the energy markets.  We upgraded the existing operations for conversion into frac sand production and commenced frac sand production in July 2017.  As part of our expansion strategy, we constructed an additional plant on the site.  This additional plant was operational in the second quarter of 2018 and is capable of producing 4.0 million tons per year of finished dry sand.  This facility has direct trucking to a four lane US highway to serve the Eagle Ford basin.  With the close proximity of the plant to the Eagle Ford basin, we sell all of the frac sand produced at the plant into this shale play, which is currently the second most active basin in the United States.  We have access to a 
 12


segment of on-site rail track that is tied into a rail line owned by UP mainline and have access to BNSF mainline which is 15 miles away.  We will continue to sell sand to non-energy markets including construction, foundry and sports sands.
 For the year ended December 31, 2018, our San Antonio facility produced 638,000 tons of frac sand.
 In spite of the primary mining and wet plant operations in San Antonio having been shut down since June 21, 2019 as a result of the incident described in the “Mines and Wet Plant” section above, we restarted a small wet processing line not impacted by the Section 103(k) order. We are also purchasing higher-cost third party wet feed to supplement our own internal feed.  On September 16, 2019, we were notified that the Section 103(k) order has been lifted.  We expect that the facility will be fully operational in the near term.  We are assessing our claims under insurance coverage.
 Kosse
 Our Kosse dry plant is located adjacent to our Kosse mine and wet plant on land we own in Kosse, Texas. The facility has a rated production capacity of 1,650 tons per day year-round.  The dry plant utilizes a 200 ton per hour natural gas fired rotary dryer that is capable of producing up to 600,000 tons per year of dry native Texas frac sand, and has an air permit that allows us to produce up to 1.2 million tons per year of finished product.  The plant produces 100 mesh native Texas sand and is capable of producing a higher-cut 40/70 frac sand.  We also sell sand to non-energy end users, including industrial applications, and sports sand for golf courses, stadiums and other sports-related venues.  The Kosse facility has three on-site 1,000-ton storage silos designed for loading trucks for delivery to local and regional markets.
 For the year ended December 31, 2018, our Kosse facility produced 383,000 tons of frac sand.
 Arland
 Our Arland dry plant is located on 22 acres that we own in the township of Arland in Barron County, Wisconsin.  The facility is located on a county road, which gives us year-round trucking access, and is situated 11 miles from our Barron facility, and 37 miles from our New Auburn facility.  Our Arland dry plant is an enclosed facility that has a rated production capacity of 8,800 tons per day year-round, regardless of weather conditions.  Our current air permit allows us to produce up to 3.5 million tons per year of finished product.  The facility has a 300 ton per hour natural gas fired rotary dryer as well as twelve high capacity gyratory mineral separators (“screeners”) that are capable of producing up to 2.5 million tons per year.  Our finished product is transported via truck to one of our dry plant facilities with rail access or to a third-party rail loadout facility located in Minnesota.
 For the year ended December 31, 2018, our Arland facility produced 1.1 million tons of northern white frac sand.  In November 2018, we idled our Arland plant due to the challenging market conditions.
 Barron
 Our Barron dry plant is located on 83 acres that we own in the township of Clinton, Wisconsin in Barron County.  The facility is located on a US Highway, which gives us year-round trucking access, and is situated along a rail spur owned by the CN railway that connects to the CN main line.  Our Barron dry plant is an enclosed facility that has a rated production capacity of 8,800 tons per day year-round regardless of weather conditions, and has on-site railcar loading facilities.  Our current air permit allows us to produce up to 2.4 million tons per year of finished product.  The facility has a 300 ton per hour natural gas fired rotary dryer as well as twelve high capacity screeners.  Our railyard at Barron consists of 18 spur tracks and is capable of storing up to 650 railcars.
 Our location on the CN rail spur allows us to offer direct access to oil and gas shale plays in northwestern Canada and the northeastern United States, including the Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin, the Marcellus Shale, and the Utica Shale plays.  The CN also presents us with access to the southern United States as well as the port of New Orleans, which provides us access to emerging oil and gas markets in Latin America.
 The Barron facility houses our technology-driven proppant (SandGuard™) production circuits.  In late 2015, we installed equipment that applies coating material for our SandGuard™ product.
 For the year ended December 31, 2018, our Barron facility produced 1.6 million tons of northern white sand.
 13


New Auburn
 Our New Auburn dry plant is located in Barron County, Wisconsin, 12 miles from our Auburn mine.  The facility is on 37 acres that we own in the village of New Auburn, Wisconsin along a short line that connects with the mainline of the UP railway.  Our New Auburn dry plant is an enclosed facility that has a rated production capacity of 4,400 tons per day year-round regardless of weather conditions, and has on-site railcar loading facilities capable of loading railcars.  Our current air permit allows us to produce up to 1.4 million tons per year of finished product.  The facility has a 175 ton per hour natural gas fired fluid bed dryer as well as six screeners.  We have access to a segment of on-site rail track that is tied into a rail line owned by UP, and we use this rail space to stage and store empty or recently loaded customer railcars.
 For the year ended December 31, 2018, our New Auburn facility produced 1.0 million tons of northern white sand.  In May 2019, we idled our New Auburn plant but are currently operating the facility for limited production runs.  We also use the facility as a transload location to load dry sand from the Barron facility to the UP rail line.
 Oklahoma
 On May 11, 2018, we signed a 25-year lease for the mining rights to approximately 600 acres located in Kingfisher County, Oklahoma, about 60 miles northwest of Oklahoma City.  We purchased 40 acres of land adjoining the leased acreage on which to construct wet and dry processing plants expected to have a capacity of 1.5 million tons per year.  This facility will serve the Mid-Continent region.  Construction of the wet and dry processing plants is temporarily suspended due to cash flow restrictions from our lenders.  We are working with our lenders and hope to move ahead with this project.
Transportation Logistics and Infrastructure
 We sell our sand both free-on-board (“FOB”) at our plants as well as at transload facilities that are closer to the wellhead. For the year ended December 31, 2018, we sold 72% of our sand FOB plant and 28% FOB transload.  For the year ended December 31, 2017, we sold 56% of our sand FOB plant and 44% FOB transload.  At our Texas plants, orders are picked up by truck because most orders are transported 200 miles or less from our plant sites.  Because nearly all product from our Wisconsin plants is transported in excess of 200 miles and transportation costs typically represent more than 50% of our customers' overall cost for delivered northern white sand, the majority of our Wisconsin shipments are transported by rail to a transload and storage location in close proximity to the customer’s intended end use destination.
 While many of our customers continue to purchase FOB plant, we offer our customers a total supply chain solution pursuant to which we manage every aspect of the supply chain from mining and manufacturing to delivery within close proximity to the wellhead.  We have built a fleet of company-leased and customer-committed railcars, assembled a network of leased transload and terminal storage sites located near major shale plays, and designed a supply chain management system, all of which allow us to flexibly and efficiently coordinate rail, truck, and storage assets with customer order information.  As of December 31, 2018, we had a total of 5,186 railcars in our fleet, including 46 dedicated customer cars and 5,140 railcars under lease with a weighted average remaining term of 3.55 years.  As of December 31, 2018, we conducted business through 13 transload facilities in North America, of which six were under long term contracts.  These facilities are positioned to serve a number of our target markets.  However, with the market shift from northern white sand and terminal sales, we are having issues covering our fixed costs for railcars and transload facilities.  As part of our bankruptcy process, we rejected all railcar and select transload leases where we were paying above market rates or did not need access to the asset.  Additionally, we entered into new railcar leases on amended terms with three select railcar lessors.  We expect a significant reduction in the annual fixed costs from the rejection and where applicable re-negotiation of these leases.
 Transload Facilities
 14


Due to limited storage capacity at or near the wellhead, our customers generally find it impractical to store frac sand in large quantities immediately near their job sites.  We can service manifest rail deliveries or unit train shipments and minimize product fulfillment lead times through the simultaneous handling of multiple customers' railcars.  In order to continue to service the customer closer to the wellhead, we have assembled a network of transload facilities within a number of the major basins that we serve.  Below is a summary of the transload sites that we operate out of as of December 31, 2018.

Transload Location by Basin | Transload Sites as of December 31, 2018 | | Transload Sites Capable of Receiving Unit Trains | | 2018 Volume Sold (Thousands of Tons)

Permits
 In order to conduct our sand operations, we are required to obtain permits from various local and state governmental agencies.  The various permits we must obtain address such issues as mining, construction, air quality, water discharge, noise, dust, and reclamation.  Prior to receiving these permits, we must comply with the regulatory requirements imposed by the issuing governmental authority.  In some cases, we also must have certain plans pre-approved, such as site reclamation plans, prior to obtaining the required permits.  A decision by a governmental agency to deny or delay issuing a new or renewed permit or approval, or to revoke or substantially modify an existing permit or approval, could have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue operations at the affected facility.  Expansion of our existing operations also is predicated upon securing the necessary environmental and other permits and approvals.  We have obtained all permits required for the operation of our existing facilities.  We will also obtain permits necessary to process and distribute any new product, as might be required.
Intellectual Property
 Our intellectual property consists primarily of patents, trade secrets, know-how and products such as “SandGuard™”.  Typically, we utilize trade secrets to protect the formulations and processes we use to manufacture our products and to safeguard our proprietary formulations and methods.  In early 2016, we launched our self-suspending sand marketed under the brand SandMaxX™.  This new technology offered the potential to increase production in oil and gas wells in addition to improving pump time and reducing other upfront costs.  Trial wells proved that the technology is effective down-hole, but the customer adoption rate was slower than initially anticipated.  Under the contract, we had the option to continue ownership of this technology after the initial installment period (which expired on May 25, 2018) by payment of significant additional funds.  Given the lack of market acceptance for SandMaxX™ proppant, even after considerable efforts to market the product, we elected to discontinue ownership of the intellectual property after the initial installment period.  Thus, we released all patents related to this technology in 2018.
Customers
 We sell substantially all of our sand to customers in the oil and gas proppants market.  Our customers include major oilfield services companies as well as exploration and production companies that are engaged in hydraulic fracturing.  Sales to the oil and gas proppants market comprised of 94% of our total sales in 2018; non-frac sand sales, which consists of sales to customers in the sport sands, construction, and foundry industries, accounted for 6% of our total sales in 2018.
 15


In 2018, total sales to customers under long-term contracts, including take-or-pay, fixed-volume, and efforts-based contracts, accounted for 60% of our total sales. As of December 31, 2018, we had 4.2 million tons under long-term contract with a weighted average remaining term of 2.1 years.  
 For the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, our top two customers, Liberty Oilfield Services and EP Energy Corporation, collectively accounted for 38% and 35% of our total revenues from continuing operations, respectively.  However, in March 2019 we sued EP Energy Corporation for failure to purchase minimum contract volumes under a sand supply agreement with us.  As a result, we no longer sell product to EP Energy Corporation.  As of December 31, 2018, we have fully reserved our exposure and do not expect to have exposure on a go forward basis. 
 Suppliers and Service Providers
 Our major vendors are rail providers, railcar lessors, mine operators, transloads, utilities providers and truckers.  We depend on our suppliers at multiple Class 1 rail lines to transport frac sand produced at our Wisconsin plants to our customers, whose operations are located across several oil and gas-producing regions in North America.  Given high trucking costs for shipping frac sand beyond a 200-mile radius, rail is the most competitive mode of transportation for our Wisconsin operations.  We work directly with the UP, CN, and BNSF railroads on an ongoing basis to determine the best origin and destination pairings for our customers.  We can experience periods of temporary service disruptions from our rail partners due to weather or their rail network issues.  We have strong relationships with these rail providers, and we work closely with the railroads to minimize service disruptions when they occur.
Competition
 The frac sand market is a highly competitive market that is comprised of a small number of large, national producers, which we also refer to as “Tier 1” producers, and a larger number of small, regional, or local producers.  Competition in the frac sand industry has increased recently, and we expect competition to increase in the future as new entrants began operations in 2018 with local, in-basin sand mines.  Suppliers compete based on price, consistency, quality of product, site location, distribution capability, customer service, reliability of supply, breadth of product offering and technical support.
 Based on management’s internal estimates, we believe we were one of the top producers of frac sand in 2018 by production capacity and sales volumes, together with U.S. Silica Holdings, Inc., Hi-Crush Proppants LLC, and Covia Holdings Corporation.  In recent years there has also been an increase in the number of small producers servicing the frac sand market due to increased demand for hydraulic fracturing services and related proppant supplies.
 Seasonality
 At our Wisconsin operations, it is challenging to process raw sand during prolonged sub-zero temperatures; therefore, frac sand is typically water-washed only eight months of the year at our Wisconsin operations.  This results in a seasonal build-up of inventory as we excavate excess sand to build a stockpile to feed the dry plants during the winter months, causing the average inventory balances to increase from a few weeks in early spring to more than 100 days in early winter.  These seasonal variations in inventory balance affect our cash flow.  We may also sell frac sand for use in oil and gas basins where severe winter weather conditions may curtail drilling activities, and, as a result, our sales volumes to those areas may be adversely affected.  For example, we could experience a decline in both volumes sold and income for the second quarter relative to the first quarter each year due to seasonality of frac sand sales into western Canada because sales volumes are generally lower during April and May due to limited drilling activity resulting from that region’s annual thaw.
Insurance
 We believe that our insurance coverage is customary for the industries in which we operate and adequate for our business.  We periodically review insurance plans to address most, but not all, of the risks against our business.  Losses and liabilities not covered by insurance would increase our costs.  To address the hazards inherent in our business, we maintain insurance coverage that includes physical damage coverage, third-party general liability insurance, employer’s liability, environmental and pollution and other coverage, although coverage for environmental and pollution-related losses is subject to significant limitations.
Environmental and Occupational Health and Safety Regulations
 16


We are subject to stringent and complex federal, state and local laws and regulations governing the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to protection of worker health, safety and the environment.  Compliance with these environmental laws and regulations may expose us to significant costs and liabilities and cause us to incur significant capital expenditures in our operations.  We are often obligated to obtain permits or approvals in our operations from various federal, state and local authorities.  These permits and approvals can be denied or delayed, which may cause us to lose potential and current customers, interrupt our operations and limit our growth and revenue.  Moreover, failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative, civil and criminal penalties, imposition of remedial obligations, and the issuance of injunctions delaying or prohibiting operations.  Private parties may also have the right to pursue legal actions to enforce compliance as well as to seek damages for non-compliance with environmental laws and regulations or for personal injury or property damage.
 We do not believe that compliance with federal, state or local environmental laws and regulations will have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position or results of operations or cash flows.  However, we cannot assure that future events, such as changes in existing laws or enforcement policies, the promulgation of new laws or regulations or the development or discovery of new facts or conditions adverse to our operations will not cause us to incur significant costs.  The following is a discussion of material environmental and worker health and safety laws that relate to our operations.
 Mining and Workplace Safety.    Our sand mining operations are subject to mining safety regulation.  MSHA is the primary regulatory organization governing the frac sand industry.  Accordingly, MSHA regulates quarries, surface mines, underground mines and the industrial mineral processing facilities associated with quarries and mines.  The mission of MSHA is to administer the provisions of the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977 and to enforce compliance with mandatory worker safety and health standards.  MSHA works closely with the Industrial Minerals Association, a trade association in which we have a significant leadership role, in pursuing this mission.  As part of MSHA’s oversight, representatives perform at least two unannounced inspections annually for each aboveground facility.
 We also are subject to the requirements of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Act (“OSHA”), and comparable state statutes that regulate the protection of the health and safety of workers.  In addition, the OSHA Hazard Communication Standard requires that information be maintained about hazardous materials used or produced in operations and that this information be provided to employees, state and local government authorities and the public.  OSHA regulates the customers and users of frac sand and provides detailed regulations requiring employers to protect employees from overexposure to silica through the enforcement of permissible exposure limits and the OSHA Hazard Communication Standard.  In March 2016, OSHA published a final rule establishing a more stringent permissible exposure limit for exposure to respirable crystalline silica and other provisions to protect employee, such as requirements for exposure assessment, methods for controlling exposure, respiratory protection, medical surveillance, hazard communication, and recordkeeping.  This final rule became effective in June 2016, with compliance required by September 2017 for the construction industry and June 2018 for general industry and maritime.  For operations in the oil and gas industry, compliance was required by June 2018, except for engineering controls, which have a compliance date of June 2021.
 Air emissions.    Our operations are subject to the Clean Air Act, as amended (the “CAA”), and comparable state and local laws that restrict the emission of air pollutants from certain sources and also impose various monitoring and reporting obligations.  Compliance with these laws and regulations may require us to obtain pre-approval for the construction or modification of certain projects or facilities expected to produce or significantly increase air emissions, obtain and strictly comply with stringent air emissions permit requirements or utilize specific equipment or technologies to control emissions.  Obtaining air emissions permits has the potential to delay the development or continued performance of our operations.  Over the next several years, we may be required to incur certain capital expenditures for air pollution control equipment or to address other air emissions-related issues such as, by way of example, the capture of increased amounts of fine sands matter emitted from produced sands.  In addition, air permits are required for our frac sand mining operations that result in the emission of regulated air contaminants.  These permits incorporate the various control technology requirements that apply to our operations and are subject to extensive review and periodic renewal.  Any future changes to existing requirements, non-compliance, or failure to maintain necessary permits or other authorizations could require us to incur substantial costs or suspend or terminate our operations.
 17


In August 2012, the EPA published final rules that established new air emission controls and practices for oil and natural gas production wells, including wells that are the subject of hydraulic fracturing operations and natural gas processing operations.  The EPA later updated its storage tank standards in August 2013, to phase in emission controls more gradually.  In May 2016, the EPA finalized additional regulations to control emissions of methane and volatile organic compounds from the oil and natural gas sector.  In April 2017, the EPA announced that it would review such regulations, and in December 2017, the EPA issued a final rule that would stay its methane rule for two years. In September 2018, the EPA issued proposed revisions to its methane regulations, which, if finalized, would reduce certain obligations thereunder.  Compliance with these rules could result in significant costs to our customers, which may have an indirect adverse impact on our business.
 There can be no assurance that future requirements compelling the installation of more sophisticated emission control equipment would not have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.
 Climate change.    In recent years, the U.S. Congress has considered legislation to reduce emissions of GHGs.  It presently appears unlikely that comprehensive climate change legislation will be passed by either house of Congress in the near future, although energy legislation and other regulatory initiatives are expected to be proposed that may be relevant to GHG emissions issues.  In addition, almost half of the states have begun to address GHG emissions, primarily through the planned development of emission inventories or regional GHG cap and trade programs.  Depending on the particular program, we could be required to control GHG emissions or to purchase and surrender allowances for GHG emissions resulting from our operations.
 Independent of Congress, the EPA has adopted regulations controlling GHG emissions under its existing authority under the CAA.  For example, the EPA has adopted rules requiring the reporting of GHG emissions in the United States for emissions from specified large GHG emission sources.  The EPA also has adopted rules establishing construction and operating permit requirements for certain large stationary sources of GHG emissions that are already potential major sources of criteria pollutants.
 Although it is not currently possible to predict how any such proposed or future GHG legislation or regulation by Congress, the EPA, the states or multi-state regions will impact our business, any legislation or regulation of GHG emissions that may be imposed in areas in which we conduct business could result in increased compliance costs or additional operating restrictions or reduced demand for our services, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
 Further, in December 2015, over 190 countries, including the United States, reached an agreement to reduce global GHG emissions. The agreement entered into force in November 2016 after more than 70 countries, including the United States, ratified or otherwise consented to be bound by the agreement.  In June 2017, President Trump stated that the United States would withdraw from the agreement, but may enter into a future international agreement related to GHGs on different terms.  The agreement provides for a four-year exit process beginning when it took effect in November 2016, which would result in an effective exit date of November 2020.  The United States’ adherence to the exit process is uncertain and/or the terms on which the United States may reenter the agreement or a separately negotiated agreement are unclear at this time.  To the extent the United States or any other country implement this agreement or impose other climate change regulations on the oil and gas industry, it could have an adverse direct or indirect effect on our business.
 Water discharge.    The Clean Water Act, as amended (the “CWA”), and analogous state laws impose restrictions and strict controls with respect to the discharge of pollutants, including spills and leaks of oil and other substances, into regulated waters.  The discharge of pollutants into regulated waters is prohibited, except in accordance with the terms of a permit issued by the EPA or an analogous state agency.  The CWA and regulations implemented thereunder also prohibit the discharge of dredge and fill material into regulated waters, including jurisdictional wetlands, unless authorized by an appropriately issued permit.  The CWA also requires the development and implementation of spill prevention, control and countermeasures, including the construction and maintenance of containment berms and similar structures, if required, to help prevent the contamination of regulated waters in the event of a petroleum hydrocarbon tank spill, rupture or leak at such facilities.  In addition, the CWA and analogous state laws require individual permits or coverage under general permits for discharges of storm water runoff from certain types of facilities.  Federal and state regulatory agencies can impose administrative, civil and criminal penalties as well as other enforcement mechanisms for non-compliance with discharge permits or other requirements of the CWA and analogous state laws and regulations.

Safe Drinking Water Act.   Although we do not directly engage in hydraulic fracturing activities, our customers purchase our frac sand for use in their hydraulic fracturing operations.  Hydraulic fracturing involves the injection of water, sand and chemicals under pressure into the formation to stimulate oil and natural gas production.  Legislation to amend the Safe Drinking Water Act (the “SDWA”) to repeal the exemption for hydraulic fracturing from the definition of “underground injection” and require federal permitting and regulatory control of hydraulic fracturing, as well as legislative proposals to require disclosure of the chemical constituents of the fluids used in the fracturing process have been proposed in recent sessions of Congress.  We cannot predict whether any such legislation will ever be enacted and, if so, what its provisions would be.  Scrutiny of hydraulic fracturing activities continues in other ways, with the EPA having released a final report regarding the impacts of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water resources in 2016.  The report concluded that certain activities associated with hydraulic fracturing may impact drinking water resources under certain circumstances.  In addition, the U.S. Department of Energy released a series of recommendations for improving the safety of the process in 2011.  Further, the EPA and the U.S. Department of the Interior (the “DOI”) have adopted new regulations for certain aspects of the process. For example, the EPA finalized effluent limitations for the treatment and discharge of wastewater resulting from hydraulic fracturing.  The DOI adopted rules that require disclosure of chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing activities upon federal and Indian lands and also strengthened standards for well-bore integrity and the management of fluids that return to the surface during and after fracturing operations on federal and Indian lands.  However, in December 2017, the DOI rescinded its rule regulating hydraulic fracturing activities on federal and Indian lands.  At the state level, some states, including Texas, have adopted, and other states are considering adopting, legal requirements that could impose more stringent permitting, public disclosure or well construction requirements on hydraulic fracturing activities.  If additional levels of regulation and permits were required through the adoption of new laws and regulations at the federal or state level, that could lead to delays, increased operating costs and process prohibitions that could make it more difficult to complete natural oil and gas wells in shale formations, increasing our customers' costs of compliance and doing business and otherwise adversely affect the hydraulic fracturing services they perform, which could negatively impact demand for our frac sand products.  In addition, heightened political, regulatory and public scrutiny of hydraulic fracturing practices could potentially expose us or our customers to increased legal and regulatory proceedings, and any such proceedings could be time-consuming, costly or result in substantial legal liability or significant reputational harm.  Any such developments could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, whether directly or indirectly.  For example, we could be directly affected by adverse litigation involving us, or indirectly affected if the cost of compliance limits the ability of our customers to operate in the geographic areas we serve.
 Solid waste.    The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, as amended (the “RCRA”), and comparable state laws control the generation, storage, treatment, transfer and disposal of hazardous and non-hazardous waste.  The EPA and various state agencies have limited the approved methods of disposal for these types of wastes.  In the course of our operations, we generate waste that may be regulated as non-hazardous wastes or even hazardous wastes, obligating us to comply with applicable RCRA standards relating to the management and disposal of such wastes.
 Site remediation.    The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, as amended (“CERCLA”), and comparable state laws impose strict, joint and several liability without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct on certain classes of persons that contributed to the release of a hazardous substance into the environment.  These persons include the owner and operator of a disposal site where a hazardous substance release occurred and any company that transported, disposed of, or arranged for the transport or disposal of hazardous substances released at the site.  Under CERCLA, such persons may be liable for the costs of remediating the hazardous substances that have been released into the environment, for damages to natural resources, and for the costs of certain health studies.  In addition, where contamination may be present, it is not uncommon for the neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury, property damage and recovery of response costs.  On November 21, 2013, the EPA issued a General Notice Letter and Information Request (“Notice”) under Section 104(e) of CERCLA to one of our former subsidiaries.  The Notice provides that the subsidiary may have incurred liability with respect to the Reef Environmental site in Alabama, and requested certain information in accordance with Section 107(a) of CERCLA.  At this time, no specific claim for cost recovery has been made by the EPA (or any other potentially responsible party) against the Partnership.  There is uncertainty relating to our share of environmental remediation liability, if any, because our allocable share of wastewater is unknown and the total remediation cost is also unknown.  Consequently, management is unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss, if any.  We have not recorded a loss contingency accrual in our financial statements.  In the opinion of management, the outcome of such matters will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, liquidity, or results of operations.
 The soil and groundwater associated with and adjacent to our former Dallas-Fort Worth terminal property have been affected by prior releases of petroleum products or other contaminants.  A past owner and operator of the terminal property, ConocoPhillips, has been working with TCEQ to address this contamination.  We, ConocoPhillips and owners and operators of adjacent industrial properties 
 19


undertaking unrelated remediation obtained a Municipal Setting Designation (“MSD”) from the City of Fort Worth, which is an ordinance prohibiting the use of groundwater as drinking water in the area of our former terminal property.  Following the certification of this MSD by the TCEQ, ConocoPhillips obtained approval of a remedial action plan for the property, which now only requires recordation of a restrictive covenant to comply with the TCEQ requirements.  In connection with the sale of this facility, we have agreed to hold our successor harmless from any claims arising from this contamination, none of which has been asserted to our knowledge.  We do not believe this former facility is likely to present any material liability to us.
 Endangered Species.    The Endangered Species Act (“ESA”), restricts activities that may affect endangered or threatened species or their habitats.  The designation of certain species has not caused us to incur material costs or become subject to operating restrictions or bans.  However, the designation of previously unidentified endangered or threatened species could cause us to incur additional costs or become subject to operating restrictions or bans or limit future development activity in the affected areas.  Moreover, as a result of a settlement approved by the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia in September 2011, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is required to consider listing more than 250 species as endangered under the Endangered Species Act.  Under the September 2011 settlement, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (“FWS”) is required to review and address the needs of more than 250 species on the candidate list before the completion of the agency’s 2017 fiscal year.  The FWS did not meet that deadline.  The designation of previously unprotected species as threatened or endangered in areas where our exploration and production customers operate could cause us or our customers to incur increased costs arising from species protection measures and could result in delays or limitations in our customers' performance of operations, which could reduce demand for our services.
 Local regulation.    As demand for frac sand in the oil and natural gas industry has driven a significant increase in current and expected future production of frac sand, some local communities have expressed concern regarding silica sand mining operations.  These concerns have generally included exposure to ambient silica sand dust, truck traffic, water usage and blasting.  In response, certain state and local communities have developed or are in the process of developing regulations or zoning restrictions intended to minimize dust from becoming airborne, control the flow of truck traffic, significantly curtail the amount of practicable area for mining activities, provide compensation to local residents for potential impacts of mining activities and, in some cases, ban issuance of new permits for mining activities.  To date, we have not experienced any material impact to our existing mining operations or planned capacity expansions as a result of these types of concerns.  We are not aware of any proposals for significant increased scrutiny on the part of state or local regulators in the jurisdictions in which we operate or community concerns with respect to our operations that would reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations going forward.
 Employees
 We have no employees.  All of our management, administrative and operating functions are performed by employees of Emerge Energy Services GP, LLC, which is our general partner.  As of December 31, 2018, our general partner employed 279 full-time employees who provide these services for us.  None of these employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements.  We consider our employee relations to be good.
