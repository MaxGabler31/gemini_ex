Item 1. Business.
Introduction
 
GTY was formed as a blank check company incorporated on August 11, 2016 as a Cayman Islands exempted company formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses (the “business combination”). Until the consummation of the business combination, GTY did not engage in any operations nor generated any revenue.
 
On November 1, 2016, GTY consummated its initial public offering (the “initial public offering”) of 55,200,000 units (the “units”), including the issuance of 7,200,000 units as a result of the underwriters’ exercise of their over-allotment option in full. Each unit consisted of one Class A ordinary share and one-third of one warrant. Each whole warrant entitled the holder thereof to purchase one Class A ordinary share at a price of $11.50 per share. The units were sold at an offering price of $10.00 per unit, generating gross proceeds, before expenses, of $552 million. Prior to the consummation of the initial public offering, in August, 2016, the Sponsor purchased 8,625,000 Class B ordinary shares (the “founder shares”) for an aggregate purchase price of $25,000, or approximately $0.002 per share. On each of October 14 and October 26, 2016, GTY effected a share capitalization resulting in an aggregate of 11,500,000 and 13,800,000 founder shares outstanding, respectively. In October 2016, the Sponsor transferred 25,000 founder shares to each of GTY’s independent director nominees at the same per-share purchase price paid by the Sponsor.
 
Simultaneously with the closing of the initial public offering, GTY consummated the private placement (“private placement”) of 8,693,334 warrants (“private placement warrants”), each exercisable to purchase one Class A ordinary share at $11.50 per share, at a price of $1.50 per private placement warrant, with the Sponsor, generating gross proceeds of approximately $13.04 million.
 
Upon the closing of the initial public offering and private placement on November 1, 2016, $552 million from the net proceeds of the sale of the units in the initial public offering and the private placement was placed in a U.S.-based trust account maintained by Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, acting as trustee (the “Trust Account”).
 
Initially, GTY was required to complete its initial business combination by November 1, 2018, which was 24 months from the closing of its initial public offering. On October 30, 2018, GTY’s shareholders approved a proposal to amend GTY’s second amended and restated memorandum and articles of association to extend the date by which it had to consummate an initial business combination from November 1, 2018 to May 1, 2019. In connection with such proposal, GTY’s public shareholders had the right to elect to redeem their public shares for a per share price, payable in cash, based upon the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account. GTY’s public shareholders holding 34,011,538 Class A ordinary shares out of a total of 55,200,000 Class A ordinary shares validly elected to redeem their public shares and, accordingly, after giving effect to such redemptions, the balance in GTY’s Trust Account was approximately $216.8 million.
 ​
 On February 19, 2019, New GTY consummated the business combination (as defined below), pursuant to which New GTY acquired each of Bonfire Interactive Ltd. (“Bonfire”), CityBase, Inc. (“CityBase”), eCivis Inc. (“eCivis”), Open Counter Enterprises Inc. (“Open Counter”), Questica Inc. and Questica USCDN Inc. (together, “Questica”), and Sherpa Government Solutions LLC (“Sherpa”) (such acquisitions are collectively referred to as the “business combination”). In connection with the closing of the business combination (the “Closing”), pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “GTY Agreement”) between New GTY, GTY Technology Holdings Inc., a Cayman Islands exempted company and former parent of New GTY (“GTY”), and GTY Technology Merger Sub, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of New GTY (“GTY Merger Sub”), GTY Merger Sub merged with and into GTY, with GTY surviving the merger as a direct, wholly-owned subsidiary of New GTY, and in connection therewith New GTY changed its name from GTY Govtech, Inc. to GTY Technology Holdings Inc. (the “GTY Merger”).

Upon the Closing, all outstanding Class A ordinary shares were exchanged on a one-for-one basis for shares of New GTY common stock, and GTY’s outstanding warrants were assumed by New GTY and became exercisable for shares of New GTY common stock on the same terms as were contained in such warrants prior to the business combination. By operation of Rule 12g-3(a) under the Exchange Act, New GTY is the successor issuer to GTY and has succeeded to the attributes of GTY as the registrant, including GTY’s SEC file number 001-37931 and CIK Code 0001682325.
 
In connection with the business combination, 11,073,040 Class A ordinary shares were redeemed at a per share price of approximately $10.29. Upon the Closing, New GTY had 48,511,028 shares of common stock outstanding.
 
Upon the Closing, New GTY became a holding company whose assets primarily consist of shares of its wholly owned subsidiaries.
