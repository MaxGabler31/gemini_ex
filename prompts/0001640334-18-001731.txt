ITEM 1. BUSINESS.
Business Development.
 
Solar Quartz Technologies Corporation (“Company”) was incorporated in Colorado on June 21, 2010 as Vanguard Energy Corporation (“Vanguard”) and until June 2014 was involved in the exploration and development of oil and gas properties in southeast Texas. Vanguard was never able to earn a profit and in January of 2013 investigating began into the possibility of selling its oil and gas properties. The sale of these oil and gas properties represented the sale of substantially all of these assets in June 2014.
 
On July 1, 2017 the Company acquired all of the shares of Solar Quartz Technologies Limited, a company incorporated in New Zealand (“SQTNZ”). These shares were purchased from Solar Quartz Technologies, Inc. (“SQTI”). Subsequently the name was changed Solar Quartz Technologies Corporation in Colorado (on July 5, 2017) and with FINRA, and have also been cleared by FINRA to use the new trading symbol SQTX. During July 2017 the Company issued 213,402,755 new shares of common stock to SQTI in exchange for 122 (100%) of the common shares of SQTNZ. The issuance of these shares was equivalent to 95% of the Company’s shares issued, after the Company issues in the future an additional 10,021,224 shares of common stock to those holders of our common stock immediately prior to the acquisition. The Company does not anticipate any further reorganization of its common stock. The Company plans to apply to trade on the more senior OTCQX exchange or NASDAQ.
 
On August 19, 2014, a 100-for-1 reverse split of our common stock became effective. On July 1, 2017 the Company increased its authorized common shares to 500,000,000 and its authorized preferred shares to 10,000,000.
 
Current Business of the Company.
 
SQTNZ is a corporation that has had no prior business activity other than being the title owner of the exclusive mining and development rights for two High Purity Quartz (HPQ) Silica deposits known as Quartz Hill (represented by leases ML 30235, ML 30236 and ML 30237) and White Springs (represented by leases ML 30238 and ML 30239) located in North Queensland, Australia. Based on resource estimates prepared by I J M Wilson, ARMIT, MAIG, a qualified resource appraiser in Australia. The report is prepared in accordance with standards established by Australasian Code for Reporting of Exploration Results, Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves (JORC Code 204). Together they contain deposits of more than 15 million tons of 99% pure high purity quartz that is feedstock in high demand in the marketplace to be used in the production of high purity quartz sand according to independent professional reports. Based on preliminary, independent valuation studies, previously obtained offers for purchase of the raw materials and other considerations, the board of directors of the Company believes the net present value of the recoverable deposits to be $530 million. The valuation of these resources included consideration of the current market prices for the materials when mined and processed, the cost of mining the quartz deposits, mining recovery obligations, pre-processing and refining costs on a net present value basis.

High purity quartz sand is an essential primary material for the manufacture of: photo-voltaic (“PV”) solar panels; semiconductors; all high-end electronic products; fiber optical cables; halogen lamps; HD and LCD television screens; and epoxy mounding compounds.
 
The Company is currently seeking capital to build a stage one pre-processing plant to upgrade the High purity quartz sand to be salable as feedstock for numerous high-tech applications. The Company plans to build that plant in Townsville, Queensland, Australia, near the mine site, and a major port city where the upgraded product can easily be shipped to any user in the world. The current estimated cost of the facility, plus operating capital, is approximately $10 million to build and equip. Upon completion, that facility will be able to upgrade the raw quartz to a High purity quartz sand purity level that meets significant worldwide demand for use in the manufacture of PV solar panels, semiconductors and all high-end electronics.
 
Following the establishment of the pre-processing plant, we plan to build a further upgrading (stage two) facility to upgrade the feedstock from the pre-processing facility to high purity quartz sand, the highest quality quartz sand necessary for the manufacture of PV solar panels and high-end electronics, fiber optics, semiconductors and microchips. That facility will cost an additional $28 million to construct and equip it with necessary equipment including a “clean room” and commercial scale processing equipment. High purity quartz sand is an essential material for this process and the essential solar crucibles, as it shares the same element (Si) and is almost non-reactive, assuring high quality silicon ingots. Apart from this, high purity quartz also finds primary applications in advanced lighting, telecom, optic and microelectronics industries. High purity quartz sand powers are required for epoxy molding compound used in manufacture of most semiconductors, and the fast-growing auto electronics sector. 
 
Active discussions with potential end-user investor partners who can provide the funding for both facilities are ongoing.
