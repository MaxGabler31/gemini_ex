Summary Description of Chevron 
Chevron Corporation,* a Delaware corporation, manages its investments in subsidiaries and affiliates and provides administrative, financial, management and technology support to U.S. and international subsidiaries that engage in integrated energy and chemicals operations. Upstream operations consist primarily of exploring for, developing and producing crude oil and natural gas; processing, liquefaction, transportation and regasification associated with liquefied natural gas; transporting crude oil by major international oil export pipelines; transporting, storage and marketing of natural gas; and a gas-to-liquids plant. Downstream operations consist primarily of refining crude oil into petroleum products; marketing of crude oil and refined products; transporting crude oil and refined products by pipeline, marine vessel, motor equipment and rail car; and manufacturing and marketing of commodity petrochemicals, plastics for industrial uses and fuel and lubricant additives. 
A list of the company’s major subsidiaries is presented on page E-2. As of December 31, 2017, Chevron had approximately 51,900 employees (including about 3,300 service station employees). Approximately 25,200 employees (including about 3,100 service station employees), or 49 percent, were employed in U.S. operations. 
Overview of Petroleum Industry 
Petroleum industry operations and profitability are influenced by many factors. Prices for crude oil, natural gas, petroleum products and petrochemicals are generally determined by supply and demand. Production levels from the members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), Russia and the United States are the major factors in determining worldwide supply. Demand for crude oil and its products and for natural gas is largely driven by the conditions of local, national and global economies, although weather patterns and taxation relative to other energy sources also play a significant part. Laws and governmental policies, particularly in the areas of taxation, energy and the environment, affect where and how companies conduct their operations and formulate their products and, in some cases, limit their profits directly.
Strong competition exists in all sectors of the petroleum and petrochemical industries in supplying the energy, fuel and chemical needs of industry and individual consumers. Chevron competes with fully integrated, major global petroleum companies, as well as independent and national petroleum companies, for the acquisition of crude oil and natural gas leases and other properties and for the equipment and labor required to develop and operate those properties. In its downstream business, Chevron competes with fully integrated, major petroleum companies, as well as independent refining, marketing, transportation and chemicals entities and national petroleum companies, in the sale or acquisition of various goods or services in many national and international markets.

Net Production of Liquids and Natural Gas
The following table summarizes the net production of liquids and natural gas for 2017 and 2016 by the company and its affiliates. Worldwide oil-equivalent production of 2.728 million barrels per day in 2017 was up 5 percent from 2016. Production increases from major capital projects, base business, and shale and tight properties, were partially offset by production entitlement effects in several locations, normal field declines, and the impact of asset sales. Refer to the “Results of Operations” section beginning on page 34 for a detailed discussion of the factors explaining the 2015 through 2017 changes in production for crude oil and natural gas liquids, and natural gas, and refer to Table V on pages 98 and 99 for information on annual production by geographical region.

Delivery Commitments
The company sells crude oil and natural gas from its producing operations under a variety of contractual obligations. Most contracts generally commit the company to sell quantities based on production from specified properties, but some natural gas sales contracts specify delivery of fixed and determinable quantities, as discussed below. 
In the United States, the company is contractually committed to deliver 151 billion cubic feet of natural gas to third parties from 2018 through 2020. The company believes it can satisfy these contracts through a combination of equity production from the company’s proved developed U.S. reserves and third-party purchases. These commitments are all based on contracts with indexed pricing terms. 
6

Outside the United States, the company is contractually committed to deliver a total of 2,380 billion cubic feet of natural gas to third parties from 2018 through 2020 from operations in Australia, Colombia, Denmark, Indonesia and the Philippines. These sales contracts contain variable pricing formulas that are generally referenced to the prevailing market price for crude oil, natural gas or other petroleum products at the time of delivery. The company believes it can satisfy these contracts from quantities available from production of the company’s proved developed reserves in these countries.

Review of Ongoing Exploration and Production Activities in Key Areas 
Chevron has exploration and production activities in most of the world's major hydrocarbon basins. Chevron’s 2017 key upstream activities, some of which are also discussed in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, beginning on page 34, are presented below. The comments include references to “total production” and “net production,” which are defined under “Production” in Exhibit 99.1 on page E-8. 
The discussion that follows references the status of proved reserves recognition for significant long-lead-time projects not on production as well as for projects recently placed on production. Reserves are not discussed for exploration activities or recent discoveries that have not advanced to a project stage, or for mature areas of production that do not have individual projects requiring significant levels of capital or exploratory investment. Amounts indicated for project costs represent total project costs, not the company’s share of costs for projects that are less than wholly owned. 
United States
Upstream activities in the United States are primarily located in the midcontinent region, the Gulf of Mexico, California and the Appalachian Basin. Net oil-equivalent production in the United States during 2017 averaged 681,000 barrels per day. 
The company's activities in the midcontinent region are primarily in Colorado, New Mexico and Texas. During 2017, net daily production in these areas averaged 134,000 barrels of crude oil, 505 million cubic feet of natural gas and 50,000 barrels of natural gas liquids (NGLs). In 2017, the company divested properties in areas including Colorado, New Mexico, Oklahoma and Texas. The company is pursuing selected opportunities and actively transacting to create value.
In the Permian Basin of West Texas and southeast New Mexico, the company holds approximately 500,000 and 1,200,000 net acres of shale and tight resources in the Midland and Delaware basins, respectively. This acreage includes multiple stacked formations that enable production from several layers of rock in different geologic zones. The stacked plays multiply the basin’s resource and economic potential by allowing for multiple horizontal wells to be developed from a single pad location using shared facilities and infrastructure, which reduces development costs and improves capital efficiency. Chevron has implemented a factory development strategy in the basin, which utilizes multiwell pads to drill a series of horizontal wells that are completed concurrently using hydraulic fracture stimulation. In 2017, the company deployed a new basis of design, resulting in improved economics. The company is also applying data analytics and petrophysical technology on its Permian well information to drive improvements in well targets and performance. The company drilled 130 wells and participated in 180 nonoperated wells in the Midland and Delaware basins in 2017.
During 2017, net daily production in the Gulf of Mexico averaged 165,000 barrels of crude oil, 122 million cubic feet of natural gas and 13,000 barrels of NGLs. In 2017, the company divested its remaining operated offshore assets in the shelf area. All remaining shelf assets are non-operated interests. Chevron is also engaged in various exploration, development and production activities in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. 
The deepwater Jack and St. Malo fields are being jointly developed with a host floating production unit (FPU) located between the two fields. Chevron has a 50 percent interest in the Jack Field and a 51 percent interest in the St. Malo Field. Both fields are company operated. The company has a 40.6 percent interest in the production host facility, which is designed to accommodate production from the Jack/St. Malo development and third-party tiebacks. Total daily production from the Jack and St. Malo fields in 2017 averaged 116,000 barrels of liquids (59,000 net) and 18 million cubic feet of natural gas (9 million net). Production ramp-up and development drilling for the first development phase was completed in 2017. In addition, development drilling continued on Stage 2, the second phase of the development plan, with three of the four planned wells completed. Stage 3 includes three additional development wells. Stage 3 drilling began in second quarter 2017; execution is expected to continue in 2018. Proved reserves have been recognized for these phases. Production from the Jack/St. Malo development is expected to ramp up to a total daily rate of 142,000 barrels of crude oil and 36 million cubic feet of natural gas. The Jack and St. Malo fields have an estimated remaining production life of 30 years.
At the 58 percent-owned and operated deepwater Tahiti Field, net daily production averaged 45,000 barrels of crude oil, 18 million cubic feet of natural gas, and 3,000 barrels of NGLs. Infill drilling continued in 2017. The Tahiti Vertical Expansion Project is the next development phase of the Tahiti Field, developing shallower reservoirs and encompassing four new wells and associated subsea infrastructure. All wells have been drilled, and facility installation work has commenced. First oil is expected in second-half 2018. Proved reserves have been recognized for this project. The Tahiti Field has an estimated production life of at least 20 years.
The company has a 15.6 percent nonoperated working interest in the deepwater Mad Dog Field. In 2017, net daily production averaged 8,000 barrels of liquids and 1 million cubic feet of natural gas. The next development phase, the Mad Dog 2 Project, is planned to develop the southwestern extension of the Mad Dog Field. The development plan includes a new 
8

floating production platform with a design capacity of 140,000 barrels of crude oil per day. A final investment decision was reached in February 2017. First oil is expected in 2021. At the end of 2017, proved reserves have been recognized for the Mad Dog 2 Project.
The development plan for the 60 percent-owned and operated deepwater Big Foot Project includes a 15-slot drilling and production tension leg platform (TLP) with water injection facilities and a design capacity of 75,000 barrels of crude oil and 25 million cubic feet of natural gas per day. The TLP has been moored in its final location; installation is expected to be completed in second quarter 2018. First oil is expected in late 2018. The field has an estimated production life of 35 years from the time of start-up. Proved reserves have been recognized for this project.
Chevron holds a 25 percent nonoperated working interest in the Stampede Project, the unitized development of the deepwater Knotty Head and Pony discoveries. The planned facilities have a design capacity of 80,000 barrels of crude oil and 40 million cubic feet of natural gas per day. Installation of the TLP and subsea infrastructure was completed in 2017, with first oil achieved in January 2018. The field has an estimated production life of 30 years from the time of start-up. Proved reserves have been recognized for this project.
During 2017 and early 2018, the company participated in two appraisal wells and four exploration wells in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. Chevron has operated working interests of 55 to 61.3 percent in the blocks containing the Anchor Field.
