ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Our Company
We are the leading cloud-based platform provider for the mortgage finance industry. Our technology solutions are used by lenders to originate and close residential mortgage loans. At December 31, 2018, approximately 186,500 mortgage professionals used our Encompass digital lending platform (“Encompass”) for their mortgage management solution.
Encompass is a comprehensive, end-to-end enterprise solution that handles most of the functions involved in running the business of originating mortgages including: marketing; lead management; loan origination; loan processing; underwriting; preparation of mortgage applications, disclosure documents, and closing documents; funding and closing the loan for the borrower; compliance with regulatory and investor requirements and overall enterprise management that provides one system of record for mortgage loans. Delivery of Encompass as an on-demand Software-as-a-Service (“SaaS”) solution provides customers with the added benefits of lower upfront implementation costs and reduced need for an infrastructure of servers, storage and network devices as well as the staff needed to support the infrastructure. SaaS delivery of Encompass enables access to the most current version of our software, including periodic upgrades and regulatory updates. We also host the Ellie Mae Network, a proprietary electronic platform that allows Encompass users to conduct electronic business transactions with service providers as well as mortgage investors (also referred to as “investors”) and lenders in order to process and fund loans. The Ellie Mae Network allows these service providers, investors and lenders to digitally integrate their services with Encompass to seamlessly conduct business with mortgage origination professionals using Encompass.
We also offer Encompass users a variety of other on-demand software services delivered within Encompass which are discussed below in our Products and Services overview.

Mortgage Industry Overview
Overview of Mortgage Origination Market
Mortgage originators typically advise borrowers, process loan files, collect, and verify the property and borrower data upon which lending decisions are based and, in the majority of cases, fund and close mortgage loans. According to data available pursuant to the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (“HMDA”), there were approximately 6,000(1) mortgage lenders in 2017 in the United States, including national banks, regional banks, non-bank lenders, and credit unions. 
Based on estimates provided by the Mortgage Bankers Association, there were $1.6 trillion(2), $1.7 trillion, $2.1 trillion, $1.7 trillion and $1.3 trillion in loans originated for 1- to 4-family homes during the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
The Mortgage Origination Process
Originating a residential mortgage involves multiple parties and requires a complex series of data-laden transactions that must be handled accurately under tight time constraints. By the time a mortgage has been funded, the typical loan package contains over one thousand pages of documents that come from over a dozen different entities, usually operating on disparate technology systems and databases. Traditionally, much of the data used to prepare these documents has been gathered manually, rather than electronically, with documents exchanged among the many participants by facsimile, courier or mail. The entire process results in significant duplicative efforts, time delays, errors, costs, and redundant paper documentation, and can expose borrower data to potential privacy and security breaches.

The following diagram of the mortgage origination process provides a framework for understanding the complexity and inefficiency of the process and the need for automated solutions:
In addition to the challenges involved in processing loans, mortgage originators must satisfy a multitude of federal, state and local regulations, and address basic business needs, including marketing, sales, product fulfillment, customer support, reporting, and general management functions. Historically, most mortgage originators have operated their businesses using separate task-specific software applications that were interconnected, if at all, through customized integrations. This often resulted in constraints on effective collaboration among operating departments, limited ability to monitor the business comprehensively, increased risk of error due to inconsistent data, failure to incorporate current regulations into work flows, inadequate security and control over the process, and expensive technical integration and maintenance costs.
Recent Mortgage Industry Trends and Developments
The residential mortgage industry continues to evolve and undergo significant changes. The following major trends are currently impacting the residential mortgage industry.
Greater Focus on Operational Efficiencies. The average total production cost per loan was $8,174 in the third quarter of 2018(3). We expect operational costs to continue to be a significant consideration for mortgage originators due to the continuously changing regulatory environment and heightened quality standards. As a result, mortgage originators have sought to increase their efficiency and reduce fixed expenses, leading them to explore technology solutions to automate their business processes as well as methods to avoid or reduce expenses that are not tied to revenue generating activities.
Customers Adopting Multi-Channel Strategies. Customers are developing multi-channel strategies beyond a single retail, correspondent, or wholesale mortgage lending channel in order to grow their businesses. The requirements of these different channels vary, and in order to maintain a single operating system, customers must use a robust system with customizable functionality.

Changes in Regulations Affecting Lenders and Investors. Mortgage lending regulations continue to change and many regulatory reforms have been introduced or proposed in recent years to promote increased underwriting standards and accountability by lenders and mortgage originators, ensure meaningful disclosures by lenders to borrowers, increase the transparency and objectivity of settlement services, and protect consumers in the mortgage market from unfair or abusive lending practices. These changes have complicated the mortgage origination process and increased the amount of documentation required to originate and fund residential mortgages. We have made and expect to continue to make significant investments in our products and services to address statutory and regulatory changes.
Consumer Demand for a Digital Based Experience from Lenders. Today’s borrowers expect transparency, service and speed, and a human touch. To meet these requirements, lenders must offer a seamless, online experience that continues even after the application has been submitted. Lenders should have access to current and historical data on every individual borrower, and provide an intuitive borrower portal that offers a simple, transparent interaction, the ability to easily upload documents, and real-time status updates.
Increased Quality Standards Imposed by Regulators, Lenders, and Investors. Lenders have eliminated many high-risk loan product offerings and significantly tightened underwriting and processing requirements. Similarly, investors seek higher-quality, lower-risk loans in which to invest. Consistent with these tightened standards and expectations, lenders and investors are demanding increased levels of documentation of the data upon which a lending decision will be based, increased use of third-party services to obtain unbiased and independent verification of borrowers’ creditworthiness, greater proof of the adequacy of the collateral securing mortgages, and strict compliance with regulatory requirements. This trend further increases the amount of documentation and the number of services required to originate and fund residential mortgages. Increased enforcement by federal and state regulators continues to encourage mortgage originators to explore technology solutions that provide adequate controls and policy enforcement to facilitate the origination of compliant loans.
Greater focus by customers and regulators on data security and consumer privacy. Recent high-profile data security incidents affecting banking institutions and their third-party service providers have resulted in an increased focus on data security by our customers and our customers’ regulators. We expect the industry focus on data security to continue to increase as companies generate greater amounts of data and as future data security incidents occur.
Our Strategy
Our mission is to be the industry standard platform for residential mortgage origination in the United States. Key elements of our strategy include:
Increase the number of lenders using Encompass and the number of loans originated on our platform.  We continue to focus our marketing, sales and product development efforts on increasing the number of mortgage lenders, commercial banks and credit unions using Encompass and our additional services, and the number of loans originated on our platform. We intend to continue to focus our efforts on all market segments, including the largest, or enterprise segment, of the lending industry.
Increase adoption and utilization of our solutions and services. We encourage increased customer adoption and utilization of the various products and services we currently offer, such as customer relationship and lead management, document preparation, compliance services, and product and pricing services. As our customers opt for supplemental on-demand software and services, we generate additional revenues, and continue to drive additional revenues per loan originated on Encompass.
Create a true digital mortgage platform. We continue to expand into a more complete digital mortgage strategy to benefit our customers. It is our goal to provide a true digital mortgage process that enables the lender to originate more loans, lower origination costs, reduce the time to close and make smarter decisions through data and predictive analytics, all while ensuring the highest levels of compliance, quality and efficiency. 
Invest in new product and platform development.  We are investing in the development of the next generation of the Encompass Digital Lending Platform, as well as the Encompass Connect solutions, each of which is built on the new Encompass Digital Lending Platform and utilizes Application Program Interfaces (“APIs”) to offer unique capabilities that help improve visibility and collaboration among loan officers, third-party originators, service providers, investors and homebuyers.
Increase our customers’ use of, and the services integrated into, the Ellie Mae Network.  The Ellie Mae Network provides mortgage originators electronic access to many of the service providers, investors and lenders that they interact with in order to process and fund loans. We will continue to promote service ordering by our Encompass customers through the Ellie Mae Network as well as encourage providers of settlement services to deliver these services electronically through the Ellie Mae Network.

Investment in our business.  We invest in initiatives that we believe will help us continue to grow our business, improve our products and services, and strengthen our competitive advantage while bringing sustainable, long-term value to our customers. We currently anticipate that throughout 2019 we will continue to invest in key areas such as research and development, enterprise sales, services, technical support, and data security. This investment will include the development of our hybrid cloud infrastructure to accommodate the increasing adoption of the Encompass Digital Lending Platform and capabilities, which we expect to continue to roll out to customers in 2019 and 2020.
Acquisitions.  Our industry is highly fragmented, and we are continuously exploring and evaluating strategic opportunities available to acquire technology-based companies that will complement and increase the attractiveness of our solutions, enhance the breadth and depth of our solutions, and further our mission of automating the entire end-to-end mortgage process for our customers.
Products and Services
The Encompass Digital Lending Platform
Encompass is our proprietary, comprehensive digital mortgage platform that addresses the entire loan lifecycle and provides seamless access to the service providers, investors and lenders on the Ellie Mae Network. The Encompass Digital Lending Platform gives customers, partners and independent software vendors a secure, scalable platform plus a suite of APIs to enable them to extend the platform by easily integrating with external systems and data, and build custom applications that integrate with the platform. The Encompass platform helps users structure and streamline their mortgage origination process and facilitates collaboration among internal departments of a mortgage origination company. It supports efficiency in gathering, reviewing, and verifying mortgage-related data and in producing accurate documentation. It also enables enforcement of rules and business practices designed to ensure loan quality, adherence to processing standards, and regulatory compliance. Mortgage originators pay for Encompass in one of two models: fees based on the number of loans closed, subject to base fees, which we refer to as Success-Based Pricing, or recurring monthly subscription fees. 
The Encompass Digital Lending Platform is designed to help lenders and investors across their entire workflow from the initial point of thought from prospective customers all the way to point of loan delivery when the transaction is executed. We categorize the Encompass Digital Lending Platform in four solution types that allow our customers to:

• | Engage and acquire prospective customers or members so as to increase pipeline volume and drive more business;


• | Originate & Close loans more efficiently to lower cost of origination and boost productivity;


• | Sell loans more efficiently to fund loans faster and ensure a steady flow of capital; and


• | Purchase loans efficiently to acquire more loans faster and drive revenue for correspondent businesses.

Each solution includes a number of products and capabilities:
6

Cross-Platform Products. The Encompass Digital Lending Platform includes functionality and value-added features applicable across all solution types, including a data layer powering reporting and analytics that help lenders drive actionable insights that lead to smarter business decisions. The data layer enables the platform’s workflow automation capabilities, including pricing, compliance, document management and rules engines that automate lenders’ workflow and reduce manual repetitious tasks that often drive up costs. In addition, we provide a developer portal and a robust set of APIs that enable lenders and their developers to innovate and extend the platform to their business needs.
Channel-Centric Solutions. The Encompass Digital Lending Platform offers technology solutions for all three mortgage channels. For retail lenders, the platform offers a borrower portal, loan officer portal, loan origination system, and investor delivery service intended to help lenders originate and sell loans faster. For wholesale lenders, the platform offers a broker portal for third-party originators, as well as the loan origination system and investor delivery services, all intended to help originate broker generated loans faster. For the correspondent channel, the platform provides the tools to enable sellers to easily deliver loans and for correspondent investors to easily manage their loan acquisition pipeline, validate loan data, and ultimately complete the acquisition transaction.
The Ellie Mae Partner Network. A key component of the Encompass Digital Lending Platform is the partner network, which we refer to as the Ellie Mae Network, which enables mortgage originators to choose from, and connect to, a broad array of third-party service providers, mortgage lenders, and investors essential to the processing and funding of loans. Key functions of the Ellie Mae Network include the following:

• | Mortgage originators can electronically order settlement services, including credit, title, appraisal, flood, compliance, mortgage insurance, fraud detection, and other reports.


• | Mortgage originators can electronically and securely submit loan files to the investors to whom they intend to sell them, in order to have the loans underwritten and priced and to have loan rates locked.


• | Investors and settlement service providers can gain instant electronic access to a large number of mortgage originators, potentially increasing their revenue opportunities and lowering their marketing, loan processing, and customer support costs.


• | Investors and service providers can access electronic and real-time marketing and quality enforcement services that facilitate business interactions with mortgage originators.

Service providers and investors enter into contracts with us that allow their proprietary operating systems to inter-operate with the Ellie Mae Network. Service providers and investors generally pay us fees on a per transaction basis when the mortgage originator orders the applicable services through the Ellie Mae Network. 
Professional Services, Technical Support, and Education
Our professional services organization promotes best practice implementations and ongoing software upkeep to support our customers’ preferred workflows and integrate with other critical systems while improving productivity and supporting compliance. Our technical support and services organization applies expertise in compliance, business workflows, and product knowledge to enable our customers to achieve better levels of productivity and more effective use of Ellie Mae technologies which result in maximization of return on investment. Our education organization develops and delivers training curriculum which facilitates the foundation of knowledge and successful application of our solutions across our user base.
Sales and Marketing
Our sales force, which is deployed across the United States, consists of four distinct teams: Sales Development, New Account Acquisition, Solution Engineering, and Account Management. These teams manage and grow our customer accounts and focus on continuing to expand our customer base. They also encourage adoption of the Ellie Mae Network and our professional services, manage new product introductions, and cross sell solutions that we develop or acquire.
To build brand awareness and generate sales leads, we conduct digital marketing campaigns, webinars, public relations campaigns, and advertising. We attend and sponsor many mortgage and banking industry conferences and promote the Ellie Mae Experience, our annual user conference.
Technology
Our technology infrastructure supports all of our SaaS products and services.
7

Data Centers and Network Access
Our primary data centers are hosted by a leading SOC 1/SSAE-16 Type II certified provider of hosting services in Santa Clara, California and Elk Grove (Chicago), Illinois. Applications we provide will run actively in either of these two sites at any time. In 2016, we started moving towards a hybrid cloud architecture that leverages our private co-location data centers as well as Amazon Web Services (“AWS”). Moving towards a hybrid cloud architecture provides us with the scalability to expand our platform and application services, as well as increase availability and cost efficiencies to deliver on our product roadmap and service quality.
We rely on private data centers and AWS to host our products and services. Any disruption with our use of private cloud data centers or AWS would impact our operations and our business would be adversely impacted. In the event of a partial or full failure of our private data centers or AWS regions due to any natural disasters or other factors, we can recover services on a separate disaster recovery data center or other Amazon regions as part of our disaster recovery plan.
In 2015, we acquired substantially all of the assets of Mortgage Returns, LLC (“Mortgage Returns”), whose primary data center is hosted by a third-party provider located in St. Louis, Missouri. Currently, our Encompass CRM application runs out of this site. In 2017, we acquired Velocify, whose primary data center is hosted by a third-party provider located in Richardson, Texas. Currently, our Velocify products run out of this data center.
Network Security
All sensitive data transmitted over public networks is encrypted using industry standard encryption protocols in order to protect sensitive data against third-party disclosure. Servers and network components are secured with access control mechanisms and protected by hardened firewalls, virus protection, and intrusion prevention/detection systems. Security services and tools are monitored and updated in order to address emerging vulnerabilities. We have and will continue to commit significant resources to protect against and remedy any potential security breaches and their consequences and intend to keep doing so in the future. In recent years, we made major investments in our network security infrastructure, encryption of customer data, end-point security, and cybersecurity threat intelligence, including headcount and third-party tools and systems. In 2019 and beyond, we will continue to invest in our security infrastructure to protect the confidentiality and integrity of our customer data.
Research and Development
We devote substantial resources to enhance the features and functionality of our offerings as well as to develop new products and services. We are developing the next generation Encompass platform, including the Encompass Connect solutions that leverage our new APIs and platform capabilities. These new products include our Encompass Consumer Connect solution to better equip our customers to deploy customized borrower-facing websites, Encompass TPO Connect which helps our customers better manage third-party originations with their partners, Encompass Loan Officer Connect which exposes a rich set of loan officer-facing functionality on mobile devices, Encompass Developer Connect which provides developers with APIs, tools and developer portal, and Encompass Data Connect which gives lenders access to all of their loan data in near real time.
We will also continue to deliver enhancements to our offerings in support of compliance updates, including the 2018 HMDA collection and reporting changes, as well as the upcoming February 2020 adoption deadline for the redesigned Uniform Residential Loan Application.
Intellectual Property
Our success depends in large part on our proprietary products and technology for which we seek protection by use of a combination of patents, copyrights, trademarks, and trade secret laws and other agreements with employees and third parties. We require our officers, employees, and consultants to enter into standard agreements containing provisions requiring the confidentiality of proprietary information and assignment to us of all inventions made during the course of their employment or consulting relationship. We also enter into nondisclosure agreements with our commercial counterparties and limit access to, and distribution of, our confidential information.
We are committed to developing and protecting our intellectual property and, where appropriate, file patent applications to protect our technology. Our existing patents expire between 2020 and 2035. Our present and future patents may provide only limited protection for our technology and may not be sufficient to provide competitive advantages to us. Third parties may infringe or misappropriate our proprietary rights. Competitors may also independently develop technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to the technology we offer in our products and services. 
We hold a number of registered and unregistered trademarks, service names and domain names that are used in our business in the United States.

Competition
The mortgage origination software market is highly competitive. We compete against software providers based on our ability to provide:

• | a comprehensive, integrated software solution that provides all business-critical functions including customer acquisition, loan processing, task management, communication with borrowers and other mortgage origination participants, reporting, regulatory compliance, and general enterprise management;


• | solutions that create efficiencies in gathering, reviewing, and verifying mortgage-related data and producing accurate documentation;


• | on-demand solutions that reduce the need for IT infrastructure and overhead while providing the ability to update capabilities and adopt new regulations in a timely manner;


• | customizable business rules to automate processes, promote accountability, and enforce business practices that help assure loan quality and regulatory compliance;


• | a database architecture designed to reduce data errors and facilitate collaboration among departments within a mortgage origination company and comprehensive monitoring of the business of the entire enterprise;


• | attractive pricing options, such as our Success-Based Pricing model, allowing customers to time payments to cash flow;


• | an integrated network to submit loan files electronically and securely to lenders and electronically order all of the services necessary to originate a loan;


• | a solution that is secure and maintains the confidentiality of sensitive data; and


• | a solution that is reliable with minimal planned and unplanned downtime.

Our end-to-end mortgage origination software solution, Encompass, competes with many software providers catering to mortgage banks, mortgage lenders, credit unions, and mortgage brokers. Our principal software competitors include: proprietary systems that lenders have put in place, largely building on top of a legacy third-party technology; Black Knight, Inc. (LoanSphere Empower and LoanSphere LendingSpace); Mortgage Cadence, an Accenture Company; Wipro Gallagher Solutions, Inc.; Blue Sage Solutions; Byte Software Inc; Calyx Technology, Inc.; DH Corporation now Finastra; LendingQB; and Mortgage Builder Software, Inc. Some of these software providers, including Black Knight, also provide connectivity between their software users and lenders and service providers.
We also compete against other service providers that offer various competing software services not only based on the quality of the service we offer, but also on the integration of each specific service provided within our Encompass platform’s overall workflow. We believe that the integration of the services with Encompass enhances mortgage originators’ control over their processes with the critical result of reducing errors and costs through the seamless exchange of data across applications and services that Encompass offers.
The Ellie Mae Network is our proprietary method of facilitating our Encompass customers’ ability to choose from, and connect with, a broad array of mortgage lenders and third-party service providers essential for the processing and funding of loans, and is only available to mortgage originators using Encompass. Its principal competition remains traditional methods of exchanging data and documents among mortgage industry participants, such as by email, facsimile, phone, courier, and mail. In addition, mortgage originators may use a standalone web browser to go individually to each investor, lender, or service provider’s website and then manually upload loan data or enter information into that website. Mortgage originators may continue to use these methods due to habit, personal business relationships or for other reasons, despite the disadvantages of duplicative efforts, time delays, errors and costs, redundant paper documentation, and potential privacy and security breaches.
9

Lenders and service providers, including those who participate on the Ellie Mae Network, can and do connect with mortgage originators that are not Encompass users in a variety of ways, including through other networks between mortgage originators and lenders, and service providers such as Black Knight, Inc.
We compete with respect to the Ellie Mae Network based on:

• | offering mortgage originators accessibility to a critical mass of investors, lenders, and service providers;


• | enabling mortgage originators to transact all aspects of the mortgage origination process over the network; and


• | providing investors, lenders, and service providers with superior technological connectivity with mortgage originators, which enables them to lower costs, reduce errors and increase speed.

Our future financial condition and operating results depend on our ability to continue to develop and offer new products and services. We believe we generally compete favorably with our competitors; however, some of our actual and potential competitors enjoy substantial competitive advantages over us, such as longer operating histories and significantly greater financial, technical, marketing, and other resources. 
Government Regulation
The U.S. mortgage industry is heavily regulated. Mortgage originators, lenders, investors, and service providers with which we do business are subject to federal, state, and local laws that regulate and restrict the manner in which they operate in the residential mortgage industry, including Regulation X of the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (“RESPA”), Regulation Z of the Truth in Lending Act (“TILA”), the Mortgage Disclosure Improvement Act, and the Secure and Fair Enforcement for Mortgage Licensing Act of 2008, as amended. In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act increased regulation of the mortgage industry, including: generally prohibiting lenders from making residential mortgage loans unless a good faith determination is made of a borrower’s creditworthiness based on verified and documented information; requiring the CFPB to enact regulations to help assure that consumers are provided with timely and understandable information about residential mortgage loans that protect them against unfair, deceptive, and abusive practices; and requiring federal regulators to establish minimum national underwriting guidelines for residential mortgages that lenders will be allowed to securitize and sell to third-party investors without retaining any of the loans’ default risk. Although we are not directly subject to these laws and regulations, changes to these laws and regulations could broaden the scope of parties or activities subject to regulation and require us to comply with their restrictions, and new products and services developed by us may be subject to, or have to reflect, these laws or regulations.
In addition, we are subject to general business laws and regulations, regulations governing federal contractors, and laws and regulations specifically governing the Internet, such as those covering taxation, tariffs, user privacy, data protection, pricing, content, copyrights, distribution, electronic contracts and other communications, consumer protection, broadband residential Internet access, and the characteristics and quality of services.
Employees
At December 31, 2018, we had approximately 1,570 full-time employees, including approximately 240 in sales and marketing, 1,150 in research and development and technology, and 180 in general and administrative functions. None of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement.
Facilities
Our corporate headquarters are located in Pleasanton, California, totaling approximately 280,700 square feet, under a lease expiring in December 2025. We also have branch offices in Calabasas, California; El Segundo, California; Irvine, California; San Diego, California; Eagan, Minnesota; Creve Coeur, Missouri; Omaha, Nebraska; and Parsippany, New Jersey.
