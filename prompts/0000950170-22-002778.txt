Item 1. Business
Who We Are
 Gogo is the world’s largest provider of broadband connectivity services for the business aviation market. We have served this market for more than 20 years. Our mission is to provide ground-like connectivity to every passenger on every business aviation flight around the globe, enabling superior passenger experiences and efficient flight operations. To accomplish our mission, we design, build and operate dedicated air-to-ground (“ATG”) networks and engineer and maintain in-flight systems of proprietary hardware and software. We hold the exclusive license to 4MHz of U.S. nationwide spectrum dedicated to ATG use, as well as exclusive rights to the same spectrum in Canada. We offer our customers a broad suite of integrated equipment, network and Internet connectivity products and services as well as global support capabilities. Our offerings include a customizable suite of smart cabin systems for highly integrated connectivity, in-flight entertainment and voice solutions.
As of December 31, 2021, we had approximately 6,400 ATG business aircraft online of which approximately 2,500 were equipped with our AVANCE platform and approximately 3,900 with Gogo Biz, our legacy ATG broadband system. AVANCE is a software-centric platform that enables us to offer a broad range of products and features and employ multiple spectrum frequencies and networks as new technologies emerge. Of the AVANCE aircraft online at December 31, 2021, approximately 1,700 were equipped with AVANCE L5 and approximately 800 with AVANCE L3, a compact version of AVANCE L5 modified for small business aircraft. As of December 31, 2021, we had over 850 paid subscribers to Gogo Vision, our in-flight video on demand entertainment service. As of such date, we also had approximately 4,600 aircraft online equipped with narrow band satellite solutions that we provide pursuant to distribution agreements with satellite providers.
We continually innovate to maintain our leading global market share and support our customers’ needs, and in May 2019, we announced our plans to build our Gogo 5G network for use on business aviation aircraft, commercial regional jets and smaller mainline jets operating within the continental United States and Canada. We continue to expect the new network to be commercially launched on a nationwide basis in the second half of 2022 and have announced completion of several key milestones including finishing construction of our seven-tower testbed, working with Duncan Aviation to complete the first-article Supplemental Type Certificate (“STC”) for the onboard 5G system and signing an agreement with Jet Edge as our 5G launch partner. Gogo 5G will support licensed and unlicensed spectrum and allow us to take advantage of new advances in technology as they are developed. We will continue to provide 3G and 4G service over our ATG networks in North America to augment performance and provide redundancy to the Gogo 5G network. Our technology roadmap includes plans for continued rapid improvement in the performance of our in-flight systems.
Our Customers and Distribution Partners
 Our end users are primarily aircraft owners/operators in the business aviation market. As of December 31, 2021, our market was comprised of approximately 24,100 business aircraft in North America, of which approximately 30% have broadband connectivity, and approximately 14,600 business aircraft in the rest of the world, of which fewer than 6% have broadband connectivity.
 We sell directly to every Original Equipment Manufacturer (“OEM”) of business aviation aircraft including Bombardier, Dassault Falcon, Embraer, Gulfstream, Pilatus and Textron Aviation. In the aftermarket, we sell through a global distribution network of approximately 120 independent dealers who are certified by the Federal Aviation Administration (“FAA”) as aircraft Maintenance and Repair Organizations (“MROs”). Our independent dealers market, resell and obtain FAA-required STCs for our equipment. Our customers also include fractional jet operators such as Flexjet and NetJets, charter operators such as Wheels Up, corporate flight departments and individuals owning aircraft. As of December 31, 2021, we had approximately 4,200 customers, none of which accounted for more than 10% of our revenue in 2021.
Upon the closing of the Transaction, we and Intelsat entered into a network sharing agreement (the “ATG Network Sharing Agreement”), pursuant to which we provide certain in-flight connectivity services on our ATG network to Intelsat, subject to certain revenue sharing obligations, and pursuant to which Intelsat has exclusive commercial aviation access to the ATG network in North America, subject to certain revenue guarantees. As of

December 31, 2021, our ATG network was accessible to more than 1,300 commercial aircraft, primarily regional jets, operated by Intelsat’s airline customers.
Our In-flight Internet Portfolio
 We focus exclusively on aviation and implement our value proposition of offering the best products and services through a comprehensive portfolio consisting of our in-flight network, in-flight systems, in-flight services, aviation partner support and production operations functions.
 In-flight Network. Our network solutions are engineered to provide industry-leading cost, capacity, coverage, reliability and aero-performance. We offer business aviation partners a variety of network solutions suitable for operation on most of the world’s business aircraft and one or more of our systems are line fit offerable on the vast majority of aircraft models manufactured by our OEM distribution partners. Our terrestrial network targets approximately 24,100 business aircraft based in North America. Such aircraft generally fly over land and are well-suited for our ATG solutions given their need for smaller antennas, lighter weight equipment and reduced equipment and operating costs.
•North American Terrestrial Network: We operate a terrestrial network using 3 MHz of licensed spectrum in the 800 MHz band and approximately 260 terrestrial cell sites in the lower 48 states and parts of Alaska and Canada. All but one of our cell sites are leased from tower operators. As of December 31, 2021, this network supported 3.1 Mbps 3G service and 9.8 Mbps 4G service. We are currently building our Gogo 5G network, which will initially include 150 cell sites across the lower 48 states which we expect to be commercially launched by the second half of 2022. Approximately 75% of the initial Gogo 5G sites will be colocated with our current ATG network. We completed construction of our seven-tower testbed in 2021 as scheduled. The seven sites will enable us to begin to validate network performance as we continue the cell site buildout. 
 •Ground Network: We lease an extensive, predominantly fiber-optic network to connect our approximately 260 cell sites to our two data centers, the Internet and cloud-based services, and our network operations center (“NOC”). Our data centers and cloud-based services provide redundant telecommunications connections to the Internet and contain numerous servers that enable the expansive set of features that we offer. The NOC monitors daily network operations, conducts network diagnostics and coordinates responses to any performance issues. We augment our ability to monitor, maintain and update our in-flight systems while aircraft are on the ground with a terrestrial modem utilizing 3G, 4G and Wi-Fi wireless service. 
 In-flight Systems. To utilize our in-flight network and provide our in-flight services, we have developed proprietary systems of airborne equipment and software. Our in-flight systems are designed for superior performance, future adaptability and ease of certification, installation and maintenance. Each system consists of: (i) an antenna specifically designed for the network and technology being used to provide the service; (ii) a modular in-cabin Wi-Fi network that includes state-of-the art servers, modems and wireless access points; and (iii) system software designed to reliably support a variety of in-flight services provided by Gogo, our aviation partners and third parties. The flexibility of the AVANCE platform provides significant benefits both to customers and Gogo operations. AVANCE provides customers with a common software platform that operates across all Gogo networks and allows aviation partners to customize their passengers’ in-flight experiences by selecting from a variety of offerings that include various levels of connectivity; on-demand entertainment; information and applications; smart cabin customization; and real-time support and tools. The flexibility of the AVANCE platform enables aircraft owners and operators to add or reduce system capabilities as their needs change. AVANCE is designed with a flexible architecture and common componentry across all devices to facilitate equipment standardization and allow Gogo to add multiple products and features, augment spectrum and employ multiple ATG or satellite networks with minimal or no changes to installed hardware or the aircraft.
 In-flight Services. We provide a wide range of in-flight services for passengers, flight and cabin crews and operational use by our aviation partners.
•Passenger Connectivity Services: Passengers connect to the Internet from their personal electronic devices, as they would on the ground, to access corporate and personal applications that include 


streaming services on our higher capacity networks. We offer a variety of connectivity services tailored to our various networks and technologies that are generally priced on a per aircraft per month basis.
•Passenger Entertainment Services: Through Gogo Vision, our video-on-demand product accessible from passengers’ personal electronic devices, passengers can access a large library of entertainment options, which currently include on-demand movies and television shows. Content is wirelessly updated each month through Gogo Cloudport, either in the customer’s own hanger or at Gogo Cloud locations in the Unites States and Europe. In December 2020, we launched Gogo Vision 360, a premium IFE service that includes unlimited on-demand movies and television shows along with digital magazines and a state-of-the art 3D moving map. As of December 31, 2021, we had over 850 paid subscribers to Gogo Vision.
 Aviation Partner Support.
 •Account Team. We have a customer operations team that assists our dealers with installation, troubleshooting and system activations, and our customers’ flight departments are supported by field service engineering teams located at key locations across the United States and Europe. Both the dealer network and customer flight departments have access to our technical and logistical support 24 hours a day, seven days a week.
 •Operational Support. We provide a variety of services required to install and maintain our in-flight systems. Our OEM distribution partners and our dealers are responsible for obtaining the FAA certifications required for installation of our equipment on aircraft, and we support them in obtaining such certifications and installing the equipment. Following installation, our NOC continually monitors the network and its usage and performance. 
 •Comprehensive Analytics. We have extensive databases, a big data platform and analytical capabilities to evaluate our system and operational performance. Our analytical capabilities are used by us, our aviation partners and our vendors in designing, manufacturing, and operating our systems to maximize performance and minimize disruptions and system downtime. 
 Engineering, Design and Development. We employ a large in-house Engineering, Design and Development (“ED&D”) organization. ED&D is responsible for translating business requirements into products that comply with rigorous avionics certification requirements. Its capabilities include: (i) a radiofrequency engineering team with expertise in antenna specifications, radio technology, spectrum analysis, network design and regulatory requirements; (ii) an airborne platform development team which manages the design, development and testing of airborne equipment and its integration with ground systems and leads FAA certification efforts; (iii) a product management and systems engineering team that manages all aspects of turning business requirements into technical specifications and is responsible for our program management process; (iv) an application development and business systems organization team that manages development of our internal business systems and the product extensions that sit on the AVANCE platform; and (v) a network engineering team that designs, implements and manages our network and data center infrastructure, security and core network functions.
Production Operations. Our manufacturing objective is to produce superior quality products that conform to avionics specifications while providing the best value to our customers. Given our highly specialized technology and required production levels, we design, assemble and test our airborne line replaceable units in-house, while relying on third parties to manufacture specific components based on our design specifications to maximize production efficiencies. We retain the intellectual property associated with the airborne equipment. We also rely on third parties to manufacture our antennas and we generally share antenna design responsibilities and intellectual property with these vendors. Our manufacturing processes include internally designed test fixtures and software that we and our third-party manufacturers employ at all levels of manufacturing. Our manufacturing-related business processes – from sales forecasts to supply chain activities to shipping – are integrated and automated within our enterprise resource planning tools. Our manufacturing and repair facilities are FAA-certified.
Competitive Strengths
 We maintain the leading global market position in connectivity for the business aviation market. We have designed our value proposition to align with our aviation partners’ priorities and we believe that our comprehensive product and service portfolio sets us apart from competitors by better meeting customer needs through:
 •Our Proprietary Networks and Exclusive Spectrum. We have developed, deployed and operated our own networks for more than 20 years, resulting in know-how and experience that we believe is unmatched by any other provider in our industry. We hold the exclusive license to the only nationwide broadband radiofrequency spectrum dedicated to ATG use, as well as exclusive rights to the same spectrum in Canada. Our proprietary ATG network provides lower latency and requires less power than the networks operated by our geosynchronous (“GEO”) satellite competitors and enables us to avoid the interference issues that can accompany use of shared, unlicensed spectrum. In addition to our ATG network, we have deployed Gogo Cloudport, which enables customers to wirelessly update Gogo Vision content while the plane is parked in the hanger. 
 •Our Innovative Culture. We continuously innovate and have a strong track record of innovation in our networks. We pioneered and have led innovation in our industry for nearly 30 years, as evidenced by the three proprietary ATG network technologies that we have deployed for the business aviation market. In addition, as of February 25, 2022, we held approximately 407 U.S. and international patents, most of which relate to network technology. We are currently building our fourth ATG network – Gogo 5G – which will marry our proprietary licensed spectrum with available unlicensed spectrum to further improve the passenger experience and address the increasing demand for data-heavy interactive services like video conferencing. 
 •Our Extensible, Software-centric AVANCE Platform. Our networks and systems are designed to provide the best in-flight Internet experience and highest network and system availability across the broadest range of aircraft wherever they fly, and a growing number of our installed aircraft are on the AVANCE platform. The AVANCE platform is software-centric and designed to be extensible as it includes hardware built with common components that operates on a single operating system across multiple devices. Approximately 80% of the components included in AVANCE L3 and AVANCE L5 are common across the two systems. Because of this extensibility, we can add new products, features and options, we can increase connectivity speeds by augmenting spectrum and we can add proprietary or third-party ATG or satellite networks, all with minimal or no hardware or aircraft modifications. For example, should we decide to pursue the opportunity presented by low earth orbit (“LEO”) satellite networks that are being launched over the next few years, AVANCE’s flexibility would enable us to limit required hardware upgrades to a new electronically steerable antenna and some additional wiring. We expect AVANCE’s common componentry to facilitate standardization of hardware and FAA certifications across multiple products, spectrum frequencies and networks, and we expect that such standardization will in turn increase efficiency and improve quality in functions that include supply chain, production operations and customer support. 
 •Our Vertical Integration. Unlike some of our competitors, our supply chain is vertically integrated. We believe that this vertical integration offers several advantages including: (i) increased agility in adjusting to changing market conditions; (ii) greater control over hardware design, manufacturing, cost and quality; (iii) greater control over hardware and services pricing; and (iv) increased ability to invest in and offer unique products and services at greater value to the customer. 
 •Our Distribution Partners. Our distribution partners include every OEM of business aviation aircraft and an aftermarket network of approximately 120 dealers, many of whom we have worked with for decades. We have established trusted relationships with our distribution partners and a proven track record of generating revenues and profits for them, and they have trust and confidence in our ability to continue to do so. This facilitates our sales and our speed to market as our distribution partners are willing to invest in marketing and certification efforts for our equipment. As one example of such investment, Duncan Aviation, the largest MRO in the United States, has agreed to modify all of its STCs for the AVANCE L5 system (which cover more than 30 aircraft models manufactured by multiple OEMs) to include Gogo 5G and is already working to obtain the first-article STC. 
Strategy
 Our strategy is to maintain and strengthen our leadership position by leveraging the competitive strengths described above to provide high-quality, cost-effective connectivity products and services. The principal elements of our strategy include the following:
 •Enhancing our ATG networks by launching Gogo 5G and leveraging our licensed spectrum and other available spectrum to meet our customers’ increasing expectations for performance and provide the most reliable business aviation service in North America;
 •Driving penetration of the extensible AVANCE platform in order to enhance our ability to pursue opportunities for software upgrades, new technologies and new markets; 
 •Offering AVANCE customers upgrades of existing products and services as well as new products and services in order to drive Average Revenue per Aircraft (“ARPA”);
 •Continuously improving our operations by, among other things, continuing to focus on common componentry in our systems in order to reduce supply chain, manufacturing and other costs and improve quality; and
 •Pursuing a balanced capital allocation strategy focused on enhancing the capacity and performance of our ATG network, reducing our leverage to an appropriate level, making strategic investments to capitalize on market opportunities and strengthen our competitive position, and returning capital to shareholders, including through, among potential other options, stock repurchases.
 Competition
 We compete against both equipment and GEO-satellite based telecommunications service providers to the business aviation market, including Honeywell Aerospace, Collins Aerospace, Satcom Direct, Inmarsat and ViaSat. In addition, SmartSky Networks, which in 2014 announced that it planned to launch an ATG network in the continental United States in 2016, has announced that it is currently targeting the second quarter of 2022 as the completion date for its nationwide network. We may in the future face competition from operators of LEO or other non-GEO satellite networks, including OneWeb, Starlink and Telesat, all of which have announced that they are developing in-flight connectivity systems. We believe that the principal points of competition in our market are technological capabilities, price, geographic coverage, customer service, product development, conformity to customer specifications, quality of support after the sale and timeliness of delivery and installation.
Licenses and Regulation
 Federal Aviation Administration
 The FAA prescribes standards and certification requirements for the manufacturing of aircraft and aircraft components, and certifies repair stations to perform aircraft maintenance, preventive maintenance and alterations, including the installation and maintenance of aircraft components. Each type of aircraft operated in the United States under an FAA-issued standard airworthiness certificate must possess an FAA Type Certificate, which constitutes approval of the design of the aircraft type based on applicable airworthiness standards. When a party other than the holder of the Type Certificate develops a major modification to an aircraft already type-certificated, that party must obtain an FAA-issued STC approving the design of the modified aircraft type. The dealers and OEMs to which we sell our equipment are generally responsible for obtaining STCs for each aircraft type on which our equipment will be installed, and we support them in those efforts. Separate STCs typically are required for different configurations of the same aircraft type, such as when they are configured differently for different owners and operators.
After an STC is obtained, a manufacturer desiring to manufacture components to be used in the modification covered by the STC must apply to the FAA for a Parts Manufacturer Approval, or PMA, which permits the holder to manufacture and sell components manufactured in conformity with the PMA and its approved design and data package. In general, each initial PMA is an approval of a manufacturing or modification facility’s production quality control system. PMA supplements are obtained to authorize the manufacture of a particular part in accordance with the requirements of the pertinent PMA, including its production quality control system. We routinely apply for and receive such PMAs and supplements.


Certain of our FCC licenses are conditioned upon our ability to obtain from the FAA a “No Hazard Determination” for our cell sites, which indicates that a proposed structure will not, if built as specified, create a hazard to air navigation. When building or altering certain cell sites, we may first be required to obtain such a determination.
 Our business depends on our continuing access to, or use of, these FAA certifications, authorizations and other approvals, and our employment of, or access to, FAA-certified engineering and other professionals.
 In accordance with these certifications, authorizations and other approvals, the FAA requires that we maintain, review and document our quality assurance processes. The FAA may visit our facilities at any time as part of our agreement for certification as a manufacturing facility and repair station to ensure that our facilities, procedures and quality control systems continue to meet FAA requirements. In addition, we are responsible for informing the FAA of significant changes to our organization and operations, product failures or defects, and any changes to our operational facilities or FAA-approved quality control systems. Other FAA requirements include training procedures and drug and alcohol screening for safety-sensitive employees working at our facilities or on aircraft.
 Foreign Aviation Regulation
 According to the Convention on International Civil Aviation, the airworthiness of U.S.-registered and FAA type-certificated aircraft on which FAA-certified Gogo equipment is installed is recognized by civil aviation authorities (“CAAs”) worldwide that are signatories to that Convention. As a result, Gogo does not expect to require further airworthiness certification formalities in countries outside of the United States for U.S.-registered aircraft that already have an STC issued by the FAA covering Gogo equipment. For aircraft registered with a CAA other than the United States, the installation of Gogo equipment requires airworthiness certification from an airworthiness certification body. Typically, the CAA of the country in which the aircraft is registered is responsible for ensuring the airworthiness of any aircraft modifications under its authority.
 The FAA holds bilateral agreements with certification authorities around the globe. Bilateral agreements facilitate the reciprocal airworthiness certification of civil aeronautical products that are imported/exported between two signatory countries. A Bilateral Airworthiness Agreement (“BAA”) or Bilateral Aviation Safety Agreement (“BASA”) with Implementation Procedures for Airworthiness provides for airworthiness technical cooperation between the FAA and its counterpart CAA. Under a BAA or BASA, the CAA of the aircraft’s country of registration generally validates STCs issued by the FAA and then issues a Validation Supplemental Type Certificate. For countries with which the FAA does not have a BAA or BASA, Gogo must apply for certification approval with the CAA of the country in which the aircraft is registered. In order to obtain the necessary certification, Gogo will be required to comply with the airworthiness regulations of the country in which the aircraft is registered. Failure to address all foreign airworthiness and aviation regulatory requirements at the commencement of each aircraft operator’s service in any country in which it registers aircraft when there are no applicable bilateral agreements may lead to significant additional costs related to certification and could impact the timing of our ability to provide our service on such aircraft.
 U.S. Department of Transportation
 The U.S. Department of Transportation (“DOT”) established an Advisory Committee on Accessible Air Transportation to negotiate and develop a proposed rule concerning accommodations for passengers with disabilities in three basic areas, including in-flight entertainment (“IFE”) and closed captioning of IFE. The Committee issued a resolution in late 2016 which included its recommendations to the DOT for a rule on IFE. However, since a final rule on IFE has not yet been issued, it is unclear how, if at all, it may impact Gogo. According to the Fall 2020 Unified Agenda of Regulatory and Deregulatory Actions posted by the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Office of Management and Budget, the projected date of publication of a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (“NPRM”) by DOT on Accessible IFE is April 2022.

Federal Communications Commission
 Under the Communications Act of 1934, as amended (the “Communications Act”), the Federal Communications Commission ("FCC") licenses the spectrum that we use and regulates the construction, operation, acquisition and sale of our wireless services. The Communications Act and FCC rules also require the FCC’s prior approval of the assignment or transfer of control of an FCC license, or the acquisition, directly or indirectly, of more than 25% of the equity or voting control of Gogo by non-U.S. individuals or entities.
 Our various services are regulated differently by the FCC. For example, we provide some of our voice and data services (not including Gogo Biz or AVANCE) by reselling the telecommunications services of two satellite operators. Because we provide these services on a common carrier basis, we are subject to the provisions of Title II of the Communications Act, which require, among other things, that the charges and practices of common carriers be just, reasonable and non-discriminatory. In addition, we provide an interconnected voice over Internet protocol (“VoIP”) service. The FCC applies many, but not all, of the same regulatory requirements to interconnected VoIP service as it does to common carrier telecommunications services.
 We offer connectivity service in the United States to business aviation aircraft and, pursuant to the ATG Network Sharing Agreement, to certain commercial aircraft operated by Intelsat’s airline customers, through our own facilities, using our ATG License, a nationwide commercial air-ground radiotelephone license in the 800 MHz band. We obtained and paid for this spectrum through an auction conducted by the FCC. See “ATG License Terms and Conditions.”
 The FCC’s current rules classify broadband Internet access service as a lightly regulated, non-common carrier “information service,” and remove virtually all of the previously-imposed network neutrality restrictions on blocking access to lawful content, applications, services or non-harmful devices; impairing or degrading lawful Internet traffic on the basis of content, applications, services or non-harmful devices; favoring some lawful Internet traffic over other lawful traffic in exchange for consideration of any kind; or prioritizing the content and services of broadband providers’ affiliates. We remain subject to certain modified transparency obligations that require disclosure of network management practices, performance, and commercial terms. To the extent the FCC further restricts reasonable network management, or to the extent network neutrality proponents prevail on further administrative or appellate review, our business may be affected.
Our Internet access service is also subject to the FCC’s data roaming rules, which require commercial mobile data service (“CMDS”) providers like Gogo to negotiate roaming arrangements with any requesting facilities-based, technologically compatible providers of CMDS. The rules do not give other providers the right to install equipment on Gogo-equipped aircraft and do not require the Gogo service to be provided on a discounted basis, although the arrangement must be “commercially reasonable.” The rules allow us to take reasonable measures to safeguard the quality of our service against network congestion that may result from roaming traffic.
In addition, most of our services are subject to various rules that seek to ensure that the services are accessible to persons with disabilities, including requirements related to the pass-through of closed captioning for certain IP-delivered video content offered through our Gogo Vision.
In addition to the two ATG licenses, we hold microwave licenses that are used for backhaul in our terrestrial network and an authorization for the provision of voice and data services between the United States and foreign points.
 ATG License Terms and Conditions
The FCC issued our ATG License on October 31, 2006, for a renewable 10-year term. We have satisfied our obligation under the license to provide “substantial service” to aircraft, and on January 25, 2017, we received confirmation from the FCC that the license has been renewed until October 31, 2026.
 Our 1 MHz ATG license obtained in 2013 from LiveTV Airfone, LLC was also originally issued on October 31, 2006, for a renewable 10-year term, although there is no “substantial service” obligation that attaches to this license. Our application to renew our license was subsequently granted for an additional 10-year term. On August 3,

2017, the FCC released an order which, among other things, revised the wireless license renewal rules. As a result of this order, which applies to the industry generally, all licensees will need to make a showing (or certification) at renewal to demonstrate that the licensee provided and continues to provide service to the public. Because the 1 MHz ATG license has no construction or substantial service requirement, it is not currently clear what level and length of service the FCC will find adequate when considering the next renewal of the 1 MHz ATG license in 2026.
 Our two ATG licenses contain certain conditions that require us to comply with all applicable FCC and FAA rules as well as all bilateral agreements between the United States and Canada and the United States and Mexico regarding the frequencies that are allocated for ATG services. These agreements apply to our use of the spectrum in areas adjacent to the United States’ northern and southern borders and in and out of Canadian and Mexican airspace.
 A bilateral ATG spectrum coordination agreement between the U.S. and Canada has been negotiated and approved and a bilateral agreement between the United States and Mexico is pending. In 2012, Industry Canada issued to our Canadian subsidiary a subordinate license that allows us to use Canadian ATG spectrum of which SkySurf Communications Inc. is the primary licensee, and in 2019 the primary license was renewed for an eight-year term expiring June 29, 2027. In 2012, we entered into the License Agreement with SkySurf, which has an initial term of ten years commencing on August 14, 2012, and, provided that the primary spectrum license agreement issued by Industry Canada (now Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada or ISED) to SkySurf remains in effect at such dates, is renewable at our option for an additional 10-year term following the initial expiration and thereafter for a further five-year term. The term of the License Agreement, including the initial 10-year term and any renewals, is contingent on the effectiveness of the primary spectrum license.
 Any future coordination agreement with Mexico and/or a Mexican ATG licensee could affect our ability to provide our broadband Internet service in the border areas using our current cell sites at current operating power levels and could affect our ability to establish or maintain ATG service in the border areas as aircraft fly into and out of Mexican airspace.
Equipment Certification
 We may not lease, sell, market or distribute any radio transmission equipment used in the provision of our services unless such equipment is certified by the FCC as compliant with the FCC’s technical rules. All certifications required for equipment currently used in the provision of our services have been obtained.
 Privacy and Data Security-Related Regulations
 We collect personal information, such as name, address, e-mail address and credit card information, directly from our users when they register to use our service. We also may obtain information about our users from third parties. We use the information that we collect to, for example, consummate their purchase transaction, customize and personalize advertising and content for our users and enhance the entertainment options when using our service. Our collection and use of such information are intended to comply with our privacy policy, which is posted on our website; applicable law; and our contractual obligations to aviation partners and other third parties; as well as industry standards such as the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard.
Notwithstanding that broadband Internet access is currently classified as a Title I information service, we must continue to comply with certain Communications Act and FCC privacy and data security rules for our services, including certain provisions applicable to customer proprietary network information.
 We are also subject to other federal and state consumer privacy and data security requirements. For example, Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) Act prohibits “unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce.” Although the FTC’s authority to regulate the non-common carrier services offered by communications common carriers has not been fully delineated, we believe that the FTC has jurisdiction over all of our services. The FTC has brought enforcement actions under the FTC Act against companies that among other things: (1) collect, use, share or retain personal information in a way that is inconsistent with the representations, commitments, and promises that they make in their privacy policies and other public statements; (2) have privacy

policies that do not adequately inform consumers about the company’s actual practices; and (3) fail to reasonably protect the security, privacy and confidentiality of nonpublic consumer information.
We are also subject to state “mini-FTC Acts,” which prohibit unfair or deceptive acts or practices, along with data security breach notification laws requiring entities holding certain personal data to provide notices in the event of a breach of the security of that data. A few states have also imposed specific data security obligations. These state mini-FTC Acts, data security breach notification laws, and data security obligations may not extend to all of our services and their applicability may be limited by various factors, such as whether an affected party is a resident of a particular state.
 Certain states have also enacted specific privacy laws to which we may be subject. For example, the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”) took effect January 1, 2020 and provides broad new privacy rights for California consumers, including, among others, the right to obtain copies of their personal information collected in the past 12 months, the ability to opt out from the sale of personal information and the right to demand deletion of personal information. The CCPA also imposes compliance requirements on companies that do business in California and collect personal information from consumers, including, among others, notice, consent and service provider requirements. The CCPA also provides for civil penalties for violations as well as a private right of action for data breaches that may increase data breach litigation. The California Office of the Attorney General has published final regulations to implement portions of the CCPA. In addition, in November 2020 California voters passed the California Privacy Rights Act (“CPRA”) ballot initiative, which introduces significant amendments to the CCPA. The CPRA will go into effect on January 1, 2023, and new regulations are expected to be introduced in 2022.
Two other states recently enacted privacy laws: the Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act (“VCDPA”) will take effect on January 1, 2023, and the Colorado Privacy Act will take effect on July 1, 2023. These laws provide broad new privacy rights for Virginia and Colorado consumers, including the right to opt out of targeted advertising and certain profiling activities. There are currently bills pending in the Virginia legislature which would amend the VCDPA prior to its effective date. Regulations relating to the Colorado Privacy Act are expected to be introduced. Depending on these developments, the measures we are required to take to comply with these laws may be significant.
Congress and other state legislatures have also been considering legislation relating to privacy and data breaches. Should any additional laws be enacted, they could affect our business.
To the extent we collect personally identifiable information of residents in other countries, we may be subject to the data protection regulations of the relevant countries. On May 25, 2018, the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) of the European Union (“EU”) took effect, and it has imposed more restrictive privacy-related requirements for entities outside the EU that process personally identifiable information about European data subjects. EU member states also have some flexibility to supplement the GDPR with their own laws and regulations and may apply stricter requirements for certain data processing activities. Additionally, in Canada, the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act of 2000 (“PIPEDA”) and substantially similar provincial laws may impose data privacy and security obligations on the processing of personal data. The regulation of data privacy and security in other jurisdictions continues to evolve.
In addition, certain countries have laws which restrict the transfer of personally identifiable information outside of such countries. For example, both Switzerland and the member states of the EU impose restrictions on transferring such data to countries, including the U.S., that they do not deem to offer a similar standard of protection as they require. Certain mechanisms apply under Swiss and EU member state laws that permit the cross-border transfer of personal information to countries that are not deemed adequate, such as the United States. Additionally, on July 16, 2020, the European Court of Justice (the highest EU court) ruled the EU-US privacy shield to be an invalid data transfer mechanism, confirmed that the Model Standard Contractual Clauses (“SCC”) remain valid, and left unaddressed some issues regarding supplementary measures that may need to be taken to support transfers. On September 27, 2021, new versions of the SCC went into effect. Depending on the supplementary measures that may need to be taken to support transfers and implement the SCC, our ability to lawfully transfer personally identifiable information out of relevant jurisdictions to the United States or other jurisdictions may be impacted.

Other countries, such as India, have also been considering legislation regarding data protection regulation and data transfers/localization. Should any additional laws be enacted in countries in which we do business, our business could be affected.
 Truth in Billing and Consumer Protection
 The FCC’s Truth in Billing rules require full and fair disclosure of all charges on customer bills for telecommunications services, except for broadband Internet access services. Thus, these rules apply to our satellite-based services. This disclosure must include brief, clear and non-misleading plain language descriptions of the services provided. States also have the right to regulate wireless carriers’ billing; however, we are not currently aware of any states that impose billing requirements on ATG services.
CALEA
 The FCC has determined that facilities-based broadband Internet access providers, which include Gogo, are subject to the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act, or CALEA, which requires covered service providers to build certain law enforcement surveillance assistance capabilities into their communications networks and to maintain CALEA-related system security policies and procedures. We have implemented such policies and procedures and, based upon our periodic self-assessments, we believe that our network is compliant with CALEA.
Intellectual Property
 We rely on a combination of intellectual property rights, including trade secrets, patents, copyrights, trademarks and domain names, as well as contractual restrictions to protect intellectual property and proprietary technology owned or used by us.
 We have patented certain of our technologies in the United States and certain countries outside of the United States. As of February 25, 2022, we held U.S. patents expiring on dates ranging from September 2022 to February 2040 and foreign patents expiring on dates ranging from November 2024 to July 2038. We do not believe that our business is dependent to any material extent on any single patent or group of patents that we own. We also have a number of patent applications pending both in and outside of the United States and we will continue to seek patent protection in the United States and certain other countries to the extent we believe such protection is appropriate and cost-effective.
 We consider our brands to be important to the success of our business and our competitive position. We rely on both trademark registrations and common law protection for trademarks. Our registered trademarks in the United States and certain other countries include, among others, “Gogo,” “Gogo Biz” and “Gogo Vision,” although we have not yet obtained registrations for our most important marks in all markets in which we currently do business or intend to do business in the future. Generally, the protection afforded for trademarks is perpetual, if they are renewed on a timely basis, if registered, and continue to be used properly as trademarks.
 We license or purchase from third parties technology, software and hardware that are critical to providing our products and services. Much of this technology, software and hardware is customized for our use and would be difficult or time-consuming to obtain from alternative vendors. We also license our proprietary technology and software to third parties to enable them to integrate such technology and software into the products they provide to us. Many of our agreements with such third parties are renewable for indefinite periods of time unless either party chooses to terminate, although some of our agreements expire after fixed periods and require renegotiation prior to expiration in order to extend the term. Among the most material of our technology-related agreements are those for modems, base stations and antennas. Our agreements for modems, base stations and antennas do not renew automatically and thus require periodic renegotiation. Such agreements, as well as certain licenses to commercially available software, are material to our business.
 Under the terms of the Transaction, we retained ownership of the entire patent portfolio held by Gogo Inc. and its affiliates, including patents developed and obtained in connection with our former commercial aviation business. We have granted Intelsat a worldwide, perpetual, non-exclusive license to our patent portfolio for use in the

commercial aviation and satellite mobility businesses (each as defined in the license agreement). Intelsat also has a limited, non-exclusive license right to use certain of our trademarks for up to two years as it transitions to its own brand.
We have developed certain ideas, processes, and methods that contribute to our success and competitive position that we consider to be trade secrets. We protect our trade secrets by keeping them confidential through the use of internal and external controls, including contractual protections with employees, contractors, customers and vendors. Trade secrets can be protected for an indefinite period so long as their secrecy is maintained.
 Human Capital
 We believe that our success is the product of an integrated approach to talent management that touches every part of our business. Rather than focusing on individual processes, we manage our employee ecosystem holistically by encouraging behaviors, conversations, relationships and activities that represent best practices for a high performing culture. We are committed to fostering a highly engaged workforce and in turn driving satisfaction among partners and customers through initiatives that include the following:
•Compensation: Our compensation program is designed to attract, retain and reward the best performers. In addition to carefully calibrated salaries and bonuses, which are reviewed annually, our employees benefit from a generous benefit package, including employee stock purchase and 401(k) programs. Additionally, all of our employees are eligible for equity awards through our annual equity program as a part of their compensation. We also grant additional equity awards on an annual basis to employees identified as high performers. 
 •Training & Development: The continued development of our people is critical to our success. New hires participate in an onboarding and orientation program, which is intended to build knowledge and understanding of our business. We also invest in various professional development and leadership training initiatives and conduct quarterly forums relevant to our business that provide unique learning and networking opportunities across all business functions. 
 •Recognition: Our employees’ success is celebrated. Our recognition programs include service awards, peer-to-peer recognition awards (called Gogo Props), spot bonuses for significant contributions above and beyond daily work efforts and special equity awards for high performers nominated by their managers. We believe these programs promote a positive employee experience that champions performance while creating a sense of community. 
 •Talent Review: We employ a comprehensive talent review program to assess the performance and capabilities of each individual. Annually we set company-wide priorities that serve as the basis upon which clear individual objectives are set across the entire workforce. Feedback is provided regularly and our annual talent review process identifies and supports high performers in the form of additional development opportunities so that each employee has the opportunity to reach their full potential. By investing in our people and taking the opportunity to promote from within when appropriate, we believe we are best able to reinforce our core values and achieve our strategic objectives. 
 •Feedback: We conduct annual employee engagement surveys to solicit feedback and help guide planning on all people-related efforts and initiatives that not only support our team members but propel our business forward.
 •Diversity & Inclusion: Gogo seeks to create an environment where each individual’s uniqueness is respected and which allows for a sense of inclusion and belonging. In 2020, Gogo formed a Diversity Council dedicated to furthering a culture of acceptance and respect for the attributes that differentiate people and/or groups. These attributes include race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation and physical and developmental disabilities. Current key initiatives include surveying employees regarding their lived experiences and investing in and seeking to expand our engagement with diverse professional and youth-focused organizations and Historically Black Colleges and Universities. We are also facilitating the creation of employee resource groups (“ERGs”) led by employees with diverse backgrounds, experiences or characteristics who share a common interest in professional development and improving corporate culture. 


As of December 31, 2021, women and employees identifying with minority races comprised approximately 27% and 30%, respectively of our workforce. We have nine members on our Board of Directors of which one is Black and a woman. Of the five members on our senior-most Executive Leadership Team, two are women and another is Hispanic/Latinx. While Gogo promotes inclusiveness for all, we are focusing our recruiting efforts on hiring more women and individuals who are Black and have established hiring goals for the next five years.
These efforts are supported by our dedicated human resources team and led by our Executive Vice President, Chief People Experience Officer, who is responsible for developing and executing our human capital strategy and regularly updates our Board of Directors and senior management on the operation and status of our human capital activities.
We have always made the health and safety of our employees a top priority, and even more so since the COVID-19 pandemic started. We have implemented work guidelines intended to maintain high productivity while providing employees who can work remotely with the flexibility to do so. We also follow safety and cleaning protocols for those coming into our offices to ensure that we are doing everything we can to prevent the spread of COVID-19 related viruses amongst our employees and the community.
 As of December 31, 2021, we had 376 employees, all of whom were full-time. No employee is a member of a labor union.
