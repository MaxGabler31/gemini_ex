ITEM 1. BUSINESS.
Overview
 
Healthcare Integrated Technologies, Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively the “Company,” “we,” “our” or “us”) is a healthcare technology company based in Knoxville, Tennessee. We are creating a diversified spectrum of healthcare technology solutions to integrate and automate the continuing care, home care and professional healthcare spaces.
 
Our initial product, SafeSpace™ with AI Vision™, is an ambient fall detection solution designed for continuing care communities and at home use. SafeSpace includes hardware devices utilizing RGB, radar and other sensor technology coupled with our internally developed software to effectively monitor a person remotely. In continuing care communities, SafeSpace detects resident falls and generates alerts to a centralized, intelligent dashboard without the use of wearable devices or any action by the resident. In the home, SafeSpace detects falls and sends alerts directly to designated individuals.
 
In addition to SafeSpace, we are creating a home concierge healthcare service application to provide a virtual assisted living experience for seniors, recently released postoperative patients, and others. The concierge application will enable the consumer to obtain home healthcare services and health and safety monitoring equipment to improve quality of life. We are also working to develop a fully integrated solution for the professional healthcare community that integrates electronic health records, remote patient monitoring, telehealth, and other items where integration is beneficial.
 
Our History
 
The Company has had three distinct businesses. First, we were incorporated in the state of Nevada on June 25, 2013 as Tomichi Creek Outfitters, aiming to provide professionally guided big game hunts in Sargents, Colorado which is approximately four hours southwest from Denver. This area of the country is home to trophy size Elk and Mule Deer. Our secondary business included offering guided scenic tours on the western slopes of the Rocky Mountains. Every season offers a diversified plethora of wildlife and stunning scenic views. Our Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) and sole director at that time was Jeremy Gindro. These operations were discontinued in 2015.
 
Second, on March 2, 2015, the Company entered into a Business Acquisition Agreement and share exchange under which we acquired the business and assets of Grasshopper Staffing, Inc. (“Grasshopper Colorado”), formed in the state of Colorado on January 13, 2015. The exchange for $10,651 was represented by 250,000 shares of the Company’s common stock in exchange for all the outstanding shares of Grasshopper Colorado. The assets purchased include the trademark and website, office supplies and office furniture. On November 2, 2015 we filed a Certificate of Amendment to our Articles of Incorporation changing the name of our Company from Tomichi Creek Outfitters to Grasshopper Staffing, Inc. Grasshopper Colorado was operating as a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company and was the primary operation of our business until the acquisition of IndeLiving Holdings Inc., on March 13, 2018. Our management consisted of Melanie Osterman as CEO, and Jeremy Gindro who was our sole director. The operations of Grasshopper Colorado were discontinued in February 2019.
 
Third, we acquired IndeLiving Holdings, Inc. (“IndeLiving”) on March 13, 2018 and changed our name to Healthcare Integrated Technologies, Inc. Our current operations are described above. With the acquisition of IndeLiving, we had another change in management, and Scott M. Boruff became CEO and sole director of the Company.
