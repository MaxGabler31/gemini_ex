ITEM 1 – Business
General Development of Business
Founded in 1870 by George H. Tennant, Tennant Company, a Minnesota corporation incorporated in 1909, began as a one-man woodworking business, evolved into a successful wood flooring and wood products company, and eventually into a manufacturer of floor cleaning equipment. Throughout its history, Tennant has remained focused on advancing our industry by aggressively pursuing new technologies and creating a culture that celebrates innovation.
Today, Tennant Company is a recognized leader of the cleaning industry. We are passionate about developing innovative and sustainable solutions that help our customers clean spaces more effectively, addressing indoor and outdoor cleaning challenges. Tennant Company operates in three geographic business units including the Americas, Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) and Asia Pacific (APAC). In April 2017, Tennant Company completed its acquisition of the IPC Group, a multi-brand manufacturer of a broad range of cleaning and accessory equipment. With primary operations in Italy, the IPC Group significantly enhances Tennant's position in the EMEA region and brings to Tennant a broader product offering.
Tennant Company is committed to empowering our customers to create a cleaner, safer and healthier world with high-performance solutions that minimize waste, reduce costs, improve safety and further sustainability goals.

Principal Products, Markets and Distribution
The Company offers products and solutions consisting of mechanized cleaning equipment, detergent-free and other sustainable cleaning technologies, aftermarket parts and consumables, equipment maintenance and repair service, specialty surface coatings, and business solutions such as financing, rental and leasing programs, and machine-to-machine asset management solutions. 


The Company's products are used in many types of environments including: Retail establishments, distribution centers, factories and warehouses, public venues such as arenas and stadiums, office buildings, schools and universities, hospitals and clinics, parking lots and streets, and more. The Company markets its offerings under the following brands: Tennant®, Nobles®, Green Machines™, Alfa Uma Empresa Tennant™, IRIS®, Superior Anodes, Waterstar and Orbio®. Orbio Technologies, which markets and sells Orbio-branded products and solutions, is a group created by the Company to focus on expanding the opportunities for the emerging category of On-Site Generation (OSG). OSG technologies create and dispense effective cleaning and antimicrobial solutions on site within a facility. Customers include contract cleaners to whom organizations outsource facilities maintenance, as well as businesses that perform facilities maintenance themselves. The Company reaches these customers through the industry's largest direct sales and service organization and through a strong and well-supported network of authorized distributors worldwide.
In April 2017, the Company completed its acquisition of the IPC Group business ("IPC"). IPC manufactures a complete range of commercial cleaning products including mechanized cleaning equipment, wet & dry vacuum cleaners, cleaning tools & carts and high pressure washers. These products are sold into similar vertical market applications as those listed above, but also into office cleaning and hospitality vertical markets through a global direct sales and service organization and network of distributors. IPC markets products and services under the following valued brands: IPC, Gansow, Vaclensa, Portotecnica, Soteco and private-label brands.
Raw Materials
The Company has not experienced any significant or unusual problems in the availability of raw materials or other product components. The Company has sole-source vendors for certain components. A disruption in supply from such vendors may disrupt the Company’s operations. However, the Company believes that it can find alternate sources in the event there is a disruption in supply from such vendors.
Intellectual Property
Although the Company considers that its patents, proprietary technologies and trade secrets, customer relationships, licenses, trademarks, trade names and brand names in the aggregate constitute a valuable asset, it does not regard its business as being materially dependent upon any single item or category of intellectual property. We take appropriate measures to protect our intellectual property to the extent such intellectual property can be protected.
Seasonality
Although the Company’s business is not seasonal in the traditional sense, the percentage of revenues in each quarter typically ranges from 22% to 28% of the total year. The first quarter tends to be at the low end of the range reflecting customers’ initial slow ramp up of capital purchases and the Company’s efforts to close out orders at the end of each year. The second and fourth quarters tend to be towards the high end of the range and the third quarter is typically in the middle of the range.

Backlog
The Company processes orders within two weeks, on average. Therefore, no significant backlogs existed at December 31, 2017 and 2016.
Competition
Public industry data concerning global market share is limited; however, through an assessment of validated third party sources and sponsored third party market studies, the Company is confident in its position as a world-leading manufacturer of floor maintenance and cleaning equipment. Several global competitors compete with Tennant in virtually every geography of the world. However, small regional competitors are also significant competitors who vary by country, vertical market, product category or channel. The Company competes primarily on the basis of offering a broad line of high-quality, innovative products supported by an extensive sales and service network in major markets.
Research and Development
Tennant Company has a history of developing innovative technologies to create a cleaner, safer, healthier world. The Company is committed to its innovation leadership position through fulfilling its goal to annually invest 3% to 4% of annual sales to research and development. The Company’s innovation efforts are focused on solving our customers’ needs holistically addressing a broad array of issues, such as managing labor costs, enhancing productivity, and making cleaning processes more efficient and sustainable.  Through core product development, partnerships and technology enablement we are creating new growth avenues for Tennant. These new avenues for growth go beyond cleaning equipment into business insights and service solutions. In 2017, 2016 and 2015, the Company spent $32.0 million, $34.7 million and $32.4 million on research and development, respectively.
Environmental Compliance
Compliance with Federal, State and local provisions which have been enacted or adopted regulating the discharge of materials into the environment, or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment, has not had, and the Company does not expect it to have, a material effect upon the Company’s capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position.
