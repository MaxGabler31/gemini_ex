Item 1. Business
Company Overview
The Andersons, Inc. (the "Company") is a diversified company rooted in agriculture. Founded in Maumee, Ohio in 1947, the Company is a significant player in the North American agricultural supply chain and conducts its business in the trade, renewables, and plant nutrient sectors. 
Segment Descriptions
The Company's operations are classified into three reportable business segments: Trade, Renewables, and Plant Nutrient. Each of these segments is organized based upon the nature of products and services offered and aligns with the management structure. See Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 for information regarding business segments.
Trade
The Trade Group is a diversified business focusing on logistics and merchandising across a wide range of commodities. The group specializes in the movement of physical commodities such as: whole grains, grain products, feed ingredients, domestic fuel products, and other agricultural commodities. The business also operates grain elevators across the U.S. and Canada where income is earned on commodities bought and sold through the elevator, commodities that are purchased and conditioned for resale, and commodities that are held in inventory until a future period, earning space income. Space income consists of appreciation or depreciation in the basis value of commodities held and represents the difference between the cash price of a commodity in one of the Company's facilities and an exchange traded futures price (“basis”); appreciation or depreciation between the future exchange contract months (“spread”); and commodities stored for others upon which storage fees are earned. The Trade Group business also offers a number of unique grain marketing, risk management and origination services to its customers and affiliated ethanol facilities for which it collects fees.
Sales are negotiated by the Company's merchandising staff as commodity prices are not predetermined. The Trade Group has a diversified portfolio of physical commodities that are sold, however, the principal commodities sold by the Company are corn, wheat and soybeans which are consistent with the prior year. Most of the Company's exported commodity sales are made through intermediaries while some commodities are shipped directly to foreign countries, mainly Canada. The Company ships grain from its facilities by rail, truck, or boat. Rail shipments are made primarily to grain processors and feeders with some rail shipments made to exporters on the Gulf of Mexico or east coast. Boat shipments are from the Port of Toledo, the Port of Houston or the Port of Oswego. In addition, commodities are transported via direct ship transactions in which suppliers sell grain to the Company, but delivered directly to domestic and international end users.
The Company's trade operations rely principally on forward purchase contracts with producers, dealers and commercial elevators to ensure an adequate supply of commodities to the Company's facilities throughout the year. The Company makes commodity purchases at prices referenced to regulated commodity exchanges.
The Company competes in the sale of commodities with other public and private grain brokers, elevator operators and farmer owned cooperative elevators. Some of the Company's competitors are also its customers. Competition is based primarily on price, service and reliability. Because the Company often buys in smaller lots, its competition for the purchase of commodities is generally local or regional in scope, although there are some large national and international companies that maintain regional grain purchase and storage facilities. Significant portions of grain bushels purchased and sold are made using forward contracts. 
The Group's asset based grain handling business is seasonal in nature in that the largest portion of the principal grains are harvested and delivered from the farm and commercial elevators typically in July for wheat and September through November for corn and soybeans, although a significant portion of the principal grains are bought, sold and handled throughout the year.

Fixed price purchase and sale commitments as well as commodities held in inventory expose the Company to risks related to adverse changes in market prices. Grain prices are typically comprised of two components, futures prices on regulated commodity exchanges and local basis adjustments. The Company manages the futures price risk by entering into exchange-traded futures and option contracts with regulated commodity exchanges. The contracts are economic hedges of price risk but are not designated or accounted for as hedging instruments. These regulated commodity exchanges maintain futures markets for the grains merchandised by the Company. Futures prices are determined by worldwide supply and demand.
The Company's grain risk management practices are designed to reduce the risk of changing commodity prices. In that regard, such practices also limit potential gains from further changes in market prices. The Company has policies that provide key controls over its risk management practices. These policies include a description of the objectives of the programs and review of daily position limits along with other internal controls. The Company monitors current market conditions and may expand or reduce the purchasing program in response to changes in those conditions. In addition, the Company monitors its counterparties on a regular basis for credit worthiness, defaults and non-delivery.
Purchases of commodities can be made the day the product is delivered to a terminal or via a forward contract made prior to actual delivery. Sales of commodities generally are made by contract for delivery in a future period. When the Company purchases commodities at a fixed price or at a price where a component of the purchase price is fixed via reference to a futures price on a regulated commodity exchange, it also enters into an offsetting sale of a futures contract on the regulated commodity exchange. Similarly, when the Company sells commodities at a fixed price, the sale is offset with the purchase of a futures contract on the regulated commodity exchange. At the close of business each day, inventory and open purchase and sale contracts as well as open futures and option positions are marked-to-market. Gains and losses in the value of the Company's ownership positions due to changing market prices are netted with, and substantially offset in the Statement of Operations by, losses and gains in the value of the Company's futures positions.
When a futures contract is entered into, an initial margin deposit must be sent to the regulated commodity exchange. The amount of the margin deposit is set by the regulated commodity exchange and varies by commodity. If the market price of a futures contract moves in a direction that is adverse to the Company's position, an additional margin deposit, called a maintenance margin, is required by regulated commodity exchanges. Subsequent price changes could require additional maintenance margin deposits or result in the return of maintenance margin deposits by the regulated commodity exchange. Significant increases in market prices, such as those that occur when grain supplies are affected by unfavorable weather conditions and/or when increases in demand occur, can have an effect on the Company's liquidity and, as a result, require it to maintain appropriate short-term lines of credit. The Company may utilize regulated commodity exchange option contracts to limit its exposure to potential required margin deposits in the event of a rapidly rising market.
The Company has a lease and marketing agreement with Cargill, Incorporated ("Cargill") for Cargill's Maumee and Toledo, Ohio grain handling and storage facilities. As part of the agreement, Cargill holds certain marketing rights to grain in the Cargill-owned facilities as well as the adjacent Company-owned facilities in Maumee and Toledo. The marketing agreement contains a profit-sharing provision whereby cumulative earnings generated from the grain facilities are contractually shared. As of December 31, 2021, the lease of the Cargill-owned facilities covers approximately 5%, or 8.8 million bushels, of the Company's total storage capacity.
Renewables
The Renewables Group (formerly the Ethanol Group) produces, purchases and sells ethanol and co-products, offers facility operations, risk management, and ethanol and co-products marketing services to the ethanol plants it invests in and operates. The group was rebranded in 2021 to reflect the strategic shift and focus on serving the broader renewables market, including renewable diesel and our ethanol plants. The group co-owns five ethanol plants located in Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Michigan and Ohio. The group demonstrates an expertise in ethanol plant management, logistics and commercialization of ethanol and feed products with a focus on leading the industry in margins per bushel. The business also leverages partnerships, which are discussed in further detail below, to expand market knowledge and shared technology across its five plants. The group also operates a merchandising and trade portfolio of ethanol, ethanol co-products and other biofuels such as renewable diesel.

Through the first nine months of 2019 the Renewables Group held ownership interests in three limited liability companies (“the ethanol LLCs” or “LLCs”), each of which owned an ethanol plant that was operated by the Company's Renewables Group. On October 1, 2019, the Renewables Group entered into an agreement to merge the LLCs and the Company's wholly-owned subsidiary, The Andersons Denison Ethanol LLC into a new legal entity, The Andersons Marathon Holdings LLC ("TAMH"). As a result of the merger, the Company and Marathon Petroleum Corporation ("Marathon") own 50.1% and 49.9% of TAMH equity, respectively. The transaction resulted in the consolidation of TAMH’s results in the Company's financial statements effective October 1, 2019. Prior to October 1, 2019, the results of the Ethanol LLCs were accounted for under the equity method of accounting. The four ethanol plants within TAMH are located in Iowa, Indiana, Michigan, and Ohio. These plants have a combined production capacity of 480 million gallons of ethanol, with a nameplate capacity of 405 million gallons.
The Company also owns 51% of ELEMENT, LLC ("ELEMENT") and ICM, Inc. ("ICM") owns the remaining 49% interest. In 2019, ELEMENT completed the construction of a 70 million-gallon-per-year bio-refinery in Kansas which began limited production in the third quarter of 2019. ICM managed the initial construction of the facility, while the Company operates the facility under a management contract, provides corn origination, ethanol marketing, and risk management services. The Company fully consolidates ELEMENT's results in the Company's financial statements.

Government Regulation
Grain sold by the Company must conform to official grade standards imposed under a federal system of grain grading and inspection administered by the United States Department of Agriculture (“USDA”).
The production levels, markets and prices of the grains that the Company merchandises are affected by United States government programs, which include acreage control and price support programs of the USDA. In regard to our investments in ethanol production facilities, the U.S. government has mandated a ten percent blend for motor fuel gasoline sold. 
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) has developed bioterrorism prevention regulations for food facilities, which require that the Company registers its grain operations with the FDA, provide prior notice of any imports of food or other agricultural commodities coming into the United States and maintain records to be made available upon request that identifies the immediate previous sources and immediate subsequent recipients of its grain commodities.
