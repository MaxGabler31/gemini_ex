Item 1. Business
Overview
We are a biopharmaceutical company focused on the acquisition, development and commercialization of novel targeted therapies for blood-related cancers that offer a unique benefit to patients and their healthcare providers. Our goal is to build a profitable company by generating income from products we develop and commercialize, either alone or with partners. We concentrate our efforts on treatments that target blood-related cancers where there is an unmet medical need and are primarily focused on evaluating pacritinib for the treatment of adult patients with myelofibrosis.
Pacritinib
Our primary development candidate, pacritinib, is an investigational oral kinase inhibitor with specificity for JAK2, FLT3, IRAK1 and CSF1R. The JAK family of enzymes is a central component in signal transduction pathways, which are critical to normal blood cell growth and development, as well as inflammatory cytokine expression and immune responses. Mutations in these kinases have been shown to be directly related to the development of a variety of blood-related cancers, including myeloproliferative neoplasms, leukemia and lymphoma. In addition to myelofibrosis, the kinase profile of pacritinib suggests its potential therapeutic utility in conditions such as acute myeloid leukemia, or AML, myelodysplastic syndrome, or MDS, chronic myelomonocytic leukemia, or CMML, and chronic lymphocytic leukemia, or CLL, due to its inhibition of c-fms, IRAK1, JAK2 and FLT3. We believe pacritinib has the potential to be delivered as a single agent or in combination therapy regimens.
Pacritinib was evaluated in two Phase 3 clinical trials, known as the PERSIST program, for patients with myelofibrosis, with one trial in a broad set of patients without limitations on platelet counts, the PERSIST-1 trial, and the other in patients with low platelet counts, the PERSIST-2 trial. 
In May 2015, we announced the final results from PERSIST-1, our Phase 3 trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of pacritinib compared to the Best Available Therapy, or BAT, excluding JAK2 inhibitors, which included a broad range of currently utilized treatments, in 327 patients with myelofibrosis regardless of the patients' platelet counts. The study included patients with severe or life-threatening thrombocytopenia. Patients were randomized to receive 400 mg pacritinib once daily or BAT, excluding JAK2 inhibitors. The trial met its primary endpoint of spleen volume reduction, or SVR, (35 percent or greater from baseline to Week 24 by magnetic resonance imaging, or MRI, or computerized tomography, or CT). The most common treatment-emergent adverse events, or AEs, occurring in 20 percent or more of patients treated with pacritinib within 24 weeks, of any grade, were gastrointestinal (generally manageable diarrhea and nausea) and anemia.
On February 8, 2016, clinical studies under the investigational new drug, or IND, for pacritinib were placed on a full clinical hold issued by the FDA. A full clinical hold is an order to suspend investigations performed under the IND application. Under the full clinical hold, all patients on pacritinib at the time were required to discontinue pacritinib immediately and no patients could be enrolled or start pacritinib as initial or crossover treatment. In its written notification, the FDA stated that the reasons for the full clinical hold were that it noted interim overall survival results from the PERSIST-2 Phase 3 trial showing a detrimental effect on survival consistent with the results from PERSIST-1, as well as hemorrhagic/cardiac toxicities. The FDA had placed a partial hold on pacritinib on February 4, 2016.
In February 2016, prior to the clinical hold, we completed patient enrollment in the PERSIST-2 Phase 3 clinical trial. Under the full clinical hold, all patients participating in the PERSIST-2 clinical trial discontinued pacritinib treatment.
In August 2016, we announced the top-line results from PERSIST-2, our second Phase 3 trial of pacritinib for the treatment of patients with myelofibrosis whose platelet counts are less than or equal to 100,000 per microliter. Three hundred eleven (311) patients were enrolled in the study, which formed the basis for the safety analysis. Two hundred twenty-one (221) patients reached Week 24 (the primary analysis time point) at the time the clinical hold was imposed and constituted the intent-to-treat analysis population utilized for the evaluation of efficacy. Results demonstrated that the PERSIST-2 trial met one of the co-primary endpoints showing a statistically significant SVR in patients treated with pacritinib compared to BAT, including the approved JAK2 inhibitor ruxolitinib. The co-primary endpoint of reduction of Total Symptom Score, or TSS, was not achieved but trended toward improvement in TSS. There was no significant difference in overall survival across treatment arms, censored at the time of clinical hold. The most common treatment-emergent AEs, occurring in 20 percent or more of patients treated with pacritinib within 24 weeks, of any grade, were gastrointestinal (generally manageable diarrhea, nausea and vomiting) and hematologic (anemia and thrombocytopenia). Details of the trial were presented in a late-breaking 
3

oral session at the American Society of Hematology Annual Meeting in December 2016. Subsequently, the results were published in JAMA Oncology in May 2018.
In January 2017, the FDA removed the full clinical hold following review of our complete response submission which included, among other items, final Clinical Study Reports for both the PERSIST-1 and 2 trials and FDA agreement on a proposed study design for a dose-exploration clinical trial (PAC203). At that time, the PAC203 trial was designed to enroll up to approximately 105 patients with primary myelofibrosis and who had failed prior ruxolitinib therapy across three dose regimens of pacritinib, 100 mg QD, 100 mg BID and 200 mg BID, to evaluate the dose response relationship for safety and efficacy (SVR at 12 and 24 weeks). The 200 mg BID dose was selected as the top dose based upon observations from the completed PERSIST-2 study. In PAC203, the entry criteria were modified to exclude patients with a history of cardiac and/or bleeding events and additional dose modification guidelines were implemented for the management of treatment-emergent cardiac and or bleeding events. The first patient in the PAC203 trial was enrolled in July 2017. In April 2018, we amended the protocol to expand the sample size to a maximum of 150 patients (or 50 patients per arm) to collect additional data for the safety and efficacy analyses. In July 2018, we announced that the independent data monitoring committee, or IDMC, for the PAC203 trial completed its planned interim data review of the PAC203 trial and that the IDMC did not identify any drug- or dose-related safety concerns and did not identify any concerns about cardiac or bleeding events. Following meetings with the FDA and EMA and consultation with the IDMC, we eliminated the interim efficacy analysis and focused the second interim data review, and all subsequent data reviews, on an assessment of safety. The protocol was amended to reflect this change and submitted to FDA. In October 2018, we announced the continuation of the PAC203 Phase 2 study without modification, following a planned second interim data review by the IDMC. The IDMC did not identify significant drug- or dose-related safety concerns and specifically did not identify any concerns around hemorrhagic or cardiac toxicity. A complete dataset from the fully enrolled study (including efficacy, safety, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data) will be used to determine the optimal dose of pacritinib for further clinical development, as requested by the FDA.The PAC203 study was fully enrolled in December 2018. In January 2019, the IDMC completed its planned third interim safety review and recommended that the study continue without modification.We expect to report the determination of the optimal dose of pacritinib in mid-2019 following a meeting with the FDA and top-line efficacy and safety data from the study are expected to be reported at a major medical meeting by the end of 2019. 
In July 2018, we attended a Type B meeting with the FDA to discuss the proposed regulatory pathway for pacritinib. Based on FDA feedback at that meeting, we plan to conduct a randomized Phase 3 study of pacritinib in patients with myelofibrosis. We anticipate the dose and dosing schedule for the Phase 3 study will be determined using the results of the PAC203 study. We attended a Type C meeting with the FDA in December 2018 and received input on key elements of the design of the new randomized Phase 3 study of pacritinib in adult patients with myelofibrosis (primary myelofibrosis, post-polycythemia vera myelofibrosis, or post-essential thrombocythemia myelofibrosis) and who have severe thrombocytopenia (as defined by patients with platelet counts of less than 50,000 per microliter), an indication that has been recognized by the medical community as an important unmet medical need. The planned Phase 3 study is designed to evaluate the effects of pacritinib as compared to physician’s choice of treatment. The primary efficacy endpoint will be the proportion of patients achieving a greater than or equal to 35% SVR between baseline and Week 24. Secondary efficacy endpoints of the study include TSS reduction and overall survival. Before commencing the Phase 3 study, we plan to seek FDA advice on the proposed final protocol design and seek scientific advice from European countries to support alignment on the Phase 3 study design. To expedite the transition to Phase 3, we intend to amend the PAC203 protocol to include a Phase 3 component, with enrollment anticipated to commence following our determination of the optimal dose of pacritinib, which we expect to report in mid-2019. 
The original Marketing Authorization Application, or MAA, for pacritinib was submitted to the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, in February 2016 with an indication statement based on the PERSIST-1 trial data. In its initial assessment report, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, or CHMP, determined that the original application was not approvable at that point in the review cycle because of major objections in the areas of efficacy, safety (hematological and cardiovascular toxicity) and the overall risk-benefit profile of pacritinib. Subsequent to the filing of the original MAA, data from the second Phase 3 trial of pacritinib, PERSIST-2, were reported. 
Following discussions with the EMA about how PERSIST-2 data might address the major objections and how to integrate the data into the current application, we withdrew the original MAA, and submitted a new application for the treatment of patients with myelofibrosis who have thrombocytopenia (platelet counts less than 100,000 per microliter). The new MAA was validated by the EMA in July 2017. Validation confirms that the submission is complete and initiates the centralized review process by the CHMP.  The CHMP review period is 210 days, excluding extension, question or opinion response periods, after which the CHMP opinion is reviewed by the European Commission, which usually issues a final decision on E.U. authorization within three months. If authorized, pacritinib would be granted a marketing license valid in all 28 E.U. member states, Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein.

We received the Day 120 List of Questions, or LoQ, in November 2017, which included Major Objections in areas including efficacy, safety (including hematological, cardiovascular and infectious toxicities) and other concerns including the size of the data set and the pharmacokinetic analyses of the two dosing regimens studied in PERSIST-2. A request for an extension was submitted following a clarification meeting with the rapporteur, co-rapporteur and members of the EMA to provide the EMA with data from PAC203, and in January 2018, we were granted a three-month extension for submitting our response to the Day 120 LoQs. In December 2017 a preapproval GCP inspection of the PERSIST-2 clinical study was conducted by the EMA. In February 2018, the EMA issued its final GCP inspection report, which concluded that the PERSIST-2 clinical trial was generally conducted in compliance with GCP and internationally accepted ethical standards, that the deficient safety reporting procedures identified as inspection findings did not pose a direct risk to data quality and that the results from the PERSIST-2 clinical trial can be used for the evaluation and assessment of the MAA. In July 2018, we received the Day 180 LoQs and were granted a two-month extension to allow us to submit a snapshot of clinical data from the ongoing PAC203 study with our responses to the remaining list of questions. In the third quarter of 2018, we submitted comprehensive responses to the Day 180 LoQs, which included new data from the PAC203 trial. In November 2018, we received a second round of questions related to the Day 180 List of Outstanding Issues. We submitted responses to these additional questions, which included data from the ongoing open label PAC203 trial, in December 2018. We withdrew the MAA in February 2019 following interactions with CHMP, during which we learned that CHMP was likely to formally adopt a negative opinion in its evaluation of the application. CHMP indicated that the risk-benefit profile for pacritinib for the intended indication has not been sufficiently established with the clinical data available to date. 
PIXUVRI
PIXUVRI is a novel aza-anthracenedione with unique structural and physiochemical properties. In May 2012, the European Commission granted conditional marketing authorization in the European Union, or the E.U., for PIXUVRI as a monotherapy for the treatment of adult patients with multiply relapsed or refractory aggressive B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma, or NHL. As part of the conditional marketing authorization in the E.U., we were required to conduct a post-authorization trial, which we refer to as PIX306, comparing PIXUVRI and rituximab with gemcitabine and rituximab in the setting of aggressive B-cell NHL and follicular grade 3 lymphoma. Enrollment for PIX306 was completed in August 2017 and, in July 2018, we and Les Laboratoires Servier and Institut de Recherches Internationales Servier, or together, Servier, announced that PIXUVRI plus rituximab did not show a statistically significant improvement in progression-free survival compared to gemcitabine plus rituximab. In February 2019, we and Servier agreed to mutually terminate our collaborative relationship. For more information on the termination of our agreement with Servier, see the section of this report captioned “- License Agreements - Servier.”
Our Strategy 
Our objective is to become a leader in the acquisition, development and commercialization of novel therapeutics for the treatment of blood-related cancers. The key elements of our strategy to achieve these objectives are to:

• | Develop Pacritinib in Myelofibrosis. We intend to develop and commercialize pacritinib for adult patients with myelofibrosis.


• | Evaluate Strategic Product Collaborations to Accelerate Development and Commercialization. Where we believe it may be beneficial, we intend to evaluate additional collaborations to broaden and accelerate clinical trial development and potential commercialization of our product candidates. Collaborations have the potential to generate non-equity based operating capital, supplement our own internal expertise and provide us with access to the marketing, sales and distribution capabilities of our collaborators in specific territories.


• | Identify and Acquire Additional Pipeline Opportunities. Historically, we have built our candidate pipeline using multiple approaches, including through licensing and acquiring assets that we believe were initially undervalued opportunities. We plan to continue to seek out additional product candidates in an opportunistic manner.

Oncology Market Overview and Opportunity
According to the American Cancer Society, or ACS, cancer is the second leading cause of death in the U.S., resulting in more than 600,000 deaths annually, or more than 1,600 people per day. Approximately 1.8 million new cases of cancer are expected to be diagnosed in 2019 in the U.S. While the exact prevalence of myelofibrosis is uncertain, a U.S. study presented at the 2012 American Society of Hematology reported a prevalence rate of 5.7 myelofibrosis cases per 100,000 people, indicating that there are approximately 18,000 myelofibrosis patients in the U.S. The most commonly used methods for treating patients with cancer are surgery, radiation and chemotherapy. Patients usually receive a combination of these treatments depending upon the type and extent of their disease. 
We believe our expertise in blood-related cancers, together with our ability to identify unique therapies that address unmet medical needs that are potentially less toxic and more effective at treating and curing patients, may fill a significant unmet medical need for cancer patients.
Pacritinib
Overview
Our primary development candidate, pacritinib, is an investigational oral kinase inhibitor with specificity for JAK2, FLT3, IRAK1 and CSF1R. The JAK family of enzymes is a central component in signal transduction pathways, which are critical to normal blood cell growth and development, as well as inflammatory cytokine expression and immune responses. Mutations in these kinases have been shown to be directly related to the development of a variety of blood-related cancers, including myeloproliferative neoplasms, leukemia and lymphoma. In addition to myelofibrosis, the kinase profile of pacritinib suggests its potential therapeutic utility in conditions such as acute myeloid leukemia, or AML, MDS, chronic myelomonocytic leukemia, or CMML, and CLL due to its inhibition of c-fms, IRAK1, JAK2 and FLT3. We believe pacritinib has the potential to be delivered as a single agent or in combination therapy regimens.
In August 2014, pacritinib was granted Fast Track designation by the FDA for the treatment of intermediate and high risk myelofibrosis, including, but not limited to patients with disease-related thrombocytopenia (low platelet counts); patients experiencing treatment-emergent thrombocytopenia on other JAK2 inhibitor therapy; or patients who are intolerant of or whose symptoms are not well controlled (sub-optimally managed) on other JAK2 therapy. The FDA’s Fast Track process is designed to facilitate the development and expedite the review of drugs to treat serious conditions and fill an unmet medical need.

Pacritinib was evaluated in two Phase 3 clinical trials, known as the PERSIST program, for patients with myelofibrosis, with one trial in a broad set of patients without limitations on platelet counts, the PERSIST-1 trial; and the other in patients with low platelet counts, the PERSIST-2 trial. Myelofibrosis is a rare blood cancer associated with significantly reduced quality of life and shortened survival. As the disease progresses, the body slows production of important blood cells and within one year of diagnosis, the incidence of disease-related thrombocytopenia (very low blood platelet counts), severe anemia and red blood cell transfusion requirements increase significantly. Among other complications, most patients with myelofibrosis present with enlarged spleens (splenomegaly), as well as many other potentially devastating physical symptoms such as abdominal discomfort, bone pain, feeling full after eating little, severe itching, night sweats and extreme fatigue. Currently patients with very low blood platelets (<50,000/µL) or those ineligible to receive, intolerant of or have insufficient response to the approved JAK1/JAK2 inhibitor have limited or no effective treatment options. Patients have poor survival following discontinuation of therapy with the approved JAK1/JAK2 therapy. We believe pacritinib may offer effective treatment of splenomegaly and disease-related symptoms in patients with severe thrombocytopenia and/or in patients with prior exposure to an approved JAK1/JAK2 inhibitor.
PERSIST-1 was a randomized (2:1), open-label, multi-center Phase 3 trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of pacritinib compared to BAT excluding JAK inhibitors, in 327 patients with myelofibrosis, without exclusion for low platelet counts. The primary endpoint for PERSIST-1 was the proportion of patients achieving a 35 percent or greater SVR from baseline to Week 24 as measured by MRI or CT, when compared with physician-specified BAT, excluding treatment with JAK2 inhibitors. The secondary endpoint was the percentage of patients achieving a 50 percent or greater reduction in TSS from baseline to week 24 as measured by tracking specific symptoms on a form, or Patient Reported Outcome, or PRO, instrument. At study entry, 46 percent of patients were thrombocytopenic; 32 percent of patients had platelet counts less than 100,000 per microliter (<100,000/µL); and 16 percent of patients had platelet counts less than 50,000 per microliter (<50,000/µL); normal platelet counts range from 150,000 to 450,000 per microliter. At the time of initiation of the trial, PERSIST-1 utilized the Myeloproliferative Neoplasm Symptom Assessment Form, or MPN-SAF TSS, the PRO instrument developed by Mayo Clinic, to measure TSS reduction. We collaborated with Mayo Clinic and the FDA and developed a modified instrument to be used as the endpoint for pacritinib clinical development. As a result, we amended the PERSIST-1 trial protocol to replace the original MPN-SAF TSS instrument with a new instrument, known as the MPN-SAF TSS 2.0, which was also used for recording patient-reported outcomes for the PERSIST-2 trial. In connection with this amendment, we increased patient enrollment in the PERSIST-1 study from 270 to 327 patients.
In May 2015, data from PERSIST-1 showed that compared to BAT (exclusive of a JAK inhibitor) pacritinib therapy resulted in a significantly higher proportion of patients with SVR and control of disease-related symptoms meeting the primary endpoint of the trial. 
The following table shows the proportion of patients randomized to pacritinib or BAT who achieved a ≥35% SVR from baseline at Week 24 or up to Week 24 in the intent-to-treat, or ITT, population or evaluable patient population. The greatest difference in treatment arms was observed in evaluable patients with the lowest platelet counts (<50,000/µL platelets) (33.3 percent with pacritinib vs 0 percent with BAT) (p=0.037).

Results from PERSIST-1 PRO and other quality of life measures showed significant improvements in symptom score with pacritinib therapy compared to BAT (exclusive of a JAK inhibitor) across the symptoms reported in the presentation. Patients treated with pacritinib experienced greater improvement in their disease-related symptoms (ITT patient population: 24.5 percent of pacritinib-treated patients vs 6.5 percent of BAT-treated patients, p<0.0001; evaluable patient population: 40.9 percent of pacritinib-treated patients vs 9.9 percent of BAT-treated patients, p<0.0001).
Additionally, 25 percent of patients treated with pacritinib who were severely anemic and transfusion dependent - requiring at least six units of blood in the 90 days prior to study entry - became transfusion independent, compared to zero patients treated with BAT (p<0.05). Among patients with the lowest baseline platelets (<50,000/µL) who received treatment with pacritinib, a significant increase in platelet counts was observed over time compared to BAT (p=0.003) - with a 35 percent increase in platelet counts from baseline to Week 24. 
The most common adverse events, occurring in 10 percent or more of patients treated with pacritinib within 24 weeks, of any grade, were: mild to moderate diarrhea, nausea, anemia, thrombocytopenia, and vomiting. Of the patients treated with pacritinib, 3 discontinued therapy and 13 patients required dose interruption (average one week) for diarrhea. Patients received a daily full dose of pacritinib over the duration of treatment. Gastrointestinal symptoms typically lasted for approximately one week and few patients discontinued treatment due to side effects. There were no Grade 4 gastrointestinal events reported. 

In December 2015, primarily based on the results of the PERSIST-1 trial, we submitted a NDA to the FDA, for pacritinib requesting U.S. marketing approval of pacritinib for the treatment of patients with intermediate and high-risk myelofibrosis with low platelet counts of less than 50,000 per microliter (<50,000/µL) for whom there are no approved therapies.
The PERSIST-2 trial was a randomized (2:1), open-label, multi-center registration-directed Phase 3 trial evaluating pacritinib compared to BAT, including the approved JAK inhibitor dosed according to product label, for patients with myelofibrosis whose platelet counts are less than or equal to 100,000 per microliter (≤100,000/µL). Patients were randomized to receive 200 mg pacritinib twice daily, 400 mg pacritinib once daily or BAT. In October 2013, we reached an agreement with the FDA on a Special Protocol Assessment, or SPA, for the PERSIST-2 trial regarding the planned design, endpoints and statistical analysis approach of the trial. The SPA is a written agreement between us and the FDA regarding the design, endpoints and planned statistical analysis approach of the trial to be used in support of a NDA submission. Under the SPA, the agreed upon co-primary endpoints are the percentage of patients achieving a 35% or greater SVR measured by MRI or CT scan from baseline to Week 24 of treatment and the percentage of patients achieving a TSS reduction of 50 percent or greater using eight key symptoms as measured by the modified MPN-SAF TSS 2.0 diary from baseline to Week 24. The design of PERSIST-1 and PERSIST-2 allowed for patients on the BAT arm to crossover and receive treatment with pacritinib if their disease progresses or after they achieve the 24-week measurement endpoint. Although crossover design of clinical trials may confound evaluation of survival, such designs are frequently used in cancer studies, and the FDA has approved multiple oncology drugs that utilized crossover design in Phase 3 trials.
In February 2015, we received a recommendation from the Independent Data Monitoring Committee, or IDMC, in place at the time to terminate the PERSIST-1 trial and hold enrollment of new patients in the PERSIST-2 trial. The IDMC’s recommendation was based on non-statistically significant safety concerns, including mortality, in patients on pacritinib, particularly those who crossover after 24 weeks. The IDMC agreed that the recommendation would be only preliminary until we were unblinded to and could review the primary and secondary endpoint data as well as safety results from the PERSIST-1 trial. The IDMC recommendation was reviewed with the PERSIST Steering Committee, comprised of external experts and the study’s principal investigators who disagreed with the IDMC’s recommendation and expressed the view that the studies should continue as planned. We also asked an independent clinician and a statistician experienced in oversight of clinical trial safety to evaluate the safety profile of pacritinib in the PERSIST-1 trial. Neither was told of the recommendation reached by either the IDMC or the Steering Committee. Both experts agreed with the Steering Committee that the studies could continue. The firm that assembled the IDMC hired a second external independent statistician to review the IDMC’s analyses and recommendation, who also disagreed with the IDMC recommendation and concurred with the other independent experts that the studies need not be terminated nor enrollment held. In June 2015, the IDMC made its recommendation final and we provided to the FDA the information reviewed by the IDMC, the IDMC’s meeting minutes, and the written opinion of the Steering Committee co-chairs, the independent experts, and the second independent statistician. In July 2015, we requested a meeting with the FDA to confirm if we should continue the studies. The FDA assigned the request to a type C meeting. In its written response, the FDA did not mandate any modifications to the studies or place pacritinib on clinical hold at that time, but indicated that it had not yet reviewed the data and noted the difficulty in attempting to draw meaningful conclusions from non-significant results, and that the crossover designs may confound the analysis of survival. We determined that no modifications to the ongoing trials were required. We decided to commission a new IDMC because of these concerns regarding the previous 
8

recommendation. The newly constituted IDMC met on several occasions and its recommendation was to continue PERSIST-2 as planned.
On February 8, 2016, the FDA notified us that a full clinical hold had been placed on pacritinib clinical studies. A full clinical hold is a suspension of the clinical work requested under the investigational new drug, or an IND, application. Under the full clinical hold, all patients on pacritinib at the time of the hold order were required to discontinue pacritinib immediately and no new patients could be enrolled or start pacritinib as initial or crossover treatment. In its written notification, the FDA cited the reasons for the full clinical hold were that it noted interim overall survival results from the PERSIST-2 Phase 3 trial showing a detrimental effect on survival consistent with the results from PERSIST-1. The deaths in PERSIST-2 in pacritinib-treated patients include intracranial hemorrhage, cardiac failure and cardiac arrest. In connection with the full clinical hold, the FDA recommended that we conduct Phase 1 dose exploration studies of pacritinib in patients with myelofibrosis, submit final clinical study reports, or CSRs, and datasets for PERSIST-1 and PERSIST-2, provide certain notifications, revise relevant statements in the related Investigator’s Brochure and informed consent documents and make certain modifications to protocols. In addition, the FDA recommended that we request a meeting prior to submitting a response to full clinical hold. As a result of the full clinical hold of pacritinib, the SPA agreement is no longer binding for PERSIST-2, and we withdrew the NDA.
In February 2016, prior to the clinical hold we completed patient enrollment in the PERSIST-2 Phase 3 clinical trial. Under the full clinical hold, all patients participating in the PERSIST-2 clinical trial discontinued pacritinib treatment.

In August 2016, we announced the top-line results from PERSIST-2. In the PERSIST-2 trial three hundred eleven (311) patients were randomized to receive 200 mg pacritinib BID, 400 mg pacritinib QD or BAT. Two hundred twenty-one (221) patients (74 pacritinib BID; 75 pacritinib QD; 72 BAT) were enrolled at least 24 weeks prior to the full clinical hold and were potentially evaluable for the Week 24 efficacy endpoint (ITT efficacy population). In the ITT efficacy population at study entry, 46 percent (101/221) of patients had platelet counts less than 50,000 per microliter (<50,000/µL), and 59 percent (130/221) were anemic (hemoglobin <10 g/dL). Normal platelet counts range from 150,000 to 450,000 per microliter. The percentage of patients in the ITT efficacy population who received prior ruxolitinib was as follows: 41 percent (31/75) pacritinib QD; 42 percent (31/74) pacritinib BID; and 46 percent (33/72) BAT. Safety analyses were based on all patients exposed to study treatment of any duration.
The co-primary endpoints of the trial were the proportion of patients achieving a 35 percent or greater SVR from baseline to Week 24 as measured by MRI or CT scan and the proportion of patients achieving a TSS reduction of 50 percent or greater using the modified MPN-SAF TSS 2.0 diary from baseline to Week 24. The primary objective of the study was to compare pooled pacritinib arms versus BAT and the secondary objectives were to compare pacritinib BID and QD arms individually to BAT. The study was designed to evaluate its objectives with a sample size of 300. At the time of clinical hold, study enrollment was completed with three hundred eleven (311) patients randomized, but only two hundred twenty one (221) patients had the potential to be evaluated for efficacy endpoints at Week 24.
The PERSIST-2 trial met one of the co-primary endpoints showing a statistically significant SVR in patients treated with pacritinib combining the once- and twice-daily arms compared to BAT. Although the PERSIST-2 trial did not meet the other co-primary endpoint of greater than 50 percent reduction in TSS, the results approached marginal significance compared to BAT. Although secondary objectives could not be evaluated formally due to the study not achieving one of the primary objectives, when the two pacritinib dosing arms were evaluated separately versus BAT, pacritinib given twice daily showed a higher percent of SVR and TSS responses compared to BAT; whereas, pacritinib given once daily showed only a higher percent SVR responses compared to BAT.

A total of 45 percent of the BAT patients randomized received ruxolitinib at some point on the study.
There was no significant difference in overall survival, or OS, across treatment arms, censored at the time of clinical hold. Hazard ratios (95% confidence intervals, or CI) were 0.68 (0.30-1.53) for pacritinib BID versus BAT and 1.18 (0.57-2.44) for pacritinib QD versus BAT. Overall mortality rates at that time were comparable between arms: 9 percent BID versus 14 percent QD and 14 percent BAT.
The most common treatment-emergent AEs, occurring in 20 percent or more of patients treated with pacritinib within 24 weeks, of any grade, were gastrointestinal (generally manageable diarrhea, nausea and vomiting) and hematologic (anemia and thrombocytopenia) and were generally less frequent for BID versus QD administration. The most common serious treatment-emergent AEs (incidence of ≥5 percent reported in any treatment arm irrespective of grade) were anemia, thrombocytopenia, pneumonia and acute renal failure none of which exceeded 8 percent individually in any arm.
In January 2017, the FDA removed the full clinical hold following review of our complete response submission which included, among other items, final Clinical Study Reports for both PERSIST-1 and 2 trials and a dose-exploration clinical trial protocol that the FDA requested. At that time, the PAC203 trial was designed to enroll up to approximately 105 patients with primary myelofibrosis and who had failed prior ruxolitinib therapy across three dose regimens of pacritinib, 100 mg QD, 100 mg BID and 200 mg BID, to evaluate the dose response relationship for safety and efficacy (SVR at 12 and 24 weeks). The 200 mg BID dose was selected as the top dose based upon observations from the completed PERSIST-2 study. In PAC203, the entry criteria were modified to exclude patients with a history of cardiac and/or bleeding events and additional dose modification guidelines were implemented for the management of treatment-emergent cardiac and or bleeding events. The first patient in the PAC203 trial was enrolled in July 2017. In April 2018, we amended the protocol to expand the sample size to a maximum of 150 patients (or 50 patients per arm) to collect additional data for the safety and efficacy analyses. In July 2018, we announced that the IDMC for the PAC203 trial completed its planned interim data review of the PAC203 trial and that the IDMC did not identify any drug- or dose-related safety concerns and did not identify any concerns about cardiac or bleeding events. Following meetings with the FDA and EMA and consultation with the IDMC, we eliminated the interim efficacy analysis and focused the second interim data review, and all subsequent data reviews, on an assessment of safety. The protocol was amended to reflect this change and submitted to FDA. In October 2018, we announced the continuation of the PAC203 Phase 2 study without modification, following a planned second interim data review by the IDMC. The IDMC did not identify significant drug- or dose-related safety concerns and specifically did not identify any concerns around hemorrhagic or cardiac toxicity. A complete dataset from the fully enrolled study (including efficacy, safety, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data) will be used to determine the optimal dose of pacritinib for further clinical development, as requested by the FDA. The PAC203 study was fully enrolled in December 2018. In January 2019, the IDMC completed its planned third interim safety review and recommended that the study continue without modification. We expect to report the determination of the optimal dose of pacritinib in mid-2019 following a meeting with the FDA and top-line efficacy and safety data from the study are expected to be reported at a major medical meeting by the end of 2019. 
In July 2018, we attended a Type B meeting with the FDA to discuss the proposed regulatory pathway for pacritinib. Based on FDA feedback at that meeting, we plan to conduct a randomized Phase 3 study of pacritinib in patients with myelofibrosis. We anticipated the dose and dosing schedule for the Phase 3 study will be determined using the results of the PAC203 study. We completed a Type C meeting with the FDA in December 2018 and received input from the FDA on key elements of the design of the new randomized Phase 3 study of pacritinib in adult patients with myelofibrosis (primary myelofibrosis, post-polycythemia vera myelofibrosis, or post-essential thrombocythemia myelofibrosis) and who have severe thrombocytopenia (as defined by patients with platelet counts of less than 50,000 per microliter), an indication that has been recognized by the medical community as an important unmet medical need. The planned Phase 3 study is designed to evaluate the effects of pacritinib as compared to physician’s choice of treatment. The primary efficacy endpoint will be the proportion of patients achieving a greater than or equal to 35% SVR between baseline and Week 24. Secondary efficacy endpoints of the study include TSS reduction and overall survival. Before commencing the Phase 3 study, we plan to seek FDA advice on the proposed final protocol design and seek scientific advice from European countries to support alignment on the Phase 3 study design. To expedite the transition to Phase 3, we intend to amend the PAC203 protocol to include a Phase 3 component, with enrollment anticipated to commence following our determination of the optimal dose of pacritinib, which we expect to report in mid-2019.
Marketing Authorization Application

The MAA for pacritinib was submitted to the EMA in February 2016 with an indication statement based on the PERSIST-1 trial data. In its initial assessment report, the CHMP determined that the original application was not approvable at 
10

that point in the review cycle because of major objections in the areas of efficacy, safety (hematological and cardiovascular toxicity) and the overall risk-benefit profile of pacritinib. Subsequent to the filing of the original MAA, data from the second Phase 3 trial of pacritinib, PERSIST-2, were reported. 
Following discussions with the EMA about how PERSIST-2 data might address the major objections and how to integrate the data into the current application, we withdrew the original MAA, and submitted a new application for the treatment of patients with myelofibrosis who have thrombocytopenia (platelet counts less than 100,000 per microliter). The new MAA was validated by the EMA in July 2017. Validation confirms that the submission is complete and initiates the centralized review process by the CHMP.  The CHMP review period is 210 days, excluding question or opinion response periods, after which the CHMP opinion is reviewed by the European Commission, which usually issues a final decision on E.U. authorization within three months. If authorized, pacritinib would be granted a marketing license valid in all 28 E.U. member states, Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein.
We received the Day 120 LoQ in November 2017, which included Major Objections in areas including efficacy, safety (including hematological, cardiovascular and infectious toxicities) and other concerns including the size of the data set and the pharmacokinetic analyses of the two dosing regimens studied in PERSIST-2. A request for an extension was submitted following a clarification meeting with the rapporteur, co-rapporteur and members of the EMA to provide the EMA with data from PAC203, and in January 2018, we were granted a three-month extension for submitting our response to the Day 120 LoQs. In December 2017 a preapproval GCP inspection of the PERSIST-2 clinical study was conducted by the EMA. In February 2018, the EMA issued its final GCP inspection report, which concluded that the PERSIST-2 clinical trial was generally conducted in compliance with GCP and internationally accepted ethical standards, that the deficient safety reporting procedures identified as inspection findings did not pose a direct risk to data quality and that the results from the PERSIST-2 clinical trial can be used for the evaluation and assessment of the MAA. In July 2018, we received the Day 180 LoQs and were granted a two-month extension to allow us to submit a snapshot of clinical data from the ongoing PAC203 study with our responses to the remaining list of questions. In the third quarter of 2018, we submitted comprehensive responses to the Day 180 LoQs, which included new data from the PAC203 trial. In November 2018, we received a second round of questions related to the Day 180 List of Outstanding Issues. We submitted responses to these additional questions, which included data from the ongoing open label PAC203 trial, in December 2018. We withdrew the MAA in February 2019 following interactions with CHMP, during which we learned that CHMP was likely to formally adopt a negative opinion in its evaluation of the application. CHMP indicated that the risk-benefit profile for pacritinib for the intended indication has not been sufficiently established with the clinical data available to date. 
Development in Other Indications 
In December 2014, we announced results of a preclinical analysis of kinase inhibition by pacritinib that demonstrated a unique kinome profile among agents in development for myelofibrosis and suggests potential therapeutic benefit across a spectrum of blood-related cancers. Pacritinib’s potent inhibition of IRAK1 and CSF1R highlight its potential therapeutic utility in other diseases, such as MDS, CLL, graft versus host disease, or GvHD, autoimmune diseases and breast cancer, some of which are currently being evaluated in investigator sponsored trials, or ISTs.
In October 2016, we regained worldwide rights for the development and commercialization of pacritinib following termination of the Pacritinib License Agreement with Baxalta. For additional information relating to the termination of the Pacritinib License Agreement, see “License Agreements - Baxalta” below. 
PIXUVRI
PIXUVRI is a novel aza-anthracenedione with unique structural and physiochemical properties. In May 2012, the European Commission granted conditional marketing authorization in the E.U., for PIXUVRI as a monotherapy for the treatment of adult patients with multiply relapsed or refractory aggressive B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma, or NHL. As part of the conditional marketing authorization in the E.U., we were required to conduct a post-authorization trial, which we refer to as PIX306, comparing PIXUVRI and rituximab with gemcitabine and rituximab in the setting of aggressive B-cell NHL and follicular grade 3 lymphoma. Enrollment for PIX306 was completed in August 2017 and, in July 2018, we and Servier announced that PIXUVRI plus rituximab did not show a statistically significant improvement in progression-free survival compared to gemcitabine plus rituximab. In February 2019, we and Servier agreed to mutually terminate our collaborative 
11

relationship. For additional information on our agreements with Servier, please see the discussion in “- License Agreements - Servier.”
Research and Development Expenses
Research and development is essential to our business. We spent $36.5 million and $32.9 million in 2018 and 2017, respectively, on company-sponsored research and development activities. The development of a product candidate involves inherent risks and uncertainties, including, among other things, that we cannot predict with any certainty the pace of enrollment of our clinical trials. As a result, we are unable to provide the nature, timing and estimated costs of the efforts necessary to complete the development of pacritinib. Even after a clinical trial is enrolled, preclinical and clinical data can be interpreted in different ways, which could delay, limit or preclude regulatory approval and advancement of this compound through the development process. For these reasons, among others, we cannot estimate the date on which clinical development of a product candidate will be completed or when, if ever, we will be able to commence commercialization of pacritinib. For additional information relating to our research and development expenses and associated risks, see Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Results of Operations - Years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 - Operating costs and expenses - Research and development expenses” and Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors.”
License Agreements
Servier
In April 2017, we entered into the Restated Agreement with Servier, pursuant to which we amended and restated our Exclusive License and Collaboration Agreement, or the Original Agreement, with Servier, entered into in September 2014. Under the Restated Agreement, we granted Servier an exclusive, sublicensable (subject to certain exceptions) license with respect to the development and commercialization of PIXUVRI for use in pharmaceutical products, or Licensed Products, outside of the U.S. (and its territories and possessions). In accordance with the Restated Agreement, we transferred to Servier medical affairs and commercialization activities relating to the Licensed Products in Austria, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Israel, Norway, Sweden, Turkey and the U.K., collectively referred to as the Transition Territory. We also terminated or assigned certain distributor and wholesaler contracts to Servier in the Transition Territory, which activities were completed in 2018. Pursuant to the Restated Agreement, each party has responsibility for the manufacture and supply of drug products and substances in its respective territory. In connection with the Restated Agreement, in October 2017, we and Servier entered into an amendment to our June 2015 trademark license agreement to provide for Servier’s right to use of our trademark PIXUVRI in connection with Licensed Products worldwide, excluding the U.S. (and its territories and possessions).
We received an upfront payment of €12.0 million from Servier, which included €2.0 million for a new milestone previously achieved, and Servier purchased PIXUVRI drug product for an additional €0.9 million in July 2017. Subject to the achievement of certain conditions, the Restated Agreement provided for certain milestone payments from Servier. In September 2017 and November 2018, we attained a regulatory milestone under the Restated Agreement and recorded milestone revenue in the amount of €1.0 million (or $1.2 million using the currency exchange rate as of the date the milestone was achieved) and €3.0 million (or $3.4 million using the currency exchange rate as of the date the milestone was achieved), respectively. 
In February 2019, we entered into a Termination and Transfer Agreement, or the Servier Termination Agreement, with Servier, which terminates the Restated Agreement. Under the Servier Termination Agreement, we will continue to be responsible for non-U.S. pharmacovigilance for PIXUVRI, the submission of a marketing authorization application for PIXUVRI and wind down of the PIX306 clinical trial during a transition period, which will last until the EMA adopts a position on the PIXUVRI marketing authorization application. Servier agreed to reimburse us €620,000 for costs to be incurred in connection with transition period activities, and if the transition period extends beyond May 31, 2019, Servier will provide additional reimbursement to us not to exceed €50,000 per month or €200,000 in the aggregate. If the EMA’s definitive position results in a standard marketing authorization for PIXUVRI, we will transfer and assign all of our rights and responsibilities for PIXUVRI globally to Servier pursuant to an asset purchase agreement. Alternatively, if the EMA’s definitive position results in a conditional marketing authorization or suspension or withdrawal of the marketing authorization, then, at Servier’s election, we will either transfer and assign all of our rights and responsibilities for PIXUVRI globally to Servier pursuant to an asset purchase agreement or cooperate with Servier in the withdrawal of PIXUVRI from all jurisdictions other than the United States. The Servier Termination Agreement provides that, in either scenario, any asset purchase agreement will require, among other things, Servier to pay us €2.0 million and assume responsibility for all of the 
12

obligations related to PIXUVRI, including our remaining royalty payments to Novartis International Pharmaceutical Ltd. and the University of Vermont.
Baxalta
In November 2013, we entered into a Development, Commercialization and License Agreement, dated as of November 14, 2013, with Baxter International Inc., or Baxter, for the development and commercialization of pacritinib for use in oncology and potentially additional therapeutic areas, or the Pacritinib License Agreement, which was subsequently amended in June 2015. Baxter assigned its rights and obligations under the Pacritinib License Agreement to Baxalta. Under the Pacritinib License Agreement, we granted to Baxter an exclusive, worldwide (subject to co-promotion rights discussed below), royalty-bearing, non-transferable, and (under certain circumstances outside of the U.S.) sub-licensable license to our know-how and patents relating to pacritinib.
In October 2016, we entered into the Asset Return and Termination Agreement, or the Baxalta Termination Agreement, with Baxalta. Pursuant to the Baxalta Termination Agreement, the Pacritinib License Agreement was terminated in its entirety (other than with respect to certain customary provisions that survive termination, including those pertaining to confidentiality and indemnification), the Pacritinib License Agreement has no further force or effect, and all rights and obligations of the Company and Baxalta under the Pacritinib License Agreement were terminated.
In October 2016, we resumed primary responsibility for the development and commercialization of pacritinib as a result of the Baxalta Termination Agreement and are no longer eligible to receive cost sharing or milestone payments for pacritinib’s development from Baxalta. In addition, under the Baxalta Termination Agreement, we are required to make a milestone payment to Baxalta in the amount of approximately $10.3 million upon the first regulatory approval or any pricing and reimbursement approvals of a product containing pacritinib.
University of Vermont
We entered into an agreement with the University of Vermont, or UVM, in March 1995, as amended, or the UVM Agreement, which grants us an exclusive sublicensable license for the rights to PIXUVRI. Pursuant to the UVM Agreement, we acquired the rights to make, have made, sell and use PIXUVRI, and we are obligated to make royalty payments to UVM ranging from low single digits to mid-single digits as a percentage of net sales; such royalty expenses are included in Cost of product sold in our consolidated financial statements. The higher royalty rate is payable for net sales in countries where specified UVM licensed patents exist, or where we have obtained orphan drug protection, until such UVM patents or such protection no longer exists. For a period of ten years after the first commercialization of PIXUVRI, the lower royalty rate is payable for net sales in such countries after expiration of the designated UVM patents or loss of orphan drug protection, and in all other countries without such specified UVM patents or orphan drug protection. Unless otherwise terminated, the term of the UVM Agreement continues for the life of the licensed patents in those countries in which a licensed patent exists, and continues for ten years after the first sale of PIXUVRI in those countries where no such patents exist. We may terminate the UVM Agreement, on a country-by-country basis or on a patent-by-patent basis, at any time upon advance written notice. UVM may terminate the UVM Agreement upon advance written notice in the event royalty payments are not made. In addition, either party may terminate the UVM Agreement in the event of an uncured material breach of the UVM Agreement by the other party or in the event of bankruptcy of the other party. If we enter into an asset purchase agreement with Servier pursuant to the Servier Termination Agreement, Servier will assume our obligations to make royalty payments to UVM under the UVM Agreement.
S*BIO
We acquired the compounds SB1518 (which is referred to as “pacritinib”) and SB1578, which inhibit JAK2 and FLT3, from S*BIO in May 2012. Under our agreement with S*BIO, we are required to make milestone payments to S*BIO up to an aggregate amount of $132.5 million if certain U.S., E.U. and Japanese regulatory approvals are obtained and if certain worldwide net sales thresholds are met in connection with any pharmaceutical product containing or comprising any compound that we acquired from S*BIO for use for specific diseases, infections or other conditions. At our election, we may pay up to 50% of any milestone payments to S*BIO through the issuance of shares of our common stock or shares of our preferred stock convertible into our common stock. In addition, S*BIO will be entitled to receive royalty payments from us at incremental rates in the low single-digits based on certain worldwide net sales thresholds on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis.
13

Novartis
In January 2014, we entered into a Termination Agreement with Novartis, or the Novartis Termination Agreement, to reacquire the rights to PIXUVRI previously granted to Novartis under our agreement entered into in September 2006, as amended, or the Original Novartis Agreement. Pursuant to the Novartis Termination Agreement, the Original Novartis Agreement was terminated in its entirety, except for certain customary provisions, including those pertaining to confidentiality and indemnification, which survive termination.
Under the Novartis Termination Agreement, we agreed not to transfer, license, sublicense or otherwise grant rights with respect to intellectual property of PIXUVRI and Opaxio unless the recipient thereof agrees to be bound by the terms of the Novartis Termination Agreement. We also agreed to provide potential payments to Novartis, including a percentage ranging from the low double-digits to the mid-teens, of any consideration received by us or our affiliates in connection with any transfer, license, sublicense or other grant of rights with respect to intellectual property of PIXUVRI or Opaxio; provided that such payments will not exceed certain prescribed ceilings in the low single-digit millions. Novartis is entitled to receive potential payments of up to $16.6 million upon the successful achievement of certain sales milestones of PIXUVRI and Opaxio. We are also obligated to pay to Novartis tiered low single-digit percentage royalty payments for the first several hundred million dollars in annual net sales, and 10% royalty payments thereafter based on annual net sales of each of PIXUVRI and Opaxio, subject to reduction in the event generic drugs are introduced and sold by a third party, causing the sale of PIXUVRI to fall by a percentage in the high double digits. Royalty payments for PIXUVRI are subject to certain minimum floor percentages in the low single digits. The royalty expenses payable under the Novartis Termination Agreement are included in Cost of product sold in our consolidated financial statements. If we enter into an asset purchase agreement with Servier pursuant to the Servier Termination Agreement, Servier will assume our obligations to make royalty payments to Novartis under the Novartis Termination Agreement.
Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd.
In June 2005, we entered into an acquisition agreement with Cephalon, Inc., or Cephalon, pursuant to which we divested the compound, TRISENOX. Cephalon was subsequently acquired by Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd., or Teva. Under this agreement, we have the right to receive up to $100 million in payments upon achievement by Teva of specified sales and development milestones related to TRISENOX. To date, we have received $60.0 million of such potential milestone payments as a result of having achieved certain sales milestones.
Other Agreements
We have several agreements with CROs, third-party manufacturers and distributors that have durations of greater than one year for the development and distribution of certain of our compounds.
Information about Customer and Geographic Concentrations
Information about customer and geographic revenue is set forth in Part II, Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - Note 15. Customer and Geographic Concentrations" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Patents and Proprietary Rights 
We dedicate significant resources to protecting our intellectual property, which is important to our business. We have filed numerous patent applications in the U.S. and various other countries seeking protection of inventions originating from our research and development, and we have also obtained rights to various patents and patent applications under licenses with third parties and through acquisitions. Patents have been issued on many of these applications. We have pending patent applications or issued patents in the U.S. and foreign countries directed to PIXUVRI, pacritinib and other product candidates. However, the lives of these patents are limited. Patents for the individual products extend for varying periods according to the date of the patent filing or grant and the legal term of patents in the various countries where patent protection is obtained.
Our U.S. and foreign composition of matter patents for pacritinib expire as follows: U.S. patents expire in May 2028 (method) / January 2029 (compound) / March 2030 (salt); foreign patents expire in November 2026 (method and compound) / December 2029 (salt). We expect our U.S. and foreign patent applications for use of pacritinib for treating transplant rejection will expire in 2036. Pacritinib has orphan drug designation for myelofibrosis in the U.S. and the E.U.
14

Our U.S. and foreign patents for PIXUVRI (pixantrone) expire as follows: US Patent Nos. 5,616,709 and 5,506,232 covering the pixantrone compound (i.e., 6,9-bis[(2-aminoethyl)amino]benzo[g]isoquinoline-5,10-dione), and dimaleate salt thereof, expired in 2014. Other patents relating to PIXUVRI include a US patent expiring in August 2024 (injectable formulation); Foreign patents (except Europe) expiring in May 2023 (injectable formulation); and European patents expiring in March 2020 (salt) and May 2027 (injectable formulation). If we enter into an asset purchase agreement with Servier pursuant to the Servier Termination Agreement, we will be required to transfer our U.S. and foreign patents for PIXUVRI to Servier. For more information, see “- License Agreements - Servier.”
Each patent may be eligible for future patent term restoration of up to five years under certain circumstances. Also, regulatory exclusivity tied to the protection of clinical data may be complementary to patent protection. During a period of regulatory exclusivity, competitors generally may not use the original applicant’s data as the basis for a generic application. In the U.S., the data protection generally runs for five years from first marketing approval of a new chemical entity, extended to seven years for an orphan drug indication.
In the absence of a patent, we would, to the extent possible, need to rely on unpatented technology, know-how and confidential information. Ultimately, the lack or expiration at any given time of a patent to protect our compounds may allow our competitors to copy the underlying inventions and better compete with us.
The risks and uncertainties associated with our intellectual property, including our patents, are discussed in more detail in Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors.”
Manufacturing, Distribution and Associated Operations 
Our manufacturing strategy utilizes third party contractors for the procurement and manufacture, as applicable, of raw materials, active pharmaceutical ingredients and finished drug product, as well as for labeling, packaging, storage and distribution of our compounds and associated supply chain operations. As our clinical development activities continue to expand, we expect that our manufacturing, distribution and related operational requirements will increase correspondingly. Additionally, in October 2016, we resumed primary responsibility for the development and commercialization of pacritinib as a result of the termination of the Pacritinib License Agreement. The development and commercialization of a major product candidate like pacritinib without a collaborative partner has significantly increased our manufacturing, distribution and related operational requirements, and we expect such increases to continue as we advance the clinical development of pacritinib.
Each third party contractor undergoes a formal qualification process by our subject matter experts prior to our entry into any service agreement and initiating any manufacturing work. We currently have a commercial supply arrangement for pacritinib.
Integral to our manufacturing strategy is our quality control and quality assurance program, which includes standard operating procedures and specifications with the goal that our compounds are manufactured in accordance with current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMPs, and other applicable global regulations. The cGMP compliance includes strict adherence to regulations for quality control, quality assurance and the maintenance of records and documentation. Manufacturing facilities for products and product candidates must meet cGMP requirements, and commercialized products must have acquired FDA, EMA and any other applicable regulatory approval. In this regard, we expect to continue to rely on contract manufacturers to produce sufficient quantities of our compounds in accordance with cGMPs for use in clinical trials and distribution.
We believe our operational strategy of utilizing qualified outside vendors in the foregoing manner allows us to direct our financial and managerial resources to development and commercialization activities, rather than to the establishment and maintenance of a manufacturing and distribution infrastructure.
Competition 
Competition in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries is intense. We face competition from a variety of companies focused on developing oncology drugs. We compete with large pharmaceutical companies and with other specialized biotechnology companies. In addition to the specific competitive factors discussed below, new anti-cancer drugs that may be developed and marketed in the future could compete with our various compounds.
Pacritinib would compete with Jakafi®, which is marketed by Incyte in the U.S. and Novartis ex-U.S. If approved, we may face competition from other candidates in development that target JAK inhibition to treat cancer such as fedratinib (Celgene) and momelotinib (Sierra Oncology).
15

Some of our existing or potential competitors have substantially greater financial, technical and human resources than us and may be better equipped to develop, manufacture and market products. Smaller companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large pharmaceutical and established biotechnology companies. Many of these competitors have products that have been approved or are in development and operate large, well-funded research and development programs.
Companies that complete clinical trials, obtain required regulatory approvals and commence commercial sales of their products before us may achieve a significant competitive advantage if their products work through a similar mechanism as our products and if the approved indications are similar. A number of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies are developing new products for the treatment of the same diseases being targeted by us. In some instances, such products have already entered late-stage clinical trials or received FDA or European Commission approval. However, cancer drugs with distinctly different mechanisms of action are often used together in combination for treating cancer, allowing several different products to target the same cancer indication or disease type. Such combination therapy is typically supported by clinical trials that demonstrate the advantage of combination therapy over that of a single-agent treatment.
We believe that our ability to compete successfully will be based on our ability to create and maintain scientifically advanced technology, develop proprietary products, attract and retain scientific personnel, obtain patent or other protection for our products, obtain required regulatory approvals and manufacture and successfully market our products, either alone or through outside parties. We will continue to seek licenses with respect to technology related to our field of interest and may face competition with respect to such efforts. See the risk factor, “We face direct and intense competition from our competitors in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries, and we may not compete successfully against them.” in Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding the risks and uncertainties we face due to competition in our industry. 
Government Regulation 
We are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA and other federal, state, and local regulatory agencies. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or the FDCA, and its implementing regulations set forth, among other things, requirements for the testing, development, manufacture, quality control, safety, effectiveness, approval, labeling, storage, record keeping, reporting, distribution, import, export, advertising and promotion of our products. Our activities in other countries will be subject to regulation that is similar in nature and scope as that imposed in the U.S., although there can be important differences. Additionally, some significant aspects of regulation in the E.U. are addressed in a centralized way through the EMA and the European Commission, but country-specific regulation by the competent authorities of the E.U. member states remains essential in many respects.
U.S. Regulation
In the U.S., the FDA regulates drugs under the FDCA and its implementing regulations, through review and approval of NDAs. NDAs require extensive studies and submission of a large amount of data by the applicant.
Drug Development
Preclinical Testing. Before testing any compound in human subjects in the U.S., a company must generate extensive preclinical data. Preclinical testing generally includes laboratory evaluation of product chemistry and formulation, as well as toxicological and pharmacological studies in several animal species to assess the quality and safety of the product. Animal studies must be performed in compliance with the FDA’s Good Laboratory Practice regulations and the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Animal Welfare Act.
IND Application. Human clinical trials in the U.S. cannot commence until an IND application is submitted and becomes effective. A company must submit preclinical testing results to the FDA as part of the IND application, and the FDA must evaluate whether there is an adequate basis for testing the drug in initial clinical studies in human volunteers. Unless the FDA raises concerns, the IND application becomes effective 30 days following its receipt by the FDA. Once human clinical trials have commenced, the FDA may stop the clinical trials by placing them on “clinical hold” because of concerns about the safety of the product being tested, or for other reasons.
Clinical Trials. Clinical trials involve the administration of the drug to healthy human volunteers or to patients, under the supervision of a qualified investigator. The conduct of clinical trials is subject to extensive regulation, including compliance with the FDA’s bioresearch monitoring regulations and Good Clinical Practice, or GCP, requirements, which 
16

establish standards for conducting, recording data from and reporting the results of, clinical trials, and are intended to assure that the data and reported results are credible and accurate, and that the rights, safety, and well-being of study participants are protected. Clinical trials must be conducted under protocols that detail the study objectives, parameters for monitoring safety, and the efficacy criteria, if any, to be evaluated. Each protocol is reviewed by the FDA as part of the IND application. In addition, each clinical trial must be reviewed, approved, and conducted under the auspices of an institutional review board, or IRB, at the institution conducting the clinical trial. Companies sponsoring the clinical trials, investigators, and IRBs also must comply with regulations and guidelines for obtaining informed consent from the study subjects, complying with the protocol and investigational plan, adequately monitoring the clinical trial and timely reporting adverse events. Foreign studies conducted under an IND application must meet the same requirements that apply to studies being conducted in the U.S. Data from a foreign study not conducted under an IND application may be submitted in support of an NDA if the study was conducted in accordance with GCP and the FDA is able to validate the data.
A study sponsor is required to submit certain details about active clinical trials and clinical trial results to the National Institutes of Health for public posting on http://clinicaltrials.gov. Human clinical trials typically are conducted in three sequential phases, although the phases may overlap with one another:

• | Phase 1 clinical trials include the initial administration of the investigational drug to humans, typically to a small group of healthy human subjects, but occasionally to a group of patients with the targeted disease or disorder. Phase 1 clinical trials generally are intended to determine the metabolism and pharmacologic actions of the drug, the side effects associated with increasing doses, and, if possible, to gain early evidence of effectiveness.


• | Phase 2 clinical trials generally are controlled studies that involve a relatively small sample of the intended patient population, and are designed to develop data regarding the product’s effectiveness, to determine dose response and the optimal dose range and to gather additional information relating to safety and potential adverse effects.


• | Phase 3 clinical trials are conducted after preliminary evidence of effectiveness has been obtained, and are intended to gather the additional information about safety and effectiveness necessary to evaluate the drug’s overall risk-benefit profile, and to provide a basis for physician labeling. Generally, Phase 3 clinical development programs consist of expanded, large-scale studies of patients with the target disease or disorder to obtain statistical evidence of the efficacy and safety of the drug, or the safety, purity, and potency of a biological product, at the proposed dosing regimen.

The sponsoring company, the FDA or the IRB may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Further, success in early-stage clinical trials does not assure success in later-stage clinical trials. Data obtained from clinical activities are not always conclusive and may be subject to alternative interpretations that could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval.
The FDA and IND application sponsor may agree in writing on the design and size of clinical trials intended to form the primary basis of an effectiveness claim in an NDA application. This process is known as a SPA. These agreements may not be changed after the clinical trials begin, except in limited circumstances. The existence of a SPA, however, does not assure approval of a product candidate.
Drug Approval
Assuming successful completion of the required clinical testing, the results of the preclinical studies and of the clinical trials, together with other detailed information, including information on the manufacture and composition of the investigational product, are submitted to the FDA in the form of an NDA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. The testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources. Submission of an NDA requires payment of a substantial review user fee to the FDA. The FDA will review the application and may deem it to be inadequate to support commercial marketing, and there can be no assurance that any product approval will be granted on a timely basis, if at all. The FDA may also seek the advice of an advisory committee, typically a panel of clinicians practicing in the field for which the product is intended, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of the advisory committee.
The FDA has various programs, including breakthrough therapy, fast track, priority review and accelerated approval, that are intended to expedite or simplify the process for reviewing drugs and/or provide for approval on the basis of surrogate endpoints. Generally, drugs that may be eligible for one or more of these programs are those for serious or life-threatening conditions, those with the potential to address unmet medical needs and those that provide meaningful benefit over existing treatments. We cannot be sure that any of our drugs will qualify for any of these programs, or that, if a drug does qualify, the review time will be reduced or the product will be approved.
17

Before approving a NDA, the FDA usually will inspect the facility or the facilities where the product is manufactured, tested and distributed and will not approve the product unless cGMP compliance is satisfactory. If the FDA evaluates the NDA and the manufacturing facilities as acceptable, the FDA may issue an approval letter, or in some cases, a complete response letter. A complete response letter contains a number of conditions that must be met in order to secure final approval of the NDA. When and if those conditions have been met to the FDA’s satisfaction, the FDA will issue an approval letter. The approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug for specific indications. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require post-marketing testing and surveillance to monitor the product’s safety or efficacy, or impose other post-approval commitment conditions.

In some circumstances, post-marketing testing may include post-approval clinical trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, which are used primarily to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended population, particularly for long-term safety follow-up. In addition, the FDA may require a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, to ensure that the benefits outweigh the risks.  A REMS can include medication guides, physician communication plans and elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries or other risk mitigation tools.
After approval, certain changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, making certain manufacturing changes or making certain additional labeling claims, are subject to further FDA review and approval. Obtaining approval for a new indication generally requires that additional clinical trials be conducted.
Post-Approval Requirements
Holders of an approved NDA are required to: (i) report certain adverse reactions to the FDA; (ii) comply with certain requirements concerning advertising and promotional labeling for their products; and (iii) continue to have quality control and manufacturing procedures conform to cGMP after approval. The FDA periodically inspects the sponsor’s records related to safety reporting and/or manufacturing and distribution facilities; this latter effort includes assessment of compliance with cGMP. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production, quality control and distribution to maintain cGMP compliance. Future FDA inspections may identify compliance issues at manufacturing facilities that may disrupt production or distribution, or require substantial resources to correct. In addition, discovery of problems with a product after approval may result in restrictions on a product, manufacturer or holder of an approved NDA, including withdrawal of the product from the market.
Marketing of prescription drugs is also subject to significant regulation through federal and state agencies tasked with consumer protection and prevention of medical fraud, waste and abuse. After approval in the U.S., we must comply with FDA’s regulation of drug promotion and advertising, including restrictions on off-label promotion, and we comply with federal anti-kickback statutes, limitations on gifts and payments to physicians and reporting of payments to certain third parties, among other requirements. 
Failure to comply with applicable U.S. requirements may subject us to administrative or judicial sanctions, such as clinical holds, FDA refusal to approve pending NDAs or supplemental applications, warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions and/or criminal prosecution.
Non-U.S. Regulation 
Before our medicinal products can be marketed outside of the U.S., they must be subject to regulatory approval similar to that required in the U.S. The requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, including requirements to conduct additional clinical trials, product licensing, safety reporting, post-authorization requirements, marketing and promotion, interactions with healthcare professionals, pricing and reimbursement may vary widely from country to country. No action can be taken to market any product in a country until an appropriate approval application has been approved by the regulatory authorities in that country. The current approval process varies from country to country, and the time spent in gaining approval varies from that required for FDA approval. In certain countries, the sales price of a product must also be approved. The pricing review period often begins after market approval is granted. Even if a product is approved by a regulatory authority, satisfactory prices may not be approved for such product.
Conduct of clinical trials in the E.U.
Similar to the United States, the various phases of non-clinical and clinical research in the E.U. are subject to significant regulatory controls. Although EU Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC, or the Clinical Trials Directive, has sought to 
18

harmonize the E.U. clinical trials regulatory framework, setting out common rules for the control and authorization of clinical trials in the E.U., E.U. Member States have transposed and applied the provisions of the Clinical Trials Directive in a manner that is not always uniform. This has led to variations in the rules governing the conduct of clinical trials in the individual E.U. Member States. The E.U. has, therefore, adopted Regulation (EU) No 536/2014, or the Clinical Trials Regulation. The Clinical Trials Regulation, which will replace the Clinical Trials Directive, introduces a complete overhaul of the existing regulation of clinical trials for medicinal products in the E.U., including a new coordinated procedure for authorization of clinical trials that is reminiscent of the mutual recognition procedure for marketing authorization of medicinal products, and increased obligations on sponsors to publish clinical trial results. The Clinical Trials Regulation is expected to take effect beginning in late 2019 or in 2020. 
Clinical trials must currently be conducted in accordance with the requirements of the Clinical Trials Directive and applicable good clinical practice standards, as implemented into national legislation by the individual E.U. Member States. Under the current regime, before a clinical trial can be initiated it must be approved in each E.U. Member State where there is a site at which the trial is to be conducted by two separate entities: the National Competent Authority, or NCA, and one or more Ethics Committees. Under the current regime all suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions to the investigated drug that occur during the clinical trial must be reported to the NCA and to the Ethics Committees of the E.U. Member State where they occur.
In the E.U., pediatric data or an approved Pediatric Investigation Plan, or PIP, or waiver, must be approved by the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, prior to submission of a marketing authorization application to the EMA or to the competent authorities of the E.U. Member States. In most E.U. countries, companies are also required to have an approved PIP before enrolling pediatric patients in a clinical trial.
Marketing authorization procedures in the E.U. and post-marketing obligations

In the E.U., medicinal products may only be placed on the market after a related marketing authorization, or MA, has been granted. Marketing authorizations for medicinal products can be obtained through several different procedures founded on the same basic regulatory process. These are through the centralized procedure, the mutual recognition procedure, the decentralized procedure, or a national procedure (single E.U. Member State).The centralized procedure is mandatory for certain medicinal products, including orphan medicinal products, medicinal products derived from certain biotechnological processes, advanced therapy medicinal products and certain other new medicinal products containing a new active substance for the treatment of AIDS, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, diabetes, auto-immune and viral diseases. It is optional for medicinal products containing a new active substance that is not yet authorized in the European Economic Area, or the EEA, and for medicinal products that constitute significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovations, or for which grant of a marketing authorization through the centralized procedure would be in the interest of patients or animal health at E.U. level. The centralized procedure allows a company to submit a single application to the EMA which will provide a positive opinion regarding the application if it meets certain quality, safety, and efficacy requirements. Based on the positive opinion of the EMA, the European Commission takes a final decision to grant a centralized marketing authorization which is valid in all 28 E.U. Member States and three of the four European Free Trade Association, or EFTA countries (Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway).

The decentralized authorization procedure permits companies to file identical applications for authorization to the competent authorities in several E.U. Member States simultaneously for a medicinal product that has not yet been authorized in any E.U. Member State. The competent authority of a single E.U. Member State, the reference member state, is appointed to review the application and provide an assessment report. The competent authorities of the other E.U. Member States, the concerned member states, are subsequently required to grant marketing authorization for their territories on the basis of this assessment. The only exception to this is where the competent authority of an E.U. Member State considers that there are concerns of potential serious risk to public health related to authorization of the product. In these circumstances the matter is submitted to the Heads of Medicines Agencies, or CMDh, for review. The mutual recognition procedure allows companies that have a medicinal product already authorized in one E.U. Member State to apply for this authorization to be recognized by the competent authorities in other E.U. Member States. The national marketing authorization procedure is founded on the same basic E.U. regulatory process as the other marketing authorization procedures discussed herein. The national marketing authorization procedure, which is increasingly rare, permits a company to submit an application to the competent authority of a single E.U. Member State and, if successful, to obtain a marketing authorization that is valid only in this E.U. Member State.
The maximum timeframe for the evaluation of a marketing authorization application in the E.U. is 210 days, excluding question or opinion response periods. The initial marketing authorization granted in the E.U. is valid for five years. The authorization may be renewed and remain valid for an unlimited period unless the national competent authority or the European Commission decides on justified grounds to proceed with one additional five-year renewal period. The renewal of a 
19

marketing authorization is subject to a re-evaluation of the risk-benefit balance of the product by the national competent authorities or the EMA.

Similar to accelerated approval regulations in the U.S., conditional marketing authorizations can be granted in the E.U. by the European Commission in exceptional circumstances. A conditional marketing authorization can be granted for medicinal products where, although comprehensive clinical data referring to the safety and efficacy of the medicinal product have not been supplied, a number of criteria are fulfilled; i) the benefit/risk balance of the product is positive, ii) it is likely that the applicant will be in a position to provide the comprehensive clinical data, iii) unmet medical needs will be fulfilled by the grant of the marketing authorization and iv) the benefit to public health of the immediate availability on the market of the medicinal product concerned outweighs the risk inherent in the fact that additional data are still required. A conditional marketing authorization must be renewed annually. Under the provisions of the conditional marketing authorization for PIXUVRI, we were required to complete a post-marketing Phase 3 study to further investigate the effects of using PIXUVRI in a defined group of patients who had received prior treatment with rituximab. We submitted the related clinical study report to the EMA in November 2018. 
In the E.U., innovative medicinal products that are subject to marketing authorization on the basis of a full dossier and which do not fall within the scope of the concept of global marketing authorization qualify for eight years of data exclusivity upon marketing authorization and ten years of market exclusivity. The eight years' data exclusivity prevents regulatory authorities in the E.U. from referencing the innovator’s data in assessing an application for authorization of a generic or biosimilar medicinal product for eight years from the data of authorization of the innovative product. After this period has expired a generic or biosimilar marketing authorization application may be submitted, and the innovator’s data may be referenced in the application. However, even if the generic product or biosimilar products is authorized it cannot be marketed in the E.U. for a further two years. The overall ten year market exclusivity period may be extended for a further year to a maximum of 11 years if, during the first eight years of those ten years, the marketing authorization holder obtains an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications which, during the scientific evaluation prior to their authorization, are held to bring a significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies.
Pricing and reimbursement in the E.U.
Even if a product is subject to a marketing authorization in the E.U., there can be no assurance that reimbursement for such product will be secured on a timely basis or at all. The E.U. Member States have the power to restrict the range of medicinal products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. An E.U. Member State may approve a specific price for the medicinal product. Alternatively, it may adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the medicinal product on the market. 
In a number of E.U. Member States we may be subject to cost-cutting measures, such as lower maximum prices, lower or lack of reimbursement coverage and incentives to use cheaper, usually generic, products as an alternative. Health Technology Assessment, or HTA, of medicinal products is becoming an increasingly common part of the pricing and reimbursement procedures in some E.U. Member States, including countries representing major markets. The HTA process, which is governed by the national laws of these countries, is the procedure according to which the assessment of the public health impact, therapeutic impact and the economic and societal impact of use of a given medicinal product in the national healthcare systems of the individual country is conducted. The outcome of HTA regarding specific medicinal products will often influence the pricing and reimbursement status granted to these medicinal products by the competent authorities of individual E.U. Member States. On January 31, 2018, the European Commission adopted a proposal for a regulation on health technologies assessment. This legislative proposal is intended to boost cooperation among E.U. Member States in assessing health technologies, including new medicinal products, and providing the basis for cooperation at the E.U. level for joint clinical assessments in these areas. The proposal provides that E.U. Member States will be able to use common HTA tools, methodologies, and procedures across the E.U., working together in four main areas, including joint clinical assessment of the innovative health technologies with the most potential impact for patients, joint scientific consultations whereby developers can seek advice from HTA authorities, identification of emerging health technologies to identify promising technologies early, and continuing voluntary cooperation in other areas. Individual E.U. Member States will continue to be responsible for assessing non-clinical (e.g., economic, social, ethical) aspects of health technology, and making decisions on pricing and reimbursement. The European Commission has stated that the role of the draft HTA regulation is not to influence pricing and reimbursement decisions in the individual E.U. Member States, but there can be no assurance that the draft HTA regulation will not have effects on pricing and reimbursement decisions.
20

Therefore, we will need to expend significant effort and expense to establish and maintain reimbursement arrangements in the various countries comprising the E.U. and may never succeed in obtaining widespread reimbursement arrangements therein.
Post-Approval Regulation
Similarly to the U.S., both marketing authorization holders and manufacturers of medicinal products are subject to comprehensive regulatory oversight by the EMA, the European Commission and the competent authorities of the individual E.U. Member States both before and after grant of the manufacturing and marketing authorizations. Failure by us or by any of our third-party partners, including suppliers, manufacturers and distributors to comply with E.U. laws and the related national laws of individual E.U. Member States governing the conduct of clinical trials, manufacturing approval, marketing authorization of medicinal products and marketing of such products, both before and after grant of marketing authorization, may result in administrative, civil or criminal penalties. These penalties could include delays or refusal to authorize the conduct of clinical trials or to grant marketing authorization, product withdrawals and recalls, product seizures, suspension, withdrawal or variation of the marketing authorization, total or partial suspension of production, distribution, manufacturing or clinical trials, operating restrictions, injunctions, suspension of licenses, fines and criminal penalties.
The holder of an E.U. marketing authorization for a medicinal product must also comply with E.U. pharmacovigilance legislation and its related regulations and guidelines, which entail many requirements for conducting pharmacovigilance, or the assessment and monitoring of the safety of medicinal products. These rules can impose on holders of marketing authorization granted through the centralized marketing authorization procedure the obligation to conduct a labor intensive collection of data regarding the risks and benefits of marketed medicinal products and to engage in ongoing assessments of those risks and benefits, including the possible requirement to conduct additional clinical studies, which may be time consuming and expensive and could impact our profitability. Marketing authorization holders are required to prepare Periodic Safety Update Reports in relation to medicinal products for which they hold marketing authorizations. The EMA reviews Periodic Safety Update Reports for medicinal products authorized through the centralized procedure. If the EMA has concerns that the risk benefit profile of a product has varied, it can adopt an opinion advising that the existing marketing authorization for the product be suspended, withdrawn or varied. The Agency can advise that the marketing authorization holder be obliged to conduct post-authorization Phase IV safety studies. The EMA opinion is submitted to the European Commission for its consideration. If the Commission agrees with the opinion, it can adopt a decision varying the existing marketing authorization. Failure by the marketing authorization holder to fulfill the obligations for which the European Commission's decision provides can undermine the on-going validity of the marketing authorization.
More generally, non-compliance with pharmacovigilance obligations can lead to the variation, suspension or withdrawal of the marketing authorization for the product or imposition of financial penalties or other enforcement measures. 
The manufacturing process for medicinal products in the E.U. is highly regulated and regulators may shut down manufacturing facilities that they believe do not comply with regulations. Manufacturing requires a manufacturing authorization, and the manufacturing authorization holder must comply with various requirements set out in the applicable E.U. laws, regulations and guidance, including Directive 2001/83/EC, Directive 2003/94/EC, Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 and the European Commission Guidelines for Good Manufacturing Practice. These requirements include compliance with E.U. cGMP standards when manufacturing medicinal products and active pharmaceutical ingredients, including the manufacture of active pharmaceutical ingredients outside of the E.U. with the intention to import the active pharmaceutical ingredients into the E.U. Similarly, the distribution of medicinal products into and within the E.U. is subject to compliance with the applicable E.U. laws, regulations and guidelines, including the requirement to hold appropriate authorizations for distribution granted by the competent authorities of the E.U. Member States.
We and our third-party manufacturers are subject to cGMP, which are extensive regulations governing manufacturing processes, stability testing, record keeping and quality standards as defined by the EMA, the European Commission, the competent authorities of E.U. Member States and other regulatory authorities. Companies may be subject to civil, criminal or administrative sanctions. These include suspension of manufacturing authorization in case of non-compliance with the E.U. or E.U. Member States’ requirements governing the manufacturing of medicinal products.
Sales and Marketing Regulations
In the E.U., the advertising and promotion of our products are subject to E.U. Member States’ laws governing promotion of medicinal products, interactions with physicians, misleading and comparative advertising and unfair commercial practices. In addition, other legislation adopted by individual E.U. Member States may apply to the advertising and promotion of medicinal products. These laws require that promotional materials and advertising in relation to medicinal products comply 
21

with the product’s Summary of Product Characteristics, or SmPC, as approved by the competent authorities. Promotion of a medicinal product that does not comply with the SmPC is considered to constitute off-label promotion. The off-label promotion of medicinal products is prohibited in the E.U.. The applicable laws at E.U. level and in the individual E.U. Member States also prohibit the direct-to-consumer advertising of prescription-only medicinal products. Violations of the rules governing the promotion of medicinal products in the E.U. could be penalized by administrative measures, fines and imprisonment. These laws may further limit or restrict the advertising and promotion of our products to the general public and may also impose limitations on our promotional activities with health care professionals.
Anti-Corruption Legislation
Our business activities outside of the U.S. are subject to anti-bribery or anti-corruption laws, regulations, industry self-regulation codes of conduct and physicians’ codes of professional conduct or rules of other countries in which we operate, including the U.K. Bribery Act of 2010.
Interactions between pharmaceutical companies and physicians are also governed by strict laws, regulations, industry self-regulation codes of conduct and physicians’ codes of professional conduct developed at both E.U. level and in the individual E.U. Member States. The provision of benefits or advantages to physicians to induce or encourage the prescription, recommendation, endorsement, purchase, supply, order or use of medicinal products is prohibited in the E.U.. Violation of these laws could result in substantial fines and imprisonment. Payments made to physicians in certain E.U. Member States also must be publicly disclosed. Moreover, agreements with physicians must often be the subject of prior notification and approval by the physician’s employer, his/her competent professional organization, and/or the competent authorities of the individual E.U. Member States. Failure to comply with these requirements could result in reputational risk, public reprimands, administrative penalties, fines or imprisonment.
Data Privacy and Protection 
Data protection laws and regulations have been adopted at the E.U. level with related implementing laws in individual E.U. Member States which impose significant compliance obligations. For example, the E.U. General Data Protection Regulation, which entered into force in May 2018, imposes strict obligations and restrictions on the ability to collect, analyze and transfer personal data, including health data from clinical trials and adverse event reporting.
As the General Data Protection Regulation entered into force recently, guidance on implementation and compliance practices are still being developed, updated or otherwise revised. Although the General Data Protection Regulation is intended to provide for a high level of harmonization across the E.U., Member States may still implement certain variations, and data protection authorities may enforce the General Data Protection Regulation and national laws differently, which adds to the complexity of processing personal data in the E.U. Apart from exceptional circumstances, the E.U. General Data Protection Regulation prohibits the transfer of personal data to countries outside of the European Economic Area, that are not considered by the European Commission to provide an adequate level of data protection, including the U.S, and requires companies to take additional compliance measures to lawfully perform such transfers .
Furthermore, there is a trend towards the public disclosure of clinical trial data in the E.U. which also adds to the complexity of processing health data from clinical trials. Such public disclosure obligations are provided in the new E.U. Clinical Trials Regulation, EMA disclosure initiatives, and voluntary commitments by industry. Failing to comply with these obligations could lead to government enforcement actions and significant penalties against us, harm to our reputation, and adversely impact our business and operating results. The uncertainty regarding the interplay between different regulatory frameworks, such as the Clinical Trials Regulation and the General Data Protection Regulation, further adds to the complexity that we face with regard to data protection regulation.
Consequences of Non-Compliance
Failure to comply with applicable requirements may subject us to administrative or judicial sanctions, such as clinical holds, refusal of regulatory authorities to approve or authorize pending product applications, warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, financial penalties and/or criminal prosecution.
Environmental Regulation
In connection with our research and development activities, we are subject to federal, state and local laws, rules, regulations and policies, both internationally and domestically, governing the use, generation, manufacture, storage, air 
22

emission, effluent discharge, handling, treatment, transportation and disposal of certain materials, biological specimens and wastes and employee safety and health matters. Although we believe that we have complied with these laws, regulations and policies in all material respects and have not been required to take any significant action to correct any noncompliance, we may be required to incur significant costs to comply with environmental and health and safety regulations in the future. Our research and development involves the controlled use of hazardous materials, including, but not limited to, certain hazardous chemicals and radioactive materials. Although we believe that our safety procedures for handling and disposing of such materials comply with applicable law and regulations, the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials cannot be eliminated. In the event of such an accident, we could be held liable for any damages that result and any such liability not covered by insurance could exceed our resources. See the risk factor, “We may be subject to claims relating to improper handling, storage or disposal of hazardous materials.” in Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding the risks and uncertainties we face due to the use of hazardous materials.
Employees
As of December 31, 2018, we employed 46 individuals in the U.S. In December 2018, we announced a restructuring plan to improve efficiencies and reduce costs within the Company, and as a result, a total of 21 positions will be eliminated approximately by the end of the first quarter 2019. Our employees do not have a collective bargaining agreement. We believe our relations with our employees are good.
