ITEM 1. | BUSINESS

Our Company
When used in this report, the terms “Primo,” “the Company,” “our Company,” “Primo Water Corporation,” “we,” “us,” or “our” refers to Primo Water Corporation, together with its consolidated subsidiaries. 
We originally incorporated in 1955 and, following the July 2021 continuance to the jurisdiction of the Province of Ontario, are governed by the Business Corporations Act (Ontario). Our principal executive office is located at 4221 W. Boy Scout Boulevard Suite 400, Tampa, Florida, United States 33607.
 Primo is a leading pure-play water solutions provider in North America and Europe. Primo operates largely under a recurring razor/razorblade revenue model. The razor in Primo’s revenue model is its industry leading line-up of sleek and innovative water dispensers, which are sold through major retailers and online at various price points or leased to customers. The dispensers help increase household penetration, which drives recurring purchases of Primo’s razorblade offering. Primo’s razorblade offering is comprised of Water Direct, Water Exchange, and Water Refill. Through its Water Direct business, Primo delivers sustainable hydration solutions across its 22-country footprint direct to the customer’s door, whether at home or to commercial businesses. Through its Water Exchange and Water Refill businesses, Primo offers pre-filled and reusable containers at over 13,000 locations and water refill units at approximately 22,000 locations, respectively. Primo also offers water filtration units across its 22-country footprint representing a top five position. 
Primo’s water solutions expand consumer access to purified, spring and mineral water to promote a healthier, more sustainable lifestyle while simultaneously reducing plastic waste and pollution. Primo is committed to its water stewardship standards and is proud to partner with the International Bottled Water Association in North America as well as with Watercoolers Europe, which ensure strict adherence to safety, quality, sanitation and regulatory standards for the benefit of consumer protection. During 2020, our U.S. operations achieved a carbon neutral certification under the Carbon Neutral Protocol, an international standard administered by Natural Capital Partners. This certification is in addition to the certifications in our European operations where we have maintained carbon neutrality for the past ten consecutive years in many of our markets. In 2021, the Company achieved carbon neutrality on a global basis. In late 2021, Primo announced its planned exit from the North American small-format retail water business. This business is relatively small and uses predominantly single-use plastic bottles. The exit from this category is estimated to reduce production of plastic water bottles by more than 400 million, annually, while also improving overall margins. The exit is anticipated to be completed by the middle of 2022.
Our Operations
During the second quarter of 2020, we implemented a restructuring program intended to optimize synergies from the Company’s transition to a pure-play water company following the acquisition of Primo Water Corporation ("Legacy Primo" and such transaction, the "Legacy Primo Acquisition") and, as a result, reorganized into two reporting segments: North America (which includes our DS Services of America, Inc. (“DSS”), Aquaterra Corporation (“Aquaterra”), Mountain Valley Spring Company (“Mountain Valley”) and Legacy Primo businesses) and Rest of World (which includes our Eden Springs Nederland B.V. (“Eden”), Aimia Foods Limited (“Aimia”), Decantae Mineral Water Limited (“Decantae”), Fonthill Waters Ltd ("Fonthill") and John Farrer & Company Limited (“Farrers”) businesses). Our corporate oversight function and other miscellaneous expenses are aggregated and included in the All Other category. 
North America 
 Our North America reporting segment provides bottled water, water filtration and coffee services to customers in North America. Products included in our North America reporting segment primarily consist of bottled water, water dispensers, purified bottled water, self-service refill drinking water, premium spring, sparkling and flavored water, filtration equipment and coffee. 
 Rest of World
Our Rest of World segment provides bottled water, water filtration and coffee services to customers in Europe and Israel. Products included in our Rest of World reporting segment primarily consist of bottled water, purified bottled water, premium spring, sparkling and flavored water, mineral water, filtration equipment and coffee. 
All Other
Our All Other segment includes our corporate oversight function and other miscellaneous expenses, as well as our former Cott Beverages LLC business which primarily sold soft drink concentrates to customers located outside of North America and was sold in the first quarter of 2019.
Competitive Strengths
The combination of our scale and density of our routes in key markets, our industry-leading infrastructure, and our emphasis on superior customer service is intended to create significant competitive strengths. We continually invest in our delivery, exchange and refill infrastructure, call centers and service capabilities to earn our position as an industry leader. We believe these investments have positioned us to capitalize on a number of positive industry dynamics and new growth opportunities. First, we intend to capture new customers as we capitalize on favorable consumer trends across our addressable markets, including increased focus on health and wellness, and concerns about deteriorating municipal water quality. Second, we believe our ability to cross-sell complementary water and filtration products and services represents a significant untapped opportunity. Third, the highly fragmented market in which we operate affords us ample opportunity to make the most of our scale, systems and customer density to execute synergistic tuck-in acquisitions across all of our service areas. We believe these strengths, along with the strengths outlined below, will allow us to capitalize on growth opportunities to drive sustainable and profitable growth.
Leading Position in Multiple Service Platforms
We have a leading volume-based national presence in the North American and European residential and commercial industry for bottled water. We offer a portfolio of well-known brands with longstanding heritages, such as Primo®, Crystal Springs®, Mountain Valley®, Crystal Rock®, Vermont Pure®, Sparkletts®, Hinckley Springs®, Kentwood Springs®, Canadian Springs®, Labrador Source® and Eden Springs®, which have contributed to our leadership position in the residential and commercial bottled water industry. In office coffee services, we offer a complete range of products under leading brands including Keurig®, Mars Alterra®, Starbucks® Coffee, Caribou Coffee®, Peet’s Coffee & Tea®, Javarama® and Lavazza®. In water filtration, we offer a complete range of products including carbon filtration and reverse osmosis filtration.
We are one of the leading direct-to-customer providers that can offer comprehensive services to residential customers and small and medium-sized businesses, as well as large regional and national corporations and retailers. Our broad direct-to-consumer network creates an advantage in marketing and customer reach, while our extensive range of products and capabilities allows us to offer customers a convenient, single solution for high quality drinking water. We believe our position is strengthened by our presence in the exchange and refill channels and will be further strengthened through our ongoing efforts to enhance and promote our full-service water solutions offering to new and existing customers.
We also believe opportunities exist to increase sales of our products in our core markets by optimizing existing customer relationships, capitalizing on cross-selling and up-selling opportunities, obtaining new customers, exploring new channels of distribution and introducing new products through our broad reaching distribution network.
International Residential and Commercial Water Delivery, Water Filtration or Point of Use and Office Coffee Service Platforms
We believe having one of the leading North American and European residential and commercial water delivery production and distribution networks in the industry gives us the ability to reduce our purchasing, manufacturing and delivery costs relative to our competitors as well as drive customer density within the markets we serve. We have an extensive residential and commercial water delivery, water filtration and office coffee services distribution network with a unique ability to service customers, along with numerous locations through which we provide our exchange and refill offerings. We believe our footprint infrastructure and attention to customer service uniquely enable us to support local, regional and national accounts, which differentiates us in the industry. Our network has allowed us to secure strategic relationships, which have been successful in attracting new customers and leveraging our production and delivery infrastructure. We are able to provide multiple products to our residential and commercial water delivery, water filtration and office coffee services customers at minimal additional cost and generate additional profits on those incremental sales.
High Levels of Customer Service and Strong Customer Integration
Customer service and customer retention are key indicators of our success. Our goal is to increase the customer lifetime value through increased customer retention. Route Sales Representatives ("RSRs"), who comprise the customer-facing part of the business, are an important part of the customer relationship and not only drive customer service, but also generate new organic customer growth. We provide reliable delivery schedules and closely track call center and customer service metrics to continually improve customer satisfaction.
Business Strategy
Our business strategy is aligned around a common purpose and vision. Our purpose defines and identifies who we are and what sets us apart. We aim to Inspire Healthier Lives Through Better Quality Water. In order to achieve our purpose, our vision guides our decisions and future investments to help differentiate us from our competitors. We aim to become the leading brand in the pure-play water category with a unique portfolio of sustainable drinking water solutions. To achieve this vision, we have aligned around a common set of global strategic pillars. These strategic pillars are integrated across our global business to help drive a differentiated offering for our customers while at the same time providing an engaged and purpose-driven culture for our associates. Through our strategies, we believe we can drive an enhanced customer experience while at the same time leverage our global scale to generate enhanced efficiencies. We also empower and motivate our associate base to help deliver for our customers and their needs. When our associate experience is aligned and operating in tandem with that of our customers, we have the best ability to deliver growth for all stakeholders. Our transition to a pure-play water company was the first step on our journey to enhancing value and we believe our business strategy will enable long-term measurable success in support of our vision and purpose.
Our strategic pillars and goals include:
•Water Your Way - we provide a diverse set of water solutions and products for residential, commercial and retail customers. We believe this allows our customers access to on-trend and key drinking water solutions whenever, wherever and however customers want them. Our goal is to establish Primo as the preferred water brand in the spaces we compete by increasing customer penetration of our water solutions while also diversifying our customer base. Our financial model is strengthened by the recurring-revenue nature of our business model. Our offering is further enhanced through digital channels allowing customers to manage their delivery and order preferences or purchase products on owned and third-party e-commerce sites of our retail partners.
•Category Leading Innovation - we focus on new product innovation to drive customer penetration and increased water consumption. We have expanded our dispenser offering with a variety of options that include hot, cold and technology to brew coffee, tea and other beverages in numerous price ranges that are suitable for our retail customer needs. We have also enhanced our lineup with color and style options that are on trend for residential and commercial settings. Dispenser innovation and enhancements also enable us to improve our service efficiency and reduce service costs.
•Customer for Life Promise - we position the customer at the center of everything we do. Our goal is to increase the customer lifetime value through increased customer retention. We seek to understand customer needs and listen to their feedback across our product offerings. By providing trusted high-quality products and equipment and responding to their service needs, we believe we can enhance the value of the relationship. We continue to build out interactive digital touch-points to better the customer experience and improve the advocacy of the experience.
•Operational Excellence - we believe we can unlock and increase efficiencies through our global scale and product offering. With our pure-play water focus we have begun streamlining and centralizing support functions in all geographies. Additionally, we have enhanced our staff with a global procurement team to help drive valuable supplier partnerships and harmonize our best practices. In conjunction with our other strategies, as we increase our customer base and customer diversity, we believe it will improve our route density and network optimization.
•Environmental, Social and Corporate Governance Leadership - we strive to provide a positive impact on the environment, our associates and the communities where we live, work and service. We maintain sustainable water resources, aim to reduce our carbon footprint and energy usage, and seek to increase the use of recycled packaging. In the social channel, we promote associate health and safety initiatives, as well as diversity, equity and inclusion training for all management. Additionally, we aim to ensure our supplier community complies with all federal, state and local human relations laws and regulations, and each supplier is required to comply with our Global Supplier Code of Conduct. In the governance channel, our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics drives compliance with all relevant rules and regulations.
•Inspiring Associates - we are developing a purpose-driven culture that will drive an enhanced associate experience. Our goal is to attract and retain highly-engaged associates who will live our purpose in their interactions with our customers, as well as in their communities. We seek to implement an effective talent strategy that focuses on the entire associate lifecycle – onboarding to exit.
We ultimately believe that our connected strategies will help drive increased customer growth and greater customer retention due to our innovation and on-trend water solution offerings, all while leveraging our operating scale. Our associates will be highly-engaged in driving our purpose and engaging in our environmental, social and corporate governance leadership.
Focus on Water Direct, Water Exchange, Water Refill and Water Filtration Solutions Growth
Using our strategic pillars, our goal is to grow profitably as consumers move to healthier beverage options and increase free cash flow by selling across multiple channels while expanding our customer density and consumption, focusing on customer service and reducing costs to serve.
We will remain focused on expanding our residential and small and medium-sized business customer base, a market segment that we believe remains underpenetrated, by continuing to capitalize on our strong direct-to-consumer distribution network, international sales and marketing efforts as well as our strategic partnerships. Additionally, the sale of our water dispensers through retail and digital channels helps us expand our customer base through which we can offer a diverse set of water solutions both direct and through retail stores.
We intend to utilize our e-commerce capabilities to employ data-driven customer acquisition, increase penetration, expand our customer base and provide a seamless strategy for improved customer experience, retention and long-term growth. Our e-commerce capabilities will utilize common platforms while engaging and serving potential and current customers in the most optimized manner.
We believe our ability to cross-sell complementary water and filtration products and services represents a significant untapped opportunity as nearly all of our existing and target customers consume multiple products. We believe we are well-positioned to capitalize on this opportunity utilizing our strong relationships and frequent face-to-face interactions with our large installed customer base. RSRs are trained to sell across our product set and are highly incentivized through our commission structure to promote new products to existing customers, which increases sales and average revenue per customer.
We intend to proactively pursue accretive acquisitions to complement our organic growth. The highly fragmented market in which we operate affords us ample opportunities to execute synergistic residential and commercial water and filtration tuck-in acquisitions. Our acquisition strategy is consistent with our objective to continually build customer density and reduce the overall cost of servicing our existing customer base. We have a proven track record of achieving significant synergies and integrating companies onto our platform, and we believe that our acquisition strategy will continue to improve our profitability.
We have managed to pursue this acquisition strategy while reducing leverage levels by employing a combination of disciplined purchasing, successful integration and synergy realization, and divestiture of assets that are no longer instrumental to our mission and strategy. On November 4, 2021, as part of our overall strategy to increase profitability and further reduce our environmental footprint, we announced a plan to exit the North America single-use retail bottled water category consisting primarily of 1-gallon, 2.5 gallon and case-pack water. The plan does not affect our large format exchange, refill, and dispenser business nor our Mountain Valley brand, which sells products primarily in glass bottles. On an annualized basis, these products have accounted for revenue of approximately $140 million. Unwinding of this business is expected to be completed by the middle of 2022 and we do not expect the costs incurred to exit this business to have a material impact on our operating results.
Evaluate Acquisition Opportunities
We will continue to evaluate additional opportunities to expand our positions in the residential and commercial water and filtration service categories, as well as other higher margin or growth-oriented water categories where we believe our platform, operating strength and synergies can be leveraged. Additionally, we may use acquisitions to enter new geographies where we believe the customer demand aligns with our product offering.
Financial Information about Segments
For financial information about reporting segments and geographic areas, see Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Ingredient and Packaging Supplies
In addition to water, the principal raw materials required to produce our products are polyethylene terephthalate (“PET”) resin, high-density polyethylene (“HDPE”) and polycarbonate bottles, caps and preforms, labels and cartons and trays. The cost of these raw materials can fluctuate substantially over time. We have implemented a number of risk mitigation programs in order to reduce the risk of commodity fluctuations in key areas such as energy surcharges tied to certain energy indexes within North America and throughout our European footprint. Our core product of residential and commercial bottled water utilizes a reusable bottle that allows for the overall cost to service to be spread out over a number of recurring trips to our customer base. We utilize a refill, reuse and recycle concept with our three gallon (“3G”) and five gallon (“5G”) bottled water packaging, which can be reused as many as fifty times per bottle. Where we have not established a risk mitigation program, it is often necessary to recover the increased cost of materials through price increases which we have historically had success in utilizing in order to reduce our overall exposure to rising ingredient and packaging costs.
Under many of our supply arrangements for these raw materials, the price we pay fluctuates along with certain changes in underlying commodity costs, such as resin in the case of PET, and HDPE. We believe that we will be able to either renegotiate contracts with these suppliers when they expire or find alternative sources for supply. We also believe there is adequate supply of the ingredient and packaging materials used to produce and package our products.
Generally, we bear the risk of increases in the costs of the ingredient and packaging materials used to produce our products, including the underlying costs of the commodities used to manufacture them and, to some extent, the costs of converting those commodities into the materials we purchase.
Resin for PET, HDPE and fuel are examples of underlying commodities for which we bear the risk of increases in costs. In addition, the contracts for certain of our ingredient and packaging materials permit our suppliers to increase the costs they charge us based on increases in their cost of converting the underlying commodities into the materials we purchase. In certain cases, those increases are subject to negotiated limits. Changes in the prices we pay for ingredient and packaging materials occur at times that vary by product and supplier, and take place on a monthly, quarterly or annual basis.
Trade Secrets, Copyrights, Trademarks and Licenses
We sell a majority of our residential and commercial 3G and 5G bottled water under our own brands while our office coffee services business sells both our branded products as well as products under which we have a distribution license. We own registrations for various trademarks that are important to our worldwide business, including Primo®, Alhambra®, Crystal Rock®, Mountain Valley®, Deep Rock®, Hinckley Springs®, Crystal Springs®, Kentwood Springs®, Mount Olympus®, Pureflo®, Nursery®, Sierra Springs®, Sparkletts®, Clear Mountain Natural Spring Water®, Earth2O®, Renü® and Water Event Pure Water Solutions® in the United States, Canadian Springs® and Labrador Source® in Canada, and Decantae®, Eden®, Eden Springs®, Chateaud’eau®, and Mey Eden® in Europe and Israel. We have filed certain trademark registration applications and intend to develop additional trademarks and seek registrations for such trademarks and to develop other intellectual property. The licenses to which we are a party are of varying terms, including some that are perpetual. Trademark ownership is generally of indefinite duration when marks are properly maintained in commercial use. 
Our success depends in part on our intellectual property, which includes trademarks for the names of the beverages we sell. To protect this intellectual property, we rely principally on registration of trademarks, contractual responsibilities and restrictions in agreements (such as indemnification, nondisclosure and confidentiality agreements) with employees, consultants and customers, and on the common law and/or statutory protections afforded to trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets and proprietary “know-how.” We also closely monitor the use of our trademarks and, when necessary, vigorously pursue any party that infringes on our trademarks, using all available legal remedies.
Customers
We have limited customer concentration, of which no customer accounts for more than 10% of our net revenues.
Competition
Our principal competitors are local, regional and national residential and commercial bottled water businesses as well as providers of various types of water filtration units. We face significant competition in our residential and commercial business as distribution methods for residential and commercial bottled water products continue to change and evolve. Our residential and commercial business also faces increased competition from filtration units. In addition, consumers may choose to drink from municipal water sources instead of purchasing bottled water or using a filtration unit.
We seek to differentiate ourselves from our competitors by offering our customers high-quality products, category management strategies, packaging and marketing strategies, efficient distribution methods, and superior service.
Government Regulation and Environmental Matters
The production, distribution and sale in the United States of many of our products are subject to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, the Federal Trade Commission Act, the Lanham Act, state consumer protection laws, federal, state and local workplace health and safety laws, various federal, state and local environmental protection laws and various other federal, state and local statutes and regulations applicable to the production, transportation, import, sale, safety, advertising, labeling and ingredients of such products. Outside the United States, the production, distribution and sale of our many products and related operations are also subject to numerous similar and other statutes and regulations.
A number of states have passed laws setting forth warning or labeling requirements relating to products made for human consumption. For example, the California law known as “Proposition 65” requires that a specific warning appear on any product sold in California containing a substance listed by that state as having been found to cause cancer or reproductive toxicity. This law, and others like it, exposes all food and beverage producers to the possibility of having to provide warnings on their products. The detection of even a trace amount of a listed substance can subject an affected product to the requirement of a warning label, although products containing listed substances that occur naturally or that are contributed to such products solely by a municipal water supply are generally exempt from the warning requirement. From time to time over the past several years, certain of our customers have received notices alleging that the labeling requirements of the relevant state regulation would apply to products manufactured by us and sold by them. There can be no assurance that we will not be adversely affected by actions against our customers or us relating to Proposition 65 or similar “failure to warn” laws.
We currently offer and use non-refillable recyclable containers in the United States and other countries around the world. We also offer and use refillable containers, which are also recyclable. Legal requirements apply in various jurisdictions in the United States and other countries requiring that deposits or certain taxes or fees be charged for the sale, marketing and use of certain non-refillable beverage containers. The precise requirements imposed by these measures vary. Other types of beverage container-related deposit, recycling, tax and/or product stewardship statutes and regulations also apply in various jurisdictions. We anticipate that additional, similar legal requirements may be proposed or enacted in the future at local, state and federal levels, both in the United States and elsewhere. In late 2021, we announced our planned exit from the North American small-format retail water business. This business is relatively small and uses predominantly single-use plastic bottles. The exit from this category is estimated to reduce production of plastic water bottles by more than 400 million, annually, while also improving overall margins. The exit is anticipated to be completed by the middle of 2022.
We are a member of the International Bottled Water Association (“IBWA”), the Watercoolers Europe Association and the Water Quality Association. These associations often set higher water quality standards than those set by governmental agencies. Members must comply with these standards, which are enforced by the members themselves. The IBWA requires submission to annual plant inspections administered by an independent third-party inspection agency, such as the National Sanitation Foundation. These inspections audit quality and testing records, review all areas of plant operations and the bottling process, and check compliance with relevant national standards, good manufacturing practices, and any other regulations set by the IBWA. If we fail to meet the standards set by the IBWA, the Watercoolers Europe Association and the Water Quality Association, there could be an adverse impact on our reputation, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.
All of our production facilities and other operations are subject to various environmental protection statutes and regulations, including those of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”), which pertain to the use of water resources and the discharge of waste water. Failure to comply with these regulations can have serious consequences, including civil and administrative penalties. Compliance with these provisions has not had, and we do not expect such compliance to have, any material adverse effect on our capital expenditures, net income or competitive position.
Subject to the terms and conditions of the applicable policies, we have coverage for product recalls and product liability claims that could result from the injury, illness or death of consumers using our products, contamination of our products, or damage to or mislabeling of our products.
Human Capital
Employees
As of January 1, 2022, we had over 9,230 employees, of whom approximately 6,070 were in the North America reporting segment; approximately 3,110 were in the Rest of the World reporting segment; and approximately 50 were in All Other. We have entered into collective bargaining agreements covering approximately 390 of the employees in the North America reporting segment and approximately 190 of the employees in the Rest of the World reporting segment, which all contain terms that we believe are typical in our industry. As these agreements expire, we believe that they can be renegotiated on terms satisfactory to us. We consider our relations with employees to be generally good.
Diversity and Inclusion
We are committed to creating an inclusive workplace that promotes and values diversity, where we embrace our differences and empower our associates to be authentic and transparent. Our company is made up of extraordinary people of every race, gender, religion, sexual orientation and background. We are committed to a culture built on our core value of respect for each other, respect for our customers, respect for our business partners and respect for our communities. We do not tolerate discrimination, harassment or retaliation.
We created a diversity, equity, and inclusion (“DEI”) Strategy Committee, a cross-functional group of diverse associates across Primo that has taken the lead in formalizing our DEI Commitment. The commitment statement is an important first step. Our goal is to create a truly inclusive work culture that ensures diversity of thought is valued across our Company. We are committed to recognizing and embracing the whole associate. As part of this process, our associates and senior management are creating detailed and measurable actions to be incorporated into our strategic plans. And we are inserting a DEI lens into our recruitment processes that is deliberate, consistent and ensures that our talent base reflects the diversity of people, of perspectives and experiences that we need to truly be one Primo across the globe. To promote these goals, we appointed Shayron Barnes-Selby as our first Chief Diversity and Inclusion Officer in June 2021. Ms. Barnes-Selby is responsible for overseeing the implementation of the end-to-end DEI framework and program across our global footprint. 
Primo offers several options for associates to raise concerns about harassment or discrimination, including an online web-based platform, a helpline, and by speaking with human resource partners or leaders in our organization. We will not tolerate retaliation or unfair treatment of any associate who reports concerns in good faith or who participates in an investigation of any such reports. Retaliation against an individual for reporting in good faith any violation or for participating in any such investigation is a serious violation of our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics that will subject the violator to appropriate disciplinary action, including possible termination of employment.
Health and Safety
The health and safety of our associates is our highest priority, and this is consistent with our operating philosophy. We have implemented crisis management teams at the enterprise level and in each of our businesses to ensure our operations are aligned with global health standards and that we continue to enable the ongoing safe manufacturing and distribution of our products, as well as the safety of our customers and associates throughout the coronavirus (“COVID-19”) pandemic and beyond.
As the COVID-19 pandemic evolved, we have taken multiple steps to prevent the potential spread of the virus, to equip our associates to provide an essential service in our communities, and to ensure the ongoing, safe manufacturing and delivery of our products:
•Adding work from home flexibility;
•Increasing cleaning protocols across all locations;
•Initiating regular communication regarding impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, including health and safety protocols and procedures;
•Implementing temperature screening of associates at our locations;
•Establishing new physical distancing procedures for associates who need to be onsite;
•Providing personal protective equipment and cleaning supplies;
•Modifying office work stations with plexiglass dividers;
•Implementing protocols to address actual and suspected COVID-19 cases and potential exposure;
•Suspending all domestic and international non-essential air travel for all associates; and
•Requiring masks to be worn in all locations.
Our products and services were deemed essential and as a result, all of our production sites continued operating during the COVID-19 pandemic. As such, we have invested in creating a physically safe work environment for our associates. Our frontline associates have gone above and beyond to perform an essential service for customers and communities during this global crisis, and our priority is to support them and keep them safe. That’s why we are reinforcing the availability of “no contact” delivery with our customers, reminding them to communicate any updates to their delivery and if they leave their empty bottles outside, we will replace them accordingly. We are also encouraging associates to live our safety principles and stop unsafe work if there is an identified or perceived risk at any delivery location.
Total Rewards
Our compensation programs are designed to align the compensation of our associates with the Company's performance, offering market-competitive compensation, meaningful benefits, and differentiated rewards for our high performers. We believe that investing in our associates results in increased engagement, satisfaction and retention, which ultimately leads to an elevated customer experience and increased shareowner value.
Our total rewards philosophy is designed to:
•Attract, motivate, reward, and retain talent who contribute to the success of the Company;
•Value the diversity of our workforce, recognizing that different people have different needs, and thus strive to provide flexibility and choice in our reward system;
•Be both internally and externally equitable, providing our talent with opportunities, which relate to competitive practices and reflect individual responsibilities, skills, and contributions to the Company;
•Support the whole person, enabling personal and professional growth; and
•Be transparent and effectively communicate; simple and easy to understand the value.
Our target total direct compensation for our executive leadership is designed to be competitive with peer companies and market data to help us attract and retain top talent. A substantial portion of executive officer compensation is variable or at-risk, in line with our philosophy of rewarding our executives when they produce value for our shareowners and our associates. 
It is also our intention to offer benefits that will allow our associates and their families to live healthier lives. We offer comprehensive benefits to all eligible associates. These include, among other benefits:
•Medical insurance, prescription drug benefits, dental and vision insurance;
•Accident insurance, critical illness insurance, life insurance, disability insurance, legal insurance, health savings and flexible spending accounts;
•Paid and unpaid leaves;
•Retirement plan; and
•Voluntary benefits that allow associates to select the options that meet their needs, including flexible time-off, telemedicine, and adoption assistance.
Serving Our Communities
We are strongly committed not only to the communities we serve, but also to the world at large. After all, our families live, work and play in our local communities and around the globe.
It is part of our purpose to promote hydration and wellness via sponsorships and in-kind donations, and to provide aid in the times of need. We provide bottled water products for local sporting events, culinary and hospitality programs, fundraisers, and associate-supported efforts and have contributed time and resources to many regional causes. We also donated water to medical centers and first responders, as well as supported hospitality partners feeding front-line workers during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.
