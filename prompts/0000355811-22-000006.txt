Item 1.        Business.

(a)General Development of Business
Gentex Corporation (the "Company") was incorporated as a Michigan corporation in 1974. The Company designs, develops, manufactures, markets, and supplies digital vision, connected car, dimmable glass, and fire protection products, including: automatic-dimming rearview and non-dimming mirrors and electronics for the automotive industry; dimmable aircraft windows for the aviation industry; and commercial smoke alarms and signaling devices for the fire protection industry. The Company’s largest business segment involves designing, developing, manufacturing and marketing interior and exterior automatic-dimming automotive rearview mirrors that utilize proprietary electrochromic technology to dim in proportion to the amount of headlight glare from trailing vehicle headlamps. Within this business segment, the Company also designs, develops and manufactures various electronics that are value added features to the interior and exterior automotive rearview mirrors as well as electronics for interior visors, overhead consoles, and other locations in the vehicle. The Company ships its products to all of the major automotive producing regions worldwide, which it supports with numerous sales, engineering and distribution locations worldwide. 
At its inception, the Company manufactured smoke detectors, a product line that has since evolved to include a variety of fire protection products. In the early 1980's, the Company introduced an interior electromechanical automatic-dimming rearview mirror as an alternative to the manual day/night rearview mirrors for automotive applications. In the late 1980's, the Company introduced an interior electrochromic automatic-dimming rearview mirror for automotive applications. In the early 1990's, the Company introduced an exterior electrochromic automatic-dimming rearview mirror for automotive applications. In the late 1990's, the Company began making volume shipments of three new exterior mirror sub-assembly products: thin glass flat; convex; and aspheric. In 2005, the Company began making volume shipments of its bezel-free exterior automatic dimming mirror. In 2010 the Company began delivering, electrochromic dimmable aircraft windows for the aviation industry. In 2013, the Company acquired HomeLink®, a wireless vehicle/home communications product that enables drivers to remotely activate garage door openers, entry door locks, home lighting, security systems, entry gates and other radio frequency convenience products for automotive applications, wherein the Company had previously been a licensee of HomeLink® and had been, since 2003, integrating HomeLink® into its interior automatic-dimming rearview mirrors. 
In 2015, the Company began making shipments of the Full Display Mirror® ("FDM"®), which is an on-demand, mirror-borne LCD display that streams live, panoramic video of the vehicle's rearward view in order to improve driver rear vision. Also in 2015, the Company introduced the integration of toll module technology into the vehicle in a first-to-market application referred to as Integrated Toll Module® or "ITM®". The interior mirror is an optimal location for a vehicle-integrated toll transponder and it eliminates the need to affix multiple toll tags to the windshield. 
In 2017, the Company announced an agreement entered into during the ordinary course of business with VOXX International Corporation to become the exclusive aftermarket distributor of the Gentex Aftermarket Full Display Mirror® in North America. The Company has also displayed a new three-camera rear vision system that streams rear video – in multiple composite views – to a rearview-mirror-integrated display. Further, the Company has announced an embedded biometric solution for vehicles that leverages iris scanning technology to create a secure environment in the vehicle. There are many use cases for authentication, which range from vehicle security to start functionality to personalization of mirrors, music, seat location and temperature, to the ability to control transactions not only for the ITM® system, but also the ride sharing car of the future. The Company believes iris recognition is among the most secure forms of biometric identification, with a false acceptance rate as low as one in 10 million, far superior to facial, voice, and other biometric systems. The Company's future plans include integrating biometric authentication with many of its other electronic features, including HomeLink® and HomeLink Connect® or the ITM®. The biometric system allows for added security and convenience for multiple drivers by adding an additional factor of authentication for increased security, when a driver (or passenger) enters a vehicle. The Company announced in January 2018 that it entered into an exclusive licensing agreement, in the ordinary course of business, with Fingerprint Cards AB to deploy its ActiveIRIS® iris-scanning biometric technology in automotive applications. 
In January 2019, the Company announced that it would be offering, as optional content, its latest generation of variable dimmable windows on the Boeing 777X aircraft. During the third quarter of 2019, the first production shipments of variably dimmable windows were made to Boeing for the 777X program. In January 2020, the 
Company announced that Airbus will also be offering the Company's dimmable aircraft windows on its aircraft with production starting in late 2020.
In January 2020, the Company unveiled an innovative lighting technology for medical applications that was co-developed with Mayo Clinic. This new lighting concept represents the collaboration of a global, high-technology electronics company with a world leader in health care. The Company's new intelligent lighting system combines ambient room lighting with camera-controlled, adaptive task lighting to optimize illumination for surgical and patient-care environments. The system was developed over an 18 month period of collaboration between Company engineers and Mayo Clinic surgeons, scientists, and operating room staff. The teams researched, designed, and rapidly iterated multiple prototypes in order to develop unique features that address major gaps in current surgical lighting solutions. In 2022, the Company will continue to work on the intelligent medical lighting system in order to assess system performance and work toward obtaining any necessary approvals. 
In April 2020, the Company, in the ordinary course of business, acquired Vaporsens, Inc. ("Vaporsens"), which specializes in nanofiber chemical sensing research and development. This new nanofiber technology can detect a wide variety of chemicals, including explosives, drugs, volatile organic compounds ("VOCs"), toxic industrial chemicals, amines, and more. The core of Vaporsens’ chemical sensor technology is a net of nanofibers approximately one thousand times smaller in size than human hair. Their porous structure allows them to absorb targeted molecules from sampled gas and identify them via changes in their electrical resistance. The technology allows for the rapid detection of target chemicals with high sensitivity in the parts per billion and parts per trillion ranges. The Vaporsens technology has a wide variety of use cases in various markets and industries, with potential applications for automotive, aerospace, agriculture, chemical manufacturing, military and first responders, worker safety, food and beverage processing, and medical.
In November 2020, the Company announced a partnership, in the ordinary course of business, with PayByCar™, to pursue compatibility between the Company's ITM® and PayByCar's innovative payment solution that allows drivers to use their smart phones and toll transponder to fuel up at certain gas stations without using cash or a credit card. Compatibility between these two technologies can help to grow each company's respective consumer base while introducing new users to the benefits of the transactional vehicle.
In January 2021, the Company announced a partnership, in the ordinary course of business, with Simplenight to provide drivers and vehicle occupants with access to enhanced mobile capability for booking personalized entertainment and lifestyle experiences in addition to everyday purchases.

Traditionally, new products and technologies have been restricted to high-end vehicles and premium trim/option packages. As consumer demand has continued to pursue the adoption of advanced technology, more OEMs have shifted to offer a variety of trim packages and option packages for each of their vehicles, creating a range of available pricing and technologies across their lineups. In some instances, Company products such as the FDM® appeal to consumers who are interested in new technology, while also resolving rearward vision limitations created by vehicle design changes that increase aerodynamics. The Company has contributed to this differentiation strategy, allowing OEMs to maximize profitability and optionality by providing profitable, mirror-based and in-vehicle technologies that consumers demand. As more consumers have become familiar with interior and exterior dimming mirrors, HomeLink®, FDM®, and other Company technologies, consumers have continued to select these technologies in their subsequent vehicles, driving further market and nameplate penetration as OEMs launch new vehicles and expand into new markets. Where OEMs had historically used Company technologies only to differentiate from one another, they have now begun to also use Company technologies to differentiate trim lines across their own nameplates. In new markets, emerging OEMs have recognized the need to include Company products in their vehicles to compete with global OEMs and to maximize per-vehicle profitability.
Automotive Rearview Mirrors and Electronics Competition. The Company continues to be the leading producer of automatic-dimming rearview mirrors in the world and currently is the largest supplier to the automotive industry with an approximate 91% market share worldwide in 2021. While the Company believes it will retain a significant position in automatic-dimming rearview mirrors for some time, another U.S. manufacturer, Magna Mirrors, a division of Magna International Inc. ("Magna"), continues to compete for sales to domestic and foreign vehicle manufacturers and is supplying a number of domestic and foreign vehicle models with its versions of auto-dimming mirrors and appears to have considerably more resources available to it. As such, Magna may present a formidable competitive threat. The Company also continues to sell automatic-dimming exterior mirror sub-assemblies to Magna Mirrors. In addition, a Japanese manufacturer (Tokai Rika) is currently supplying a few vehicle models in Japan with solid-state electrochromic mirrors. There are also a small number of Chinese domestic mirror suppliers that are marketing and selling automatic-dimming rearview mirrors, in low volume, within the domestic China automotive market. Moreover, other companies have demonstrated products that are competitive to the Company's Full Display Mirror® system, and a small number of Chinese domestic mirror suppliers have begun marketing and selling these products, in low volume, within the domestic China Market. Further, a Japan manufacturer (Murakami) has begun selling and marketing competitive Full Display Mirror® products in Japan. The Company acknowledges that dimming device (e.g., electrochromic) technology is the subject of research and development efforts by numerous third parties. 
In November 2020, the Company announced a partnership, in the ordinary course of business, with PayByCar™, to pursue compatibility between the Company's ITM® and PayByCar's innovative payment solution that allows drivers to use their smartphones and toll transponder to fuel up at certain gas stations without using cash or a credit card. Compatibility between these two technologies can help to grow each company's respective consumer base while introducing new users to the benefits of the transactional vehicle. 
In January 2021, the Company announced a partnership, in the ordinary course of business, with Simplenight to provide drivers and vehicle occupants with access to enhanced mobile capability for booking personalized entertainment and lifestyle experiences in addition to everyday purchases. Simplenight delivers a customizable and robust platform that enables brands to globally offer real-time book-ability across multiple categories such as dining, accommodations, attractions, events, gas, parking, shopping and more. The platform is unique in that it is designed to seamlessly integrate into automaker infotainment and navigation systems, as well as mobile applications and voice assistants. The Company plans to integrate Simplenight into its current and future connected vehicle technologies, including HomeLink®, the automotive industry’s leading car-to-home automation system. HomeLink® consists of vehicle-integrated buttons that can be programmed to operate a myriad of home automation devices.
