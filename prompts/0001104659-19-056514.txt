PB Bancorp, Inc. (the “Company”) is a Maryland corporation incorporated in 2015 to be the successor to PSB Holdings, Inc. upon completion of the second-step mutual-to-stock conversion (the “Conversion”) of Putnam Bancorp, MHC (the “MHC”), the top tier mutual holding company of PSB Holdings, Inc. PSB Holdings, Inc. was the former mid-tier holding company for Putnam Bank (the “Bank”).

General
 
Our principal business consists of attracting deposits from the general public in the communities where our offices are located, and investing those deposits, together with funds generated from operations, primarily in loans secured by real estate, including one-to-four family residential mortgage loans and commercial real estate loans (including multi-family real estate loans).  To a lesser extent, we originate commercial loans, residential construction loans and consumer loans.  We also invest in investment securities.

Market Area
 
Our market area has a relatively stable population and household base.  We currently operate out of eight offices, which are located in Windham County and New London County, Connecticut.  Windham County is located in the Northeastern corner of Connecticut and borders both Massachusetts (to the north) and Rhode Island (to the east).  New London County is to the south of Windham County, located in the Southeastern corner of Connecticut.  Putnam is approximately 45 miles from Hartford, Connecticut, 30 miles from Providence, Rhode Island, and 65 miles from Boston, Massachusetts.
 
According to S&P Global Market Intelligence, from 2014 to 2019, the population of Windham County decreased by 0.6%, and New London County’s population decreased 2.3%.  At the same time, the population of the state of Connecticut decreased by 0.3%, while the United States’ population increased by 3.8%.  During the same period, the number of households declined in both Windham County and New London County (by 0.3% and 1.7%, respectively) and Connecticut showed a slight decline (0.1%) as well.  Comparatively, the number of households increased on a nationwide basis, by 4.0%.  In 2019, per capita income and median household income for Windham County equaled $33,235 and $66,793, respectively.  In the same year, per capita income and median household income for New London County equaled $42,459 and $76,305, respectively.  These compare to 2019 per capita income measures for the state of Connecticut and the United States of $45,112 and $34,902, respectively, and 2019 median household income measures for the state of Connecticut and the United States of $78,970 and $63,174, respectively.
 
Windham County has a diversified mix of industry groups and employment sectors, including education/healthcare/social services, services and wholesale/retail trade.  According to S&P Global Market Intelligence, these three sectors comprise approximately 66% of the employment base in Windham County.  The same three sectors comprised approximately 66% of the employment base in New London County.
 
June 2019 unemployment rates for Windham County at 4.4% and Connecticut at 3.9% were above the national unemployment rate of 3.8%, while New London County’s unemployment rate of 3.8% matched the national rate.  Notably, the June 2019 unemployment rates for the United States, Connecticut, Windham County, and New London County have all decreased relative to their June 2018 unemployment rates of 4.2%, 4.4%, 4.8% and 4.2%, respectively.  Our primary market area for deposits includes the communities in which we maintain our main office and our branch office locations.  Our primary lending area is broader than our primary deposit market area and includes all of Windham County, and parts of the adjacent Connecticut Counties of New London and Tolland, as well as the Rhode Island and Massachusetts communities adjacent to Windham County.
 
Competition
 
We face intense competition within our market area for deposits and loans. The Town of Putnam and the surrounding area have a high concentration of financial institutions, including large commercial banks, community banks and credit unions. Several large holding companies operate banks in our market area. Many of them are significantly larger than us and, therefore, have greater resources.  Additionally, some of our competitors offer products and services that we currently do not offer, such as trust services and private banking. We face additional competition for deposits from money market funds, brokerage firms, insurance companies, mutual funds and other corporate and government securities.
 
As of June 30, 2018, based on the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation’s annual Summary of Deposits Report (the most current data available), our market share of Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation-insured deposits represented 18.9% of deposits in Windham County, giving us the second largest market share out of ten financial institutions with offices in that county as of that date, and 1.4% of deposits in New London County, giving us the 11th largest market share out of 15 financial institutions with offices in that county as of that date. 
 
Lending Activities 
 
Historically, our principal lending activity has been the origination of first mortgage loans for the purchase or refinancing of one-to-four family residential real estate, and we have recently increased our origination of commercial real estate loans. Historically, we have sold the majority of longer-term, fixed-rate loans (other than bi-weekly loans) in the secondary market. However, the additional capital raised in the offering has permitted us to retain longer term, fixed-rate loans in our portfolio.

At June 30, 2019, the total amount of loans that had fixed interest rates was $204.1 million, and the total amount of loans that had floating or adjustable interest rates was $175.8 million.
 
Residential Real Estate Loans. Our primary residential lending activity consists of the origination of one-to-four family residential real estate loans that are primarily secured by properties located in Windham and New London Counties, Connecticut. At June 30, 2019, $221.5 million, or 58.3% of our loan portfolio, consisted of one-to-four family residential real estate loans. At June 30, 2019, our residential real estate loans included $8.1 million of second mortgages and $7.0 million of home equity lines of credit. Generally, one-to-four family residential real estate loans are originated in amounts up to 80% of the lesser of the appraised value or purchase price of the property, with private mortgage insurance required on loans with a loan-to-value ratio in excess of 80%. We will not make loans with a loan-to-value ratio in excess of 100% for one-to-four family residential real estate loans. Fixed rate real estate loans generally are originated for terms of 10 to 30 years. Generally, all fixed rate residential real estate loans are underwritten according to Fannie Mae policies and procedures. There were no residential real estate loans purchased during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019.
 
At June 30, 2019, $56.6 million, or 25.6%, of our residential real estate loans were bi-weekly real estate loans. Bi-weekly real estate loans are loans that require payments to be made every two weeks, thus shortening the duration of the loan. The borrower is required to maintain a deposit account with us for automatic withdrawal of the mortgage payment.
 
Historically, we have sold the majority of longer-term, fixed-rate loans (other than bi-weekly loans) in the secondary market. However, the additional capital raised in the offering has permitted us to retain longer term, fixed-rate loans in our portfolio. We originated $14.6 million of fixed rate one-to-four family residential loans during the year ended June 30, 2019, of which $1.5 million were sold in the secondary market.
 
We also offer adjustable rate mortgage loans for one-to-four family properties, with an interest rate based on the one-year Constant Maturity Treasury Bill Index, which adjusts annually from the outset of the loan or which adjusts annually after a three-, five-, seven-, or ten-year initial fixed rate period. We originated $7.9 million of adjustable rate one-to-four family residential loans during the year ended June 30, 2019, none of which were sold in the secondary market. Our adjustable rate mortgage loans generally provide for maximum rate adjustments of 100 basis points per adjustment, with a lifetime maximum adjustment up to 6% above the initial rate, regardless of the initial rate. Our adjustable rate real estate loans amortize over terms of up to 30 years.
 
Adjustable rate real estate loans decrease the risk associated with changes in market interest rates by periodically repricing, but involve other risks because, as interest rates increase, the monthly or bi-weekly payments by the borrower increase, thus increasing the potential for default by the borrower. At the same time, the value of the underlying collateral may be adversely affected by higher interest rates. Upward adjustment of the contractual interest rate is also limited by the maximum periodic and lifetime interest rate adjustments permitted by our loan documents and, therefore, the effectiveness of adjustable rate real estate loans may be limited during periods of rapidly rising interest rates. At June 30, 2019, $88.8 million, or 40.1%, of our one-to-four family residential loans had adjustable rates of interest.

In an effort to provide financing for moderate income home buyers, we offer Veterans Administration (“VA”), Connecticut Housing Finance Authority (“CHFA”) and Rural Development (“RD”) loans. These programs offer residential real estate loans to qualified individuals. These loans are offered with fixed rates of interest and terms of up to 30 years. Such loans are secured by one-to-four family residential properties. All of these loans are originated using agency underwriting guidelines. RD, VA and CHFA loans are closed in the name of Putnam Bank and are immediately sold on a servicing-released basis. All such loans are originated in amounts of up to 100% of the lower of the property’s appraised value or the sale price. 
 
All residential real estate loans that we originate include “due-on-sale” clauses, which give us the right to declare a loan immediately due and payable if, among other things, the borrower sells or otherwise disposes of the real property subject to the mortgage and the loan is not repaid. Regulations limit the amount that a savings association may lend relative to the appraised value of the real estate securing the loan, as determined by an appraisal of the property at the time the loan is originated. All borrowers are required to obtain title insurance. We also require homeowner’s insurance and fire and casualty insurance and, where circumstances warrant, flood insurance, on properties securing real estate loans. At June 30, 2019, our largest residential real estate loan had a principal balance of $1.1 million and was secured by a one-to-four family residence located in Massachusetts. At June 30, 2019, this loan was performing in accordance with its original terms.
 
At June 30, 2019, second mortgages and home equity lines of credit totaled $15.1 million, or 6.8% of our residential real estate loans and 4.0% of total loans. Additionally, at June 30, 2019, the unadvanced amounts of home equity lines of credit totaled $10.8 million. The underwriting standards utilized for second mortgages and home equity lines of credit include a determination of the applicant’s credit history, an assessment of the applicant’s ability to meet existing obligations and payments on the proposed loan and the value of the collateral securing the loan. Second mortgages are offered with fixed rates of interest and with terms of up to 15 years. The loan-to-value ratio for a home equity loan is generally limited to 80%. However, we offer special programs to borrowers, who satisfy certain underwriting criteria, with loan-to-value ratios of up to 100%. Our home equity lines of credit have adjustable rates of interest which are indexed to the prime rate, as reported in The Wall Street Journal.
 
Commercial Real Estate Loans. We originate commercial real estate loans, including multi-family real estate loans. These loans are generally secured by one-to-four family non-owner occupied investment properties, multi-family real estate of 20 units or less, small commercial owner and non-owner occupied properties, hotels, non-owner occupied condominiums and commercial vacant land.  The security for these loans is primarily located in our primary market area. At June 30, 2019, commercial mortgage loans totaled $145.7 million, or 38.4% of total loans. Our commercial real estate underwriting policies provide that such real estate loans may be made in amounts of up to 80% of the appraised value of the property provided such loan complies with our current loans-to-one-borrower limit, which at June 30, 2019 was $11.1 million. Our commercial real estate loans may be made with terms of up to five years with 20-year amortization schedules and are offered with interest rates that are fixed or that adjust periodically and are generally indexed to the prime rate as reported in The Wall Street Journal or to Federal Home Loan Bank advance rates. In reaching a decision on whether to make a commercial real estate loan, we consider the net operating income of the property, the borrower’s expertise and credit history, and the profitability of the value of the underlying property. In addition, with respect to commercial real estate rental properties, we will also consider the term of the lease and the quality of the tenants. We generally require that the properties securing these real estate loans have debt service coverage ratios (the ratio of earnings before debt service to debt service) of at least 1.25x. Environmental surveys are generally required for commercial real estate loans. Generally, multi-family and commercial real estate loans made to corporations, partnerships and other business entities require personal guarantees by the principals.
 
A commercial borrower’s financial information is monitored on an ongoing basis by requiring periodic financial statement updates, payment history reviews and periodic face-to-face meetings with the borrower. We require commercial borrowers to provide annually updated financial statements and federal tax returns. These requirements also apply to all guarantors on commercial loans. We also require borrowers with rental investment property to provide an annual report of income and expenses for the property, including a tenant list and copies of leases, as applicable. The largest commercial real estate loans in our portfolio at June 30, 2019 were loans totaling $8.5 million, secured by a hotel located in Connecticut. These loans consisted of $7.4 million outstanding, with an unadvanced portion of $1.1 million as of June 30, 2019. At June 30, 2019, these loans were performing in accordance with its original terms.

Loans secured by commercial real estate, including multi-family properties, generally involve larger principal amounts and a greater degree of risk than one-to-four family residential real estate loans. Because payments on loans secured by commercial real estate, including multi-family properties, are often dependent on successful operation or management of the properties, repayment of such loans may be affected by adverse conditions in the real estate market or the economy.
 
Commercial Loans. At June 30, 2019, we had $10.3 million in commercial business loans, which amounted to 2.7% of total loans. We make such commercial loans primarily in our market area to a variety of professionals, sole proprietorships and small businesses. Commercial lending products include term loans and revolving lines of credit. Such loans are generally used for longer-term working capital purposes such as purchasing equipment or furniture. Commercial loans are made with either adjustable or fixed rates of interest. Variable rates are based on the prime rate, as published in The Wall Street Journal, plus a margin. Fixed rate commercial loans are set at a margin above the comparable Federal Home Loan Bank advance rate.
 
When making commercial loans, we consider the financial condition of the borrower, our lending history with the borrower, the debt service capabilities of the borrower, the projected cash flows of the business and the value of the collateral. Commercial loans are generally secured by a variety of collateral, primarily accounts receivable, inventory and equipment, and are supported by personal guarantees. Depending on the collateral used to secure the loans, commercial loans are made in amounts of up to 75% of the value of the collateral securing the loan. We generally do not make unsecured commercial loans.
 
Commercial loans generally have greater credit risk than residential real estate loans. Unlike residential real estate loans, which generally are made on the basis of the borrower’s ability to make repayment from his or her employment or other income, and which are secured by real property whose value tends to be more easily ascertainable, commercial loans generally are made on the basis of the borrower’s ability to repay the loan from the cash flow of the borrower’s business. As a result, the availability of funds for the repayment of commercial loans may depend substantially on the success of the business itself. Further, any collateral securing the loans may depreciate over time, may be difficult to appraise and may fluctuate in value. We seek to minimize these risks through our underwriting standards. At June 30, 2019, our largest commercial loan was a $943,000 loan secured by business assets located in our primary market area. This loan was performing according to its original terms at June 30, 2019.
 
Origination, Purchase, Sale and Servicing of Loans. Lending activities are conducted primarily by our loan personnel operating at our eight branch offices and one loan origination center. All loans originated by us are underwritten pursuant to our policies and procedures. We originate both adjustable rate and fixed rate loans. Our ability to originate fixed or adjustable rate loans is dependent upon the relative customer demand for such loans, which is affected by current and expected future levels of market interest rates. There were no loans purchased during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019. The Bank performs its own underwriting analysis before purchasing a loan and, therefore, believes there should not be a greater risk of default on these obligations compared to loans the Bank originates itself. However, generally in a purchased loan, the Bank does not service the loan and thus is subject to the policies and practices of the originating lender with regard to pursuing collections and foreclosure proceedings.
 
Historically, we have sold the majority of longer-term, fixed-rate loans (other than bi-weekly loans) in the secondary market. However, the additional capital raised in the offering has permitted us to retain longer term, fixed-rate loans in our portfolio. The one-to-four family loans that we currently originate for sale include mortgage loans which conform to the underwriting standards specified by Fannie Mae. We also sell all mortgage loans insured by CHFA, VA and Rural Development. Generally, we sell our loans without recourse. We retain the servicing rights on the mortgage loans sold to Fannie Mae, but sell all CHFA, VA, and Rural Development loans on a servicing-released basis.

At June 30, 2019, Putnam Bank was servicing loans in the amount of $20.0 million. Loan servicing includes collecting and remitting loan payments, accounting for principal and interest, contacting delinquent mortgagors, supervising foreclosures and property dispositions in the event of unremedied defaults, making certain insurance and tax payments on behalf of the borrowers and generally administering the loans.
 
During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019, we originated $22.5 million of one-to-four family loans, of which we retained $21.0 million. We recognize at the time of sale, the cash gain or loss on the sale of the loans based on the difference between the net cash proceeds received and the carrying value of the loans sold.
 
Loan Approval Procedures and Authority. The board of directors establishes the lending policies and loan approval limits of Putnam Bank. Loan officers generally have the authority to originate loans up to amounts established for each lending officer. Loans in amounts above the individual authorized limits require the approval of Putnam Bank’s Credit Committee. The Credit Committee is authorized to approve all loans-to-one borrower relationships in amounts up to $750,000. Putnam Bank’s Board of Directors must approve all loans and relationships that are $750,000 or greater.
 
The board of directors annually approves independent appraisers used by Putnam Bank. For larger loans, we may require an environmental site assessment to be performed by an independent professional for all non-residential real estate loans. It is our policy to require hazard insurance on all real estate loans.
 
Loan Origination Fees and Other Income. In addition to interest earned on loans, Putnam Bank receives loan origination fees. Such fees and costs vary with the volume and type of loans and commitments made and purchased, principal repayments, and competitive conditions in the mortgage markets, which in turn respond to the demand and availability of money.
Loans to One Borrower. The maximum amount that we may lend to one borrower and the borrower’s related entities is generally limited, by regulation, to 15% of our stated capital and reserves. At June 30, 2019, our regulatory limit on loans to one borrower was $11.1 million. At that date, the largest aggregate amount loaned by Putnam Bank to one borrower was $8.5 million, consisting of commercial real estate loans. These loans consisted of $7.4 million outstanding, with an unadvanced portion of $1.1 million as of June 30, 2019. The loans comprising this lending relationship were performing in accordance with their original terms as of June 30, 2019.
Delinquencies and Classified Assets
 
Collection Procedures A computer-generated delinquency notice is mailed monthly to all delinquent borrowers, advising them of the amount of their delinquency. When a loan becomes 60 days delinquent, Putnam Bank sends a letter advising the borrower of the delinquency. The borrower is given 30 days to pay the delinquent payments or to contact Putnam Bank to make arrangements to bring the loan current over a longer period of time. If the borrower fails to bring the loan current in 30 days or to make arrangements to cure the delinquency over a longer period of time, the matter is referred to legal counsel and foreclosure proceedings are started. We may consider forbearance in cases of a temporary loss of income if a plan is presented by the borrower to cure the delinquency in a reasonable period of time after his or her income resumes.
Loans Past Due and Non-Performing Assets.  Loans are reviewed on a regular basis.  Management determines that a loan is impaired or non-performing when it is probable at least a portion of the loan will not be collected in accordance with the original terms due to a deterioration in the financial condition of the borrower or the value of the underlying collateral, if the loan is collateral dependent.  When a loan is determined to be impaired, the measurement of the loan in the allowance for loan losses is based on present value of expected future cash flows, except that all collateral-dependent loans are measured for impairment based on the fair value of the collateral. Non-accrual loans are loans in which collectability is questionable and therefore interest on such loans will no longer be recognized on an accrual basis. All loans that become 90 days or more delinquent are placed on non-accrual status unless the loan is well secured and in the process of collection. When loans are placed on non-accrual status, unpaid accrued interest is fully reversed, and further income is recognized only to the extent received on a cash basis or cost recovery method.  At June 30, 2019, we had non-performing loans of $4.2 million and a ratio of non-performing loans to total loans of 1.1%.

Real estate acquired as a result of foreclosure or by deed in lieu of foreclosure is classified as other real estate owned (“OREO”) until such time as it is sold.  When real estate is acquired through foreclosure or by deed in lieu of foreclosure, it is recorded at its fair value, less estimated costs of disposal.  If the value of the property is less than the loan, less any related specific loan loss provisions, the difference is charged against the allowance for loan losses.  Any subsequent write-down of OREO is charged against earnings.  At June 30, 2019, we had OREO of $1.3 million. Other real estate owned is included in non-performing assets.
 
A loan is classified as a troubled debt restructuring if, for economic or legal reasons related to the borrower’s financial difficulties, we grant a concession to the borrower that we would not otherwise consider. This usually includes a modification of loan terms, such as a reduction of the interest rate to below market terms, capitalizing past due interest or extending the maturity date and possibly a partial forgiveness of debt. Interest income on restructured loans is accrued after the borrower demonstrates the ability to pay under the restructured terms through a sustained period of repayment performance, which is generally six consecutive months.
 
Non-Performing Assets. The table below sets forth the amounts and categories of our non-performing assets at the dates indicated. A loan classified in the table below as “non-accrual” does not necessarily mean that such loan is or has been delinquent. Once a loan is delinquent 90 days or more or the borrower or collateral securing the loan experiences an event that makes collectability doubtful, the loan is placed on “non-accrual” status. Our policies require six consecutive months of contractual payments in order for the loan to be removed from non-accrual status.

Total non-performing assets decreased by $306,000, or 5.3%, to $5.5 million at June 30, 2019 from $5.8 million at June 30, 2019. Non-performing assets as of June 30, 2019 consisted of $1.3 million of other real estate owned, which reflects the repossession of a three-lot residential development project at a carrying value of $97,000, commercial land with a carrying value of $394,000, 202.5 acres of land with a carrying value of $494,000, a residential home with a carrying value of $166,000 and vacant land with a carrying value of $121,000. Also included in non-performing assets at June 30, 2019 was $4.2 million in non-performing loans. These loans consisted of 28 residential loans totaling $3.7 million and three commercial real estate loans totaling $539,000. Non-performing assets as of June 30, 2018 consisted of $1.4 million of other real estate owned, which reflects the repossession of a three-lot residential development project at a carrying value of $110,000, a commercial building with a carrying value of $81,000, commercial land with a carrying value of $418,000, 202.5 acres of land with a carrying value of $557,000, a residential home with a carrying value of $106,000 and another residential home at a carrying value of $110,000. Also included in non-performing assets at June 30, 2018 was $4.4 million in non-performing loans. These loans consisted of 31 residential loans totaling $4.0 million, three commercial real estate loans totaling $432,000 and one consumer loan for $1,000. 
 
Management is focused on working with borrowers and guarantors to resolve non-performing loans by restructuring or liquidating assets when prudent. We review the strength of the guarantors; require face to face discussions and offer restructuring suggestions that provide the borrowers with short-term relief and exit strategies. Overall, we expect to see improvement as solutions are identified and executed. We obtain a current appraisal on all real estate secured loans that are 180 days or more past due if the appraisal in our file is older than one year. If the determination is made that there is the potential for collateral shortfall, an allocated reserve will be assigned to the loan for the expected deficiency. It is our policy to charge off or write down loans or other assets when, in the opinion of the Credit Committee and external loan review, the ultimate amount recoverable is less than the book value, or the collection of the amount is expected to be unduly prolonged. The level of non-performing assets is expected to fluctuate in response to changing economic and market conditions, and the relative sizes of the respective loan portfolios, along with management’s degree of success in resolving problem assets. Management takes a proactive approach with respect to the identification and resolution of problem loans

Classified Assets. Applicable banking regulations and our internal policies require that management utilize an internal asset classification system to monitor and evaluate the credit risk inherent in its loan portfolio. We currently classify problem and potential problem assets as “substandard”, “doubtful”, “loss” or “special mention.” An asset is considered “substandard” if it is inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged, if any. “Substandard” assets include those characterized by the distinct possibility that the institution will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. Assets classified as “doubtful” have all of the weaknesses inherent in those classified “substandard” with the added characteristic that the weaknesses present make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values, questionable, and there is a high probability of loss. Assets classified as “loss” are those considered uncollectible and of such little value that their continuance as loans is not warranted. In addition, assets that do not currently expose us to sufficient risk to warrant classification in one of the aforementioned categories but possess credit deficiencies or potential weaknesses are required to be designated “special mention.”
 
An insured institution is required to establish general allowances for loan losses in an amount deemed prudent by management for loans classified substandard or doubtful, as well as for other potential problem loans. General allowances represent loss allowances which have been established to recognize the inherent losses associated with lending activities, but which, unlike specific allowances, have not been allocated to particular problem assets. When an insured institution classifies problem assets as “loss”, it is required either to establish a specific allowance for losses equal to 100% of the amount of the asset so classified or to charge off such amount. Our determination as to the classification of its assets and the amount of its valuation allowances is subject to review by our banking regulators, who can order the establishment of additional general or specific loss allowances.
 
11

 

On the basis of management’s review of our assets, at June 30, 2019, we classified $5.9 million of our loans as substandard and no loans as doubtful. Of these loans, $3.8 million were considered non-performing and included in the table of non-performing assets. At June 30, 2019, $1.6 million of our loans were designated as special mention, and none of our assets were classified as loss.


The loan portfolio is reviewed on a regular basis to determine whether any loans require classification in accordance with applicable regulations. Not all classified assets constitute non-performing assets.
 
Allowance for Loan Losses 
 
Our allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level necessary to absorb loan losses that are both probable and reasonably estimable. Management, in determining the allowance for loan losses, considers the losses inherent in our loan portfolio and changes in the nature and volume of loan activities, along with the general economic and real estate market conditions. We identify and establish specific loss allowances on impaired loans, establish general valuation allowances on the remainder of our loan portfolio and establish an unallocated portion to reflect losses resulting from the inherent imprecision involved in the loss analysis process. Once a loan becomes delinquent or otherwise identified as impaired, we may establish a specific loan loss allowance based on a review of among other things, expected cash flows, delinquency status, size of loans, type and market value of collateral and financial condition of the borrowers. General loan loss allowances are based upon a combination of factors including, but not limited to, actual loan loss experience, composition of the loan portfolio, current economic conditions and delinquency trends. The allowance is increased through provisions charged against current earnings and recoveries of previously charged-off loans. The portions of loans that are determined to be uncollectible are charged against the allowance. While management uses available information to recognize probable and reasonably estimable loan losses, future loss provisions may be necessary based on changing economic conditions. The allowance for loan losses as of June 30, 2019 was maintained at a level that represents management’s best estimate of losses inherent in the loan portfolio, and such losses were both probable and reasonably estimable.
 
In addition, the Federal Reserve Board and the Connecticut Department of Banking, as an integral part of their examination process, periodically review our allowance for loan losses. These agencies may require that we recognize additions to the allowance based on their judgment of information available to them at the time of examination.

Each quarter, management evaluates the allowance for loan losses based on several factors, some of which are not loan specific but are reflective of the inherent losses in the loan portfolio. This process includes, but is not limited to, a periodic review of loan collectability in light of historical experience, the nature and volume of loan activity, conditions that may affect the ability of the borrower to repay, underlying value of collateral, if applicable, and economic conditions in our immediate market area. First, we group loans by delinquency status. All loans 90 days or more delinquent are generally evaluated individually along with other impaired loans, based primarily on the present value of expected future cash flows or the value of the collateral securing the loan. Specific loss allowances are established as required by this analysis. All loans which are not individually evaluated are segregated by type or loan grade and a loss allowance is established by using loss experience data and management’s judgment concerning other matters it considers significant. The allowance is allocated to each category of loan based on the results of the above analysis. Differences between the allocated balances and recorded allowances are reflected as unallocated to absorb losses resulting from the inherent imprecision involved in the loss analysis process.
 
This analysis process is inherently subjective, as it requires us to make estimates that are susceptible to revisions as more information becomes available. Although we believe that we have established the allowance at levels to absorb probable and estimable losses, future additions may be necessary if economic or other conditions in the future differ from the current environment. Additionally, our regulators, as a part of their examination process, periodically review our allowance for loan losses and may require us to recognize additions to the allowance based on their judgements at the time of their examination.
 
Investment Activities 
 
Putnam Bank’s Executive Committee is responsible for implementing Putnam Bank’s Investment Policy. The Investment Policy is reviewed annually and any changes to the policy are recommended to, and subject to, the approval of our board of directors. The Executive Committee is comprised of our Chairman, President, Executive Vice President and one rotating director. Authority to make investments under the Investment Policy guidelines is delegated by the Executive Committee to appropriate officers. While general investment strategies are developed and authorized by the Asset/Liability Committee, the execution of specific actions rests with the Chief Executive Officer or Executive Vice President who may act jointly or severally as Putnam Bank’s Investment Officer. The Investment Officer is responsible for ensuring that the guidelines and requirements included in the Investment Policy are followed and that all securities are considered prudent for investment. The Investment Officer is authorized to execute investment transactions (purchases and sales) up to $5 million per transaction without the prior approval of the Executive Committee and within the scope of the established Investment Policy. Each transaction in excess of established limits must receive prior approval of the Executive Committee.
 
In addition, Putnam Bank utilizes the services of an independent investment advisor to assist in managing the investment portfolio. The investment advisor is responsible for maintaining current information regarding securities dealers with whom they are conducting business on our behalf. A list of appropriate dealers is provided annually to the board of directors for approval prior to execution of trades. The investment advisor, through its assigned portfolio manager, must contact our President or Treasurer to review all investment recommendations and transactions and receive approval from the President or Treasurer prior to execution of any transaction that might be transacted on our behalf. Upon receipt of approval, the investment advisor, or its assigned portfolio manager, is authorized to conduct all investment business on our behalf.
 
Our Investment Policy requires that all securities transactions be conducted in a safe and sound manner. Investment decisions must be based upon a thorough analysis of each security instrument to determine its quality, inherent risks, fit within our overall asset/liability management objectives, effect on our risk-based capital measurement and prospects for yield and/or appreciation.
 
The investment policy is consistent with our overall business and asset/liability management strategy, which focuses on sustaining adequate levels of core earnings. During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019, we recognized $33,000 in other-than-temporary write-downs on non-agency mortgage-backed securities.

U.S. Government and government-sponsored securities. At June 30, 2019, our U.S. Government and government-sponsored securities portfolio classified as available-for-sale totaled $2.2 million, or 2.2% of total securities. At June 30, 2019, our U.S. Government and government-sponsored securities portfolio classified as held-to-maturity totaled $9.4 million, or 9.1% of total securities. While U.S. Government and government-sponsored securities generally provide lower yields than other investments in our securities investment portfolio, we maintain these investments, to the extent appropriate, for liquidity purposes and as collateral for borrowings.
 
Corporate Bonds.  At June 30, 2019, we had three investments in corporate single-issuer trust preferred securities with a total book value of $4.0 million and total fair value of $3.7 million, or 3.6% of total securities, all of which were classified as available-for-sale. The single-issuer trust preferred investments are evaluated for other-than-temporary impairment by performing a present value of cash flows each quarter. None of the issuers have deferred interest payments or announced the intention to defer interest payments. We believe the decline in fair value is related to the spread over three-month LIBOR, on which the quarterly interest payments are based, as the spread over LIBOR being received is significantly lower than current market spreads. Management concluded the impairment of these investments was considered temporary and asserts that we do not have the intent to sell these investments and that it is more likely than not it will not have to sell the investments before recovery of their cost basis which may be at maturity.
 
Although corporate bonds may offer higher yields than U.S. Treasury or agency securities of comparable duration, corporate bonds also have a higher risk of default due to possible adverse changes in the creditworthiness of the issuer. In order to mitigate this risk, our investment policy requires that corporate debt obligations be rated investment grade or better by a nationally recognized rating agency. If the bond rating goes below investment grade, then the investment is placed on an investment “watch report” and is monitored by our Investment Officer. The investment is then reviewed quarterly by our board of directors where a determination is made to hold or dispose of the investment.
 
Mortgage-Backed Securities. We purchase mortgage-backed securities insured or guaranteed by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and Ginnie Mae. We invest in mortgage-backed securities to achieve positive interest rate spreads with minimal administrative expense, and lower our credit risk as a result of the guarantees provided by Freddie Mac, Fannie Mae and Ginnie Mae. We also invest in collateralized mortgage obligations (CMOs or non-agency mortgage-backed securities), also insured or issued by Freddie Mac, Fannie Mae and Ginnie Mae, or private issuers such as Washington Mutual and Countrywide Home Loans. All private issuer CMOs were rated AAA at time of purchase.
 
Mortgage-backed securities are created by the pooling of mortgages and the issuance of a security with an interest rate that is less than the interest rates on the underlying mortgages. Mortgage-backed securities typically represent a participation interest in a pool of single-family or multi-family mortgages, although we focus our investments on mortgage-backed securities backed by one-to-four family mortgages. The issuers of such securities (generally U.S. government agencies and government-sponsored enterprises, including Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and Ginnie Mae) pool and resell the participation interests in the form of securities to investors such as Putnam Bank, and guarantee the payment of principal and interest to investors. Mortgage-backed securities generally yield less than the loans that underlie such securities because of the cost of payment guarantees and credit enhancements. However, mortgage-backed securities are usually more liquid than individual mortgage loans and may be used to collateralize our specific liabilities and obligations.
 
CMOs are a type of mortgage-backed security issued by a special purpose entity that aggregates pools of mortgage-backed securities and creates different classes of CMO securities with varying maturities and amortization schedules as well as a residual interest, with each class, or “tranche,” possessing different risk characteristics. A particular tranche of CMOs may, therefore, carry prepayment risk that differs from that of both the underlying collateral and other tranches. We purchase CMO tranches in an attempt to moderate reinvestment risk associated with mortgage-backed securities resulting from unexpected prepayment activities.

At June 30, 2019, mortgage-backed securities and CMOs classified as available-for-sale totaled $23.0 million, or 22.5% of total securities. At June 30, 2019, mortgage-backed securities and CMOs classified as held-to-maturity totaled $53.7 million, or 52.4% of total securities. At June 30, 2019, 59.6% of the mortgage-backed securities were backed by adjustable rate loans and 40.4% were backed by fixed rate mortgage loans. The mortgage-backed securities portfolio had a weighted average yield of 2.96% at June 30, 2019. Investments in mortgage-backed securities involve a risk that actual prepayments may differ from estimated prepayments over the life of the security, which may require adjustments to the amortization of any premium or accretion of any discount relating to such instruments thereby changing the net yield on such securities. There is also reinvestment risk associated with the cash flows from such securities or if such securities are redeemed by the issuer. In addition, the market value of such securities may be adversely affected by changes in interest rates.
 
State agency and municipal obligations.  At June 30, 2019, our state agency and municipal obligations portfolio classified as held-to-maturity totaled $440,000, or 0.4% of total securities.
 
Other Debt securities.  At June 30, 2019, other debt securities portfolio totaled $10.0 million, or 9.7% of total securities, all of which were classified as available-for-sale. At June 30, 2019, the portfolio consisted of auction-rate trust preferred securities (“ARP”). Auction-rate trust preferred securities are a floating rate preferred stock, on which the dividend rate generally resets every 90 days based on an auction process to reflect the yield demand for the instruments by potential purchasers. At June 30, 2019, our investments in auction-rate trust preferred securities consisted of investments in three corporate issuers. We originally purchased these securities because they represented highly liquid, tax-preferred investments secured, in most cases, by preferred stock issued or guaranteed by high quality, investment grade companies, generally other financial institutions (“collateral preferred shares”). The ARP shares, or certificates, we purchased are Class A certificates, which, among other rights, entitles the holder to priority claim on dividends paid into the trust holding the preferred shares.
 
In most cases, the trusts which issued the ARP certificates own various callable preferred shares of stock by a single entity. In addition to the call dates for redemption established by the collateral preferred shares, each trust has a maturity date upon which the trust itself will terminate. The value of the remaining collateral preferred shares is not guaranteed, and may be more or less than the stated par value of the collateral preferred shares, and is dependent on the market value of those collateral preferred shares on the date of the trust’s maturity.
 
The certificates issued by the trusts previously traded in an active, open auction market, with each individual trust establishing the frequency of its auctions, typically every 90 days (the “reset date”). The results of an auction would be the exchange of certificates, at par, between participants entering or exiting the market, and resetting of the yield to be earned by holders of the Class A certificates as well as the holders of other classes of trust certificates.
 
Beginning in February 2008, auctions for these securities began to fail when investors declined to bid on the securities. Five of the largest investment banks that made a market in these securities (Merrill Lynch, Citigroup, USB, AG and Morgan Stanley) declined to act as bidders of last resort, as they had in the past. The auction failures did not result in the loss of any principal value to the certificate holders, but prevented many sellers from exiting, or redeeming, their certificates at the reset date. These unsuccessful sellers were required to continue to hold the certificates until the next scheduled reset date. To compensate these unsuccessful sellers, the failed auctions triggered a penalty-rate feature which provided that owners of the Class A certificates were entitled to a higher portion of the dividends, and thus a higher yield, on the Class A certificates.
 
During this time, we attempted to divest the ARPs, but were prevented from doing so due to the continued failure of the auction market. We continued to carry our investments at par value, despite the increased liquidity risk, because the credit strength of the issuers of the collateral preferred shares remained high, and the yield remained above-market.
 
The turmoil in the financial markets caused the value of the underlying collateral preferred shares to decline dramatically. Market values for the ARPs from Merrill Lynch, our safekeeping agent, also declined, and we recorded a temporary impairment adjustment to the carrying value of the ARPs, which are classified as available-for-sale. A temporary impairment reduces the carrying value of the investment security with an offsetting reduction in our capital accounts.
 
17

 

We determine the fair value of the ARPs classified as Level 3 using the quoted market values of the underlying collateral preferred shares, adjusted for the higher yield we earned through the Class A certificates compared with the nominal rate available to a direct owner of the collateral preferred shares. We have not changed this pricing methodology.
 
As of June 30, 2019, there was an unrealized loss of $24,000, or 0.8% on these securities. We have the ability and intent to hold these securities for the time necessary to collect the expected cash flows.

Portfolio Maturities and Yields. The composition and maturities of the investment securities portfolio at June 30, 2019 are summarized in the following table. Maturities are based on the final contractual payment dates, and do not reflect the impact of prepayments or early redemptions that may occur. State agency and municipal obligations as well as common and preferred stock yields have not been adjusted to a tax-equivalent basis. Certain mortgage-backed securities have interest rates that are adjustable and will reprice annually within the various maturity ranges. These repricing schedules are not reflected in the table below. At June 30, 2019, mortgage-backed securities with adjustable rates totaled $45.7 million. At June 30, 2019, we held three securities that mature in one year or less, totaling $4.0 million.

Sources of Funds 
 
General. Deposits have traditionally been our primary source of funds for use in lending and investment activities. In addition to deposits, funds are derived from scheduled loan payments, investment maturities, loan prepayments, retained earnings and income on earning assets. While scheduled loan payments and income on earning assets are relatively stable sources of funds, deposit inflows and outflows can vary widely and are influenced by prevailing interest rates, market conditions and levels of competition. Borrowings from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston and brokered certificates of deposit may be used to compensate for reductions in deposits and to fund loan growth.
Deposits. A majority of our depositors are persons who work or reside in Windham County and New London County, Connecticut. We offer a selection of deposit instruments, including checking, savings, money market deposit accounts, negotiable order of withdrawal (NOW) accounts and fixed-term certificates of deposit. Deposit account terms vary, with the principal differences being the minimum balance required, the amount of time the funds must remain on deposit and the interest rate.
 
20

 

Interest rates paid, maturity terms, service fees and withdrawal penalties are established on a periodic basis. Deposit rates and terms are based primarily on current operating strategies and market rates, liquidity requirements, rates paid by competitors and growth goals. To attract and retain deposits, we rely upon personalized customer service, long-standing relationships and competitive interest rates.
 
The flow of deposits is influenced significantly by general economic conditions, changes in money market and other prevailing interest rates and competition. The variety of deposit accounts that we offer allows us to be competitive in obtaining funds and responding to changes in consumer demand. Based on historical experience, management believes our deposits are relatively stable. However, the ability to attract and maintain money market accounts and certificates of deposit, and the rates paid on these deposits, have been and will continue to be significantly affected by market conditions. At June 30, 2019, $130.3 million, or 34.0%, of our deposit accounts were certificates of deposit, of which $78.4 million had maturities of one year or less.

Subsidiary Activities 
 
PB Bancorp, Inc.’s only subsidiary is Putnam Bank. Putnam Bank has three subsidiaries, Windham North Properties, LLC, PSB Realty, LLC and Putnam Bank Mortgage Servicing Company. Windham North Properties, LLC is used to acquire title to selected properties on which Putnam Bank forecloses. As of June 30, 2019, Windham North Properties, LLC, owned five such properties. PSB Realty, LLC owns a parcel of real estate located immediately adjacent to Putnam Bank’s main office. This real estate is utilized as a loan center for Putnam Bank and there are no outside tenants that occupy the premises. PSB Realty, LLC also owns the 40 High Street, Norwich branch building and real estate. Putnam Bank Mortgage Servicing Company is a qualified “passive investment company” that is intended to reduce Connecticut state taxes on interest earned on real estate loans.
Personnel 
 
As of June 30, 2019, we had 81 full-time employees and 32 part-time employees. Our employees are not represented by any collective bargaining group. Management believes that we have good working relations with our employees.
FEDERAL AND STATE TAXATION
 
PB Bancorp, Inc. and Putnam Bank are subject to federal income taxation in the same general manner as other corporations, with some exceptions discussed below.
 
The following discussion of federal taxation is intended only to summarize certain pertinent federal and state income tax matters and is not a comprehensive description of the tax rules applicable to PB Bancorp, Inc. or Putnam Bank.
 
23

 


The Company is currently open to audit under statute of limitations by the Internal Revenue Service and state taxing authorities for the years ended June 30, 2016 through June 30, 2019. The Federal return for the tax year ended 2009 was audited in 2010. The state tax returns have not been audited for the last five years.
 
Federal Taxation 
 
Method of Accounting. For federal income tax purposes, PB Bancorp, Inc. and Putnam Bank currently report their income and expenses on the accrual method of accounting and use a tax year ending June 30 for filing their federal income tax returns. On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“TCJA”) was signed into law, which decreased the federal tax rate to 21.0% beginning January 1, 2018. The fiscal year ending June 30, 2018 results reflect the initial impact of TCJA, which resulted in an additional $211,000 tax provision booked as of December 31, 2017 due to the revaluation of its net deferred tax asset at the enactment date.
Bad Debt Reserves. Prior to the Small Business Protection Act of 1996 (the “1996 Act”), Putnam Bank was permitted to establish a reserve for bad debts and to make annual additions to the reserve. These additions could, within specified formula limits, be deducted in arriving at our taxable income. As a result of the 1996 Act, Putnam Bank was required to use the specific charge off method in computing its bad debt deduction beginning with its 1996 federal tax return. Savings institutions were required to recapture any excess reserves over those established as of December 31, 1987 (base year reserve). At June 30, 2019, Putnam Bank had no reserves subject to recapture in excess of its base year reserves.
Taxable Distributions and Recapture. Prior to the 1996 Act, bad debt reserves created prior to January 1, 1988 were subject to recapture into taxable income if Putnam Bank failed to meet certain thrift asset and definitional tests. Federal legislation has eliminated these thrift-related recapture rules. At June 30, 2019, our total federal pre-1988 base year reserve was approximately $2.3 million. However, under current law, pre-1988 base year reserves remain subject to recapture if Putnam Bank makes certain non-dividend distributions, repurchases any of its stock, pays dividends in excess of tax earnings and profits, or ceases to maintain a bank charter.
Alternative Minimum Tax: The Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”) imposes an alternative minimum tax (“AMT”) at a rate of 20% on a base of regular taxable income plus certain tax preferences, which we refer to as “alternative minimum taxable income.”  The AMT is payable to the extent such alternative minimum taxable income is in excess of an exemption amount and the AMT exceeds the regular income tax.  Net operating losses can offset no more than 90% of alternative minimum taxable income.  Certain AMT credits may be used as credits against regular tax liabilities in future years.  At June 30, 2019, PB Bancorp, Inc. had no AMT payments and no net operating losses available for carry forward to future periods. As of June 30, 2018, we had AMT credit carryforwards of $1.2 million.  Under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, the AMT has been eliminated and any credits will be fully recovered by 2021.
Net Operating Loss Carryovers. A company may carry back net operating losses to the preceding two taxable years and forward to the succeeding 20 taxable years. Net operating losses incurred in tax years arising after December 31, 2017, are providing no carryback and an indefinite carryforward.
Corporate Dividends-Received Deduction. PB Bancorp, Inc. may exclude from its income 100% of dividends received from Putnam Bank as a member of the same affiliated group of corporations. The corporate dividends-received deduction is 65% in the case of dividends received from corporations with which a corporate recipient does not file a consolidated tax return, and corporations which own less than 20% of the stock of a corporation distributing a dividend may deduct only 50% of dividends received or accrued on their behalf.
State Taxation 
 
Connecticut State Taxation. PB Bancorp, Inc., Putnam Bank and its subsidiaries are subject to the Connecticut corporation business tax. Both entities are required to pay the regular corporation business tax (income tax).
 
The Connecticut corporation business tax is based on the federal taxable income before net operating loss and special deductions and makes certain modifications to federal taxable income to arrive at Connecticut taxable income.  Connecticut taxable income multiplied by the state tax rate of 7.5% to arrive at Connecticut income tax.  At June 30, 2019, PB Bancorp, Inc. and subsidiaries had $88 million of net operating losses.  These available Connecticut net operating loss carryforwards allows the taxpayer to offset 50% of their CT taxable income.
 
The State of Connecticut permits the formation of passive investment companies by financial institutions. This legislation exempts qualifying passive investment companies from the Connecticut corporation business tax and excludes dividends paid from a passive investment company from the taxable income of the parent financial institution. Putnam Bank’s passive investment company, Putnam Bank Mortgage Servicing Company, eliminated the state income tax expense of Putnam Bank. If the State of Connecticut were to pass legislation in the future to eliminate the passive investment company exemption Putnam Bank would be subject to state income taxes in Connecticut.
 
24

 

Maryland State Taxation. As a Maryland business corporation, PB Bancorp is required to file an annual report with and pay franchise taxes to the state of Maryland.
 
SUPERVISION AND REGULATION
 General 
 
Putnam Bank is a stock savings bank organized under the laws of the State of Connecticut. The lending, investment, and other business operations of Putnam Bank are governed by Connecticut law and regulations, as well as applicable federal law and regulations, and Putnam Bank is prohibited from engaging in any operations not authorized by such laws and regulations. Putnam Bank is subject to extensive regulation, supervision and examination by the Connecticut Department of Banking and, as a member of the Federal Reserve System, by the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston. This regulation and supervision establishes a comprehensive framework of activities in which an institution may engage and is intended primarily for the protection of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation’s deposit insurance fund and depositors, and not for the protection of security holders. Putnam Bank also is a member of and owns stock in the Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston, which is one of the 11 regional banks in the Federal Home Loan Bank System.
 
Under this system of regulation, the regulatory authorities have extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory, enforcement, rulemaking and examination activities and policies, including rules or policies that: establish minimum capital levels; restrict the timing and amount of dividend payments; govern the classification of assets; determine the adequacy of loan loss reserves for regulatory purposes; and establish the timing and amounts of assessments and fees. Moreover, as part of their examination authority, the banking regulators assign numerical ratings to banks and savings institutions relating to capital, asset quality, management, liquidity, earnings and other factors. These ratings are inherently subjective and the receipt of a less than satisfactory rating in one or more categories may result in enforcement action by the banking regulators against a financial institution. A less than satisfactory rating may also prevent a financial institution, such as Putnam Bank or its holding company, from obtaining necessary regulatory approvals to access the capital markets, pay dividends, acquire other financial institutions or establish new branches.
 
In addition, we must comply with significant anti-money laundering and anti-terrorism laws and regulations, Community Reinvestment Act laws and regulations, and fair lending laws and regulations. Government agencies have the authority to impose monetary penalties and other sanctions on institutions that fail to comply with these laws and regulations, which could significantly affect our business activities, including our ability to acquire other financial institutions or expand our branch network.
 
As a savings and loan holding company, PB Bancorp is required to comply with the rules and regulations of the Federal Reserve Board.  It is required to file certain reports with the Federal Reserve Board and is subject to examination by and the enforcement authority of the Federal Reserve Board.  PB Bancorp is also subject to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission under the federal securities laws.
 
Any change in these laws or regulations, whether by the Connecticut Department of Banking, Federal Reserve Board, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or Congress, could have a material adverse impact on PB Bancorp, Inc. and Putnam Bank and their operations.
 
Set forth below is a brief description of material regulatory requirements that are applicable to Putnam Bank and PB Bancorp. The description is limited to certain material aspects of the statutes and regulations addressed, and is not intended to be a complete description of such statutes and regulations and their effects on Putnam Bank and PB Bancorp.
 
Connecticut Bank Regulation
 
Connecticut Banking Commissioner. The Connecticut Banking Commissioner regulates the deposit, lending and investment activities of state-chartered savings banks, including Putnam Bank. The approval of the Connecticut Banking Commissioner is required for, among other things, the establishment of branch offices and business combination transactions. The Commissioner conducts periodic examinations of Connecticut-chartered banks, as does the Federal Reserve Board. The Federal Reserve Board also regulates many of the areas regulated by the Connecticut Banking Commissioner, and federal law may limit some of the authority provided to Connecticut-chartered banks by Connecticut law.
 
25

 

Lending Activities. Connecticut banking laws grant banks broad lending authority. With certain limited exceptions, secured and unsecured loans to any one obligor under this statutory authority may not exceed 10.0% and 15.0%, respectively, of a bank’s equity capital and allowance for loan losses.
Consumer Protection. We are also subject to a variety of Connecticut statutes and regulations that are intended to protect consumers and prohibit discrimination in the granting of credit. These statutes and regulations provide for a range of sanctions for non-compliance with their terms, including imposition of administrative fines and remedial orders, and referral to the Attorney General for prosecution of a civil action for actual and punitive damages and injunctive relief. Certain of these statutes authorize private individual and class action lawsuits and the award of actual, statutory and punitive damages and attorneys’ fees for certain types of violations.
Dividends. Putnam Bank may pay cash dividends out of its net profits. For purposes of this restriction, “net profits” represents the remainder of all earnings from current operations. Further, the total amount of all dividends declared by a bank in any year may not exceed the sum of a bank’s net profits for the year in question combined with its retained net profits from the preceding two years without the specific approval of the Connecticut Banking Commissioner. Federal law also prevents an institution from paying dividends or making other capital distributions that, if by doing so, would cause it to become “undercapitalized.” Federal Reserve Board regulations establish limits on dividends, including requiring Federal Reserve Board approval for aggregate dividends exceeding net income for the current year and the two prior calendar years. In addition, as a subsidiary of a savings and loan holding company, Putnam Bank must provide prior notice to the Federal Reserve Board of any dividend. The Federal Reserve Board has the authority to object to the dividend if deemed unsafe or unsound. No dividends may be paid to Putnam Bank’s sole stockholder, PB Bancorp, Inc, if such dividends would reduce stockholders’ equity below the amount of the liquidation account required by federal regulations.
Powers. Connecticut law permits Connecticut banks to sell insurance and fixed and variable rate annuities if licensed to do so by the Connecticut Insurance Commissioner. With the prior approval of the Connecticut Banking Commissioner, Connecticut banks are also authorized to engage in a broad range of activities related to the business of banking, or that are financial in nature or that are permitted under the Bank Holding Company Act or the Home Owners’ Loan Act, both federal statutes, or the regulations promulgated as a result of these statutes.
 
Connecticut banks are also authorized to engage in any activity permitted for a national bank, a federal savings association or an out of state state-chartered bank upon filing notice with the Connecticut Banking Commissioner unless the Connecticut Banking Commissioner disapproves the activity.
 
Assessments. Connecticut banks are required to pay annual assessments to the Connecticut Department of Banking to fund the Connecticut Department of Banking’s operations. The general assessments are paid pro-rata based upon a bank’s asset size.
Enforcement. Under Connecticut law, the Connecticut Banking Commissioner has extensive enforcement authority over Connecticut banks and, under certain circumstances, affiliated parties, insiders and agents. The Connecticut Banking Commissioner’s enforcement authority includes cease and desist orders, fines, receivership, conservatorship, removal of officers and directors, emergency closures, dissolution and liquidation.
Federal Bank Regulation 
 
Capital Requirements. Federal regulations require state banks to meet several minimum capital standards: a common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-based assets ratio, a Tier 1 capital to risk-based assets ratio, a total capital to risk-based assets ratio and a Tier 1 capital to total assets leverage ratio.
 
The risk-based capital standards for state banks require the maintenance of common equity Tier 1 capital, Tier 1 capital and total capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 4.5%, 6% and 8%, respectively. In determining the amount of risk-weighted assets, all assets, including certain off-balance sheet assets (e.g., recourse obligations, direct credit substitutes, residual interests) are multiplied by a risk weight factor assigned by the regulations based on the risks believed inherent in the type of asset. Higher levels of capital are required for asset categories believed to present greater risk. Common equity Tier 1 capital is generally defined as common stockholders’ equity and retained earnings. Tier 1 capital is generally defined as common equity Tier 1 and additional Tier 1 capital. Additional Tier 1 capital includes certain noncumulative perpetual preferred stock and related surplus and minority interests in equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries. Total capital includes Tier 1 capital (common equity Tier 1 capital plus additional Tier 1 capital) and Tier 2 capital. Tier 2 capital is comprised of capital instruments and related surplus, meeting specified requirements, and may include cumulative preferred stock and long-term perpetual preferred stock, mandatory convertible securities, intermediate preferred stock and subordinated debt. Also included in Tier 2 capital is the allowance for loan and lease losses limited to a maximum of 1.25% of risk-weighted assets and, for institutions that have exercised an opt-out election regarding the treatment of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income, up to 45% of net unrealized gains on available-for-sale equity securities with readily determinable fair market values. Calculation of all types of regulatory capital is subject to deductions and adjustments specified in the regulations. In assessing an institution’s capital adequacy, the Federal Reserve takes into consideration, not only these numeric factors, but qualitative factors as well, and has the authority to establish higher capital requirements for individual associations where necessary.
 
26

 

Legislation enacted in May 2018 requires the federal banking agencies, including the Federal Reserve Board, to establish for institutions with less than $10 billion of assets a “community bank leverage ratio” of tangible equity capital to total average consolidated assets of between 8 to 10%. Institutions with capital meeting the specified requirement and electing to follow the alternative regulatory capital structure will be considered to comply with the applicable regulatory capital requirements, including the risk-based requirements. The establishment of the community bank leverage ratio is subject to notice and comment rulemaking by the federal regulators and the agencies issued a proposed rule in February 2019 that would set the “community bank leverage ratio” at 9%. In addition to establishing the minimum regulatory capital requirements, the regulations limit capital distributions and certain discretionary bonus payments to management if the institution does not hold a “capital conservation buffer” consisting of 2.5% of common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted asset above the amount necessary to meet its minimum risk-based capital requirements. The capital conservation buffer requirement was phased in beginning January 1, 2016 at 0.625% of risk-weighted assets and increasing each year until fully implemented at 2.5% on January 1, 2019.
 
The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act required each federal banking agency to revise its risk-based capital standards for insured institutions to ensure that those standards take adequate account of interest-rate risk, concentration of credit risk, and the risk of nontraditional activities, as well as to reflect the actual performance and expected risk of loss on multi-family residential loans. The Federal Reserve Board, along with the other federal banking agencies, adopted a regulation providing that the agencies will take into account the exposure of a bank’s capital and economic value to changes in interest rate risk in assessing a bank’s capital adequacy. The Federal Reserve Board also has authority to establish individual minimum capital requirements in appropriate cases upon determination that an institution’s capital level is, or is likely to become, inadequate in light of the particular circumstances.
 
Standards for Safety and Soundness. As required by statute, the federal banking agencies adopted final regulations and Interagency Guidelines Establishing Standards for Safety and Soundness to implement safety and soundness standards. The guidelines set forth the safety and soundness standards that the federal banking agencies use to identify and address problems at insured depository institutions before capital becomes impaired. The guidelines address internal controls and information systems, internal audit system, credit underwriting, loan documentation, interest rate exposure, asset growth, asset quality, earnings and compensation, fees and benefits. The agencies have also established standards for safeguarding customer information. If the appropriate federal banking agency determines that an institution fails to meet any standard prescribed by the guidelines, the agency may require the institution to submit to the agency an acceptable plan to achieve compliance with the standard.
 
Interstate Banking and Branching. Federal law permits well capitalized and well managed holding companies to acquire banks in any state, subject to Federal Reserve Board approval, certain concentration limits and other specified conditions. Interstate mergers of banks are also authorized, subject to regulatory approval and other specified conditions. More recent legislative amendments permit banks to establish de novo branches on an interstate basis provided that branching is authorized by the law of the host state for the banks chartered by that state.
Prompt Corrective Regulatory Action. Federal law requires, among other things, that federal bank regulatory authorities take “prompt corrective action” with respect to banks that do not meet minimum capital requirements. For these purposes, the law establishes five capital categories: well capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized.
 
The Federal Reserve Board has adopted regulations to implement the prompt corrective action legislation. The regulations were amended to incorporate the previously mentioned increased regulatory capital standards that were effective January 1, 2015. An institution is deemed to be “well capitalized” if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of 10.0% or greater, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 8.0% or greater, a leverage ratio of 5.0% or greater and a common equity Tier 1 ratio of 6.5% or greater. An institution is “adequately capitalized” if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of 8.0% or greater, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6.0% or greater, a leverage ratio of 4.0% or greater and a common equity Tier 1 ratio of 4.5% or greater. An institution is “undercapitalized” if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of less than 8.0%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 6.0%, a leverage ratio of less than 4.0% or a common equity Tier 1 ratio of less than 4.5%. An institution is deemed to be “significantly undercapitalized” if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of less than 6.0%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 4.0%, a leverage ratio of less than 3.0% or a common equity Tier 1 ratio of less than 3.0%. An institution is considered to be “critically undercapitalized” if it has a ratio of tangible equity (as defined in the regulations) to total assets that is equal to or less than 2.0%. The Dodd-Frank Act provides that an institution that elects and complies with the “community bank leverage ratio” alternative will be deemed to be “well capitalized.”
 
27

 

At each successive lower capital category, an insured depository institution is subject to more restrictions and prohibitions, including restrictions on growth, restrictions on interest rates paid on deposits, restrictions or prohibitions on payment of dividends, and restrictions on the acceptance of brokered deposits. A bank that is classified as well-capitalized, adequately capitalized, or undercapitalized may be treated as though it were in the next lower capital category if the appropriate federal banking agency determines, after notice and opportunity for hearing, that an unsafe or unsound condition, or an unsafe or unsound practice, warrants such treatment. If an insured depository institution is classified in one of the undercapitalized categories, it is required to submit a capital restoration plan to the appropriate federal banking agency, and the holding company must guarantee the performance of that plan. An undercapitalized bank’s compliance with a capital restoration plan is required to be guaranteed by any company that controls the undercapitalized institution in an amount equal to the lesser of 5.0% of the institution’s total assets when deemed undercapitalized or the amount necessary to achieve the status of adequately capitalized. If an “undercapitalized” bank fails to submit an acceptable plan, it is treated as if it is “significantly undercapitalized.” “Significantly undercapitalized” banks must comply with one or more of a number of additional restrictions including, but not limited to, an order by the Federal Reserve Board to sell sufficient voting stock to become adequately capitalized, reduce total assets, cease receipt of deposits from correspondent banks or dismiss directors or officers, and restrictions on interest rates paid on deposits, compensation of executive officers and capital distributions by the parent holding company. “Critically undercapitalized” institutions are subject to additional measures including, subject to a narrow exception, the appointment of a receiver or conservator within 270 days after it obtains such status.
 
Transaction with Affiliates and Regulation W of the Federal Reserve Regulations. Transactions between banks and their affiliates are governed by federal law. An affiliate of a bank is any company or entity that controls, is controlled by or is under common control with the bank. In a holding company context, the parent bank holding company and any companies which are controlled by such parent holding company are affiliates of the bank (although subsidiaries of the bank itself, except financial subsidiaries, are generally not considered affiliates). Generally, Section 23A of the Federal Reserve Act and the Federal Reserve Board’s Regulation W limit the extent to which the bank or its subsidiaries may engage in “covered transactions” with any one affiliate to an amount equal to 10.0% of such institution’s capital stock and surplus, and with all such transactions with all affiliates to an amount equal to 20.0% of such institution’s capital stock and surplus. Section 23B applies to “covered transactions” as well as to certain other transactions and requires that all such transactions be on terms substantially the same, or at least as favorable, to the institution or subsidiary as those provided to a non-affiliate. The term “covered transaction” includes the making of loans to, purchase of assets from, and issuance of a guarantee on behalf of an affiliate, and similar transactions. Section 23B transactions also include the provision of services and the sale of assets by a bank to an affiliate. In addition, loans or other extensions of credit by the financial institution to the affiliate are required to be collateralized in accordance with the requirements set forth in Section 23A of the Federal Reserve Act.
 
Sections 22(h) and (g) of the Federal Reserve Act place restrictions on loans to a bank’s insiders, i.e., executive officers, directors and principal shareholders. Under Section 22(h) of the Federal Reserve Act, loans to a director, an executive officer and a greater than 10.0% shareholder of a financial institution, and certain affiliated interests of these, together with all other outstanding loans to such person and affiliated interests, may not exceed specified limits. Section 22(h) of the Federal Reserve Act also requires that loans to directors, executive officers and principal shareholders be made on terms substantially the same as offered in comparable transactions to other persons and also requires prior board approval for certain loans. In addition, the aggregate amount of extensions of credit by a financial institution to insiders cannot exceed the institution’s unimpaired capital and surplus. Section 22(g) of the Federal Reserve Act places additional restrictions on loans to executive officers.
 
Enforcement. The Federal Reserve Board and, secondarily, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, have extensive enforcement authority over insured state savings banks, including Putnam Bank. The enforcement authority includes, among other things, the ability to assess civil money penalties, issue cease and desist orders and remove directors and officers. In general, these enforcement actions may be initiated in response to violations of laws and regulations, breaches of fiduciary duty and unsafe or unsound practices.
Federal Insurance of Deposit Accounts. Putnam Bank is a member of the Deposit Insurance Fund, which is administered by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. Deposit accounts in Putnam Bank are insured up to a maximum of $250,000 for each separately insured depositor.
 
28

 

The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation imposes an assessment for deposit insurance on all depository institutions. Under the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation’s risk-based assessment system, insured institutions are assessed based on perceived risk to the Deposit Insurance Fund. Perceived risk to the deposit insurance fund is currently determined by the FDIC using a combination of examination ratings and financial modeling designed to estimate the probability that an institution fails over a three year period. The range of assessments for banks of less than $10 billion in assets is 1 1/2 basis points to 30 basis points of total assets less tangible capital, effective July 1, 2016.
 
The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation has authority to increase insurance assessments. A significant increase in insurance premiums would likely have an adverse effect on the operating expenses and results of operations of Putnam Bank. Future insurance assessment rates cannot be predicted.
 
Insurance of deposits may be terminated by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation upon a finding that the institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule order or regulatory condition imposed in writing. We do not know of any practice, condition or violation that might lead to termination of deposit insurance.
 
In addition to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation assessments, the Financing Corporation (“FICO”) is authorized to impose and collect, with the approval of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, assessments for anticipated payments, issuance costs and custodial fees on bonds issued by the FICO in the 1980s to recapitalize the former Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation. The bonds issued by the FICO are due to mature by year end 2019. For the quarter ended June 30, 2019, the annualized FICO assessment was equal to 0.12 basis points of total assets less tangible capital.
 
Privacy Regulations. Federal regulations generally require that Putnam Bank disclose its privacy policy, including identifying with whom it shares a customer’s “non-public personal information,” to customers at the time of establishing the customer relationship and annually thereafter. In addition, Putnam Bank is required to provide its customers with the ability to “opt-out” of having their personal information shared with unaffiliated third parties and not to disclose account numbers or access codes to non-affiliated third parties for marketing purposes. Putnam Bank currently has a privacy protection policy in place and believes that such policy is in compliance with the regulations.
Community Reinvestment Act. Under the Community Reinvestment Act, or CRA, as implemented by federal regulations, a state member bank has a continuing and affirmative obligation, consistent with its safe and sound operation, to help meet the credit needs of its entire community, including low and moderate income neighborhoods. The CRA does not establish specific lending requirements or programs for financial institutions nor does it limit an institution’s discretion to develop the types of products and services that it believes are best suited to its particular community, consistent with the CRA. The CRA does require the Federal Reserve Board, in connection with its examination of a state member bank, to assess the institution’s record of meeting the credit needs of its community and to take such record into account in its evaluation of certain applications by such institution, including applications to acquire branches and other financial institutions. The CRA requires a written evaluation of an institution’s CRA performance utilizing a four-tiered descriptive rating system. Putnam Bank’s latest federal CRA rating was “Satisfactory.”
 
Connecticut has its own statutory counterpart to the CRA that is also applicable to Putnam Bank. Connecticut law requires the Connecticut Banking Commissioner to consider, but not be limited to, a bank’s record of performance under Connecticut law in considering any application by a bank to establish a branch or other deposit-taking facility, to relocate an office or to merge or consolidate with or acquire the assets and assume the liabilities of any other banking institution. Putnam Bank's most recent CRA rating under Connecticut law was "Satisfactory."
 
Consumer Protection and Fair Lending Regulations. Connecticut savings banks are subject to a variety of federal statutes and regulations that are intended to protect consumers and prohibit discrimination in the granting of credit. These statutes and regulations provide for a range of sanctions for non-compliance with their terms, including imposition of administrative fines and remedial orders, and referral to the Attorney General for prosecution of a civil action for actual and punitive damages and injunctive relief. Certain of these statutes authorize private individual and class action lawsuits and the award of actual, statutory and punitive damages and attorneys’ fees for certain types of violations.
USA Patriot Act. Putnam Bank is subject to the USA PATRIOT Act, which gave federal agencies additional powers to address terrorist threats through enhanced domestic security measures, expanded surveillance powers, increased information sharing, and broadened anti-money laundering requirements. By way of amendments to the Bank Secrecy Act, Title III of the USA PATRIOT Act provided measures intended to encourage information sharing among bank regulatory agencies and law enforcement bodies. Further, certain provisions of Title III impose affirmative obligations on a broad range of financial institutions, including banks, thrifts, brokers, dealers, credit unions, money transfer agents, and parties registered under the Commodity Exchange Act.
 
29

 

Other Regulations 
 
Interest and other charges collected or contracted for by Putnam Bank are subject to state usury laws and federal laws concerning interest rates. Loan operations are also subject to state and federal laws applicable to credit transactions, such as the:

· | Home Mortgage Disclosure Act of 1975, requiring financial institutions to provide information to enable the public and public officials to determine whether a financial institution is fulfilling its obligation to help meet the housing needs of the community it serves;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Equal Credit Opportunity Act, prohibiting discrimination on the basis of race, creed or other prohibited factors in extending credit;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Fair Credit Reporting Act of 1978, governing the use and provision of information to credit reporting agencies; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Rules and regulations of the various federal and state agencies charged with the responsibility of implementing such federal and state laws.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
The deposit operations of Putnam Bank also are subject to, among others, the:
 

· | Right to Financial Privacy Act, which imposes a duty to maintain confidentiality of consumer financial records and prescribes procedures for complying with administrative subpoenas of financial records;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Check Clearing for the 21st Century Act (also known as “Check 21”), which gives “substitute checks,” such as digital check images and copies made from that image, the same legal standing as the original paper check; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Electronic Funds Transfer Act and Regulation E promulgated thereunder, which govern automatic deposits to and withdrawals from deposit accounts and customers’ rights and liabilities arising from the use of automated teller machines and other electronic banking services.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Federal Reserve System 
 
The Federal Reserve Board regulations require depository institutions to maintain non-interest-earning reserves against their transaction accounts (primarily NOW and regular checking accounts). The amount of required reserves is adjusted annually. For 2019, the Federal Reserve Board’s regulations require that reserves be maintained against aggregate transaction accounts as follows: for that portion of transaction accounts aggregating $124.2 million or less, the reserve requirement is 3.0%; amounts greater than $124.2 million require a 10.0% reserve. The first $16.3 million of otherwise reservable balances is exempted from the reserve requirements. Putnam Bank is in compliance with these requirements.
Federal Home Loan Bank System 
 
Putnam Bank is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank System, which consists of 11 regional Federal Home Loan Banks. The Federal Home Loan Bank provides a central credit facility primarily for member institutions. Members of the Federal Home Loan Bank are required to acquire and hold shares of capital stock in the Federal Home Loan Bank. Putnam Bank was in compliance with this requirement at June 30, 2019. Based on redemption provisions of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston, the stock has no quoted market value and is carried at cost. At its discretion, the Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston may declare dividends on the stock. The Federal Home Loan Banks are required to provide funds for certain purposes including contributing funds for affordable housing programs. These requirements could reduce the amount of dividends that the Federal Home Loan Banks pay to their members and result in the Federal Home Loan Banks imposing a higher rate of interest on advances to their members. For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019, the Federal Home Loan Bank paid quarterly dividends equal to an average annual yield of 6.34%. There can be no assurance that such dividends will continue in the future. Further, there can be no assurance that the impact of recent or future legislation on the Federal Home Loan Banks also will not cause a decrease in the value of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston stock held by Putnam Bank.

Sarbanes-Oxley Act
 
The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 was enacted in response to public concerns regarding corporate accountability in connection with certain accounting scandals. The stated goals of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act are to increase corporate responsibility, to provide for enhanced penalties for accounting and auditing improprieties at publicly traded companies, and to protect investors by improving the accuracy and reliability of corporate disclosures pursuant to the securities laws.
 
We have existing policies, procedures and systems designed to comply with these regulations, and we are further enhancing and documenting such policies, procedures and systems to ensure continued compliance with these regulations.
 
Holding Company Regulation 
 
PB Bancorp is a unitary savings and loan holding company subject to regulation and supervision by the Federal Reserve Board. The Federal Reserve Board has enforcement authority over PB Bancorp and its non-savings institution subsidiaries. Among other things, this authority permits the Federal Reserve Board to restrict or prohibit activities that are determined to be a risk to Putnam Bank.
 
As a savings and loan holding company, PB Bancorp’s activities are limited to those activities permissible by law for financial holding companies (if PB Bancorp makes an election to be treated as a financial holding company and meets the other requirements to be a financial holding company) or multiple savings and loan holding companies. A financial holding company may engage in activities that are financial in nature, incidental to financial activities or complementary to a financial activity. Such activities include lending and other activities permitted for bank holding companies under Section 4(c)(8) of the Bank Holding Company Act, and selling insurance and underwriting equity securities. Multiple savings and loan holding companies are authorized to engage in activities specified by federal regulation.
 
Federal law prohibits a savings and loan holding company from directly or indirectly acquiring more than 5% of another savings institution or savings and loan holding company without prior written approval of the Federal Reserve Board, and from acquiring or retaining control of any depository institution not insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. In evaluating applications by holding companies to acquire savings institutions, the Federal Reserve Board must consider such things as the financial and managerial resources and future prospects of the company and institution involved, the effect of the acquisition on and the risk to the federal deposit insurance fund, the convenience and needs of the community and competitive factors. A savings and loan holding company may not acquire a savings institution in another state and hold the target institution as a separate subsidiary unless it is a supervisory acquisition under Section 13(k) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act or the law of the state in which the target is located authorizes such acquisitions by out-of-state companies.
 
Savings and loan holding companies historically had not been subjected to consolidated regulatory capital requirements. However, the Dodd-Frank Act required the Federal Reserve Board to establish minimum consolidated capital requirements for all depository institution holding companies that are as stringent as those required for the insured depository subsidiaries. Subsequent legislation was enacted in December 2014 that required the Federal Reserve Board to extend the applicability of its “Small Bank Holding Company” exemption from consolidated holding company capital requirements from holding companies of up to $500 million of consolidated assets to holding companies of up to $1 billion. Regulations implementing this amendment were effective May 15, 2015. Legislation enacted in May 2018 directed the Federal Reserve to extend the exemption to holding companies of up to $3 billion in consolidated assets, which was done in August 2018. Consequently, savings and loan holding companies with under $3 billion in consolidated assets, such as PB Bancorp, remain exempt from consolidated regulatory capital requirements, unless the Federal Reserve determines otherwise in particular cases.
 
The Dodd-Frank Act extended the “source of strength” doctrine to savings and loan holding companies. The Federal Reserve Board has promulgated regulations implementing the “source of strength” policy that require holding companies to act as a source of strength to their subsidiary depository institutions by providing capital, liquidity and other support in times of financial stress.
 
31

 

The Federal Reserve Board has issued a policy statement regarding the payment of dividends and the repurchase of shares of common stock by bank holding companies and savings and loan holding companies. In general, the policy provides that dividends should be paid only out of current earnings and only if the prospective rate of earnings retention by the holding company appears consistent with the organization’s capital needs, asset quality and overall financial condition. Regulatory guidance provides for prior regulatory consultation with respect to capital distributions in certain circumstances such as where the company’s net income for the past four quarters, net of dividends previously paid over that period, is insufficient to fully fund the dividend or the company’s overall rate of earnings retention is inconsistent with the company’s capital needs and overall financial condition. The ability of a holding company to pay dividends may be restricted if a subsidiary bank becomes undercapitalized. The policy statement also states that a holding company should inform the Federal Reserve Board supervisory staff prior to redeeming or repurchasing common stock or perpetual preferred stock if the holding company is experiencing financial weaknesses or if the repurchase or redemption would result in a net reduction, as of the end of a quarter, in the amount of such equity instruments outstanding compared with the beginning of the quarter in which the redemption or repurchase occurred. These regulatory policies may affect the ability of PB Bancorp to pay dividends, repurchase shares of common stock or otherwise engage in capital distributions.
 
In order for PB Bancorp to be regulated by the Federal Reserve Board as a savings and loan holding company, rather than as a bank holding company, Putnam Bank must qualify as a “qualified thrift lender” under federal regulations or satisfy the “domestic building and loan association” test under the Internal Revenue Code. Under the qualified thrift lender test, a savings institution is required to maintain at least 65% of its “portfolio assets” (total assets less: (i) specified liquid assets up to 20% of total assets; (ii) intangible assets, including goodwill; and (iii) the value of property used to conduct business) in certain “qualified thrift investments” (primarily residential mortgages and related investments, including certain mortgage-backed and related securities) in at least nine out of each twelve month period. At June 30, 2019, Putnam Bank maintained 73.3% of its portfolio assets in qualified thrift investments and was in compliance with the qualified thrift lender requirement.
 
Change in Control Regulations
 
Under the Change in Bank Control Act, no person may acquire control of a savings and loan holding company such as PB Bancorp unless the Federal Reserve Board has been given 60 days’ prior written notice and has not issued a notice disapproving the proposed acquisition, taking into consideration certain factors, including the financial and managerial resources of the acquirer and the competitive effects of the acquisition. Control, as defined under federal law, means ownership, control of or holding irrevocable proxies representing more than 25% of any class of voting stock, control in any manner of the election of a majority of the institution’s directors, or a determination by the regulator that the acquiror has the power, directly or indirectly, to exercise a controlling influence over the management or policies of the institution. Acquisition of more than 10% of any class of a savings and loan holding company’s voting stock constitutes a rebuttable determination of control under the regulations under certain circumstances including where, as will be the case with PB Bancorp, the issuer has registered securities under Section 12 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
 
In addition, federal regulations provide that no company may acquire control of a savings and loan holding company without the prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board. Any company that acquires such control becomes a “savings and loan holding company” subject to registration, examination and regulation by the Federal Reserve Board.
