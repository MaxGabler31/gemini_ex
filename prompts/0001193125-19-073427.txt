Overview 
 CRH is a North American company focused on providing physicians throughout the United States with innovative products and services for the treatment of gastrointestinal (GI) diseases. The CRH ORegan System is a single-use, disposable, hemorrhoid banding technology that is safe and highly effective in treating all grades of hemorrhoids. CRH distributes the CRH ORegan System, treatment protocols, operational and marketing expertise as a complete, turnkey package directly to gastroenterology practices, creating meaningful relationships with the gastroenterologists (GIs) it serves. The CRH ORegan System is currently used in all 48 lower U.S. states. 
 In 2014, CRH acquired Gastroenterology Anesthesia Associates, LLC (GAA), a full-service gastroenterology anesthesia company that provides anesthesia services for patients undergoing endoscopic procedures. Performing these procedures under anesthetic provides more comfort for patients and increases the operating efficiency of ASCs. CRH has continued to leverage the capabilities it acquired through GAA to consolidate the highly fragmented gastroenterology anesthesia provider business. The Companys goal is to establish itself as the premier provider of innovative products and essential services to GIs throughout the United States. Each of the Companys two primary lines of business, the sale of medical products and the provision of anesthesia services, is discussed below. As of December 31, 2018, CRH has a majority ownership interest in 20 GI anesthesia practices in 10 U.S. states and services approximately 305,000 patient cases annually. 
 In 2018, the Company completed five acquisitions. All acquisitions completed during 2018 have been included in the anesthesia segment of the Company. In March 2018, a subsidiary of the Company entered into an asset purchase agreement to acquire 100% of certain assets of Shreveport Sedation Associates, LLC, an anesthesia services provider in Louisiana. In May 2018, a subsidiary of the Company entered into an asset contribution and exchange agreement to acquire 51% of the ownership interest in Western Ohio Sedation Associates, LLC, an anesthesia services provider in Ohio. In July 2018, a subsidiary of the Company entered into a membership interest purchase agreement to acquire a 51% interest in Lake Washington Anesthesia Associates, LLC, a gastroenterology anesthesia services provider in Washington State. In September, a subsidiary of the Company entered into an asset purchase agreement to acquire 100% of the ownership interest in Lake Erie Sedation Associates, LLC, an anesthesia services provider in Ohio. In December, a subsidiary of the Company entered into an asset contribution and exchange agreement to acquire 51% of the ownership interest in Tennessee Valley Anesthesia Associates, an anesthesia services provider in Tennessee. The total aggregate consideration paid for these businesses was $27,509,811 in cash and acquisition costs incurred.

 The CRH ORegan System 
 Invented in 1997 by laparoscopic surgeon Dr. Patrick J. ORegan, and cleared by the FDA in 2000, the CRH ORegan System represents a significant advancement in rubber band ligation treatment of hemorrhoids. The technology was improved in 2016, incorporating a number of features bringing the CRH ORegan System to a new level of functionality for the practitioner and a new level of comfort and safety for the patient. The CRH ORegan System is an entirely disposable, single-use device for hemorrhoid treatment. Previous metal instruments were introduced in the 1950s and 1960s, before the advent of virulent, blood borne pathogens such as HIV and Hepatitis B and C. Today they pose reprocessing challenges and concerns about cross-patient infection. 
 The ligator is a plastic plunger suction device resembling a syringe, with a built-in obturator to ease insertion, which is applied to each hemorrhoid in turn, two centimeters above the dentate line. Manual suction is induced to cause a portion of the hemorrhoid cushion to enter the nozzle, and the band is then released to strangulate the tissue. Only one band is used to facilitate the later adjustment and to reduce the risk of complications. This procedure can be performed under direct visualization with a specially designed anoscope or using a blind technique where the device is inserted to a mark through the anus and directed to one of the hemorrhoid cushions, which is then banded. 
 What are Hemorrhoids? 
 Hemorrhoids are normal cushions of tissue and blood vessels in the lower rectum which normally play a role in maintaining continence. In a large number of people, these hemorrhoidal cushions undergo changes which typically lead to any number of perianal symptoms. It is at this point when patients typically seek treatment for their hemorrhoidal disease. Hemorrhoids are classified as either external or internal: 
 External  swollen vascular and soft tissue that is present below the Dentate Line, which can often be seen and felt under the skin outside the anal canal. They often appear as a small bulge and are the same color as the skin. These can become irritated, inflamed or thrombosed, are generally treated by over the counter remedies or in some cases, a surgical procedure. External hemorrhoids are often mistakenly blamed for patients symptoms that are actually caused by their internal hemorrhoids, explaining why so many patients with external symptoms respond to treating their internal hemorrhoids. 
 Internal  swollen and prolapsing vascular tissue that are inside of the anal opening, and form above the Dentate Line. When internal hemorrhoids become abnormal, they may protrude out through the anus while straining or during defecation. A reference to hemorrhoids in a clinical setting is generally a reference to internal hemorrhoids. 
 Internal hemorrhoids fall into one of four grades depending on the degree of severity. Grade I hemorrhoids do not prolapse, and so very infrequently cause symptoms. These patients are usually treated with over the counter remedies and diet, and if any symptoms are present they are typically self-limited. Grades II through IV are typically in need of treatment and rubber band ligation is the most frequent type of treatment utilized on these patients, although most Grade IV patients require surgical intervention, which is quite costly and painful. Successful treatment of lesser grades of hemorrhoids may well prevent the development of Grade IV disease. 
 There are many presumed factors that may increase the likelihood of developing hemorrhoidal symptoms. These factors include: aging, chronic constipation or diarrhea, pregnancy, hereditary issues, chronic straining during bowel movements and faulty bowel function due to overuse of laxatives or enemas. Hemorrhoid symptoms include: itching, bleeding, swelling, prolapse, leakage, and in patients with associated external hemorrhoids, lumps and pain. 
 According to the National Institute of Health, the prevalence rate of hemorrhoids in the United States is at least 4.4% of the population, and approximately 50% of the U.S. population will develop symptomatic hemorrhoids by age 50. 
 
6 


 According to the American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons, hemorrhoids are one of the most common ailments, with the onset typically occurring usually after age 30. The peak prevalence occurs between 45 and 65 years of age. Most patients with milder cases appear to suffer in silence, or may seek over-the-counter remedies, rather than turning to a medical professional. 
 Hemorrhoid Treatment Procedures 
 Rubber Band Ligation 
 A small rubber band is placed around the base of the hemorrhoid inside the rectum. The band cuts off circulation, the banded tissue sloughs within a few days, and scar tissue forms, preventing the tissue from prolapsing or causing symptoms. Rubber band ligation may be utilized for the vast majority of hemorrhoid patients. 
 The banding technique is the most widely accepted form of treatment as it requires no anesthesia, is simple to perform, can be done in a doctors office, and is relatively inexpensive and effective. The CRH ORegan System is an example of this treatment technique. 
 Coagulation by use of infrared light (IRC) 
 Coagulation by use of infrared light causes the treated hemorrhoid tissue to coagulate, creating scar tissue that is intended to stop the prolapse, lessening the hemorrhoidal symptoms. It is mostly used for grade 1 or small grade II hemorrhoids. IRC has been shown to be less effective than rubber band ligation, as it typically requires more treatments with a higher recurrence rate. 
 Injection sclerotherapy with chemicals 
 With injection sclerotherapy, a doctor injects a chemical solution under the surface of the hemorrhoid. The solution causes inflammation and scarring of the tissue in an attempt to keep the hemorrhoidal tissue from causing symptoms. This technique is not widely used, and complications can occur if the solution is not injected precisely where it is needed. 
 Surgery 
 A hemorrhoidectomy is performed by a surgeon with local anesthetic plus sedation, or more typically a spinal anesthetic or a general anesthetic. It is sometimes performed on an outpatient basis, but an overnight or inpatient hospital stay can be required. It is a more expensive procedure than the other options as it is required to be performed in a hospital or ambulatory surgery center. Surgery is accompanied by greater cost, as well as post procedural pain and disability. 
Stapling 
 A PPH or a stapled hemorrhoidectomy utilizes a specialized device which can cut and then staple together a portion of the rectal lining, causing scar tissue that typically keeps the hemorrhoid tissue in place, minimizing the patients symptoms. This procedure gained favor because it caused less pain and disability than the conventional surgical hemorrhoidectomy, but more recent experience has shown that this procedure is not without the potential for significant complications. 
Transanal Hemorrhoidal Dearterialization 
 A more recent development, this surgical procedure utilizes a specialized scope to help identify the arteries which supply blood to the hemorrhoidal tissues. This localization allows for the surgeon to suture those vessels, reducing blood flow to the hemorrhoids as well as to cause scarring which helps to minimize hemorrhoidal 
 
7 


  symptoms. This technique demonstrates promise, but it is still a surgical procedure, causing significantly more pain and disability than the non-surgical approaches outlined above. This technique has demonstrated as high as a 25% short term failure rate. 
 Evidence of Use for the CRH ORegan System 
 A large 2005 study of the CRH ORegan System reported the lowest hemorrhoid treatment complication rate ever published at 16 out of 5,424 procedures, or 0.3%. Post-band bleed occurred in eight patients (0.4%), post-band pain in three patients (0.2%) and post-band thrombosis in five patients (0.3%). No other complications were observed. Compared to conventional rubber band ligation, these figures demonstrate a ten-fold reduction in complications. The results also showed the CRH ORegan System to have lower recurrence (4.8%) at two years than previous banding techniques (12%) or even hemorrhoidectomy (5-8%). However, patient compliance with dietary changes and recommended bowel habits may have marked influence on recurrence rates and long-term studies to confirm whether this distinction exists at late follow-up have not been conducted. 
 A 2006 study was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness and complications associated with rubber band ligation using the CRH ORegan System. The study included treatment for 60 patients and no major complications were noted. The study concluded that the CRH ORegan System is associated with a good response and low complication rate. Minor early and late bleeding was reported in 10% and 6.7% of patients, respectively, but none was severe. Pain occurred in 6.7% of patients, but was not severe. In all cases clinical and endoscopic improvement was observed and patients of all ages, including the elderly, were found to be tolerant to the procedure. The study concluded the technique is a safe and reliable treatment option. 
 A 2008 study involving 113 patients and a total of 257 banding events concluded that the outpatient treatment of hemorrhoids by GIs using the CRH ORegan System is safe and effective. Initial symptoms were resolved in 94% of patients, and rectal bleeding resolved in 90% of patients after at least one banding event. These results were sustained at three months. There were no cases of pelvic sepsis. Patient satisfaction with the CRH ORegan System was high. Overall, 81% of patients were highly satisfied with their treatment and 75% of patients said they would choose this therapy again over a surgical option and/or recommend it to a friend. Patients do not require time off from work after the procedure. 
 A 2010 study titled The Long Term Results of Hemorrhoid Banding Using the ORegan Disposable Suction Ligator, involved 20,286 ligations with the CRH ORegan System on 6,690 patients. The results indicated an 8% recurrence of all three hemorrhoids over an average of 42 months and a 5% partial recurrence (one or two hemorrhoids). Complications were 0.2% per band or 0.6% per course of treatment. In light of the low recurrence and partial recurrence rates, the study concluded that the use of the CRH ORegan System was a significant improvement on Barrons original rubber band ligation device and that the CRH ORegan System has performed well since its introduction. 
 In order to improve ease of use and patient comfort, the Company began distributing its upgraded ligator in 2016. The improved CRH ORegan System incorporated a built-in obturator which eases insertion as well as limits the trauma that can be inflicted by utilizing an alternative device with an open jaw. The anti-pinch feature further adds to patient comfort, and a feature which helps to prevent misfires makes the device more reliable when treating patients. These upgrades have improved the safety profile of the device, and have further reduced patient pain and post-banding complaints. 
 Commercialization Strategies 
 In 2008, as a strategy to achieve rapid adoption of the CRH ORegan System by a broader segment of the medical community, the Company began developing the capability to bring our CRH ORegan System directly to physicians. We believe this strategy, called the Direct-to-Physician Program, positions the Company to increase the number of physicians who use utilize its products and capture more market share while building brand awareness and value.

 Approximately 15 million colonoscopies are performed annually in the United States by approximately 14,000 GIs. Studies have shown as many as 40% of colonoscopies demonstrate significant hemorrhoidal changes. Given that gastroenterologists perform the majority of colonoscopies in the United States, CRHs Direct-to-Physician Program specifically targets these providers because they are regularly diagnosing hemorrhoids and are able to adequately screen patients prior to the procedure. The CRH ORegan System provides GIs with an effective modality to treat hemorrhoidal disease and increase their practice revenue. 
 CRH is actively expanding the Direct-to-Physician Program by targeting the distribution of the CRH ORegan System directly to the over 14,000 GIs practicing in the United States. CRH utilizes many methods to create awareness and demand for the CRH ORegan System. Awareness is created through a number of channels and tactics, including key opinion leader endorsement and GI word-of-mouth; articles and advertisements in professional journals and publications; Grand Rounds-type presentations at academic institutions and Gastroenterology Fellowship Training Programs; exhibits and product demonstrations at GI conferences; and targeted email and direct mail campaigns. The information on the CRH ORegan System website, including procedure videos and published research, also serves as an educational tool and an important source of awareness to the GI community. To date, CRH has provided training relating to the use of the CRH ORegan System to approximately 3,000 GIs at over 1,100 practices. 
 The Company is introducing the CRH ORegan System into the curriculum of the approximately 190 academic and hospital-based Gastroenterology Fellowship Programs throughout the United States as perianal care is not traditionally a topic covered during training. The treatment of hemorrhoids is a natural extension of the GI practice. Hemorrhoid treatment with the CRH ORegan System expands the continuum of care and provides a fast and painless solution to patients. Since many hemorrhoid patients also require colonoscopy and other endoscopic services, adoption of the CRH ORegan System creates additional patient and procedural revenue for the GIs traditional practice. 
 In addition, the integration of the CRH ORegan System into a GI practice may increase practice revenues. For example, the treatment of patients using the CRH ORegan System generates an hourly procedural reimbursement approximately equal to or greater than that of colonoscopy procedures. Offering these treatments also brings new patients into the practice, many of whom require additional diagnostic procedures. Moreover, the reimbursement is typically generated without the need for any additional staff, capital expenditures or facility requirements. 
 In contrast to other treatment modalities, the CRH ORegan System procedure takes less than a minute to perform, does not require anesthesia or bowel preparation, is well tolerated by patients, and can be performed in an office setting as well as in ASCs. The CRH ORegan System is totally disposable and does not require any capital investment. 
 CRH provides a comprehensive support program for GI practices, including providing clinical training, operational training and marketing programs and materials. 
 CRH provides physician-to-physician training for GIs at their own practice setting with patients they identify and recruit for treatment. This enables the GI to see a variety of pathologies and learn the procedure by treating patients in a hands-on manner, ultimately leading to a greater comfort level with the technology and the associated necessary treatment protocols. These initial patients are also then scheduled for subsequent bandings, contributing to the start-up and growth of hemorrhoid procedures within the practice. 
 CRH also provides operational training and support to ensure that GI office staff are comfortable describing the procedure and are able to address the questions most frequently asked by hemorrhoid sufferers seeking our treatment. The training includes hemorrhoid education, technology facts, phone scripts, frequently-asked questions, optimal patient flow processes and scheduling methodologies, and a billing and coding overview. In addition, CRH provides hemorrhoid content that may be added to the GI practice website. The goal is to ensure 
 
9 


  that the GI practice can effectively convert treatment inquiries into patient appointments and bring new patients in. 
 CRH provides a comprehensive marketing support program to assist GIs with integrating the CRH ORegan System into their practice. Marketing programs and materials are available at no charge and are designed to quickly and effectively educate new and existing patients about the procedure. 
 CRH also provides web-based marketing resources to GI practices by adding their practice profile to the CRH website. The CRH consumer website (www.crhsystem.com) directs hemorrhoid sufferers to trained physicians near them who offer our procedure. The creation of a direct link between the practice website and the CRH website has been one of the most beneficial tools for driving new patients to our GI partner practices. Information contained on, or accessible through, our website is not a part of this Annual Report, and the inclusion of our website address in this Annual Report is an inactive textual reference. 
 Specialized Skill & Knowledge 
 The Companys management, medical and support teams have developed specific skills and knowledge in the U.S. healthcare market from the Companys prior operation of Centers for Colorectal Health and many years managing and developing its Direct-to-Physician Program. We believe that the extent and breadth of the Companys experience delivering healthcare services, developed through years of operating across multiple U.S. states, have provided it with a national scope of knowledge that is not easily acquired or replicated. On a national scale, there is a significant amount of fragmentation of legal requirements, divergence in medical service reimbursement levels, and local healthcare contracting that the Company must evaluate prior to penetrating any particular market. Over the course of its operating history, we believe the Company has acquired the knowledge necessary to gather and process the critical information required to measure quantifiable decisions to enter prospective markets. The Company continues to develop this knowledge and expertise by expanding the know-how of its existing management and acquiring new personnel with the requisite skill sets.

 Competition 
 The majority of rubber band ligation procedures are performed using metal re-usable ligators and retractors. In the same way that disposable syringes have replaced re-usable syringes in most medical applications, disposable ligators have replaced re-usable ligators. The table below compares the CRH ORegan Ligator to the traditional ligation device and other hemorrhoid treatment devices.

Foreign Operations 
 While the Companys headquarters are in Vancouver, British Columbia, substantially all of the Companys revenues from sales of the CRH ORegan System are generated in the United States. 
 The Company is actively working to begin distributing the CRH ORegan System in China. The device has received CFDA approval and is currently undergoing a clinical trial at the Beijing Anorectal Hospital. 
 Regulatory Approval 
 The FDA, Health Canada, and comparable agencies in other foreign countries impose requirements upon the design, development, manufacturing, marketing and distribution of medical devices. The applicable regulations 
 
11 


  require clearance or approval before the devices can be sold. After the applicable approvals are granted the regulatory agencies require companies to comply with quality system requirements and maintain annual registrations. 
 The Company has FDA 510(k) clearance (K963166 and K020702) for the United States and Medical Device License #65043) for Health Canada. These registrations are legal prerequisites for the Company to market and sell the CRH ORegan Ligator, Anoscope and CRH ORegan System in the United States and Canada, and many countries worldwide that accept these registrations. The Company sub-contracts the design and manufacture of its ORegan products to a Canadian manufacturer that holds certification for CRH products to ISO13485:2016 MDSAP. 
 For a more fulsome description of the regulations applicable to the Companys products and services, see the section below titled Government Regulation. 
 Operations and Manufacturing 
 The Company manages sub-contracted activities and Quality Management System activities to ensure compliance with the requirements of ISO 13485:2016 MDSAP and Current Good Manufacturing Practices and is committed to continuously improve the quality of our products and services to better satisfy the needs and expectations of our customers. 
 All subcontractors are monitored and evaluated on a regular basis to ensure the highest quality product. We manage the activities of our supply chain on a continuous basis. While the Company has outsourced design and manufacturing activities, we maintain direct control over customer service activities to ensure that we provide our best service to our customers. Through an established system of customer feedback we are able to monitor for signs of quality problems and customer issues. 
 Customer, Professional and Technical Services 
 The Company has established a feedback system to provide early warning of quality problems and to determine whether it has met the customers requirements. Customer complaints, expressions of satisfaction and other unsolicited customer feedback are collected and processed by Customer Service. As discussed above, our licensed physician medical directors provide professional and consultative support to our Customers. 
Cycles and Economic Dependence 
 The provision of healthcare services in the United States has changed as a result of the shifts within the healthcare insurance market. Some of these shifts include a decline in overall Health Maintenance Organization market-share due to patients demand to see out of network physicians. Other shifts are high deductible plans and health savings plans that are shifting the burden of healthcare expenditures directly to patients. These shifts have an effect on the frequency and the types of treatment that patients will seek and thus have an effect on treatments that may be considered elective. Although the treatment of hemorrhoids with ligation is a covered procedure by most insurance plans, some patients may still consider the treatment as elective due to the above factors. 
 
12 


 The Company is economically dependent on one critical supplier for the CRH ORegan System. The supplier, a clean room injection molding manufacturing company based in Ontario, Canada, performs contract manufacturing and assembly for the Company. Currently, the Company has one set of manufacturing molds for each product produced, which is used for the injection molding and these molds are inventoried at the suppliers facility. See the risk factor titled Our dependence on suppliers could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations in Item 1A. 
 Revenue from the sale of the CRH ORegan System was $10,959,215 and $11,501,005 for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Many healthcare plans in the United States have deductibles and other patient related costs for the treatment of hemorrhoids. As a result of these plans, and other factors, the Company may experience fluctuations in quarterly revenue. 
 Gastroenterology Anesthesia Services 
 In 2014, CRH became a full-service gastroenterology anesthesia company with the platform purchase of Gastroenterology Anesthesia Associates, LLC (GAA). In all, CRH has completed 21 anesthesia acquisitions to date. The Company provides anesthesia services for patients undergoing endoscopic procedures performed by GIs in Ambulatory Surgery Centers (ASCs) in the United States. Most commonly this is propofol sedation for upper endoscopy and lower endoscopy procedures performed in ASCs. As part of each acquisition, the Company enters into a service agreement with each ASC to become the exclusive provider of anesthesia services at that location. In return, CRH undertakes to staff the facility with the appropriately trained and experienced anesthetists and board-certified anesthesiologists. The Company receives and records revenue through fee for service arrangements with commercial and government insurance providers. The serviced GI group or ASC is not responsible for payment for the procedure. 
 The Company currently provides anesthesia services in 47 GI-focused ASCs, to more than 320,000 patients per year, using a team of more than 400 Certified Registered Nurse Anesthetists and Physician Anesthesiologists. 
 Evidence of Use 
 Based upon Medicare claims data, more than 50% of the approximately 25 million GI endoscopy procedures are performed with monitored anesthesia care. The remaining procedures use moderate sedation, typically by combining an opioid and benzodiazepine (e.g. the fentanyl-Versed regimen), which does not require the involvement of an anesthetist. 
 The use of anesthesia for GI endoscopic procedures has shown a significant increase in use over the last decade. A Medicare cohort study showed an anesthesia utilization rate of 11% in 2000, rising to 23.4% in 2006, while a published survey of commercial payor data showed anesthesia was used in 13.6% of cases in 2003, increasing to 35.5% in 2009, and was forecasted to increase to 53.7% during 2015. We believe anesthesia for GI endoscopy is the standard of care and that adoption will continue to increase. 
 The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) launched the Screen for Life: National Colorectal Cancer Action Campaign in 1999 with the goal of raising awareness about the importance of colorectal cancer screening. As of 2016, the program found that only 67.3% of U.S. adults were up to date with their colorectal screening. The campaigns current goal is to have 80% of the population between the ages of 50 and 75 up to date on their screening by 2018. 
 The United States Census Bureau projects that the number of Americans between the ages of 50 to 75, the group targeted for screening, will grow from 91 million in 2014 to 99 million in 2020. Assuming 80% of that population gets screened, as targeted by the CDC, an additional 6.4 million colonoscopies would have to be performed in that period.

 Physician and Patient Preference 
 GIs prefer Propofol sedation due to its pharmacologic properties that include rapid onset, rapid recovery and fewer recovery-associated symptoms compared to moderate sedation. This is associated with increased patient compliance during the procedure and less utilization of resources during recovery, which can improve costs, procedure throughput and scheduling efficiency. 
 Patients also strongly prefer the use of anesthesia, which allows for a more comfortable procedure and a reduced recovery time that is free from nausea, memory loss and drowsiness associated with the moderate sedation regimen. 
 Commercialization Strategies 
 The Companys anesthesia business strategy has been to establish itself as a high quality, reliable provider of anesthesia services to ASCs performing GI endoscopies. There are approximately 1,000 single-specialty-GI Medicare certified ASCs in the United States, of which the Company currently serves 46. The Company expects to further penetrate the market through its acquisition strategy, with the goal of increasing the number of facilities in which it serves. 
 Similar to GAA and the Companys other 19 acquisitions, the Company seeks to acquire established GI-focused anesthesia groups. GI anesthesia acquisitions consist of either a 100% acquisition or a joint venture acquisition structure where the Company acquires a controlling interest. The joint venture model allows the physician group to monetize a portion of their anesthesia business while retaining an ongoing revenue stream and reducing risk from an operational, regulatory, and reimbursement standpoint. The acquired anesthesia group provides anesthesia services to the partner ASC under a professional services agreement. 
 We believe there are several GI groups that lack the knowledge and resources to launch and maintain their own anesthesia group. To address this, the Company has created a Monitored Anesthesia Care (MAC) Development Program as an option for groups wishing to provide anesthesia services to their patients. This arrangement provides greater control over the anesthesia services through a co-management arrangement with the Company while also providing additional revenue for the physicians. These business arrangements include the initial development and ongoing management of the anesthesia group. Additionally, CRH may be provided a contractual right of first refusal on the purchase of the anesthesia group and/or a future option to purchase a controlling interest in the anesthesia group. In each case, the Company integrates the acquired professional service agreements into its established billing and staffing processes to maximize quality assurance and efficiencies. 
 Overall, these acquisitions generally experience annual volume growth, primarily driven by patient case growth of the referring GI group. 
 CRH provides an anesthesia services solution that integrates quickly with the GI group practice with little or no disruption. While the GIs are actively involved with CRH in establishing the anesthesia group, CRHs involvement allows GIs to focus on their core business of endoscopic procedures to achieve greater results for their patients. In addition to the daily assistance in the management of the anesthesia group through billing, collections, staff recruitment, credentialing, and scheduling, those partnering with CRH take advantage of our quality assurance and quality improvement program, data collection and reporting, and patient questionnaires. All of these processes can be a burden for many GI practices, but we believe they are critical to measuring quality and treatment outcomes. 
 CRH has established itself as a long-standing, trusted partner in the GI community through the CRH ORegan System due to its focus on the patient and by providing a level of service to both the GI and practice staff that we believe is unparalleled in the industry. CRH Anesthesia Services continues to achieve this same high level of quality and service, while leveraging the relationships that have been established with approximately 3,000 GIs throughout the country to date. 
 
14 


 As a result, we believe the Company has established its reputation as a high-quality provider of, and partner in, anesthesia services, thereby fostering maintenance and adoption of its services. This may lead to other non-GI anesthesia opportunities in the future. 
 Specialized Skill and Knowledge 
 The Company maintains national medical directors responsible for reviewing, implementing and supporting evidence based clinical practices. The Companys clinical and operational thought leaders serve on the Quality Management Committee, chartered to help drive the clinical quality of the Company and to ensure that all patients receive the highest quality of care. Committee members review specific cases, research, survey readiness practices and various other data with the intent to continuously enhance their understanding of anesthesia care and to disseminate learnings and best practices Company-wide. Often these learnings are transferred through on-site provider education sessions and in-services.
To support the independent needs of providers, the Company offers both W2 employment as well as 1099 contractor status. The Company has insourced recruitment to ensure alignment and focuses efforts on experienced providers, typically maintaining three or more years of clinical experience. A defined provider on-boarding process orients each provider to their respective facilities and clinical policies and procedures of the Company. Once onboarded, the ability to retain these providers resides in the Companys competitive compensation and benefits, strong clinical support and expansive clinical opportunities across the broad portfolio of sites nationally. 
 The Company focuses diligently on the overall patient experience delivered across the communities served. Patient experience is measured through a survey system, offering real-time patient and caregiver insights. Feedback from the surveys is consistently monitored at the local level as well as by the centralized Quality Management Committee in order to drive change. 
 Additional areas of expertise include payer and provider credentialing, payer contracting and revenue cycle management and optimization, which is provided through an exclusive relationship with an outsourced provider. These key practices ensure continual alignment with regulatory requirements as well as the efficient and optimal collection of revenue. 
 The Company has streamlined and standardized their ability to deliver these specialized skills to businesses through their dedicated integration resources. The integration team ensures a seamless transition and onboarding experience for GI physicians and anesthesia providers alike. As part of the integration process, clinical and regulatory compliance policies and practices promote ethical and compliant practices, while also providing internal controls to proactively address any identified potential concerns. Fundamentals include provider education and access to compliance leadership to report and address potential concerns or non-compliant behaviors. 
 Competition 
 The majority of GI ASCs are currently utilizing anesthesia services for its endoscopic procedures through groups affiliated with their GI practice. It is these groups the Company targets for acquisition. The remainder utilize 3rd party management or staffing companies. These 3rd parties are generally small, fragmented, and not well-capitalized, offering no opportunity for acquisition. 
 Those GI ASCs not currently utilizing anesthesia for its endoscopic procedures are targets for the Companys MAC Development Program. Local 3rd party management and staffing companies compete for these programs, however they do not offer the same breadth of services, nor the potential for a future acquisition. 
 Additionally, the Company competes with large GI practices, led by private equity groups that are active in acquiring and consolidating physician practices, including related ancillary services, such as GI anesthesia.

 The Company plans to continue to primarily focus on the GI market and leverage its reputation for high-quality value-added service, established through its CRH ORegan System business, to consolidate the market and further establish itself as a trusted anesthesia provider. 
 Intangible Properties 
 The Companys intangible properties pertaining to the anesthesia business include its exclusive professional service agreements with each of the serviced facilities. The majority of our agreements are multi-year and contain auto-renewal features. 
Foreign Operations 
 While the Companys headquarters are in Vancouver, British Columbia, all of the Companys revenues for anesthesia services are generated in the United States. 
 Economic Dependence 
 Though highly recommended, GI endoscopies such as colorectal screenings, are primarily elective procedures and are therefore susceptible to the dynamics of the general economy, which can influence the proportion of the population covered by private insurance and the number of patients willing to pay relevant copays and deductibles, thereby influencing overall procedure volumes. 
 The Companys anesthesia services are dependent upon the continuous recruitment and retention of qualified Anesthetists and Anesthesiologists. As the demand for Anesthetists and Anesthesiologists in hospitals and non GI ASCs increases, there is a potential for cost increases for these resources. See the risk factor titled Our ability to successfully recruit and retain qualified anesthesiologists or other independent contractors in Item 1A. 
 The Companys anesthesia services rely upon the ample and continual supply of Propofol or potential sedation alternative. When necessary, CRH currently sources Propofol through supply agreements with narcotics manufacturers and its physicians and medical practitioners. See the risk factor titled Our dependence on suppliers could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations in Item 1A. 
 We depend primarily on U.S. government, third party commercial and private and governmental third-party sources of payment for the services provided to patients. The amount we receive for our services may be adversely affected by market and cost factors, as well as other factors over which we have no control, including changes to the Medicare and Medicaid payment systems. For a description of the risks relating to changes in U.S. government health care programs, see the risk factors titled Changes to payment rates or methods of third-party payors, including United States government healthcare programs, changes to the United States laws and regulations that regulate payments for medical services, the failure of payment rates to increase as our costs increase, or changes to our payor mix, could adversely affect our operating margins and revenues and We are unable to predict the impact of health reform initiatives, including reform initiatives relating to the PPACA in Item 1A. 
 Though the co-pay and deductible for anesthesia during screening colonoscopies was eliminated in 2015 as a part of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act (collectively, the PPACA), many private healthcare plans in the United States have deductibles and other patient-related costs. As a result of these plans, payor mix, and other factors, the Company may experience fluctuations in quarterly revenue. 
 Revenue from anesthesia services was $101,790,165 and $83,505,140 for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. In 2018, the Companys revenue from anesthesia services for the acquisitions completed

  through December 31, 2017 were negatively impacted by the November 2, 2017 Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) final rule which came into effect on January 1, 2018 and by changes in the per unit reimbursements received from our commercial payors. The CMS final rule impacted our revenue per case by an estimated 9% and the changes from our commercial payors impacted our revenue per case by an additional 4%. These negative impacts to anesthesia revenue were partially offset by organic growth in patient cases and deployment of available capital for acquisitions, and we expect similar offsets in the future. 
 Intellectual Property 
 A vital part of the Companys business strategy is to protect its products and technologies through the use of patents, proprietary technologies and trademarks, to the extent available. Success will depend, in part, upon the ability to obtain and enforce strong patents, to maintain trade secret protection and to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others. Current CRH policy is to seek patent protection for proprietary technology whenever and wherever commercially practical. CRH has acquired or received patents for marketing in the United States, Canada, Europe and in some parts of Asia. See the risk factor titled If we are unable to adequately protect or enforce our intellectual property, our competitive position could be impaired in Item 1A. 
 As of December 31, 2018, our patent portfolio consists of 11 issued U.S. and foreign patents and 4 pending U.S. and foreign patent applications. Of these, our issued patents expire between approximately 2021 and 2034. Pursuant to an agreement dated May 8, 2001 as amended, the Company acquired the patent and all other rights to the CRH ORegan Ligator from Dr. Patrick J. ORegan, a former director of the Company, in exchange for common shares of the Company. The patent regarding the CRH ORegan Ligator was registered in the name of the Company in the patent office on August 27, 2002. The CRH ORegan System consists of the CRH ORegan Ligator and the slotted Anoscope. The CRH ORegan Ligator is a disposable, minimally invasive hemorrhoid banding device. The CRH ORegan Ligator was patented in the United States by Dr. Patrick ORegan. 
 In addition, we also have 3 U.S. and foreign trademark registrations. 
 We routinely monitor the status of existing and emerging intellectual property disclosed by third parties that may impact our business, and to the extent we identify any such disclosures, evaluate them and take appropriate courses of action. We also protect our proprietary information by ensuring that our employees, consultants, contractors and other advisors execute agreements requiring non-disclosure and assignment of inventions prior to their engagement. 
 Research and Development 
 The Company is not engaged in any research and development activities. 
 Government Regulation 
 Healthcare Reform 
 The United States and some foreign jurisdictions are considering or have enacted a number of legislative and regulatory proposals to change the healthcare system in ways that could affect our ability to sell our future products profitably. Among policy makers and payors in the United States and elsewhere, there is significant interest in promoting changes in healthcare systems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs, improving quality or expanding access. In the United States, changes in healthcare policy could increase our costs and subject us to additional regulatory requirements that may impact sales of the CRH ORegan System. By way of example, the PPACA substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers, and significantly impacted the medical device industry. PPACA, among other things, imposed a 2.3% excise tax on any entity that manufactures or imports medical devices offered for sale in the U.S., with limited exceptions. While the implementation of the medical device tax has further been suspended until 
 
17 


  December 31, 2019, the status of the tax for sales after December 31, 2019 is not clear. The medical device tax may continue to be suspended, or may be reinstated at the same or at a different level effective January 1, 2020. Since its enactment, there have been judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the PPACA. For example, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Acts, enacted December 22, 2017 in the United States, made changes to the tax treatment of health care expenses and repealed the individual mandate to purchase private insurance. Additional legislation may result in changes to government programs such as Medicare, Medicaid and federal sunshine laws. In addition, the current U.S. Administration is considering a number of administrative policy changes that could result in additional changes to insurance coverage, financing of insurance coverage and benefits offered through private insurance in both the employer-sponsored and individual markets. As a result, there is still uncertainty whether the PPACA will undergo additional revisions, and we cannot predict the impact of any future modifications, and it is uncertain how any such proposals, if approved, would affect these provisions. 
 In addition to PPACA, there will continue to be proposals by legislators at both the federal and state levels, regulators and third party payors to reduce costs while expanding individual healthcare benefits. For example, in December 2016, the 21st Century Cures Act (the Cures Act), was signed into law. The Cures Act, among other things, is intended to modernize the regulation of medical devices and spur innovation, but its ultimate implementation is unclear. We expect that the PPACA, as well as other healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future, may result in more rigorous coverage criteria and lower reimbursement, and in additional downward pressure on the price that we receive for our products. Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare or other government-funded programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors. The implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may prevent us from being able to maintain profitability. 
 Other Healthcare Laws and Compliance Requirements 
 We are subject to a number of laws and regulations that may restrict our business practices, including, without limitation, anti-kickback, false claims, physician payment transparency and data privacy and security laws. The government has interpreted these laws broadly to apply to the marketing and sales activities of manufacturers like us. 
 The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, persons or entities from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, in exchange for or to induce either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, lease, order or recommendation of, any good, facility, item or service for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, under federal healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. In addition, a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act. Violations can result in significant penalties, imprisonment and exclusion from Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs. 
 The federal civil False Claims Act prohibits, among other things, any person or entity from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment or approval to the federal government or knowingly making, using or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to the federal government. A claim includes any request or demand for money or property presented to the U.S. government. The civil False Claims Act also applies to false submissions that cause the government to be paid less than the amount to which it is entitled. When an entity is determined to have violated the federal civil False Claims Act, the government may impose significant civil fines and penalties for each false claim, plus treble damages, and exclude the entity from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs. Private suits filed under the civil False Claims Act, known as qui tam actions, can be brought by individuals on behalf of the government. These individuals may share in any amounts paid by the entity to the government in fines or settlement. 
 
18 


 The federal Civil Monetary Penalties Law prohibits, among other things, the offering or transfer of remuneration to a Medicare or state healthcare program beneficiary if the person knows or should know it is likely to influence the beneficiarys selection of a particular provider, practitioner, or supplier of services reimbursable by Medicare or a state healthcare program, unless an exception applies. 
 The federal Physician Sunshine Act, which requires certain manufacturers of drugs, biologicals, and medical devices or supplies that require premarket approval by or notification to the FDA, and for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Childrens Health Insurance Program, to report annually to the CMS information related to (i) payments and other transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals, and (ii) ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Applicable manufacturers are required to submit annual reports to CMS. Failure to submit required information may result in civil monetary penalties for all payments, transfers of value or ownership or investment interests that are not timely, accurately, and completely reported in an annual submission, and may result in liability under other federal laws or regulations. Certain states also mandate implementation of commercial compliance programs, impose restrictions on device manufacturer marketing practices and/or require the tracking and reporting of gifts, compensation and other remuneration to healthcare professionals and entities. 
 In addition, we may be subject to, or our marketing activities may be limited by, data privacy and security regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. For example, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended (HIPAA), and its implementing regulations established uniform federal standards for certain covered entities (healthcare providers, health plans and healthcare clearinghouses) governing the conduct of certain electronic healthcare transactions and protecting the security and privacy of protected health information. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, commonly referred to as the economic stimulus package, included expansion of HIPAAs privacy and security standards called the Health Information Technology for Economic Clinical Health Act (HITECH). Among other things, HITECH makes HIPAAs privacy and security standards directly applicable to business associates independent contractors or agents of covered entities that create, receive, maintain, or transmit protected health information in connection with providing a service for or on behalf of a covered entity. HITECH also increased the civil and criminal penalties that may be imposed against covered entities, business associates and possibly other persons. 
 Also, many U.S. states and countries outside the U.S. have similar fraud and abuse statutes or regulations that may be broader in scope and may apply regardless of payor, in addition to items and services reimbursed under government programs. 
 Because of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of available statutory and regulatory exemptions, it is possible that some of our business activities could be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the federal and state laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including criminal and significant civil monetary penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, imprisonment, exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs, injunctions, recall or seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production, denial or withdrawal of pre-marketing product approvals, private qui tam actions brought by individual whistleblowers in the name of the government or refusal to allow us to enter into supply contracts, including government contracts, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations. We may also be subject to additional reporting requirements and oversight if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or similar agreement with a governmental entity to resolve allegations that we have violated these laws. To the extent that any of our products are sold in a foreign country, we may be subject to similar foreign laws and regulations, which may include, for instance, applicable post-approval requirements, including safety surveillance, anti-fraud and abuse laws, and implementation of corporate compliance programs and reporting of payments or transfers of value to healthcare professionals.

 As stated above, in addition to regulatory requirements in the United States, Health Canada, and comparable agencies in other foreign countries impose requirements upon the design, development, manufacturing, marketing and distribution of medical devices. The applicable regulations require clearance or approval before the devices can be sold, and after the applicable approvals are granted, the regulatory agencies generally require companies to comply with quality system requirements and maintain annual registrations. In addition, the regulations governing medical devices vary from country to country and continue to evolve. 
 Employees 
 As of December 31, 2018, we had 25 employees supporting our CRH ORegan business, CRH Anesthesia Management LLC and corporate operations. In addition, we have 112 employed anesthesia providers, including 87 full-time, 25 part-time, and relationships with 234 independent contractors and other third party providers in connection with the Companys anesthesia services business. None of our employees are represented by a labor organization or covered by a collective bargaining arrangement. We consider our relationship with our employees and independent contractors to be excellent.
