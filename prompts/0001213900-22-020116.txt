Our Industry



The pace of technology evolution continues to accelerate and shows no signs of slowing down. From Enterprise to Carriers and Service Providers, there is a continuous need to plan, install, manage, and protect networks from cybersecurity threats. As technology evolves, the demand for more robust networks, faster speeds, better experiences, and protection from the ever evolving cyber threat landscape continues to grow at a robust pace. This demand has been compounded by the global COVID-19 pandemic and the rapid transition to “work from home” for large swaths of the global workforce. Remote learning, remote video meetings, collaboration software, increased email volumes, all have transformed the way we share information, and created strain on the way business used to be done. Nearly two years later, the technology and telecom industry anticipates these trends to continue for many years to come, and a new hybrid workplace environment evolving.



Wireless infrastructure which has been in place since the 1980’s includes towers, buildings, telephone poles and other facilities to place critical antennas and associated electronics to support a wind range of wireless protocols including WiMax, LTE and now 5G technologies. These wireless trends combined with the wireline transition from copper to fiber, and its corresponding order of magnitude change in bandwidth, are occurring to satisfy the world’s ever-increasing demand for data, which are significant long term drivers of our business model and continued success. There has been a significant transition underway from 4G wireless technology to 5G wireless technology. According to Gartner, spending on 5G infrastructure slowed in 2020 due to the pandemic, and only slightly increased in 2021. Gartner also expects this important transition to accelerate by 39% in 2022. The transition to 5G will accelerate migration to the next generation standard that allows for higher capacity, lower latency, and the architecture required to support new applications. The roll-out of enhanced mobile broadband, small cell architectures, 5G services and billions of new Internet of Things (IoT) connected devices greatly increases the need to modernize networks to accommodate this new breed of connectivity. This long-term trend is a significant enduring opportunity for companies like ours. The transition from trial-based deployments of 5G to a full nationwide implementation is expected to continue beyond 2025. Necessary investments in supporting infrastructure such as fiber optic backhaul is expected by Deloitte Consulting LLP to require $130-$150 billion over the next 5-7 years to adequately support the consumer demand for broadband and wireless densification projects in the United States alone. It is mission-critical for these providers to deliver broadband capacity, reliably, securely and cost-effectively in a solution that supports the massive data consumption of emerging applications such as: augmented reality/virtual reality, video streaming, mobile advertising, IoT, self-driving cars, personalized health monitoring and much more.

With the rapid proliferation of device connectivity and the transition of the workforce to remote or hybrid, the demands on Enterprise networks and all traditional networks have shifted. Cyber security risks have proliferated right along with it. PurpleSec reports that cyber attacks were up 600% as a result of the pandemic and the change in network design and utilization. They also estimate a global cost of over $6 trillion annually in 2021 from ransomware alone. Cyber risk is now something that every business is forced to address around the globe. Closer to home, a patchwork of legislation has emerged in the United States with various states enacting different requirements for protection of sensitive data, networks, and adding duties to disclose. Congress has yet to enact federal laws mandating cyber security protections thus far, but there have been many discussions, task forces, and the Department of Defense has updated standards for private sector companies doing business with them.



Global Cyber Security spending is expected to exceed $1.75 trillion from 2021 to 2025 according to Cybersecurity Ventures. Enterprises, Service Providers, Wireless Providers, and Managed Service Providers are all working at a feverish pace to keep up with emerging threats. There are over 1500 different “point” solutions on the market today. Most focused on a single part of the problem or “attack surface”. Traditional solutions require a lot of work to deploy, constant monitoring, and well-trained people to interpret the massive amounts of data they produce. This sets the stage for managed service solutions that meld best in breed tools together into a comprehensive solution, manage the solution 24x7x365, to detect and respond to threats.



All of these trends come together at the network level. As networks improve from the Carrier to the Enterprise, demand for building, managing, and protecting these networks will rise as a requisite portion of the predicted industry spend dollars. The contracts to perform these services, provide human capital for them, and protect them will last years.

Competitors



We provide, managed and professional services to carriers, service provider, utilities and enterprise clients on a national and international basis. Demand for our services is strong and growing in all segments of the business. Our channel-oriented sales model provides for very rapid expansion within our clients as they win contracts, develop new programs, build out their own suite of services, or leverage our portfolio to expand their own under private label.



Managed Services is a very competitive market and as such, our strategy to work exclusively through distribution channels with existing customer bases and robust sales organizations that can provide rapid growth. Most of our competitors are not channel only, but rather serve customers directly as well as have a channel component. Many are also wed to their own software, which makes it challenging to pivot as threats change. Some of our significant competitors would be Arctic Wolf, Herjevic Group, SecureWorks, and numerous smaller competitors. This space is rapidly evolving and hiring and retaining talent can be challenging. The company that develops a competitive edge in recruitment and employee retention will have a significant advantage. In a crowded and evolving landscape, there will be a continued need to spend on marketing and sales to acquire partners and help them convert and acquire new customers. We believe that with the combination of businesses we have, we are able to differentiate our services and compete aggressively in this market.

Our current and potential larger competitors in the professional services sector include MasTec, Dycom Industries, Inc., Goodman Networks, Inc., and Black and Veatch. In some segments of our business, a significant portion of our services revenue is currently derived from MSAs and price is often an important factor in awarding such agreements. Accordingly, our competitors may underbid us if they elect to price their services aggressively to procure such business. Our competitors may also develop the expertise, experience and resources to provide services that are equal or superior in both price to our services, and we may not be able to maintain or enhance our competitive position based on thresholds for margin and profitability that has been established as benchmarks within our telecommunications division. The principal competitive factors for our professional services include; agility to respond, geographic presence, breadth of service offerings, technical skills “in-house” professional competencies and methodologies, price, quality of service, safety record, proven performance and industry reputation. We believe we compete favorably with our competitors on the basis of all of these factors.



Our Competitive Strengths



We believe our market advantage is our positioning as a trusted authority in the space and the long-term relationships, Master Service Agreements (MSAs), industry leading provider of solutions and a reputation and track record of our ability to perform with agility, quality on a seamless and flawless manner for our clients is key in our success to date. High Wire’s ability to provide a wide range of services in a turn-key integrated solution is critical to our clients.

Customers



On behalf of our clients, we provide services for most of the Fortune 1000 enterprises and the like, software and hardware OEMs, wireless and wireline service providers, cable broadband MSOs and telecommunications OEMs. Our current service provider and OEM customers include leading telecommunications companies, such as Ericsson, Inc., Verizon Communications, T-Mobile/Sprint Corporation and AT&T.



During the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, our top four customers accounted for approximately 55% and 69% of our total revenues.



A substantial portion of our revenue is derived from work performed under multi-year master service agreements and multi-year service contracts. We have entered into master service agreements, or MSAs, with numerous service providers and OEMs, and generally have multiple agreements with each of our customers. MSAs are generally the contracting vehicle with work awarded primarily through a competitive bidding process based on the depth of our service offerings, experience, price, geographic coverage and capacity. MSAs generally contain customer-specified service requirements, such as discrete pricing for individual tasks, but do not require our customers to purchase a minimum amount of services. To the extent that such contracts specify exclusivity, there are often a number of exceptions, including the ability of the customer to issue work orders valued above a specified dollar amount to other service providers, perform work with the customer’s own employees and use other service providers. Most of our MSAs may be cancelled by our customers upon minimum notice (typically 60 days), regardless of whether we are or are not in default. In addition, many of these contracts permit cancellation of particular purchase orders or statements of work without any prior notice but do allow for payment for services performed up to the point of hold or cancellation.



Suppliers and Vendors



We have supply agreements with major technology vendors and material supply houses. However, for a majority of the professional services we perform, our customers supply the necessary major equipment and materials. We expect to continue to further develop our relationships with our technology vendors and to broaden our scope of work with each of our partners. In many cases, our relationships with our partners have extended for over a decade, which we attribute to our commitment to excellence. It is our objective to selectively expand our partnerships moving forward in order to expand our service offerings.

We evaluate our insurance requirements on an ongoing basis to help ensure we maintain adequate levels of coverage internally and externally for our clients.



Our internal policy is to carefully monitor claims and actively participate with our insurers in determining claims estimates and adjustments. The estimated costs of claims are accrued as liabilities and include estimates for claims incurred but not reported. If we experience future insurance claims in excess of our umbrella coverage limit, our business could be materially and adversely affected.
