Operational Efficiencies Adient intends to maintain high capacity utilization and increase its efficiency through continued use of standardized manufacturing processes, which represent a core competency. These standardized manufacturing processes allow Adient to deliver high quality levels and minimize waste. Adient achieves scale advantages through a global manufacturing footprint and an integrated supply chain. Adient fosters an environment of continuous improvement and identifies best business practices through the analysis of process and cost metrics, which are then shared globally throughout Adient's manufacturing network.
To ensure appropriate service levels, minimal inventory and optimal factory utilization, Adient employs a Sales & Operational Planning, or S&OP, process. A well-executed S&OP process provides two strategic advantages: focused customer service and on-time delivery which result in both customer retention and the opportunity for market share gain.
Longstanding Customer Relationships with Leading Global OEMs Adient works with OEMs to develop complete seating solutions to meet consumer expectations for performance, safety and comfort. Adient does business with all major global OEM customers, and in many cases, works closely with those customers to develop a seating solution integrated into the overall vehicle appearance and architecture.
Through dedicated customer teams, Adient maintains close relationships with its global OEM customers. These relationships enable Adient to clearly understand its customers' needs so that it is positioned to meet its customers' requirements. Adient's customer teams also lead the new business acquisition process, which ensures alignment with Adient's product, process and manufacturing strategies.
Product Innovation and Process Leadership Adient has a strong record for developing winning product and process technologies over many years, which has created a competitive advantage for Adient and its customers. Management expects to increase investment in innovation.
Adient utilizes a Global Core Product Portfolio, or CPP, strategy for part and design reuse in all of its product applications. Adient intends to continue investing in its CPP to sustain and expand its market success and to leverage its existing modular and scalable systems and interchangeable components. Through the CPP strategy, Adient provides high quality products for its customers with market competitive cost and mass (low weight to improve fuel economy) while meeting their performance requirements. Adient continues to use its CPP to advance Adient's lean manufacturing initiatives by providing standard, flexible processes that reduce complexity, inventory and floor space. This will yield reductions in development time, product cost and investment.
Global Development Network Adient participates in innovating and developing key competitive differentiators in the automotive seating business. In the development process, key downstream elements of the product are locked in, including material costs, plant conversion costs, quality characteristics and certain technical requirements. Adient uses a common product development process globally that ensures that these elements are correct at the outset of the development process, reflects the best practices of Adient's operations worldwide and meets the expectations of Adient's diverse customer base. Its product launch system is customizable and scalable based on customer and product requirements.
Adient's worldwide engineering network includes ten core development centers. These development centers utilize a globally consistent approach to the process for developing seating products. By leveraging a network of subject matter technical experts, Adient efficiently implements best practices and improves product cost and quality. Adient's product development practices also entail leveraging low cost country development centers in India, China, Czech Republic and Slovakia.

Industry
The Automotive Seating industry provides OEMs with complete seats on a "just-in-time" or "in-sequence" basis. Seats are assembled to specific order and delivered on a predetermined schedule directly to an automotive assembly line. The components for these complete seat assemblies such as seating foam, metal structures, fabrics, seat covers and seat mechanisms are shipped to Adient or competitor seating assembly plants. Adient is a global leader in complete seat assembly and one of the largest in all major seating components, operating manufacturing plants that produce seating foam, metal structures, seat covers and seat mechanisms.
Adient plc | Form 10-K | 6


Demand for automotive parts in the OEM market is generally a function of the number of new vehicles produced, which is primarily driven by macro-economic factors such as credit availability, interest rates, fuel prices, consumer confidence, employment and other trends. Although OEM demand is tied to actual vehicle production, participants in the automotive supplier industry also have the opportunity to grow through increasing product content per vehicle by further penetrating business with existing customers and in existing markets, gaining new customers and increasing their presence in global markets. Adient believes that, as a company with a global presence and advanced technology, engineering, manufacturing and customer support capabilities, it is well positioned to benefit from these opportunities. 
Sourcing Patterns by OEMs Most OEMs have adopted global vehicle platforms to increase standardization, reduce per unit cost and increase capital efficiency and profitability. In seating, three sourcing patterns exist:
1.    Core seat structures: By developing common front seat frames and mechanisms across multiple vehicle platforms, OEMs are reducing costs.
2.    Component sourcing: Several OEMs have shifted from sourcing a complete seating system to a components approach where the OEM sources each of the different components of the seat and seating assembly as separate business awards.
3.    Engineering "in-sourcing": Some OEMs are conducting the design and engineering internally and are selecting suppliers that have the capability to manufacture products on a worldwide basis and adapt to regional variations.
As a supplier with global scale and strong design, engineering and lean manufacturing capabilities in both complete seat systems and components Adient is well-positioned to accommodate each of these three sourcing patterns.
Shorter Product Development Cycles As a result of new safety and environmental regulations, as well as a trend of more rapid customer preference changes, OEMs are requiring suppliers to respond faster with new designs and product innovations. Although these trends are more significant in mature markets, emerging markets are moving rapidly towards the regulatory standards and consumer preferences of the more mature markets. Suppliers with strong technologies, robust global engineering and development capabilities will be best positioned to meet OEM demands for rapid innovation.
Electric Vehicles  The adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) is accelerating in the global automotive industry driven by numerous product offerings from legacy manufacturers and new entrants, government incentives and overall consumer acceptance. While seating systems are not largely impacted by the shift to EVs, key attributes of seat design are evolving as the market pivots toward EVs. This movement provides Adient with unique opportunities to provide value added solutions through Adient’s Evolution of Seating Systems Sustainability (“ES3”) and to capture market share through new entrants based on Adient’s existing leading market position.
Autonomous Driving As the industry moves towards autonomous driving and alternative usage models such as car sharing and urban mobility, Adient has developed an interiors concept for autonomous driving which addresses major seating and other interior trends that are expected to drive the automotive industry of the future. Adient will continue to partner with OEMs and other customers in the development of autonomous driving concepts.
Competition
Adient faces competition from other automotive suppliers and, with respect to certain products, from the automobile OEMs who produce or have the capability to produce certain products the business supplies. The automotive supply industry competes on the basis of technology, quality, reliability of supply and price. Design, engineering and product planning are increasingly important factors. The competitive landscape for seating and components can be categorized into three segments: (1) traditional seating suppliers, (2) component specialists and (3) competitors who are partnered with an OEM through ownership or interlocking business relationships. Independent suppliers that represent the principal competitors of Adient include Lear Corporation, Toyota Boshoku Corporation, Faurecia SA and Magna International Inc. Adient's deep vertical integration, global footprint and broad product offering make it well positioned to compete against the traditional global Tier-1 suppliers and component specialists.
Raw Materials
Raw materials used by Adient in connection with its operations include steel, aluminum, polyurethane chemicals, fabrics, leather, vinyl and polypropylene. Continuing into fiscal 2022, the automotive industry has experienced a period of significant volatility in commodity prices. This price volatility may continue into the future as demand increases and/or supply remains 
Adient plc | Form 10-K | 7


constrained. Price volatility has resulted in an overall increase of input costs for Adient that may not be, or may only be partially, offset through customer negotiations. During fiscal 2023, commodity prices and availability could fluctuate throughout the year and significantly affect Adient's results of operations. Refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors section for additional information.
Intellectual Property
Generally, Adient seeks statutory protection for strategic or financially important intellectual property developed in connection with its business. Certain intellectual property, where appropriate, is protected by contracts, licenses, confidentiality or other agreements.
Adient owns numerous U.S. and non-U.S. patents (and their respective counterparts), the more important of which cover those technologies and inventions embodied in current products or which are used in the manufacture of those products. While Adient believes patents are important to its business operations and in the aggregate constitute a valuable asset, no single patent, or group of patents, is critical to the success of the business. Adient, from time to time, grants licenses under its patents and technology and receives licenses under patents and technology of others.
Adient's trademarks are registered or otherwise legally protected in the United States and many non-U.S. countries where products and services of Adient are sold.
Most works of authorship produced for Adient, such as computer programs, catalogs and sales literature, carry appropriate notices indicating Adient's claim to copyright protection under U.S. law and appropriate international treaties.
Regulation
Adient operates in a constantly evolving global regulatory environment and is subject to numerous and varying regulatory requirements for its product performance and material content. Adient's practice is to identify potential regulatory and quality risks early in the design and development process and proactively manage them throughout the product lifecycle through the use of routine assessments, protocols, standards, performance measures and audits. New regulations and changes to existing regulations are managed in collaboration with the OEM customers and implemented through Adient's global systems and procedures designed to ensure compliance with existing laws and regulations. Adient demonstrates material content compliance through the International Material Data System, or IMDS, which is the automotive industry material data system. In the IMDS, all materials used for automobile manufacturing are archived and maintained, in order to meet the obligations placed on the automobile manufacturers and thus on their suppliers by national and international standards, laws and regulations.
Adient works collaboratively with a number of stakeholder groups including government agencies (e.g., National Highway Traffic Safety Administration), its customers and its suppliers to proactively engage in federal, state and international public policy processes.
Legal Matters
Adient is involved in various lawsuits, claims and proceedings incident to the operation of its businesses, including those pertaining to product liability, environmental, safety and health, intellectual property, employment, commercial and contractual matters, and various other matters. Although the outcome of such lawsuits, claims and proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty and some may be disposed of unfavorably to Adient, it is management's opinion that none of these will have a material adverse effect on Adient's financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Costs related to such matters were not material to the periods presented. Further details regarding Adient's commitments and contingencies is provided in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K in Note 19, "Commitments and Contingencies," of the notes to consolidated financial statements.
Environmental, Social and Governance
At Adient, we recognize robust and responsible environmental, social and governance (ESG) policies and practices are essential to the long-term success of our business and the well-being of our stakeholders, including our investors, employees, suppliers, customers and communities. We are weaving sustainability into our company’s DNA by integrating ESG principles into our product development initiatives, manufacturing processes, procurement practices, corporate governance activities and other key business areas. Our Board of Directors and senior managers ensure we operate our business ethically and in accordance with applicable laws and regulations, and, as appropriate, they oversee and implement our ESG policies and strategies with input from a cross-functional team of subject matter experts across our organization. We regularly communicate our ESG targets and 
Adient plc | Form 10-K | 8


related actions to our stakeholders through our SEC filings, media releases, quarterly earnings reports and our annual corporate sustainability report. 
Production Processes
Adient remains committed to improving sustainability in its global operations and to utilize standardized processes to reduce energy consumption, conserve water and generate less waste and emissions at our facilities globally. In fiscal year 2021, Adient set a goal of reducing its scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions 75% by 2030 (with 2019 as our base year), and continues to make progress toward that goal. Some recent examples of how Adient is reducing emissions and improving sustainability in its operations include: 
•Investing in more efficient equipment such as variable-speed air compressors and higher-efficiency HVAC units
•Replacing inefficient lighting with LED lighting
•Conducting hunts for sustainability opportunities at the facility level 
•Purchasing ultrasonic air leak detectors to find and repair leaks on the production line
•Reconfiguring shipping racks and packaging to optimize transportation logistics and save fuel
In addition, several of Adient’s facilities generate renewable electricity on-site via solar panel installations, and more than 40 of its locations now attribute 100% of their electricity consumption to renewable sources.
Products
Sustainability has been an inherent part of product development and innovation at Adient for more than three decades, and customers’ sustainability targets are closely tracked to ensure its efforts align with the needs and goals of its customers. More recently, vehicle electrification and a general move toward increasingly efficient transportation have emphasized the need for automotive seating products that are lighter, slimmer and contain more environmentally friendly materials than traditional seating products. To help meet this need, Adient has developed products such as the Soft Back Panel, which integrates 70% recycled PET (polyethylene terephthalate) while improving knee clearance and reducing the weight of each seat by as much as 2 kg. Through Adient’s Evolution of Seating Systems Sustainability (ES3) approach to product design, Adient is continuously identifying and integrating materials and manufacturing methods that minimize environmental impact and promote a circular economy.
Adient also recognizes the importance of its supply chain’s environmental risks and impacts and are working with its suppliers to reduce scope 3 (value chain) emissions 35% by 2030 (with 2019 as the base year). In 2022, Adient began mapping its complex supply chain, and in fiscal year 2023, Adient plans to implement a supplier due diligence tool — which, in part, calculates greenhouse gas emissions per commodity based on its supplier spend — to assess ESG risks within the supply chain and fine-tune the roadmap for reaching its scope 3 emissions-reduction goal. As noted in Adient’s recently published Deforestation Policy, the Company is also committed to procuring its forest commodities from more sustainable sources in order to reduce the impact on deforestation and protect natural habitats globally. 
People
Adient continues to work to protect the human rights and well-being of its employees, suppliers, customers and communities in which Adient operates globally. To those ends, Adient recently published a Human Rights Policy Statement, which outlines its commitment and defines the policies and procedures the Company has in place for respecting human rights, and a Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DE&I) Commitment Statement, which illustrates why and how Adient is creating a safe, respectful, diverse and inclusive work culture. Additionally, Adient is proud to support women-, minority- and veteran-owned businesses by spending more than $1 billion with diverse suppliers every year. 
Human Capital Resources
Adient's ability to sustain and grow its business requires it to hire, retain and develop a highly skilled and diverse workforce. Adient values character and integrity as much as qualifications and fosters an empowerment culture where employees have ownership in business outcomes. The highest levels of Adient’s management drive these practices with the alignment and support of all levels within the organization. Our Executive Vice President, Chief Legal and Human Resources Officer, and Corporate Secretary, reporting directly to the Chief Executive Officer (CEO), oversees Adient’s global talent processes to attract, develop and retain the most valuable asset - its employees. Adient has approximately 75,000 employees worldwide who represent a wide variety of backgrounds. Adient’s workforce composition (including employees at consolidated joint ventures), as of September 30, 2022, consists of approximately:
Adient plc | Form 10-K | 9


•44% work in the Americas, 43% work in EMEA and 13% work in our Asia-Pacific region
•40% of the global workforce is female
•43% of employees in the U.S. have identified themselves as ethnically diverse.
Adient ensures its people are engaged and working collaboratively to achieve company goals through positive employee relations activities that focus on supporting employees and their families. Adient also provides and encourages many forms of corporate communication such as town hall meetings, open-door policy and an ethics Integrity Helpline so that employees can hear directly from Adient leadership and have the opportunity to ask questions, make suggestions and provide input. Because the attraction, development and retention of the employee base is significant to its business strategy, executive management provides frequent updates on these metrics to the board of directors.
Health and Safety
We are committed to protecting the safety and well-being of our colleagues, customers, suppliers and people using our premises by providing and maintaining a safe working environment that protects both physical and mental wellbeing. Adient requires protective equipment, enforces comprehensive safety policies and procedures, and encourages employees and leaders to look regularly for ways to improve workplace safety. Adient has implemented and maintains a health and safety management system that is certified to the ISO 45001 Occupational Health and Safety standard. Globally, 100% of Adient’s facilities are internally audited and compliant, and 60% are also third-party audited and certified. Adient has achieved a year-over-year decrease in our global injury rate over the last several years. We work together across the globe, sharing best practice ideas, procedures, and information regarding accidents and injuries. At Adient, every new machine, operation, building or work-station change requires a safety risk assessment. When our employees come to work, they can know that where they work has undergone an extensive review of associated risks of injury or illness and that those risks are eliminated and/or minimized through robust controls. Adient provides monthly updates on health and safety to its board of directors, which during fiscal 2022, included updates on the return-to-work health and safety protocols in various geographies as a result of COVID-19.
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion
Adient strives to build a culture of diversity and inclusion through its purchasing and human resource practices and policies and works to eliminate discrimination and harassment in all of its forms, including women, minorities and other protected groups. Its CEO signed the "CEO Action for Diversity & Inclusion" pledge promulgated by the CEO Action for Diversity & Inclusion initiative, the largest CEO-driven business commitment to advance diversity and inclusion in the workplace. In addition, Adient is a member of the Center for Automotive Diversity, Inclusion and Advancement (CADIA). In September 2022 Adient published two new documents - a Human Rights Policy Statement and a Diversity, Equity & Inclusion (DE&I) Commitment Statement - each of which emphasizes the Company's commitment to protecting the safety, well-being and human rights of our people while driving a diverse and inclusive work culture. Adient developed and tracks human capital metrics regarding diversity and inclusion, which the Chief Legal and Human Resources Officer reviews semi-annually with the board of directors.
Since success in this area requires listening to diverse voices, Adient established Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DE&I) Councils in each of its three business regions - the Americas, EMEA (Europe, the Middle East and Africa) and APAC (Asia Pacific). The Councils drive strategic and tactical actions in the areas of talent acquisition and retention, communications and employee feedback, training and education, metrics and key performance indicators, as well as support Adient’s diverse Business Resource Groups. While the three councils primarily work within their regions, they also communicate and collaborate across regions to ensure alignment and progress toward enterprise-wide DE&I goals. Additionally, Adient has an annual global online training to all salaried employees focused on DE&I.
In 2022, Adient launched one Business Resource Group (BRG) in the Americas - the Hispanic Origins Latino Ancestry group (HOLA!) - in addition to growing the existing African Ancestry BRG, True Colors Network, and Women’s Resource Network. We continue to develop and refine our diversity initiatives to achieve our DE&I vision of being a premier employer that champions an inclusive and equitable work culture enriched by our diversity, where all employees are valued and respected. 
Succession and Talent Development
At Adient, we believe that attracting, developing, motivating and retaining employees is key to our sustainable and profitable growth. We understand that, like customers, our employees and potential employees have choices of where to work, and we must compete for the best talent. Adient supports employee development in multiple ways. Adient has a global performance management process through which employees provide a self-assessment and managers provide evaluation and feedback on performance. This process informs employee development goals. Adient's Leadership Talent Review (LTR) is its annual 
Adient plc | Form 10-K | 10


process for identifying and evaluating talent for the purposes of aligning individual aspirations and development plans with the organization's needs and building a diverse pipeline of leaders to mitigate leadership vacancy risk. LTR is designed to be an inclusive process that promotes visibility of talent, increases the validity of succession plans and ensures development efforts are applied efficiently. Talent potential assessments and succession plans are calibrated with broader groups of leaders to drive consistency, awareness and alignment on decisions and development actions. Adient's executive leadership provides annual updates on succession and talent development to the board of directors.
Seasonal Factors
Adient's principal operations are directly related to the automotive industry. Consequently, Adient may experience seasonal fluctuations to the extent automotive vehicle production slows, such as in the summer months when many customer plants close for model year changeovers and in December when many customer plants close for the holidays.
