Corporate History
 
Aura Energy Inc. formerly known as Arcom (the Company) was incorporated as Arcom under the laws of the State of Nevada on September 26, 2016. Arcom has only one officer and director who is Hui Liu Ping. We are engaged in the production of wood-manufactured bow ties in China, Hunan Province. 
 
On October 26, 2016, the Company issued 3,000,000 shares of restricted common stock to Hui Liu Ping. The value of these shares is $3,000 based on the par value of $0.001 per share of common stock.
 
On October 27, 2016, we consummated an agreement with CNC MACHINERY CHINA CO., LTD for the purchase of equipment to be used in our bow tie production. The Company has purchased Engraving Cnc Machine, Model STO CNC 6090 from above mentioned vendor. 
 
Our bow ties are accessories created for a daring new generation of men set to express themselves with originality and flair. The idea was developed in China. Looking to fill a void in mens accessories, we developed handcrafted bow ties that fuse old school craftsmanship with modern style. The efforts resulted in a product that uses wood as a distinctive material in the fashion industry. The bow ties are made from a variety of rare and exotic pieces of hardwood. A range of diverse patterns such as argyle, plaid, polka dot, and more are laser etched into the wood making them both increasingly unique and attractive. Each bow tie also incorporates an array of fine fabrics, resulting in a truly special accessory. 
 
As a Nevada corporation with operations in the Peoples Republic of China (PRC), we are considered a foreign-invested enterprise (FIE) under Chinese law.  As such, we are subject to PRC regulations, which are generally lengthy, and our expected future expenses associated with complying with those regulations will be substantial.  Even though a recent change in PRC law allows FIEs to establish operations in China without governmental preapproval, we are still required to file periodically regarding the establishment of our operations in China, increasing or decreasing our capital, selling equities or terminating operations in China, and we have not yet done so.  Please see our Risk Factors beginning on Page 15, particularly the risk factor entitled, Chinese regulations restrict foreign involvement in companies with China-based operations, and compliance with Chinese regulations will be costly.
 
Industry Overview
 
This report includes market and industry data that we have developed from publicly available information, various industry publications and other published industry sources and our internal data and estimates. Although we believe the publications and reports are reliable, we have not independently verified the data. Our internal data, estimates and forecasts are based upon information obtained from trade and business organizations and other contacts in the market in which we operate, and our management understands of industry conditions.
Bow Ties 
 
There are three types of bow ties: self-tie, pre-tied, and clip-on.

Self-Tie Bow Tie
 
Sometimes known as "freestyle," the self-tie bow tie is the classic style and has an organic look when tied. It can be challenging to tie a self-tie bow tie the first few times, but the payoff is well worth the effort.
Pre-Tied Bow Tie
 
At the name suggests, a pre-tied bow tie comes pre-tied and the knot is sewn in place. It is easy to put on but any bow tie aficionado will be able to spot the difference.
Clip-on Bow Tie
 
Clip-on bow ties clip directly onto the collar of your shirt. This style is the least convincing and is most appropriate for small children. There are several types of bow tie shapes, including butterfly, big butterfly, batwing, diamond point, and club round.
 
Arcom plans to focus its attention first of all on the clip-on bow tie in various shapes. This type of bow tie has a lot of advantages, as it is easy to fit on different neck sizes, and also easy to wear, because of the clip, which all of our initial ties will have. We believe that this unique unisex accessory has the potential to become popular in the near future. 
 
Equipment and Raw Materials 
 
We use a milling and engraving CNC machine, model STO CNC 6090. This machine is important to our production, as it has excellent speed and accuracy and can perform a variety of tasks. Thanks to a convenient NcStudio management system, accurate mechanical structure, high speed copying, and 3D carving, this CNC machine is everything we need in one unit for our bow tie manufacturing process.
 
Arcom has purchased raw materials from the same vendor as CNC machine. The materials primarily consist the following oak wood, elastic band, craft paper, fabric, needle and thread and wood varnish. These materials, together with walnut, rosewood, oak, and maple are sourced from CNC MACHINERY CHINA CO., LTD. We are checking the availability of raw materials while ordering the materials. The above-mentioned raw materials are all necessary for our bow ties production and distribution. We also purchased different kinds of wrapping paper from another vendor, Bag & Box Packaging Company, Ltd. 
 
Manufacturing Process 
 
Our manufacturing process in general can be described as below:
 
The most important stage is to choose the wood from which the bow ties will be manufactured. We use walnut, rosewood, oak, and maple in the beginning of our operations. After we choose the wood, the layout is drawn. Next, the wood is cut in accordance with the layout that was drawn previously. Further, when the billet is ready it is sanded, to prevent irregularities and make the surface smooth. If requested we can provide a special design on the bow tie, though this step adds to production time. The final step is applying a fabric in the middle and as a rim for the ties. We also use leather, denim, and cotton as a main fabric for our bow ties. 
Webpage and Marketing 
 
We plan to distribute our products via several distribution channels simultaneously. With regards to the fashion segment, we plan to cooperate with retailers (wedding accessory, celebration present, etc.) and wholesalers (fashion expeditions, designer companies and style magazines). We seek to attract individual and corporate clients through our website. In the case of large corporate clients, we also plan to focus on personal contacts with public relations departments of large companies, presentations of our products, distribution of promotional leaflets, free samples, and other measures to facilitate brand awareness.
 
Among others, we also intend to use such marketing strategies as web advertisements, direct mailing, and phone calls to acquire potential customers. We have a website to market and display our products. 
 We also plan to attend some trade shows and fashion exhibitions to show our products with a view to find new customers. We intend to continue our marketing efforts during the life of our operations. We spent approximately $4,600 in our fiscal year ended October 31, 2018 on advertising. There is no guarantee that we will be able to attract or retain enough customers to justify our expenditures. If we are unable to generate a significant amount of revenue and successfully protect ourselves against those risks, then it would materially affect our financial condition and our business could be harmed.

Office Facilities 
 
The Company leases a 37-square meter office space located at Hezhou N Rd 12, Hecheng Qu, Huaihua Shi, Hunan Sheng, China, 418000. The lease contract was signed for a one-year term with the option of expansion for an additional one-year term. Our rent expense was approximately $2,800 in our fiscal year ended October 31, 2018.
Competitors 
 
There are many well-established manufacturing, distribution and wholesale sales companies in our industry like Bow Tie House TM, Shengzhou Handsome Textiles Co., Ltd., and Yiwu Eco Baoyu E-Business Firm. We face the same difficulty that a lot of competitors in our same field are present on such sites as Tao Bao, Ali Express and others. We expect to face medium to high levels of resistance when we enter the market, where it will be up to our marketing efforts and negotiation skills to acquire new customers. Most of our competitors have greater financial resources than we do and will be able to withstand sales or price decreases better than we can. We also expect to continue to face competition from new market entrants. We may be unable to continue to compete effectively with these existing or new competitors, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
Risks We May Face and Other Information
 
Under Paragraph 2 of Article 2 of the Peoples Republic of China Corporate Income Tax Law (the Corporate Income Law), any foreign enterprise which shall constitute a resident enterprise shall meet both of the following requirements: (i) such enterprise was established under the laws of foreign countries or regions; and (ii) the actual management of such enterprise must be located within China. Further, under relevant provisions of the Circular of the State Administration of Taxation Regarding the Issues Relevant to the Identification of Chinese-controlled Enterprises Registered Abroad as Resident Enterprises by Actual Management (Guo Shui Fa [2009] No. 82, Circular No. 82) issued by the State Administration of Taxation on April 22, 2009 and based upon our no-name inquiry to the Peoples Republic of China State Administration for Taxation, any Chinese-controlled enterprise whose actual management is held to be located within China shall satisfy all of the following requirements: (i) the site, where the management of such enterprise responsible for the daily operation of such enterprise performs its duties, is located within China; (ii) the financial decisions (such as borrowings, extending loans, financing or financial risks management) and HR policies (such as appointment, dismissal or remunerations) shall be made or approved by the institution or personnel of such enterprise staying within China; (iii) 1/2 or more of the directors with voting rights or of the management of such enterprise live within China permanently; and (iv) the main assets, accounting books and stamps of and the minutes and files of the board of directors of and of shareholders meeting of such enterprise exist and will be maintained within China.
 
We believe that we are not considered a resident enterprise for PRC enterprise income tax purposes. We have no subsidiaries within China. We have our executive office in China, which were unincorporated entities under Chinese laws, and all of our management is located within China. We make or approve the financial decisions (such as borrowing, extending loans, financing or financial risks management) and human resource policies (such as employees appointment, dismissal and remunerations) within China, and half or more of our directors with voting rights are also located within China. Our main assets, accounting books, stamps and minutes of our directors board and of our shareholders meetings exist and will be maintained in outside the USA, so we are consistent with Item (iv) of the above four requirements under Circular No. 82 although our present conditions satisfy Items (i) to (iii) of the above requirements under Circular No. 82. Therefore, we are an enterprise established under the laws of Nevada, and our management team is located within China, we believe that we shall not be held to be a resident enterprise for PRC under the Corporate Income Tax Law.
 
Nevertheless, we cannot fully exclude the possibility that there is a difference or discrepancy between the interpretation of the Chinese authorities and our understanding as set forth above, nor can we assure that the statements or interpretations of the Chinese government officials will remain unchanged. Furthermore, we cannot exclude the possibility that the Chinese government will promulgate any new laws, regulations or provisions that will be in conflict with our understanding. If so, we may be classified as a resident enterprise for PRC enterprise income tax purposes, which could result in unfavorable tax consequences to our non-PRC shareholders and us.
 
If the PRC tax authorities determine that we are a resident enterprise for PRC enterprise income tax purposes, we may be subject to the enterprise income tax at a rate of 25% on our worldwide taxable income, as well as PRC enterprise income tax reporting obligations.
 
If we are considered a resident enterprise, this could result in a situation in which a 10% withholding tax is imposed on dividends we pay to our non-PRC enterprise shareholders and with respect to gains derived by our non-PRC enterprise shareholders from transferring our shares and a 20% withholding tax on dividends we pay to our non-PRC individual stockholders and with respect to gains derived by our non-PRC individual stockholders from transferring our shares. If we are required under PRC law to withhold

PRC income tax on dividends payable to our non-PRC investors or if you are required to pay PRC income tax on the transfer of our shares, the value of your investment in our shares may be materially and adversely affected.
 
Government policies are subject to rapid change and the government of China may adopt policies that have the effect of hindering private economic activity and greater economic decentralization. There is no assurance that the government of China will not significantly alter its policies from time to time without notice in a manner with reduces or eliminates any benefits from its present policies of economic reform. In addition, a substantial portion of productive assets in China remains government-owned. For instance, all lands are state owned and government state-owned lands grant use rights to business entities or individuals.
 
The granting process is typically based on government policies at the time of granting, which could be lengthy and complex. This process may adversely affect our business. The government of China also exercises significant control over Chinas economic growth through the allocation of resources, controlling payment of foreign currency and providing preferential treatment to particular industries or companies. Uncertainties may arise with changing of governmental policies and measures. In addition, changes in laws and regulations, or their interpretation, or the imposition of confiscatory taxation, restrictions on currency conversion, imports and sources of supply, devaluations of currency, the nationalization or other expropriation of private enterprises, as well as adverse changes in the political, economic or social conditions in China, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
 
We are subject to the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which generally prohibits United States companies from engaging in bribery or other prohibited payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Foreign companies, including some that may compete with us, are not subject to these prohibitions. Corruption, extortion, bribery, pay- offs, theft and other fraudulent practices occur from time-to-time in China. We can make no assurance, however, that our employees or other agents will not engage in such conduct for which we might be held responsible. If our employees or other agents are found to have engaged in such practices, we could suffer severe penalties and other consequences that may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
 
We may experience barriers to conducting business and trade in our targeted emerging markets in the form of delayed customs clearances, customs duties and tariffs. In addition, we may be subject to repatriation taxes levied upon the exchange of income from local currency into foreign currency, substantial taxes of profits, revenues, assets and payroll, as well as value-added tax.
 
The markets in which we plan to operate may impose onerous and unpredictable duties, tariffs and taxes on our business and products, and there can be no assurance that this will not reduce the level of sales that we achieve in such markets, which would reduce our revenues and profits.
 
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENDITURES
 
We have not incurred any research expenditures since our incorporation.
 
BANKRUPTCY OR SIMILAR PROCEEDINGS
 
There has been no bankruptcy, receivership or similar proceeding entered into either voluntarily by the Company and involuntarily against the Company.
 
REORGANIZATIONS, PURCHASE OR SALE OF ASSETS
 
There have been no material reclassifications, mergers, consolidations, or purchase or sale of a significant amount of assets not in the ordinary course of business.
 
COMPLIANCE WITH GOVERNMENT REGULATION
 
We will be required to comply with all regulations, rules and directives of governmental authorities and agencies applicable to the construction and operation of any facility in any jurisdiction which we would conduct activities.
 
We do not believe that any existing or probable government regulation on our business, including any applicable export or import regulation or control imposed by China will have a material impact on the way we conduct our business.
