Company Background
 
We were incorporated in the State of Utah on October 4, 1985, under the name of Mormon Mint, Inc. The corporation was originally a startup company organized to manufacture and market commemorative medallions related to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints. On January 5, 1999, Bekam Investments, Ltd. acquired one hundred percent of the common shares of the Company and spun the Company off changing its name Converge Global, Inc. From August 13, 1999 until November 20, 2002, the Company focused on the development and implementation of Internet web content and e-commerce applications. From 2009 to 2014 we operated primarily in the mining exploration business. In 2015, we left the mining business and began an internet-based marketing business focused on offerings from our “Majestic Menu” food service items offered to the hospitality and food service industry via an on-line internet site, where individuals could purchase retail direct from food distributors via credit cards and commercial accounts.
 
On September 4, 2015, Donald Steinberg and Charles Larsen purchased 400,000,000 shares of restricted common stock and 10,000,000 shares of the Preferred Class A stock from the Company’s President, Cornelia Volino, in exchange for $105,000.00. On September 9, 2015, Donald Steinberg was appointed Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer and Secretary of the Company. Mr. Larsen was appointed to the Board of Directors. The former officers and directors of the Company resigned concurrent with the new appointments. By virtue of Messrs. Steinberg and Larsen’s stock purchase and appointment to the Company’s Board of Directors, a purchase or sale of a significant amount of assets not in the ordinary course of business and a corresponding change of control occurred. The Company reported the change of control in its September 30, 2015 quarterly report filed with the OTC Markets. Thereafter, the Company’s business plans and operations changed to focus on cannabis and legalized hemp more fully discussed in this filing. The Company changed its name to Marijuana Company of America, Inc. and trading symbol on December 1, 2015.
 
Marijuana Company of America and subsidiaries is a publicly listed company quoted on the OTC Pink Sheet Exchange under the symbol “MCOA”. We are based in Escondido, California. Our business strategy has evolved over the course of fiscal year ended December 31, 2017. We originally were very interested in directly entering into the legalized cannabis business in those states where cannabis is legal for recreational and/or medicinal use. Our original business plans included directly engaging in the growth, cultivation, harvesting and distribution of cannabis and the research and development of cannabis products for sale, in addition to consumer products containing hemp derived, non-psychoactive cannabinoids (“CBD”). Our business plan and operation evolved to only focus in part on the development, manufacturing, marketing and sale of non-psychoactive industrial hemp, and hemp-derived consumer products containing CBD. Our business includes the research and development of (1) varieties of various species of hemp; (2) beneficial uses of hemp and hemp derivatives; (3) indoor and outdoor cultivation methods for hemp; (4) technology used for cultivation and harvesting of different species of hemp, including but not limited to lighting, venting, irrigation, hydroponics, nutrients and soil; (5) different industrial hemp derived CBD, and the possible health benefits thereof; and, (6) new and improved methods of hemp CBD extraction omitting or eliminating the delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol “THC” molecule.
 
We develop, manufacture and sell, through our wholly owned subsidiary H Smart, Inc., consumer products that include industrial hemp derived, non-psychoactive CBD as an ingredient, under the brand name “hempSMART™. Our industrial hemp-based products are specifically developed with an enriched CBD molecular composition with a THC concentration of three-tenths of one percent or less by dry weight. We market and sell our hempSMART™ products directly through our web site, and through our affiliate marketing program, where qualified sales affiliates use a secure multi-level-marketing sales software program that facilitates order placement over the internet via a web site, and accounts for affiliate orders and sales; calculates referral benefits apportionable to specific sales associates and calculates and accounts for loyalty and rewards benefits for returning customers. We also retained a full-service marketing company that uses a multi-channel transactional marketing campaign focused on digital advertising, infographics, content marketing, customer incentives and acquisition, a broad social media presence, as well as search engine marketing and optimization that includes comprehensive research and analytics and order fulfillment in order to boost direct sales.

Our business also includes making selected investments in other related new businesses. Currently, we have made investments in startup ventures, including:
 

· | Conveniant Hemp Mart, LLC; Conveniant (sic) Hemp Mart, LLC is a Wyoming limited liability company whose business plan includes the development, manufacture and sale of consumer products containing CBD that are intended for marketing and sales at convenience stores, gas stations and markets. On July 19, 2017, we agreed to lend fifty thousand dollars ($50,000) to Conveniant based on a promissory note. The note provided that in lieu of receiving repayment, we could elect to exercise a right to convert the loaned amount into a payment towards the purchase of a 25% interest in Conveniant, subject to our payment of an additional fifty thousand dollars [$50,000] equaling a total purchase price of $100,000. The Company exercised this option on November 20, 2017 and made payment to Conveniant on November 21, 2017. Conveniant developed a line of consumer products containing industrial hemp derived CBD with no traceable THC content. The product line includes tinctures that combine industrial hemp-derived CBD with hemp seed oil, coconut oil and other essential natural oils; a muscle cream product that combines industrial hemp-derived CBD with natural oils; a hand lotion that combines industrial hemp derived CBD with lavender oils; and a line of pet treats that combine industrial hemp-derived CBD with natural oils. Conveniant began its initial marketing efforts by introducing its brand and products at the ASD Market Tradeshow in Las Vegas that took place in March 2018. The ASD Market Tradeshow is a business to business convention where retail merchandise is introduced to various consumer market segments, including Conveniant’s primary focus on convenience stores, gas stations, small markets and similar venues. Conveniant Hemp Mart’s operations are in the development stage.

· | MoneyTrac Technology, Inc.; MoneyTrac Technology, Inc. is a developer of an integrated and streamlined electronic payment processing system containing E-Wallet and mobile applications, that allows for the management and processing of prepaid cards, debit cards, and credit card payments. We entered into a stock purchase agreement with MoneyTrac on March 13, 2017 to purchase a 15% equity position in MoneyTrac. On July 27, 2017 we completed tender of the purchase price of $250,000. MoneyTrac’s business and banking software solutions offer firms the ability to deposit funds directly into a “MoneyTrac Merchant Wallet,” created and controlled by the firm, from which the firm can manage and provide inventory management, payroll processing, and audit tracking; and, the creation of “Customer Wallets,” by anyone who wants to engage in cashless transactions, by loading money into their “MoneyTrac Customer Wallet” from a bank account or through a MoneyTrac kiosk, which also accepts debit and credit card transactions. MoneyTrac’s kiosks are marketed to businesses that wish to offer cashless transactions to its customers, who can choose to either have funds loaded directly into their “Customer Wallet” or onto a pre-paid debit card. MoneyTrac’s system provides for a secure, managed and auditable record of cashless transactions that is designed to be marketed to firms who want an alternative payment and management method for transacting business, including those firms in the legalized cannabis business in those states where cannabis has been legalized for recreational and/or medicinal use.

· | Global Hemp Group, Inc. Joint Venture; On September 5, 2017, we announced our agreement to participate in a joint venture with Global Hemp Group Inc., a Canadian corporation, in a multi-phase industrial hemp project on the Acadian peninsula of New Brunswick, Canada. The joint venture’s goal is to develop a “Hemp Agro-Industrial Zone”, a concept that promotes and engages farmers, processors and manufacturers to collaboratively produce and process 100% of the hemp plant into a number of wholesale materials that can be manufactured into healthy and sustainable products. The “HAIZ” will be surrounded by hemp production thereby minimizing the cost of expensive transportation to distant processing facilities. The “Hemp Agro-Industrial Zone” has a goal of producing social and environmental benefits to the communities where they operate. These zones are envisioned to prospectively create jobs for farmers, foster rural development, provide the opportunity to develop more sustainable products of superior quality and help support Global Hemp Group’s commitment to creating a carbon free economy. The first phase of the project involved lab testing in support of the trials. The Collège Communautaire du Nouveau Brunswick (CCNB) in Bathurst, New Brunswick (“CCNB”) intends to assist Global Hemp Group in research on its ongoing industrial hemp trials in the region, and to perform laboratory tests in support of these trials. These tests will provide information to validate agronomic and key yield data in preparation of a large-scale industrial development project that will involve processing of the full plant: grain, straw, flowers and leaves, scheduled to begin in 2018. The results of these tests will also be used in discussions with farmers of the region to refine a hemp-based farming model, and to mobilize additional farmers for the next growing season. Our participation included providing one-half, or $10,775 of the funding for the phase one work. On January 10, 2018, phase-one was completed by successfully cultivating industrial hemp during the 2017 growing season for research purposes. The objective of phase one was to re-introduce hemp into the area, and ensure that it could be productive under New Brunswick growing conditions prior to significantly increasing cultivation acreage and building a hemp processing facility in the region, in future phases of the project. As a result of our participation in the joint venture, we will share in the ownership of research and development of hemp and CBD related studies produced by the New Brunswick Project, and, in the event Canadian laws governing the growing, harvesting, manufacturing and production of products containing hemp and CBD change (as expected, but not guaranteed) in 2018, we would benefit from possible preferred pricing and terms for the purchase of hemp and CBD that would enable us to further conduct its business and research and development into hemp and CBD products.

· | Bougainville Ventures, Inc. Joint Venture; On March 16, 2017, we entered into a joint venture agreement with Bougainville Ventures, Inc., a Canadian corporation. The purpose of the joint venture was for the Company and Bougainville to jointly engage in the development and promotion of products in the legalized Marijuana industry in Washington State; (ii) utilize Bougainville’s high quality grow operations in the State of Washington on real property leased by Bougainville for use within the legalized Marijuana industry; (iii) provide technical and management services and resources including but not limited to: sales and marketing, agricultural procedures, operations security and monitoring, processing and delivery, branding, capital resources and financial management; and, (iv) optimize collaborative business opportunities. The Company and Bougainville agreed to operate through a Washington State Limited Liability Company, and BV-MCOA Management, LLC was organized in the State of Washington on May 16, 2017.

As our contribution to the joint venture, the Company committed to raise not less than $1 million dollars to fund joint venture operations based upon a funding schedule. The Company also committed to providing branding and systems for the representation of Marijuana related products and derivatives comprised of management, marketing and various proprietary methodologies directly tailored to the Marijuana industry.
 Bougainville represented that it possessed a lease for real property in Washington State suitable for growing marijuana, and information primarily related to the management and control of Marijuana grow operations as conducted in Washington State that included research, development and know how in the Marijuana industry. Bougainville also represented that it was associated with a Tier 3 license holder in Washington State. The Company and Bougainville's agreement was that the funding provided by the Company would go, in part, towards the ultimate purchase of the land leased by Bougainville, consisting of a one-acre parcel located in Okanogan County, Washington.
 As disclosed on Form 8-K on December 11, 2017, the Company did not comply with the funding schedule for the joint venture. On November 6, 2017, the Company and Bougainville amended the joint venture agreement to reduce the amount of the Company's commitment to $800,000 and also required the Company to issue Bougainville 15 million shares of the Company's restricted common stock. The Company completed its payments pursuant to the amended agreement on November 7, 2017, and on November 9, 2017, issued to Bougainville 15 million shares of restricted common stock.
 Thereafter, the Company determined that Bougainville was not a lessee to property in Washington State as represented in the joint venture agreement, but rather was a party to a purchase agreement for real property that included Green Ventures Capital Corp., a Canadian corporation. The real property purchase agreement was in breach due to non-payment by Bougainville and Green Ventures. Bougainville also did not possess an agreement with an I503 license holder to grow Marijuana on the property. Nonetheless, as a result of funding arranged for by the Company, Bougainville and Green Ventures purchased the land.
 
Thereafter, Bougainville, the Company and Green Ventures entered into good faith negotiations to revise and restate the joint venture agreement to clarify the respective contributions and roles of the parties going forward. Once the revised and restated joint venture agreement is finalized, and the land is subdivided by the Okanogan County Assessor, Green Ventures and Bougainville will deed the land to the joint venture. Thereafter, the joint venture will lease the property to Green Ventures who will operate and curate the land for the growth, cultivation harvest and sale of agricultural products determined by Green Ventures as lessee of the land in its discretion. Green Ventures’ participation in the joint venture will be limited to only acting to deed the land to the joint venture, after which, Green Venture’s role in the joint venture will cease. As noted above, our business plans and priorities evolved over 2017. Originally, we were very interested in directly engaging in the growth, cultivation, harvesting and distribution of cannabis and the research and development of cannabis products for sale. We initially envisioned the joint venture as playing an active role in the growth, cultivation and harvesting of cannabis on the land. However, we ultimately determined to abandon direct involvement with THC psychoactive cannabis in favor of focusing on the development, manufacturing, marketing and sale of non-psychoactive industrial hemp, and hemp-derived consumer products containing CBD. As a result of the foregoing, we expect that aside from having arranged for the funding necessary for the purchase of the land, our participation in the joint venture’s role going forward will only be to lease the land to Green Ventures, and to provide financial accounting and business services. The following documents, once completed and executed, will be filed on Form 8-K:

· | GateC Research Joint Venture; On March 17, 2017, the Company and GateC Research, Inc. entered into a Joint Venture Agreement. The Company committed to raise up to $1,500,000 over a six-month period, with a minimum commitment of $500,000 within a three (3) month period; and, information establishing brands and systems for the representation of marijuana related products and derivatives comprised of management, marketing and various proprietary methodologies, including but not limited to its affiliate marketing program, directly tailored to the marijuana industry. GateC agreed to contribute its management and control services and systems related to marijuana grow operations in Adelanto County, California, and its permit to grow marijuana in an approved zone in Adelanto, California. On or about November 28, 2017, GateC and the Company orally agreed to a suspension of the Company’s funding commitment, pending the finalization of California State regulations governing the growth, cultivation and distribution of marijuana. Consistent with the Company’s decision, as discussed above, to not directly engage in THC psychoactive cannabis growth, the Company and GateC entered into a Recession and Mutual Release Agreement on March 19, 2018. GateC and the Registrant rescinded the Agreement and concurrently released each other from any all any and all losses, claims, debts, liabilities, demands, obligations, promises, acts, omissions, agreements, costs and expenses, damages, injuries, suits, actions and causes of action, of whatever kind or nature, whether known or unknown, suspected or unsuspected, contingent or fixed, that they may have against each other and their Affiliates, arising out of the joint venture agreement (See Note 15 to the Financial Statements, Subsequent Events).

Industry and Regulatory Overview
 
Our business plan intends on only engaging within states and/or countries that have lawfully allowed and permitted the legal use of cannabis and hemp generally, and specifically hemp derived CBD and its molecular compounds and resulting products.
 
The Company is not engaged in the direct growth, cultivation, harvesting and distribution of cannabis containing psychoactive amounts of the THC molecule. However, we do offer and provide financial consulting and property management services to licensed, lawful and compliant operator(s) engaged within legalized states where cannabis strains containing the THC molecule is regulated and/or has been de-criminalized for personal and/or medicinal use.
 
Hemp is a member of the cannabis family. Industrial hemp derived CBD, like cannabis, is illegal under federal law and is a “Schedule 1” drug under the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. § 811). As a Schedule 1 drug, hemp derived CBD is viewed as being highly addictive and having no medical value. The United States Drug Enforcement Agency enforces the Controlled Substances Act, and persons violating it are subject to federal criminal prosecution. The criminal penalty structure in the Controlled Substances Act is determined based on the specific predicate violations, including but not limited to: simple possession, drug trafficking, attempt and conspiracy, distribution to minors, trafficking in drug paraphernalia, money laundering, racketeering, environmental damage from illegal manufacturing, continuing criminal enterprise, and smuggling. A first conviction under the Controlled Substances Act can generally result in possible fines from $250,000 to $50 million dollars, and incarceration for periods generally from five and up to forty years. For a second conviction, fines increase generally from $500,000 to $75 million dollars, and incarceration for periods generally from ten years to twenty years to life.
 
The federal government recently issued guidance to federal prosecutors concerning marijuana enforcement under the Controlled Substances Act (CSA). On January 4, 2018, Attorney General Jeff Sessions issued a memorandum for all United States Attorneys concerning federal cannabis enforcement generally. Mr. Sessions rescinded all previous prosecutorial guidance issued by the Department of Justice regarding cannabis, including the August 29, 2013 memorandum by James Cole, Deputy Attorney General (the “Cole Memorandum”).
 
The Cole Memorandum previously set out the Department of Justice’s prosecutorial priorities in light of various states legalizing cannabis for medicinal and/or recreational use. The Cole Memorandum provided that when states have implemented strong and effective regulatory and enforcement systems to control the cultivation, distribution, sale, and possession of cannabis, conduct in compliance with those laws and regulations is less likely to threaten the federal priorities. Indeed, a robust system may affirmatively address those priorities by, for example, implementing effective measures to prevent diversion of cannabis outside of the regulated system and to other states, prohibiting access to cannabis by minors, and replacing an illicit cannabis trade that funds criminal enterprises with a tightly regulated market in which revenues are tracked and accounted for. In those circumstances, consistent with the traditional allocation of federal-state efforts in this area, the Cole Memorandum provided that enforcement of state law by state and local law enforcement and regulatory bodies should remain the primary means of addressing cannabis-related activity. If state enforcement efforts are not sufficiently robust to protect against the harms set forth above, the federal government may seek to challenge the regulatory structure itself in addition to continuing to bring individual enforcement actions, including criminal prosecutions, focused on those harms.
 
By rescinding the Cole Memorandum, Mr. Sessions injected material uncertainty as it relates to how the Department of Justice will evaluate cannabis cases for prosecution, and risk into the Company’s business as it relates to the research, development, marketing and sale of its products containing industrial hemp derived CBD (see Risk Factors, Item 1A).
 
Mr. Sessions stated that U.S. Attorneys must decide whether or not to pursue prosecution of cannabis activity based upon factors including: the seriousness of the crime, the deterrent effect of criminal prosecution, and the cumulative impact of particular crimes on the community. Mr. Sessions reiterated that the cultivation, distribution and possession of cannabis continues to be a crime under the U.S. Controlled Substances Act.
 
On March 23, 2018, President Donald J. Trump signed into law a $1.3 trillion-dollar spending bill that included an amendment known as “Rohrabacher-Blumenauer,” which prohibits the Justice Department from using federal funds to prevent certain states “from implementing their own State laws that authorize the use, distribution, possession or cultivation of medical marijuana.”
 
The United States Food & Drug Administration (“FDA”) is generally responsible for protecting the public health by ensuring the safety, efficacy, and security of (1) prescription and over the counter drugs; (2) biologics including vaccines, blood & blood products, and cellular and gene therapies; (3) foodstuffs including dietary supplements, bottled water, and baby formula; and, (4) medical devices including heart pacemakers, surgical implants, prosthetics, and dental devices.

Regarding its regulation of drugs, the FDA process requires a review that begins with the filing of an “Investigational New Drug” (IND) application, with follow on clinical studies and clinical trials that the FDA uses to determine whether a drug is safe and effective, and therefore subject to approval for human use by the FDA.
 
Aside from the FDA’s mandate to regulate drugs, the FDA also regulates dietary supplement products and dietary ingredients under the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994. This law prohibits manufacturers and distributors of dietary supplements and dietary ingredients from marketing products that are adulterated or misbranded. This means that these firms are responsible for evaluating the safety and labeling of their products before marketing to ensure that they meet all the requirements of the law and FDA regulations, including, but not limited to the following labeling requirements: (1) identifying the supplement; (2) nutrition labeling; (3) ingredient labeling; (4) claims; and, (5) daily use information.
 
The FDA has not approved cannabis, hemp or CBD derived from industrial hemp as a safe and effective drug for any indication. As of the date of this filing, we have not, and do not intend to file an IND with the FDA, concerning any of our consumer products that contain CBD derived from industrial hemp.
 
The FDA has concluded that products containing industrial hemp derived CBD are excluded from the dietary supplement definition under sections 201(ff)(3)(B)(i) and (ii) of the U.S. Food, Drug & Cosmetic Act, respectively. The FDA’s position is that products containing industrial hemp derived CBD are Schedule 1 drugs under the Controlled Substances Act, and so are illegal drugs that are under the purview of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency and U.S. Justice Dept., who are charged with enforcing the Controlled Substances Act. However, at some indeterminate future time, the FDA may choose to change its position concerning cannabis generally, and specifically products containing industrial hemp derived CBD, and may choose to enact regulations that are applicable to such products as either drugs or supplements. In this event, our industrial hemp-based products containing CBD may be subject to regulation (See Risk Factors, Item IA).
 
In addition to strict compliance with state laws and regulations in those jurisdictions where cannabis is legal for recreational or medical use, the Company’s research and development activities intend to comply with the parameters of a recent 9th Cir. Federal Appellate Court decision, United States v. McIntosh, 2016 DJDAR 8484 (Aug. 16, 2016), which held: “the U.S. Department of Justice cannot spend money to prosecute federal marijuana cases if the defendants comply with state guidelines that permit the drug's sale for medical purposes”. The Court reasoned that “if the DOJ punishes individuals for engaging in activities permitted under state law (such as the use, cultivation, distribution and possession of medical marijuana), then the DOJ is preventing state law from being implemented as a practical matter.” “By officially permitting certain conduct, state law provides for non-prosecution of individuals who engage in such conduct. If the federal government prosecutes such individuals, it has prevented the state from giving practical effect to its law providing for non-prosecution of individuals who engage in the permitted conduct." This ruling is consistent with Congress’s passing of its current budget law, that included an amendment known as “Rohrabacher-Blumenauer,” which prohibits the Justice Department from using federal funds to prevent certain states “from implementing their own State laws that authorize the use, distribution, possession or cultivation of medical marijuana.”
 
Industrial Hemp
 
With the passage of the 2014 Farm Bill, Congress differentiated industrial hemp from marijuana plants. Section 7606 of the 2014 Farm Bill authorized the growth, cultivation and marketing of industrial hemp under agricultural pilot programs in states that have legalized such activities. States with permitting agricultural programs may authorize, upon the granting of an applicant’s application, the issuance of a State license to lawfully participate under the 2014 Farm Bill’s hemp program.
 
On August 11, 2016, a Statement of Principles on Industrial Hemp (the “Statement”) was issued by the Office of Secretary of the U.S. Department of Agriculture (“USDA”), the Drug Enforcement Administration (“DEA”) of the U.S. Department of Justice (“DOJ”) and the Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) of the Department of Health and Human Service (“HHS”). On this date, Jonathan Miller, Esq., of the firm Frost Brown Tod, Lexington, KY., and co-signed by Joseph Sandler, Esq., of the firm Sandler Reiff Lamb Rosenstein & Birkenstock, Washington, DC., provided to the Members of the Kentucky Hemp Industry Counsel, a legal opinion on the U.S. Federal Agency Statement of Principles. This legal opinion including the following statement:
 
“As we outlined comprehensively in our Opinion on the Legal Status of Industrial Hemp, dated December 21, 2015 and attached as Appendix B (“our December Opinion”), the Agricultural Act of 2014, P.L. No. 113-79 (the “2014 Farm Bill”) and the Consolidated Appropriations Act for FY 2016 (the “Omnibus Law”) constitute a sweeping legal revolution for the industrial hemp crop. Taken together, the two laws ensure that individuals and firms that are engaged in authorized agricultural pilot programs should be permitted to grow, cultivate, transport, process, sell and/or use industrial hemp under the guidelines and regulations of state law, without interference from agencies using federally-authorized funds.”
 
The Omnibus Appropriations Act of 2016, P.L. 114-113, 129 Stat. 2242, was enacted into law on December 18, 2015. One of the provisions of that act prohibits use of federal funds to “prohibit the transportation, processing, sale, or use of Industrial Hemp that is grown or cultivated [under the Agricultural Act of 2014].” P.L. 114-113, § 763, 129 Stat. 2285. Federal case law supports this interpretation and would allow the dissemination of hemp across state lines or support the notion that the Federal agencies are not permitted to use federal funds to impede such transportation.

On March 26, 2018, U.S. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) and Kentucky Commissioner of Agriculture Ryan Quarles (R-KY) announced the impending introduction of legislation in the United States Senate to support Kentucky’s hemp industry. The Hemp Farming Act of 2018 will legalize hemp as an agricultural commodity and remove it from the list of controlled substances.
 
Our position is that the industrial hemp plant, with a THC concentration of three-tenths of a percent or less by dry weight, has no potential for abuse, as it does not cause any psychoactive effect, as has been established by numerous studies, and its growth has been sanctioned by the foregoing laws and policies. Nonetheless, we intend to engage in the industrial hemp derived CBD and extract industry only in compliance with permitting state’s and their Department of Agriculture Programs and with the final approval from our legal counsel. Final products shall be sold and certified as THC free.
 
Business Overview
 
We primarily operate within two divisions within the regulated cannabis industry: (i) the development, manufacturing, marketing and sale of our “hempSMART™ consumer products that include non-psychoactive industrial hemp-based CBD as an ingredient; and, (ii) professional financial consulting and property management services.

Sales and Marketing
 
We market and sell our services and products throughout the United States in states that have implemented regulated cannabis programs as well as Canada. We intend to expand our offerings as additional countries, states and jurisdictions adopt state-regulated or federal programs. We market and sell our hempSMART™ products directly through our web site, and through our affiliate marketing program, where qualified sales affiliates use a secure multi-level-marketing sales software program that facilitates order placement over the internet via a web site, and accounts for affiliate orders and sales; calculates referral benefits apportionable to specific sales associates and calculates and accounts for loyalty and rewards benefits for returning customers. We also retained a full-service marketing company that uses a multi-channel transactional marketing campaign focused on digital advertising, infographics, content marketing, customer incentives and acquisition, a broad social media presence, as well as search engine marketing and optimization that includes comprehensive research and analytics and order fulfillment in order to boost direct sales.
Research and Development 
 
Our research and development activity for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017 was primarily focused on the formulation of our first hempSMART™ product: hempSMART™ Brain. Our research and development costs were $62,000, all in connection to research and development activity concerning hempSMART™ Brain. We expect to conduct additional research and development as the Company expands its hempSMART™ line of products.
Significant Customers
 
Sales of our hempSMART™ products, both directly by us and through our affiliate marketing sales program, have yet to produce material revenues, and so our operations have not resulted in reportable significant customers.
Intellectual Property
 
On July 18, 2016, our wholly owned subsidiary, H Smart, Inc., filed a patent application with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, Application No. 15/651,648, for its proprietary CBD formulated product: hempSMART™ Brain. On October 3, 2016, H Smart, Inc. filed a trademark application with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office for the tradename hempSMART™, Application No. 87/531,833. Neither the patent nor the trademark have yet been registered, and the applications for each are pending.
Competition
 
Our competitors include professional services firms dedicated to the regulated cannabis industry, as well as sellers of hemp-based CBD products. We compete in markets where cannabis has been legalized and regulated, which includes various states within the United States and Canada. We expect that the quantity and composition of our competitive environment will continue to evolve as the industry matures. Additionally, increased competition is possible to the extent that new states and geographies enter the marketplace as a result of continued enactment of regulatory and legislative changes that de-criminalize and regulate cannabis and hemp products. We believe that by being well established in the industry, our experience, and our continued expansion of service and product offerings in new and existing locations, are factors that mitigate the risk associated with operating in a developing competitive environment. Additionally, the contemporaneous growth of the industry as a whole will result in new customers entering the marketplace, thereby further mitigating the impact of competition on our expected operations and results. 
Employees 
 
As of December 31, 2017, we have 6 full-time employees and 6 part-time employees, all of which are U.S. based, primarily in California at our Escondido headquarters. None of our U.S employees are represented by a labor union.
