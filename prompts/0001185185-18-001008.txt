Item 1.  BUSINESS

(b)  Financial Information about Our Segments
 
While selling children’s books and related products (collectively referred to as “books”) is our only line of business, we sell them through two business segments, which we sometimes refer to as “divisions”:

· | Home Business Division (“Usborne Books & More” or “UBAM”) – This division sells our books through independent consultants directly to our customers. Our consultants sell books by hosting home parties, through social media collaboration platforms on the internet, by hosting book fairs with school and public libraries and through other events.

· | Publishing Division (“EDC Publishing” or “Publishing”) – This division sells our books to bookstores (including major national chains), toy stores, specialty stores, museums and other retail outlets throughout the country.

(c)  Narrative Description of Business
 
Products
 
As the exclusive United States trade co-publisher of the Usborne books and sole publisher of Kane Miller books, we offer over 2,000 different children’s books.  Many of our books are interactive in nature, including our Touchy-Feely board books, activity and flashcards, adventure and search books, art books, sticker books and foreign language books.  Most of our books are originally published in other countries, in their native languages, and we translate them to common American English and have exclusive rights to publish the titles in United States.
 
 We have a broad line of ‘internet-linked’ books which allow readers to expand their educational experience by referring them to relevant non-Company websites.  Our books include science and math titles, as well as chapter books and novels.  We continually introduce new titles across all lines of our products.
 
UBAM markets the books through commissioned consultants using a combination of direct sales, home parties, book fairs and internet based social media party plans.  The division had approximately 35,500 active consultants in 50 states at February 28, 2018.
 
Our Publishing division markets through commissioned trade representatives who call on retail book, toy, and specialty stores along with other retail outlets. Publishing also conducts in-house marketing by telephone to these customers and potential customers.  This division markets to approximately 4,000 book, toy and specialty stores.  Approximately 8% of our Publishing division's net sales, are to major book chains.
 
Key Customers
 
No customer represents more than 10% of our net sales.
 
Seasonality
 
Sales for both divisions are greatest during the fall due to the holiday season.
 
Competition
 
While we have the exclusive U.S. rights to sell Usborne Books and our Kane Miller published books, we face competition from the internet and other book publishers who are also selling directly to our customers.  Our UBAM division competes in recruiting and retaining sales consultants, which continuously receive opportunities to work for larger direct selling companies.  We also compete with Scholastic Books in the school and library book fair market.
 
Our Publishing division faces competition from large U.S. and international publishing companies.
 
Employees
 
As of May 16, 2018, 193 full-time employees worked at our Tulsa office and distribution facility and at our San Diego office.  Of these employees, approximately 65% of our employees work in our distribution warehouse.  We believe our relations with our employees are good.
