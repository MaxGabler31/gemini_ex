Governmental Regulations
Our manufacturing operations are subject to regulation by governmental and other regulatory authorities with jurisdiction over our operations. These regulations include regulations concerning the discharge of materials into the environment, the handling, storage, transportation, disposal, and clean-up of chemicals and waste materials, and otherwise relating to the protection of the environment, as well as other operational regulations, such as the Occupational Safety and Health Act and the Toxic Substances Control Act in the U.S. and the Registration, Evaluation and Authorization of Chemicals, or REACH, directive in Europe, the UK, and other countries. It is not possible to quantify with certainty the material effects that compliance with these regulations may have upon the capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position of Ingevity, but we currently anticipate that such compliance will not have a material adverse effect on any of the foregoing. Environmental and other regulations and related legal proceedings have the potential to involve significant costs and liability for Ingevity.
Intellectual Property
Intellectual property, including patents, closely guarded trade secrets and highly proprietary manufacturing know-how, as well as other proprietary rights, is a critical part of maintaining our technology leadership and competitive edge. Our business strategy includes filing patent and trademark applications where appropriate for proprietary developments, as well as protecting our trade secrets. We actively create, protect, and enforce our intellectual property rights. We are filing for and being granted patents for product and process developments for our Performance Materials business that we believe are both novel and consistent with trends in the technological development of engines. Our Evotherm® Warm Mix Asphalt technology is supported by numerous global patents. Additionally, our caprolactone and related technologies are supported by numerous global patents and trademarks, as well as proprietary manufacturing and technical know-how. The protection afforded by our patents and trademarks varies based on country, scope, and coverage, as well as the availability of legal remedies. Although our intellectual property taken as a whole is material to the business, there is no individual patent or trademark the loss of which could have a material adverse effect on the business. 
On July 19, 2018, Ingevity filed suit against BASF Corporation (“BASF”) in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware (the “Delaware Proceeding”) alleging BASF infringed Ingevity’s patent covering canister systems used in the control of automotive gasoline vapor emissions (U.S. Patent No. RE38,844) (the “844 Patent”). On February 14, 2019, BASF asserted counterclaims against Ingevity in the Delaware Proceeding, alleging two claims for violations of U.S. antitrust law (one for exclusive dealing and the other for tying) as well as a claim for tortious interference with an alleged prospective business relationship between BASF and a BASF customer (the “BASF Counterclaims”). The BASF Counterclaims relate to Ingevity’s enforcement of the 844 Patent and Ingevity’s entry into several supply agreements with customers of its fuel vapor canister honeycombs. The U.S. District Court dismissed Ingevity’s patent infringement claims on November 18, 2020, and the case proceeded to trial on the BASF Counterclaims in September 2021.
On September 15, 2021, a jury in the Delaware Proceeding issued a verdict in favor of BASF on the BASF Counterclaims and awarded BASF damages of approximately $28.3 million, which will be trebled under U.S. antitrust law to approximately $85.0 million when the court enters judgment. In addition, BASF may seek pre- and post-judgment interest and attorneys’ fees and costs in amounts that they will have to support at a future date.
We disagree with the verdict, including the court’s application of the law, and we intend to seek judgment as a matter of law in the Delaware Proceeding post-trial briefing stage and on appeal, if necessary. In addition, we intend to challenge the U.S. District Court’s November 2020 dismissal of our patent infringement claims against BASF. Ingevity believes in the strength of its intellectual property and the merits of its position and intends to pursue all legal relief available to challenge these outcomes in the Delaware Proceeding. Final resolution of these matters could take up to eighteen months.
Seasonality
There are a variety of seasonal dynamics, including global climate and weather conditions, that impact our businesses, though none have currently materially affected our financial results, except in the case of the pavement technologies product line, where roughly 70 to 75 percent of revenue is generated between April and September. From a supply perspective, this seasonality is effectively managed through pre-season inventory build and active inventory management throughout the year.
Energy
Our manufacturing processes require a significant amount of energy. We are dependent on natural gas to fuel the processes in our chemical refineries and activated carbon plants. Although we believe that we currently have a stable natural 
gas supply and infrastructure for our operations, we are subject to volatility in the market price of natural gas. We enter into certain derivative financial instruments in order to mitigate expected fluctuations in market prices and the volatility to earnings and cash flow resulting from changes to pricing of natural gas purchases. All of our manufacturing processes also consume a significant amount of electricity. Each of these facilities are located in regulated service areas that have stable rate structures with reliable electricity supply. 
Leveraging Sustainability
Throughout our Performance Chemicals and Performance Materials portfolios, we are a leader in adding value to products made from renewable materials and in derivatizing technologies that impart desirable environmental benefits in their use. To create a majority of our chemistries, we take crude tall oil from pine trees and hardwood sawdust (both co-products of the lumber, paper and furniture-making industries) and convert them into products that benefit customers, the environment and society. 
For the caprolactone-based products in our Performance Chemicals segment – although derived from traditional feedstocks – these solutions enable performance attributes in end-use markets that directly help customers and consumers meet sustainability goals. The superior durability of Capa-based technologies extends product life and helps make materials fully biodegradable.
Put simply: Ingevity’s products help customers reduce their ecological impact. Our asphalt emulsifiers enable pavement recycling that reuses up to 100 percent of existing materials to create longer-lasting roads. Our automotive activated carbon products improve the air we breathe by recovering 8 million gallons of gasoline daily. Our lubricant technologies increase tool life and simplify formulations. And our alternative-fuel vehicle technology enables the use of renewable natural gas as fuel for pickup trucks.
Our business is built on our ability to maximize the value and utility of materials over their lifecycle, and we will continue to enhance this value proposition through future acquisitions and new product development.
Human Capital Management
Talent
Our employees are critical to our success, and we strive to provide a safe, rewarding and respectful workplace where our people are provided with opportunities to pursue career paths based on skills, performance and potential. Ingevity is dependent upon our talented production workers who are key to ensuring safe and successful operations, as well as upon engineering, technical, sales and application specialists, together with experienced industry professionals, who are integral to our success. Additionally, we rely on senior management in order to establish and execute our business strategies. Our success depends, in part, on our ability to attract, retain and motivate these key performers. Our failure to attract and retain individuals making significant contributions could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.
We currently employ approximately 1,850 employees, of whom approximately 75 percent are employed in the U.S. Approximately 19 percent of our employees are represented by domestic (i.e., U.S.) labor unions under various collective bargaining agreements ("CBA"). We engage in negotiations with labor unions for new CBAs from time to time based upon expiration dates of agreements and statutory requirements. We consider our relationships with all salaried, union hourly and non-hourly employees to be positive and collaborative.
During the second quarter of 2021, at our Crossett, Arkansas Performance Chemicals' manufacturing facility, the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers Union ("IAM") AFL-CIO Local 1362 ratified a three-year CBA, which expires March 1, 2024. Further, in the second quarter of 2021, at our Covington, Virginia Performance Materials' manufacturing facility, the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (“IBEW”) AFL-CIO Local Union 464 ratified a four-year CBA which expires January 15, 2025.
In addition, at our Covington, Virginia Performance Materials' manufacturing facility, the CBA with the Covington Paper Workers Union, Affiliated with The Association of Western Pulp and Paper Workers (“AWPPW”) Local 675 expired on December 1, 2021. The Company and Covington AWPPW began contract negotiations in November 2021 and the parties continue to operate under the expired CBA while contract renewal discussions continue.
Diversity, Equity & Inclusion
 In 2021, we welcomed a new Chief Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Officer (CDEIO). Establishing the CDEIO role is an important step in our efforts to cultivate diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI), and a unique sense of belonging at the company, all of which enhance our ability to deliver on our mission to purify, protect and enhance the world. Incubating diverse talent will allow us to harness diverse insights that fuel innovation and create value for customers. 
Over the past year, we have ensured our community can live, learn and earn by increasing recruitment of diverse talent through diverse candidate slates, diverse interview teams and gender-neutral job descriptions. Our new diversity recruiting strategy is focused on ensuring everyone has an equitable experience, diversifying our talent pipeline through DEI programs and enhancing strategic diversity partnerships. We are partnering with organizations such as the National Society of Black Engineers (NSBE), National Black MBA Association, Society of Women Engineers (SWE), Society of Hispanic Engineers (SHPE), Society of Asian Scientist and Engineers (SASE), Corporate Gray with a focus on military recruiting and historically black colleges and universities to broaden our candidate pool.
A more diverse leadership continues to positively impact our growth and success. Today, our board of directors is 38 percent women and 13 percent racially and ethnically diverse, and our executive team is 29 percent women-led and 14 percent racially and ethnically diverse. Our Women’s Network employee resource group (ERG) served as a catalyst for building community, supporting personal and professional development, and strengthening our business impact internally and externally. We also recently launched two new ERGs in support of our Black and Hispanic employees. ERGs aim to foster a diverse, inclusive workplace by promoting a positive and inclusive employee experience.
Performance Management
We evaluate employee performance holistically, with a view that looks at the progress against goals and direct contributions of the employee and the level of impact they had on the business. These include key accomplishments that supported the team, our business, our customers and/or internal customers and behaviors that align with Ingevity's core values. In 2019, we launched a more modern approach to performance management, called Perform. This approach encourages collaborative partnerships and ongoing conversations between managers and employees to improve performance, meet goals, drive business results and increase employee engagement. Performance conversations often occur monthly or more frequently, and quality is monitored through frequent surveys. 
Health & Safety
Ingevity has a world-class safety program and a strong safety culture. Personal, process and public safety is a core value at Ingevity. We work hard to protect employees, contractors and the communities where we operate from injuries, illnesses and incidents through the design of safe operations, continuous improvement of personal and process safety performance, management systems and programs, a strong culture of compliance, and a commitment to zero harm to people and the environment.
In 2021, we continued our efforts to increase reporting of and response to near miss incidents to prevent more serious injuries before they could occur. This included efforts to increase the number of near misses reported and an increase in reporting by a broader number of employees. We also continued to improve safety training, further expanded the use of leading indicators to ensure effective initiatives are proactively implemented, and improved incident investigation quality to ensure contributing factors are appropriately identified and addressed. Employees were trained on the importance of our Life Saving Rules, put in place to prevent fatalities and serious injuries through leadership videos, monthly interactive training packages, and upgraded procedures, checklists, work permits and audits.
Segments
Performance Materials
We engineer, manufacture, and sell hardwood-based, chemically activated carbon products, which are produced through a highly technical and specialized process primarily for use in gasoline vapor emission control systems in cars, trucks, motorcycles, and boats. To maximize the productivity of our manufacturing assets, we also produce a number of other activated carbon products for food, water, beverage, and chemical purification applications.
Our automotive activated carbon products primarily take the form of granules, pellets and honeycomb "scrubbers", which are primarily utilized in vehicle-based gasoline vapor emission control systems to capture gasoline vapors that would otherwise be released into the atmosphere as volatile organic compounds. The captured gasoline vapors are largely purged from the activated carbon and re-directed to the engine where they are used as supplemental power for the vehicle. In this way, our automotive activated carbon products are part of a system that improves the environment and fuel efficiency. Performance Materials' net sales for 2021, 2020, and 2019 were $516.8 million, $510.0 million, and $490.6 million, respectively. The chart below reflects our 2021 Performance Materials' net sales by geography. Sales are assigned to geographic areas based on the location of the third party to which product was shipped.
Raw Materials and Production
Our Performance Materials segment serves customers globally from three manufacturing locations in the U.S. and two in China. The primary raw material (by volume) used in the manufacture of our activated carbon is hardwood sawdust. Sawdust is readily available and is sourced through multiple suppliers to protect against supply disruptions and to maintain competitive pricing.
We also utilize phosphoric acid, which is used to chemically activate the hardwood sawdust. This phosphoric acid is sourced through multiple suppliers to protect against supply disruptions and to maintain competitive pricing. The market price of phosphoric acid is affected by the global agriculture market as the majority of global phosphate rock production is used for fertilizer production and only a portion of that production is used to manufacture purified phosphoric acid.
Customers
We sell our automotive technologies products to approximately 80 customers around the globe. In 2021, our ten largest customers accounted for approximately 90 percent of sales. We are the trusted source of these products for many of the world’s largest automotive parts manufacturers, including BorgWarner Inc. (previously Delphi Technologies PLC), A. Kayser Automotive System GmbH, Korea Fuel-Tech Corporation, MAHLE GmbH, and many other large and small component manufacturers throughout the global automotive supply chain. Our process purification products are sold to approximately 90 customers globally. We sell our automotive technologies and process purification products primarily through our own direct sales force in North America, Europe, South America and Asia and also have a smaller, focused network of third-party distributors that have established a strong direct sales and marketing presence in North America and China.
Competition
Our competitors include Cabot Corp. (sold to One Equity Partners on Nov. 26, 2021), Kuraray Co., Ltd., and several domestic U.S. manufacturers and distributors of imported products and Chinese manufacturers. Ingevity has a decades-long track record of providing activated carbon that achieves life-of-vehicle emission standards. Given the imperative for automotive manufacturers to produce vehicles for the U.S., Canada, and China markets capable of meeting life-of-vehicle emission standards, or potentially face expensive recalls and unfavorable publicity, our automotive activated carbon products provide our customers the low-risk choice for this high performance application. Additionally, we are well-positioned to meet increasing emissions standards around the world.
Performance Chemicals
Ingevity’s Performance Chemicals segment is comprised of three product lines: pavement technologies, industrial specialties, and engineered polymers. Our products are utilized in warm mix paving, pavement preservation, pavement reconstruction and recycling, adhesives, agrochemical dispersants, lubricants, printing inks, coatings, resins, elastomers, bioplastics, medical devices, oil well service additives, oil production and downstream applications, and other diverse industrial uses. Our application expertise is often called upon by our customers to provide unique solutions that maximize resource efficiency. We have a broad and diverse customer base in this segment. In 2021, our top ten customers accounted for approximately 20 percent of our segment revenue, with the next 100 customers making up approximately 45 percent of our segment revenue. Performance Chemicals' net sales for 2021, 2020 and 2019 were $874.7 million, $706.1 million, and $802.3 million, respectively. The chart below reflects our 2021 Performance Chemicals' net sales by geography. Sales are assigned to geographic areas based on the location of the third party to which product was shipped.
Raw Materials and Production
Our Performance Chemicals segment serves customers globally from three manufacturing locations in the U.S. and one in the UK. Most of our pavement technologies, and industrial specialties products are derived from crude tall oil (CTO), a co-product of the kraft pulping process, where pine trees are used as the source of the pulp. We also produce products derived from lignin, which is extracted from black liquor, another co-product of the kraft pulping process. 
In 2016, we entered into a long-term supply agreement with WestRock pursuant to which we purchase all of the CTO and CTO equivalent tons of black liquor soap skimming ("BLSS"), the precursor to CTO, from WestRock's kraft mills as of such date, subject to certain exceptions. In 2018, we entered into a 20-year supply agreement with Georgia-Pacific LLC (“Georgia-Pacific”), pursuant to which we purchase the lesser of 125,000 tons of CTO and the aggregate output of CTO produced and originating at certain of Georgia-Pacific’s paper mills.
These relationships with WestRock and Georgia-Pacific are strategically important to our Performance Chemicals business due to the limited supply of CTO globally, of which we believe a significant portion is already under long-term supply agreements with other consumers of CTO. Under these agreements, we currently expect to source approximately 60 to 70 
percent of our CTO requirements through 2025 based on the maximum operating rates of our three Performance Chemicals' pine chemicals facilities. The remainder of our CTO needs are sourced through short-term contracts in the open market.
Our engineered polymers' products are caprolactone based, which is derived from cyclohexanone, a benzene derivative, and hydrogen peroxide, both of which are readily available in the market. We maintain multiple suppliers of cyclohexanone to protect against supply disruptions and to maintain competitive pricing. Our hydrogen peroxide is currently supplied by Solvay Interox Limited, a co-located supplier at our Warrington, UK facility under a long-term supply agreement. 
The other key raw materials used in the Performance Chemicals business are nonylphenol, pentaerythritol, and ethylene amines. These are sourced where possible through multiple suppliers to protect against supply disruptions and to maintain competitive pricing.
