ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
We are a clinical-stage pharmaceutical company striving to transform patient lives by developing innovative and differentiated prescription therapeutics for the treatment of autoimmune, inflammatory, and other debilitating diseases. Our pipeline combines several development-stage candidates and a cutting-edge platform with broad potential in autoimmune and inflammatory disorders with a potential best-in-class, late-stage program for the treatment of primary axillary hyperhidrosis. Our executive management team and board of directors bring extensive experience in product development and global commercialization, having served in leadership roles at large global pharmaceutical companies and biotechs that have developed and/or launched successful products, including several that were first-in-class and/or achieved iconic status, such as Cialis®, Taltz®, Gemzar®, Prozac®, Cymbalta®, and Juvederm®. Our strategy is to leverage this experience to in-license, acquire, develop, and commercialize innovative pharmaceutical products that we believe can meaningfully benefit patients who are suffering from chronic, debilitating diseases in the foregoing target disease areas and that are underserved by available therapies.
The following table summarizes our product development programs: 
Research & Development Programs
BBI-02: A Potential First-in-Class Oral DYRK1A Inhibitor for the Treatment of Autoimmune and Inflammatory Diseases 
On August 27, 2021, we entered into a License and Development Agreement (the “Voronoi License Agreement”) with Voronoi Inc. (“Voronoi”), pursuant to which we acquired exclusive, worldwide rights to research, develop, and commercialize BBI-02, a potential first-in-class oral DYRK1A inhibitor, and other novel DYRK1A therapeutics developed from Voronoi’s proprietary kinase inhibitor platform. These novel DYRK1A inhibitors aim to restore immune balance in patients whose immune system has become dysregulated. Based on the promising preclinical efficacy data generated to date with BBI-02, we believe these drug candidates have the potential to offer first-in-class, potent therapies to treat a wide array of debilitating autoimmune and inflammatory diseases.
Our lead development-stage program, BBI-02, is a Phase 1-ready, highly selective, and orally bioavailable DYRK1A inhibitor that has demonstrated promising results in various preclinical models, including atopic dermatitis (“AD”) and rheumatoid arthritis (“RA”). In these models, BBI-02 showed encouraging decreases in disease severity and reduction of pro-inflammatory cytokines compared to current standard-of-care agents, such as Janus kinase (“JAK”) inhibitors and anti-tumor necrosis factor (“TNF”) biologics. Notably, many current therapies for autoimmune disorders are broadly immunosuppressant, which may lead to severe side effects, such as increased infection risk. Preclinical data have shown BBI-02 to drive regulatory T-cell differentiation while dampening pro-inflammatory TH17 cells and MyD88/IRAK4-related signaling pathways. Regulatory T cells serve to maintain tolerance and keep the autoreactive, pro-inflammatory T cells in check, thus inhibiting autoimmune disease and limiting chronic inflammation. The myeloid differentiation primary response 88 (“MyD88”) protein is normally spliced into a long form and a short form. DYRK1A inhibition shifts the balance to produce more MyD88 short form, which leads to IRAK4, a protein kinase involved in signaling immune responses from toll-like receptors, not being phosphorylated and so appears to deactivate downstream cascades of certain pro-inflammatory cytokines. Based on current understanding, this inhibition of the release of excess cytokines can be achieved by re-establishing the role of MyD88 short form as a negative regulator of this pathway. Unlike many existing therapies, as well as those currently being investigated, BBI-02 may have the ability to target both the adaptive and innate immune imbalance simultaneously, potentially resulting in, or substantially achieving, restoration of immune homeostasis that, if proven, would represent a paradigm shift in the treatment of certain autoimmune and inflammatory diseases.
We are on track to progress BBI-02 into a Phase 1 clinical trial in Canada in the second quarter of 2022. This Phase 1 study is expected to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of BBI-02 in both healthy volunteers and subjects with AD and will include a preliminary assessment of efficacy. Part 1A of the Phase 1 trial will be a single ascending dose (“SAD”) assessment in healthy volunteers, Part 1B will be a multiple ascending dose (“MAD”) assessment in healthy volunteers, and Part 2 will compare BBI-02 to placebo in moderate-to-severe AD patients. Topline results from the Phase 1 SAD and MAD trials (Parts 1A and 1B) are anticipated year-end 2022. 
BBI-02 is covered by a composition of matter patent issued in the U.S., Japan, China, and other key countries through at least 2038, subject to patent term extensions and adjustments that may be available depending on how this early-stage asset is developed, as well as a pending Patent Cooperation Treaty (“PCT”) application, and other foreign and U.S. applications for BBI-02, as of the date of this Annual Report. 
BBI-10: A Covalent STING Inhibitor for the Potential Treatment of Autoinflammatory and Rare Genetic Diseases
On February 2, 2022, we entered into an Exclusive License Agreement (the “Carna License Agreement”) with Carna Biosciences, Inc. (“Carna”), pursuant to which we acquired exclusive, worldwide rights to research, develop, and commercialize Carna’s portfolio of novel Stimulator of Interferon Genes (“STING”) inhibitors. STING is a well-known mediator of innate immune responses. Excessive signaling through STING is linked to numerous high unmet need diseases, ranging from autoimmune disorders, such as systemic lupus erythematosus and RA, to interferonopathies, which are a set of rare genetic conditions characterized by interferon overproduction and could have orphan drug potential.
STING is a key component of the cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (“cGAS”)-STING pathway, which plays an important role in the activation of innate immunity. cGAS acts as a DNA sensor, detecting DNA from sources such as invading bacteria, viruses, and cellular debris that can arise from aging and tissue damage. Upon DNA binding, cGAS produces the secondary messenger molecule cyclic GMP-AMP (“cGAMP”), which binds to STING. STING then undergoes the post-translational modification called palmitoylation, a step essential to the activation of STING. Activated STING then in turn activates the recruitment of kinases that phosphorylate IRF3 and IκBα. Phosphorylated IRF3 leads to activation of the type I interferon response, while phosphorylated IκBα activates NFκB and increases the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6 and TNFα, resulting in 
inflammation. While the innate immune response is an important defense mechanism, a dysregulated type I interferon response and overproduction of pro-inflammatory cytokines also represents a driving cause for multiple autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. As such, targeting the cGAS-STING pathway may be a novel approach to treating these diseases. 
BBI-10, our lead early-stage STING inhibitor candidate, is a novel, potent, and orally available covalent STING inhibitor that specifically targets the palmitoylation site of STING, which allows it to inhibit both wild-type STING and gain-of-function mutants without competing with cGAMP binding, thus deactivating downstream signaling through IRF3 and IκBα and ultimately suppressing inflammation. BBI-10 has exhibited strong proof-of mechanism and a promising profile in initial pharmacokinetics, toxicology, and safety pharmacology studies. In addition, in vitro studies show that BBI-10 more potently blocks the STING pathway compared to other known STING palmitoylation inhibitors, and that mice treated with BBI-10 demonstrate significant decreases in pro-inflammatory cytokine production following stimulation of STING. Nonclinical development activities for BBI-10 are currently underway, and we expect to conduct experimental characterization of the STING inhibitor library throughout 2022.
For BBI-10, as of the date of this Annual Report, we currently have one pending PCT application and one pending priority patent application. We possess an exclusive license directed to a library of compounds targeting/inhibiting STING, pharmaceutical compositions containing the same, and methods of their use, which are being evaluated. 
Next-Generation Kinase Inhibitors: A Cutting-Edge Platform with Potential to Produce Treatments for Autoimmune, Inflammatory, and Other Debilitating Diseases
As part of the Voronoi License Agreement, in August 2021 we acquired exclusive global rights to a cutting-edge platform of next-generation kinase inhibitors, in addition to BBI-02. This library of new chemical entities includes next-generation DYRK1A inhibitors, as well as other molecules that specifically inhibit Leucine Rich Repeat Kinase 2 (“LRRK2”), TTK (also known as Monopolar spindle 1 (Mps1)), and CDC2-like kinase (“CLK”) kinases. A number of these drug candidates have the potential to penetrate the blood brain barrier, presenting an opportunity to address neuroinflammatory conditions of high unmet need such as Down Syndrome, Alzheimer’s Disease, and Parkinson’s Disease, while other peripherally acting novel LRRK2, TTK, and CLK kinase inhibitors could be developed in additional therapeutic areas within autoimmunity, inflammation, and oncology. We are currently engaged in research to identify both brain penetrant and non-brain penetrant new chemical entities from this next-generation kinase inhibitor platform.
Compounds from the next-generation kinase inhibitor platform are covered by U.S. and foreign composition of matter patent applications, as well as other applications, that are currently pending in global prosecution based on our exclusive license from Voronoi related to DYRK1A, LRRK2, TTK, and CLK kinases. 
Sofpironium Bromide: A Potential Best-in-Class Investigational Product for the Treatment of Primary Axillary Hyperhidrosis
Sofpironium bromide is a new chemical entity that belongs to a class of medications called anticholinergics. Anticholinergics block the action of acetylcholine, a chemical that transmits signals within the nervous system that are responsible for a range of bodily functions, including activation of the sweat glands. Sofpironium bromide was retrometabolically designed. Retrometabolic drugs are designed to exert their action locally and are potentially rapidly metabolized into a less active form once absorbed into the blood. We have developed sofpironium bromide gel, 15% as a potential best-in-class, self-administered, once daily, topical therapy for the treatment of primary axillary hyperhidrosis, also known as excessive underarm sweating. 
Hyperhidrosis is a debilitating, life-altering medical condition of sweating beyond what is physiologically required for thermoregulation of the body. Primary axillary hyperhidrosis is believed to be caused by an 
overactive cholinergic response of the sweat glands and affects an estimated 15.3 million, or 4.8%, of the U.S. population, and 12.76% of the population in Japan. According to a 2016 update on the prevalence and severity of hyperhidrosis in the U.S., axillary hyperhidrosis, which is the targeted first potential indication for sofpironium bromide, is the most common occurrence of hyperhidrosis, affecting approximately 65% of patients, or an estimated 10 million individuals, in the U.S.
Sofpironium bromide gel, 15% has completed a U.S. Phase 3 pivotal clinical program (also referred to as our “Cardigan Studies”) for the treatment of primary axillary hyperhidrosis, and sofpironium bromide gel, 5% is approved in Japan for the same indication under the brand name ECCLOCK®. Following a pre-NDA meeting with the FDA held in the first quarter of 2022, we remain on track to file an NDA for sofpironium bromide gel, 15% in mid-2022.
Given the significant cost to obtain FDA approval of an NDA and, if approved, to launch sofpironium bromide successfully in the U.S., we are presently evaluating different options that include: (i) commercializing sofpironium bromide alone; (ii) partnering with a contract sales organization that has an embedded sales force and other commercial capabilities in which to share costs and profits; or (iii) assigning/selling our rights to sofpironium bromide to another third party pharmaceutical company or investment entity to commercialize on its own. No decision on our strategic direction for sofpironium bromide has been finalized as of the date of this Annual Report.
As of December 31, 2021, regarding our patent portfolio for sofpironium bromide, we owned or possessed an exclusive license to 18 issued U.S. patents and 137 patents granted, registered, or allowed in foreign countries, including validations in member states of the European Patent Organisation. For sofpironium bromide, for the same time period, we owned or possessed an exclusive license to eight pending U.S. patent applications, 87 pending foreign patent applications, and two pending international patent applications to be nationalized in 2022, which, if issued, may provide patent term coverage to 2041 in certain cases and countries, and even further subject to availability of patent term extension or adjustments. We continue to prosecute pending applications for sofpironium bromide globally as of the date of this Annual Report. 
U.S. Phase 3 Pivotal Cardigan Studies
Our U.S. Phase 3 pivotal clinical program for sofpironium bromide gel, 15% was comprised of two pivotal clinical studies. The Cardigan I and Cardigan II studies enrolled 350 subjects and 351 subjects, respectively, who were nine years of age and older with primary axillary hyperhidrosis. The Cardigan Studies were multicenter, randomized, double-blinded, vehicle (placebo)-controlled, evaluating the efficacy and safety of topically applied sofpironium bromide gel, 15%. Subjects applied sofpironium bromide gel, 15% or placebo to their underarms once daily at bedtime for six consecutive weeks, with a two-week post-treatment follow-up. The co-primary efficacy endpoints of the Cardigan Studies included the proportion of subjects achieving at least a 2-point improvement on the Hyperhidrosis Disease Severity Measure-Axillary© (HSDM-Ax) scale, a proprietary and validated patient-reported outcome measure, and change in gravimetric sweat production (“GSP”), each from baseline to end of treatment (“EOT”). 
In October 2021, we reported positive topline results from both Cardigan Studies, which achieved statistical significance on all primary and secondary efficacy endpoints. In the Cardigan I and II Studies, sofpironium bromide gel, 15% was generally well-tolerated. 
Cardigan Studies Efficacy Results*
All primary and secondary efficacy endpoints demonstrated statistically significant differences between sofpironium bromide gel, 15% (SB) and vehicle (or placebo), as follows:

 | Cardigan I | | Cardigan II
Co-Primary Efficacy Endpoints | SB(n=173) | Vehicle(n=177) | p-value | SB(n=180) | Vehicle(n=171) | p-value
•Proportion of subjects achieving at least a 2-point improvement in the HDSM-Ax score from baseline to EOT | 49.3% | 29.4% | p<0.001 | 63.9% | 47.0% | p=0.003
•Change in GSP from baseline to EOT (in mg) | -129.5 | -99.3 | p=0.002 | -145.9 | -131.7 | p=0.030


 | Cardigan I | | Cardigan II

Cardigan Studies Safety Results 
In the Cardigan Studies, sofpironium bromide gel, 15% was generally well-tolerated. The Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (“TEAEs”) were mild or moderate in severity and transient in nature. Overall, 89% of patients who were randomized to sofpironium gel, 15% in the studies completed the full six weeks of treatment. Common adverse events (incidence ≥2%) observed in the sofpironium bromide gel, 15% treatment group in the Cardigan I and II studies were dry mouth (11.6%, 17.2%), blurred vision (5.2%, 11.7%), application site pain (6.4%, 10.0%), application site erythema (5.2%, 7.8%), mydriasis (7.5%, 5.0%), application site pruritis (6.4%, 2.2%), application site dermatitis (5.8%, 5.6%), urinary retention (1.2%, 3.3%), application site irritation (1.2%, 3.3%), dry eye (0.6%, 3.3%), headache (1.2%, 2.2%), constipation (0.6%, 2.2%) and urinary hesitation (0.6%, 2.2%), respectively. Five (2.9%) and nine (5.0%) subjects who received sofpironium bromide gel, 15%, discontinued the Cardigan I and II studies, respectively, due to a TEAE. No treatment-related serious adverse events were reported.
Collaboration with Kaken in Asia
Under our License, Development, and Commercialization Agreement with Kaken, dated March 31, 2015 (as amended, the “Kaken Agreement”), we and Kaken have completed multiple clinical trials of sofpironium bromide gel involving over 1,690 subjects in the U.S. and Japan. These trials evaluated the potential safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and efficacy of sofpironium bromide gel in adult and pediatric patients with primary axillary hyperhidrosis and healthy adult subjects. 
In September 2020, Kaken received regulatory approval in Japan to manufacture and market sofpironium bromide gel, 5% under the brand name ECCLOCK for the once-daily treatment of primary axillary hyperhidrosis. Japan is the first country to approve sofpironium bromide, which also marks the first approval of a topical prescription product for the treatment of primary axillary hyperhidrosis in Japan. This approval was based on the results of Kaken’s Japanese pivotal Phase 3 registration study of sofpironium bromide gel, 5% in 281 patients with primary axillary hyperhidrosis. 
In November 2020, Kaken launched commercial sales of ECCLOCK in Japan. This marked the first commercialization of sofpironium bromide for any indication worldwide. Under the Kaken Agreement, we are entitled to receive commercial milestone payments, as well as tiered royalties based on a percentage of net sales of ECCLOCK in Japan. As a result, beginning in the fourth quarter of 2020, we have recognized royalty revenue earned on a percentage of net sales of ECCLOCK in Japan. In addition to Japan, Kaken has rights to develop and commercialize sofpironium bromide in South Korea, China, and certain other Asian countries, and we are entitled to receive royalties based on a percentage of Kaken’s net sales in these countries.
Competition
Our industry is highly competitive and subject to rapid and significant change. While we believe that our team’s extensive pharmaceutical development and commercialization experience, scientific knowledge, and global industry relationships provide us with competitive advantages, we face competition from other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, specialty pharmaceutical companies, generic drug companies, over-the-counter (“OTC”) companies, academic institutions, government agencies, and research institutions. 
Many of our competitors have significantly greater financial, technical, and human resources than we do. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries may result in even more resources being concentrated amongst a smaller number of our competitors. Our success will be based in part on our ability to identify, develop, and manage a patented portfolio of product candidates that are safer and more effective than competing products.
Intellectual Property
Our success depends in large part upon our ability to secure proprietary protection for our products and technologies, including those in development, and to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others. We seek to avoid the latter by monitoring patents and publications that may affect our business, and to the extent we identify such threats, evaluate and take appropriate courses of action. 
Patents extend for varying periods according to the date of patent filing or grant, applicable laws allowing for patent term extension, and the legal term of patents in various countries where patent protection is obtained. The actual protection afforded by a patent can vary from country to country and depends on the type of patent, the scope of its coverage, and the availability of legal remedies in the country. 
We also intend to use regulatory exclusivity (also called data package exclusivity), or depending on eligibility, orphan drug designation, as a means of acquiring intellectual property protections that are separate and distinct to patents as appropriate for eligible pipeline candidates. These kinds of rights involve being given exclusivity for varying periods of time depending on the country to incentivize innovators who invest significant funds in and conduct clinical trials to produce necessary data to demonstrate a drug is safe and effective for its intended use(s) and, as such, the data package in an NDA for the FDA (or similar regulatory filings in other countries) should receive some degree of protection even if no patent is available, or exclusivity given to produce a treatment for a disease that otherwise would not realistically be invested in without such incentive. In addition, there are other forms of intellectual property protection we may seek worldwide, including but not limited to trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, pediatric exclusivity and the like, where available and appropriate for our business interests.
We further protect our proprietary information by requiring our directors, officers, employees, consultants, contractors, and other advisors to execute nondisclosure and assignment of invention agreements upon commencement of their respective employment or engagement. Agreements with our employees also prevent them from bringing the proprietary rights of third parties to our company without adequate permission to do so. In addition, we require confidentiality or service agreements from third parties that receive our confidential information or materials. 
We aim to take advantage of a broad range of the intellectual property rights that are available to us and believe that this comprehensive approach will provide us with proprietary exclusive positions for our product candidates, where available. 
In-Licensing and Other Agreements
Exclusive License and Development Agreement with Carna
On February 2, 2022, we entered into the Carna License Agreement with Carna, pursuant to which we acquired exclusive, worldwide rights to research, develop, and commercialize Carna’s portfolio of novel STING inhibitors. In accordance with the terms of the Carna License Agreement, in exchange for the licensed rights, we made a one-time cash payment of $2.0 million. 
The Carna License Agreement provides that we will make success-based payments to Carna of up to $258.0 million in the aggregate contingent upon achievement of specified development, regulatory, and commercial milestones. Further, the Carna License Agreement provides that we will pay Carna tiered royalty payments ranging from mid-single digits up to 10% of net sales. All of the contingent payments and royalties are payable in cash in U.S. Dollars. Under the terms of the Carna License Agreement, we will be responsible for, and bear the future costs of, all development and commercialization activities, including patenting, related to all the licensed compounds.
License and Development Agreement with Voronoi
On August 27, 2021, we entered into the Voronoi License Agreement with Voronoi, pursuant to which we acquired exclusive, worldwide rights to research, develop, and commercialize BBI-02, a novel, Phase 1-ready, potential first-in-class DYRK1A inhibitor, and other next-generation therapeutics developed from Voronoi’s proprietary kinase inhibitor platform. In accordance with the terms of the Voronoi License Agreement, in exchange for the license rights, we made a one-time payment of $2.5 million in cash and issued $2.0 million, or 2,816,901 shares, of our common stock to Voronoi.
With respect to BBI-02, the Voronoi License Agreement provides that we will make payments to Voronoi of up to $211.0 million in the aggregate contingent upon achievement of specified development, regulatory, and commercial milestones. With respect to the next-generation compounds arising from the novel kinase inhibitor platform, we will make payments to Voronoi of up to $107.5 million in the aggregate contingent upon achievement of specified development, regulatory, and commercial milestones. Further, the Voronoi License Agreement provides that we will pay Voronoi tiered royalty payments ranging from low-single digits up to 10% of net sales of products arising from the in-licensed DYRK1A inhibitor programs and next-generation kinase inhibitor platform. All of the contingent payments and royalties are payable in cash in U.S. Dollars, except for $1.0 million of the development and regulatory milestone payments, which amount is payable in equivalent shares of our common stock. Under the terms of the Voronoi License Agreement, we will be responsible for, and bear the future costs of, all development and commercialization activities, including patenting, related to all the licensed compounds.
Amended and Restated License Agreement with Bodor
In February 2020, we, together with Brickell Subsidiary and Bodor Laboratories, Inc. and Dr. Nicholas S. Bodor (collectively, “Bodor”) entered into an amended and restated license agreement (the “Amended and Restated License Agreement”), which supersedes the License Agreement, dated December 15, 2012, entered into between Brickell Subsidiary and Bodor, as amended by Amendment No. 1 to License Agreement, effective as of October 21, 2013, and Amendment No. 2 to License Agreement, effective as of March 31, 2015.
The Amended and Restated License Agreement retains with us a worldwide, exclusive license to develop, manufacture, market, sell, and sublicense products containing the proprietary compound sofpironium bromide based upon the patents referenced in the Amended and Restated License Agreement for a defined field of use. As of December 31, 2021, under the original License Agreement and the Amended and Restated License Agreement, we had remaining obligations to pay Bodor (i) a royalty on sales of product outside Kaken’s territory, including a low single-digit royalty on sales of certain product not covered by the patent estate licensed from Bodor; (ii) approximately 50 to 55% of all royalties we receive from Kaken for sales of product within its territory; (iii) a percentage of non-royalty sublicensing income we receive from Kaken or other sublicensees; and (iv) up to an aggregate of $0.8 million (plus an additional $0.1 million for approvals of additional products) in cash payments and $1.0 million of shares of our common stock upon the achievement of certain regulatory milestones. Under the terms of the Amended and Restated License Agreement, we made a $0.5 million milestone payment to Bodor following the closing of a public offering in June 2020 and accrued an additional $1.0 million related to our plan to initiate our U.S. Phase 3 pivotal program in the fourth quarter of 2020.
AnGes Collaboration Agreement
In September 2020, we entered into a collaboration agreement with AnGes, Inc. (“AnGes”) relating to the development and potential commercialization of AnGes’ proprietary investigational adjuvanted plasmid DNA vaccine intended to prevent COVID-19. While AnGes has conducted a Phase 1/2 study and a Phase 2/3 clinical study with its vaccine candidate in Japan, many other COVID-19 vaccines are already approved or have received emergency use authorization from regulatory authorities, and the demand for new vaccines may be limited. As a result, at this time, our agreement with AnGes is not a strategic priority for us.
Manufacturing and Supply
We currently contract with third parties for the manufacture of drug substances and drug products for use in nonclinical and clinical studies, and would expect to do so for any potential future commercial supply, and we intend to continue to do so in the future. To our knowledge, all of our clinical drug substance and drug product manufacturing activities are in compliance with current good manufacturing practice (“cGMP”) and other applicable laws. We have assembled a team of experienced employees and consultants to provide the necessary technical, quality, and regulatory oversight over the contract manufacturing organizations (“CMOs”) with which we contract. We rely on third-party cGMP manufacturers for scale-up and process development work and to produce sufficient quantities of development product candidates for use in nonclinical and clinical studies. 
Government Regulation
FDA Drug Approval Process
In the U.S., prescription human drugs are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and other federal and state statutes and regulations govern, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, storage, recordkeeping, approval, labeling, advertising, promotion and marketing, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, sampling and import and export of pharmaceutical products, which apply to our pipeline of products. Failure to comply with applicable U.S. 
requirements may subject a company to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as FDA refusal to approve pending NDAs, warning or untitled letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, civil penalties, corporate integrity agreements, and criminal prosecution. 
Pharmaceutical product development for a new product or certain changes to an approved product in the U.S. typically involves nonclinical laboratory and animal tests, the submission to the FDA of an Investigational New Drug Exemption (“IND”), which must become effective before clinical testing may commence, and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to establish the safety and effectiveness of the drug for each indication for which FDA approval is sought. In addition, other tests on the chemistry, manufacturing, and controls (“CMC”) of producing the drug and its various formulations to establish the shelf life, stability, storage conditions, and quality parameters and specifications must be conducted, submitted, and approved by the FDA. 
Satisfaction of FDA pre-market approval requirements typically takes many years at significant cost and the actual time required may vary substantially based upon the type, complexity, and novelty of the product or disease. Nonclinical tests include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, formulation, and toxicity, as well as animal trials to assess the characteristics and potential safety and efficacy of the product. The conduct of the nonclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements, including current good laboratory practice (“GLP”) regulation. The results of nonclinical testing are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND along with other information, including information about product CMC described above and a proposed clinical trial protocol. Long-term nonclinical tests, such as animal tests of reproductive toxicity and carcinogenicity, may continue after the IND is submitted. 
A 30-day waiting period after the submission of each IND is required prior to the commencement of clinical testing in humans. If the FDA has neither commented on nor questioned the IND within this 30-day period, the IND is considered in effect, and the clinical trial proposed in the IND may begin. 
Clinical trials involve the initial administration of the investigational new drug to healthy subjects or patients, with subsequent trials involving patients with the disease or disorder for which the investigational drug is being studied to treat, all under the supervision of qualified physician investigator(s). Clinical trials must be conducted (1) in compliance with federal and state regulations; (2) in compliance with current good clinical practice (“cGCP”) regulations, an international standard (as adopted by FDA) meant to protect the rights and health of patients and to define the roles of clinical trial sponsors, administrators, and monitors; and (3) under protocols detailing the objectives of the trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated as well as the actual primary and secondary endpoints of the study to be evaluated. Each protocol involving testing on U.S. patients and subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. 
The FDA may order the temporary, or permanent, discontinuation of a clinical trial at any time, or impose other sanctions, if it believes that the clinical trial either is not being conducted in accordance with FDA requirements or presents an unacceptable risk to the clinical trial participants. The study protocol and informed consent information for patients in clinical trials must also be submitted to a local or central institutional review board (“IRB”) (outside the U.S., these are called Ethics Committees) for approval and oversight. An IRB may also require the clinical trial at the site to be halted, either temporarily or permanently, for failure to comply with the IRB’s requirements, or may impose other conditions. 
Clinical trials to support NDAs for marketing approval are typically conducted in three sequential phases, but the phases may overlap or in rarer cases early phases may be skipped depending on the amount and quality of data that exists. In Phase 1, the initial introduction of the drug into healthy human subjects or patients, the drug is tested to assess pharmacological actions, metabolism, pharmacokinetics, adverse effects associated with administration of the investigational drug and, if possible, early evidence of effectiveness. Phase 2 usually involves trials in a limited patient population to determine the effectiveness of the drug for a particular 
indication, dosage tolerance, and optimum dosage, and to identify common adverse effects and safety risks. If a compound demonstrates evidence of effectiveness and an acceptable safety profile in Phase 2 evaluations, Phase 3 clinical trials are undertaken to obtain the additional information about clinical efficacy and safety in a larger number of patients with the targeted disease or disorder, typically at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, to permit the FDA to evaluate the overall benefit-risk relationship of the drug and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the drug. In most cases, the FDA requires two adequate and well-controlled prospective Phase 3 clinical trials with statistically significant results to demonstrate the efficacy of the drug by comparing a treatment arm against a control (placebo or best supportive care) arm. A single Phase 3 clinical trial with other confirmatory evidence may be sufficient in limited instances for FDA registration where the study is a large multicenter trial demonstrating internal consistency and a statistically very persuasive finding of an effect on mortality, irreversible morbidity, or prevention of a disease with a potentially serious outcome and confirmation of the result in a second trial would be practically impossible or ethically problematic. 
After completion of required clinical testing, applicable law requires that an NDA be prepared and submitted to the FDA. We have completed all FDA-required clinical trials of sofpironium bromide for the treatment of primary axillary hyperhidrosis that are expected to be part of an NDA submission by us to the FDA. In the first quarter of 2022, we held a pre-NDA meeting with the FDA, in which we discussed our plans for the content and organization of the NDA. The FDA provided comments and recommendations on the data to be included in the NDA. We agreed with the FDA’s suggestions and are on track to file an NDA for sofpironium bromide in mid-2022 consistent with the outcome of the pre-NDA meeting.
FDA approval of an NDA is required before marketing of the product may begin in the U.S., which will be the case for sofpironium bromide, as well for any other pipeline products being developed by us. The NDA must include the results of all nonclinical, clinical, and other testing and a compilation of data relating to the product’s efficacy, safety, quality, and manufacturing. The cost of preparing and submitting an NDA is substantial. The submission of most NDAs is additionally subject to a substantial application user fee, and the manufacturer and sponsor under an approved NDA are also subject to annual product and establishment user fees. These fees are typically increased annually. In the case of sofpironium bromide, payment of a user fee is not expected to be required for filing of an initial NDA, because FDA guidance waives, or reduces, user fees for, among other things, a small business applicant, like us, submitting its first NDA. 
The FDA has 60 calendar days from its receipt of an NDA submission to determine whether the application will be accepted for filing based on the agency’s threshold determination that it is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review. The FDA has agreed with Congress to certain performance goals in the review of NDAs. Priority review can be applied to drugs that treat a serious condition and, if approved, would provide a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness. In addition, the FDA provides an accelerated approval mechanism applied to investigational drugs for serious or life-threatening diseases. Sofpironium bromide is not eligible for priority review or accelerated approval, based on the present criteria. The review process for both standard and priority review may be extended by the FDA for three additional months to consider certain late-submitted information, or information intended to clarify information already provided in the submission. 
The FDA also may refer applications for novel drug products, or drug products that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy, to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes independent clinicians and other experts in the targeted disease, for review, evaluation, and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it generally follows such recommendations. It is not known at this time whether the FDA will require an advisory committee for review of any NDA that may be submitted for sofpironium bromide, and that decision will be made by the FDA during the NDA review. 
Before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more of the sponsor’s clinical sites to assure compliance with cGCPs. Additionally, the FDA will generally inspect the facility or the facilities at which the 
drug is manufactured. As of the date of this Annual Report, it is not known what, if any, inspections the FDA may require related to the NDA for sofpironium bromide. The FDA will not approve an investigational product unless compliance with cGMP is satisfactory and the NDA contains data sufficient to support the labeled shelf life and to demonstrate that the drug can be manufactured reliably in a stable, controlled manner.
After the FDA evaluates the NDA and potentially the manufacturing facilities, it issues either an approval letter or a complete response letter. A complete response letter generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing, or information in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. If, or when, those deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA’s satisfaction in a resubmission of the NDA, the FDA will issue an approval letter. The FDA has committed to reviewing such resubmissions in two or six months depending on the type of information required. 
An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug in the U.S. with specific prescribing information for specific indications and may contain certain post-marketing requirements, including additional surveillance of how the drug is used. The approval letter may contain safety information that limits the ability of the drug to be marketed (e.g., black box warning; although these are not expected for sofpironium bromide) or contains contraindications, warnings, and/or precautions that limit the potential of the drug’s desirability (these are standard for most approved drugs). As another potential condition of NDA approval, the FDA may require a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (“REMS”) for drugs that are effective but also have potentially significant safety concerns. REMS can include medication guides, communication plans for healthcare professionals, and elements to assure safe use (“ETASU”). ETASU can include, but are not limited to, special training or certification for prescribing or dispensing, dispensing only under certain circumstances, special monitoring, and the use of patient registries. The requirement for a REMS can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the drug. At the pre-NDA meeting held in the first quarter of 2022, the FDA stated that the need for a REMS is unlikely but a final decision will be made during the NDA review. As stated, product approval may require post-approval testing and surveillance to monitor the drug’s safety or efficacy, which could be substantial. Once granted, product approvals may be withdrawn if compliance by the drug’s sponsor with regulatory standards is not maintained or problems are identified following initial marketing and/or manufacturing by the sponsor or in how the drug is being used in the marketplace.
Changes to some of the conditions established in an approved application, including changes in indications, labeling, or manufacturing processes or facilities, require submission and FDA approval of a new NDA or NDA supplement before the change can be implemented. Also, an NDA supplement for a new indication typically requires clinical data similar to that in the original application, and the FDA uses the same procedures and actions in reviewing NDA supplements as it does in reviewing NDAs.
Post-Approval Requirements
Once an NDA is approved, a product will be subject to certain post-approval requirements. For instance, the FDA closely regulates, in part, the post-approval marketing and promotion of drugs, including standards and regulations for direct-to-consumer advertising, social media, off-label promotion, formulary and reimbursement presentations, product sampling, sales force activities including dissemination of peer-reviewed journal articles, marketing items and detailing practices with prescribers, health care practitioner interactions, industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities, other promotional activities involving the internet and to certain other press, publicity and media communications initiated by us, while other parts of the government regulate, among other things, against false claims, foreign corrupt practices, trade sanctions, and anti-kickbacks. States often impose strict legal requirements and prohibitions on a variety of post-approval drug marketing practices. We may market drugs holding an approved NDA only for the permitted indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved labeling. 
Adverse event reporting, pharmacovigilance, and submission of periodic reports are required of the NDA holder following FDA approval of that NDA. The FDA also may require post-marketing testing, known as Phase 4 
testing, the aforementioned REMS, and/or surveillance to monitor the effects of an approved product, or the FDA may place conditions on an approval that could restrict the distribution or use of the product, especially in the U.S. In addition, quality-control, drug manufacture, packaging, and labeling procedures must continue to conform to cGMPs after approval. Drug manufacturers and certain of their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies. Registration with the FDA subjects entities to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA, during which the agency inspects manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with cGMPs. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the areas of production and quality-control to maintain compliance with cGMPs or risk being sanctioned by the FDA from supplying the drugs they manufacture or facing partial or complete product recalls. Regulatory authorities may withdraw product approvals or request such product recalls if a company fails to comply with applicable regulatory standards, if we encounter problems following initial marketing and supply, or if previously unrecognized problems with the drug being prescribed subsequently are discovered. 
The Hatch-Waxman Act
In seeking approval for a drug through an NDA, applicants are required to list with the FDA each eligible patent whose claims cover the applicant’s product. Upon approval of a drug, each of the patents listed in the application for the drug is then published in the FDA’s Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations, commonly known as the “Orange Book.” Drugs listed in the Orange Book can, in turn, be cited by potential generic competitors in support of approval of an abbreviated new drug application (“ANDA”). An ANDA provides for marketing of a drug product that has the same active ingredients in the same strengths and dosage form as the listed drug and has been shown through bioequivalence testing to be therapeutically equivalent to the listed drug. Other than the requirement for bioequivalence testing, ANDA applicants are not required to conduct, or submit results of, nonclinical or clinical studies to prove the safety or effectiveness of their drug product. Drugs approved in this way are commonly referred to as “generic equivalents” to the listed drug and can often be substituted by pharmacists under prescriptions written for the original listed drug and may be required to be switched to from the original listed drug by certain laws or insurance and formulary practices, which can affect the profitability of the original listed drug adversely. 
To proceed forward, the ANDA applicant is required to certify to the FDA concerning any patents listed for the approved product in the FDA’s Orange Book. Specifically, the applicant must certify either that (1) the required patent information has not been filed; (2) the listed patent has expired; (3) the listed patent has not expired, but will expire on a particular date and approval is sought after patent expiration; or (4) the listed patent is invalid or will not be infringed by the new product. The ANDA applicant also may elect to submit a section viii statement certifying that its proposed ANDA label does not contain (or carves out) any language regarding the patented method-of-use rather than certify to a listed method-of-use patent. If the applicant does not challenge the listed patents, the ANDA will not be approved until all the listed patents, if valid, claiming the referenced product expire. 
A certification that the new product will not infringe the already approved product’s listed patents, or that such patents are invalid, is called a Paragraph IV certification. If the ANDA applicant has provided a Paragraph IV certification to the FDA, the applicant must also send notice of the Paragraph IV certification to the NDA and patent holders once the ANDA has been accepted for filing by the FDA. The NDA and patent holders may then commence a patent infringement lawsuit in response to the notice of the Paragraph IV certification. The filing of a patent infringement lawsuit within 45 calendar days of the receipt of a Paragraph IV certification automatically prevents the FDA from approving the ANDA until the earlier of (i) 30 months; (ii) expiration of the patent; (iii) settlement of the lawsuit; or (iv) a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the ANDA applicant. 
The ANDA also will not be approved until any applicable non-patent exclusivity listed in the Orange Book for the referenced product expires.
It is not known at this time whether and to what extent, or when, an ANDA applicant may emerge with respect to sofpironium bromide, or any other pipeline product in our portfolio, nor have the patents that will be listed in the NDA for sofpironium bromide and later the Orange Book been fully decided or evolved to date. 
Regulatory Exclusivity
Upon NDA approval of a new chemical entity (“NCE”), which is a drug that contains no active molecule that has been approved by the FDA in any other NDA, that drug receives five years of marketing exclusivity in the U.S. during which the FDA cannot receive any ANDA seeking approval of a generic version of that drug. Certain changes to a drug, such as the addition of a new indication to the package insert, are associated with a three-year period of exclusivity during which the FDA cannot approve an ANDA for a generic drug that includes the change. Other countries may, and do, have different periods for regulatory exclusivity.
An ANDA may be submitted one year before NCE exclusivity expires if a Paragraph IV certification is filed. If there is no listed patent in the Orange Book, there may not be a Paragraph IV certification and, thus, no ANDA may be filed before the expiration of the exclusivity period; however, it is expected that the NDA for sofpironium bromide will list one or more patents.
Patent Term Extension
After NDA approval, owners of relevant drug patents may apply for up to a five-year patent term extension in the U.S. The allowable patent term extension is calculated as half of the drug’s testing phase, the time between IND application and NDA submission, and all of the review phase, the time between NDA submission and approval, up to a maximum of five years. Only one patent may be extended for a regulatory review period for any product. If more than one application for extension of the same patent is filed, the certificate of extension of patent term, if appropriate, will be issued based upon the first filed application for extension. The time can be shortened if the FDA determines that the applicant did not pursue approval with due diligence. The total patent term after the extension may not exceed 14 years. 
For patents that might expire during the application phase, the patent owner may request an interim patent extension. An interim patent extension increases the patent term by one year and may be renewed up to four times. For each interim patent extension granted, the post-approval patent extension is reduced by one year. The director of the USPTO must determine that approval of the drug covered by the patent for which a patent extension is being sought is likely. Interim patent extensions are not available for a drug for which an NDA has not been submitted.
It is premature to know what, and if any, patent term extension that may be allowed in the U.S. would be at this time, or which patent an extension may be triggered from.
Pediatric Information
Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, NDAs or supplements to NDAs must contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of the investigational drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration in each pediatric subpopulation for which the drug is safe and effective. The FDA may grant full or partial waivers, or deferrals, for submission of data. 
The Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act (“BPCA”) provides NDA holders a six-month extension of any exclusivity, patent or non-patent, for a drug if certain conditions are met. Conditions for exclusivity include the FDA’s determination that information relating to the use of a new drug in the pediatric population may produce health benefits in that population, the FDA making a written request for pediatric studies, and the applicant agreeing to perform, and report on, the requested studies within the statutory timeframe. We are expected to see if we can obtain additional exclusivity based on the pediatric data it obtained and application of the BPCA.
Disclosure of Clinical Trial Information
Sponsors of clinical trials of FDA-regulated products, including drugs, are required to register and disclose certain clinical trial information, including when a clinical trial is initiated (often on www.clintrials.gov); information for certain Company studies, including several involving sofpironium bromide, can be accessed at this website. Information related to the product, patient population, phase, type and scope of investigation, study sites and investigators, and other aspects of the clinical trial is then made public as part of the registration process. Sponsors are obligated also to discuss the results of their clinical trials after completion and industry trade association ethics guidelines require publication of both favorable and unfavorable study results, which can affect the potential market for a drug. Disclosure of the results of these trials can be delayed until the new product or new indication being studied has been approved. Competitors may use this publicly available information to gain knowledge regarding the progress and intent of development programs. 
Regulation Outside of the U.S.
In addition to regulations in the U.S., we will be subject to regulations of other countries governing any clinical trials and commercial sales and distribution of our product candidates, as well as extent, scope, and enforceability of intellectual property rights associated with the product candidate introduced in these other countries. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we, or our local partners, must obtain approval by the comparable regulatory authorities of countries outside of the U.S. before it can commence clinical trials in such countries and approval of the regulators of such countries or economic areas, such as the European Union, before we may market products in those countries or areas. Certain countries outside of the U.S. have a process similar to the FDA’s that requires the submission of a clinical trial application (“CTA”), much like the IND prior to the commencement of human clinical trials. In the European Union, for example, a CTA must be submitted to each country’s national health authority and an independent ethics committee, much like the FDA and IRB, respectively. Once the CTA is approved in accordance with a country’s requirements, clinical trial development may proceed. The approval process and requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing, and reimbursement vary greatly from place to place, and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval. In some cases, once the investigational drug is approved by a regulatory agency in certain established markets, like the FDA in the U.S., other countries will allow a sponsor to rely on that other country’s approval and extend it, with the same terms and conditions, in the foreign country and this may accelerate the introduction of the drug in foreign markets, where applicable (often called a free sales certificate (“FSC”), or also a CPP, process). 
Under European Union regulatory systems, a company may submit marketing authorization applications either under a centralized or decentralized procedure. The centralized procedure, which is compulsory for medicines produced by biotechnology or those medicines intended to treat AIDS, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, or diabetes and is optional for those medicines which are highly innovative, provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization that is valid for all European Union member states. The decentralized procedure provides for mutual recognition of national approval decisions. Under this procedure, the holder of a national marketing authorization may submit an application to the remaining member states. Within 90 calendar days of receiving the applications and assessments report, each member state must decide whether to recognize the national marketing authorization of a different member state.
As of the date of this Annual Report, there is only one regulatory submission pending outside the U.S. for any of our pipeline products, which is for BBI-02.
Anti-Kickback, False Claims Laws
In addition to FDA restrictions on marketing of pharmaceutical products, several other types of state and federal laws in the U.S. have been applied to restrict or prohibit certain marketing practices in the pharmaceutical industry. These laws include, among others, anti-kickback statutes, false claims statutes and other statutes 
pertaining to healthcare fraud and abuse, and anticorruption. The federal healthcare program anti-kickback statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting, or receiving remuneration to induce, or in return for, purchasing, leasing, ordering, or arranging for the purchase, lease or order of any healthcare item or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid, or other federally financed healthcare programs. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended (“PPACA”), amended the intent element of the federal anti-kickback statute so that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it. This statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on the one hand and prescribers, purchasers, and formulary managers on the other. Although there are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting certain common activities from prosecution or other regulatory sanctions, the exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly, and practices that involve remuneration intended to induce prescribing, purchases or recommendations may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exception or safe harbor. 
Federal false claims laws prohibit any person or entity from, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to the federal government, or knowingly making, or causing to be made, a false statement to have a false claim paid. This includes claims made to programs where the federal government reimburses, such as Medicaid, as well as programs where the federal government is a direct purchaser, such as when it purchases off the Federal Supply Schedule. Pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have been prosecuted under these laws for, among other things, allegedly inflating drug prices they report to pricing services, which in turn were used by the government to set Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement rates, and for allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product. In addition, certain marketing practices, including off-label promotion, also may violate federal false claims laws. Additionally, PPACA amended the federal healthcare program anti-kickback statute such that a violation of that statute can serve as a basis for liability under certain federal false claims laws. 
The majority of U.S. states also have statutes or regulations similar to the federal anti-kickback law and false claims laws, which apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payor. 
Other federal statutes pertaining to healthcare fraud and abuse include the civil monetary penalties statute, which prohibits, among other things, the offer or payment of remuneration to a Medicaid or Medicare beneficiary that the offeror or payor knows or should know is likely to influence the beneficiary to order or receive a reimbursable item or service from a particular supplier, and the healthcare fraud and false statements statutes, which prohibit, among other things, knowingly and willfully executing or attempting to execute a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or obtain by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, or promises any money or property owned by or under the control of any healthcare benefit program in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items, or services. 
Violations of these federal healthcare fraud and abuse laws are punishable in the U.S. by imprisonment, criminal fines, civil monetary penalties, and exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs. 
Other Federal and State Regulatory Requirements 
Under the Open Payments Rule, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services requires certain manufacturers of prescription drugs to annually collect and report information on payments or transfers of value to certain health care professionals, including physicians, and teaching hospitals, as well as certain ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Failure to submit required information may result in civil monetary penalties. Other countries require similar reporting, including France and Belgium, if the product is approved and marketed there. In addition, several states now require prescription drug companies to report expenses relating to the marketing and promotion of drug products and to report gifts and payments to individual healthcare practitioners and entities in these states. Other states prohibit various 
other marketing-related activities. Still, other states require the posting of information relating to clinical studies and their outcomes. In addition, California, Connecticut, Nevada, and Massachusetts require pharmaceutical companies to implement compliance programs and marketing codes. Several additional states are considering similar proposals. Some of the state laws are broader in scope than federal laws. Compliance with these laws is difficult and time-consuming, and companies that do not comply with these state laws face civil or other penalties. 
Coverage and Reimbursement
Sales of our product candidates, if approved, by us or any potential commercial partners will depend, in part, on the extent to which such products will be covered by third-party payors, such as government healthcare programs, commercial insurance, and managed healthcare organizations. These third-party payors are increasingly limiting coverage or reducing reimbursements for medical products and services. Patients are unlikely to use our products unless coverage is provided and reimbursement is adequate to cover a significant portion of the cost of our products. Sales of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale will therefore depend, in part, on the availability of coverage and adequate reimbursement from third-party payors. Third-party payors include government authorities, managed care plans, private health insurers, and other organizations.
The process for determining whether a third-party payor will provide coverage for a drug typically is separate from the process for setting the price of such product or for establishing the reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the product once coverage is approved. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific products on an approved list, also known as a formulary, which might not include all of the FDA-approved products for a particular indication. A decision by a third-party payor not to cover our product candidates could reduce a physician’s willingness to prescribe our products once approved and have a material adverse effect on our sales, results of operations, and financial condition. Moreover, a third-party payor’s decision to provide coverage for a drug does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development. Additionally, coverage and reimbursement for products can differ significantly from payor to payor. One third-party payor’s decision to cover a particular medical product or service does not ensure that other payors will also provide coverage for the medical product or service or will provide coverage at an adequate reimbursement rate.
In addition, the U.S. government, state legislatures, and foreign governments have continued implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement, and requirements for substitution of generic products. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit our net revenue and results. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services, examining the medical necessity and reviewing the cost-effectiveness of drugs, in addition to questioning safety and efficacy. If these third-party payors do not consider our products to be cost-effective compared to other available therapies, they may not cover our products after FDA approval or, if they do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow us to sell our products at a profit.
