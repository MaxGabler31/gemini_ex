Item 1. Business
Overview
We are a clinical-stage healthcare company focused on developing and commercializing innovative therapies for women’s health and prostate cancer. Our lead product candidate is relugolix, an oral, once-daily, small molecule that acts as a gonadotropin-releasing hormone, or GnRH, receptor antagonist that is currently being evaluated in multiple Phase 3 clinical trials across three distinct indications. We are advancing relugolix 40 mg in combination with low-dose estradiol and a progestin for the treatment of heavy menstrual bleeding associated with uterine fibroids and for pain associated with endometriosis, and relugolix 120 mg as a monotherapy for advanced prostate cancer. In addition, we are developing MVT-602, an oligopeptide kisspeptin-1 receptor agonist, for the treatment of female infertility as part of assisted reproduction. Both relugolix and MVT-602 were licensed to us by Takeda Pharmaceuticals International AG, or Takeda, in April 2016. 
Since our inception, we have devoted substantially all of our efforts to identifying and in-licensing our product candidates, organizing and staffing our company, raising capital, preparing for and advancing the clinical development of our product candidates and preparing for potential future regulatory approvals and commercialization of relugolix.
On May 14, 2019, we announced that LIBERTY 1, the first of two Phase 3 studies of once daily relugolix combination therapy in women with uterine fibroids and heavy menstrual bleeding, met its primary efficacy endpoint and six key secondary endpoints. Relugolix combination therapy maintained bone mineral density at levels comparable to placebo over 24 weeks and was generally well tolerated. 
In the primary endpoint analysis, 73.4% of women receiving once daily oral relugolix combination therapy (relugolix 40 mg plus estradiol 1.0 mg and norethindrone acetate 0.5 mg) achieved the responder criteria compared with 18.9% of women receiving placebo (p < 0.0001). A response was defined as a menstrual blood loss volume of less than 80 mL and a 50 percent or greater reduction from baseline in menstrual blood loss volume during the last 35 days of the 24-week treatment period measured using the alkaline hematin method. On average, women receiving relugolix combination therapy experienced an 84.3% reduction in menstrual blood loss from baseline, a clinically relevant secondary endpoint.
These data represent a top-line analysis of the results of the LIBERTY 1 study.  Further review of the underlying data by Myovant is ongoing and may result in additional observations with respect to the study. We expect to submit data from LIBERTY 1 for presentation and publication in 2019.
We further expect to announce top-line results from four additional Phase 3 clinical trials over the next three quarters.

• | maximize the commercial potential of our product candidates.

Relugolix
We are currently developing relugolix in three target indications: heavy menstrual bleeding associated with uterine fibroids; pain associated with endometriosis; and advanced prostate cancer. Relugolix is an oral, once-daily, small molecule that acts as a GnRH receptor antagonist that binds to and inhibits GnRH receptors in the anterior pituitary gland. Inhibition of GnRH receptors decreases the release of gonadotropins (luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone), thereby decreasing the downstream production of estrogen and progesterone by the ovaries in women and testosterone by the testes in men. 
As a GnRH receptor antagonist, relugolix has a clinically-validated mechanism of action in each of our three target indications. Lowering estrogen and progesterone levels has previously been demonstrated to effectively decrease heavy menstrual bleeding in women with uterine fibroids and to reduce the pelvic pain associated with endometriosis. We are developing relugolix, 40 mg in combination with estradiol (1.0 mg) and a progestin (norethindrone acetate, 0.5 mg) administered orally once a day, with the goal of optimizing estradiol levels to maximize the benefit of relugolix on symptoms of uterine fibroids and endometriosis, while maintaining bone health and mitigating side effects from a low-estrogen state such as vasomotor symptoms. We expect to launch in our women’s health indications with a single-tablet regimen of relugolix, 40 mg in combination with estradiol (1.0 mg) and a progestin (norethindrone acetate, 0.5 mg) administered orally once day. We believe our combination approach with relugolix has the potential to have a better safety and tolerability profile than the currently approved GnRH agonist therapies and has the potential to be used longer-term. The goal of this longer-term treatment is to provide women with uterine fibroids and endometriosis a medical alternative to hysterectomy and other invasive procedures often recommended to treat these conditions. If we are unsuccessful in our attempts to formulate a fixed-dose combination in time for the initial application for marketing authorization in the United States, or U.S., we expect to seek approval for relugolix tablets co-packaged with a commercially available tablet containing both the low-dose estradiol and norethindrone acetate. 
Decreasing testosterone slows the growth and progression of advanced prostate cancer, such as when the disease recurs or the prostate-specific antigen, or PSA, is rising following prostatectomy or radiation therapy. Relugolix monotherapy is in Phase 3 clinical evaluation as a once daily oral treatment to lower testosterone. It is being evaluated at a three-times higher dose in men with advanced prostate cancer than the women’s health indications (120 mg orally once daily following a single 360 mg loading dose compared to 40 mg). We are developing our women’s health relugolix combination and our advanced prostate cancer relugolix monotherapy treatments with the potential of bringing to market two distinct branded products. 
Myovant Sciences GmbH, our wholly-owned subsidiary, holds global commercial rights to relugolix, excluding Japan, China, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Korea, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand, and Vietnam, including the territories and possessions of each of the foregoing. In May 2018, Takeda announced that it had entered into a license agreement granting ASKA Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. exclusive commercialization rights to relugolix for uterine fibroids and exclusive development and commercialization rights to relugolix for endometriosis, in each indication in Japan, and in January 2019 Takeda and ASKA Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. announced that Takeda obtained marketing authorization in Japan for Relumina® Tablets 40 mg (generic name: relugolix) for the improvement of symptoms of uterine fibroids including heavy menstrual bleeding, lower abdominal pain, lower back pain, and anemia. 
Uterine Fibroids
Uterine fibroids are noncancerous tumors that develop in or on the muscular walls of the uterus and are among the most common reproductive tract tumors in women. In addition to an individual’s genetic predisposition, estrogens are well known to play an important role in the regulation of fibroid growth. Although uterine fibroids are benign tumors, they can cause debilitating symptoms such as abnormal uterine bleeding, heavy or painful periods, anemia, abdominal pain, backache, increased abdominal girth and bloating, urinary frequency or retention, constipation or painful defecation, pregnancy loss, painful intercourse and, in some cases, infertility. These symptoms can also lead to loss of productivity at work, limitations in normal activities of daily living, and social embarrassment.
We estimate approximately 19 million women in the U.S. have uterine fibroids. Of those, approximately five million women are estimated to suffer from symptoms of uterine fibroids, approximately three million of whom are inadequately treated by current medical therapy and require further treatment. 
7

The current approach to treating uterine fibroids includes both medical and surgical options. The recommended treatment for a given patient is dependent on factors such as the patient’s desire to become pregnant in the future, the importance of uterine preservation, symptom severity, and tumor characteristics. Medical options include oral contraceptives, tranexamic acid, and GnRH agonists. The current standard of care for the treatment of patients with mild symptoms includes the use of oral contraceptives or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or NSAIDs, which are generally prescribed at the time of initial diagnosis. These therapeutic options, however, often do not provide sufficient relief to the many patients with more moderate-to-severe symptoms. These women require additional treatment to relieve excessive bleeding and pain. Tranexamic acid, an antifibrinolytic agent, is approved for use to treat heavy menstrual bleeding. GnRH agonists are used for short-term therapy and may involve low-dose estradiol and progestin hormonal combination therapy to mitigate the side effect of bone mineral density loss and reduce vasomotor symptoms generally associated with GnRH agonists. Other invasive procedures such as endometrial ablation and uterine artery embolization may also be tried. Surgical intervention, such as myomectomy or hysterectomy, are often used to treat the heavy bleeding and symptoms associated with uterine fibroids; however, these procedures may result in post-operative complications, complications with future pregnancy, or even preclude the potential for future pregnancies. Even if a future pregnancy is not desired, many women prefer to avoid surgical intervention. However, heavy menstrual bleeding associated with uterine fibroids is a leading cause of hysterectomy, resulting in approximately 250,000 hysterectomies per year in the U.S. alone.
Our Phase 3 Program for the Treatment of Heavy Menstrual Bleeding Associated with Uterine Fibroids
We initiated a Phase 3 clinical program in January 2017, evaluating relugolix in women with heavy menstrual bleeding associated with uterine fibroids. The program consists of two multinational, replicate pivotal clinical trials, which we refer to as LIBERTY 1 and LIBERTY 2. Each trial randomized women 1:1:1 to one of three treatment arms: relugolix 40 mg once daily co-administered in combination with commercially available low-dose hormonal therapy including 1.0 mg estradiol and 0.5 mg norethindrone acetate for 24 weeks; relugolix 40 mg once daily monotherapy for 12 weeks followed by relugolix 40 mg once daily co-administered in combination with low-dose hormonal therapy for an additional 12 weeks; or placebo once daily for a period of 24 weeks. We have completed enrollment in the two replicate LIBERTY 1 (N = 388) and LIBERTY 2 (N = 382) trials. Eligible women completing the initial 24-week period are offered an active treatment extension with relugolix 40 mg once daily co-administered in combination with low-dose hormonal therapy for an additional 28-week period, or a total treatment period of 52 weeks, to evaluate the safety of longer-term treatment. Women completing the open-label extension study will be offered the opportunity to participate in a randomized withdrawal study to provide up to two years of safety and efficacy data for relugolix combination therapy and information about the need for maintenance therapy. We are also conducting a one-year observational study of bone mineral density in women with uterine fibroids or endometriosis to provide additional context for our Phase 3 clinical programs. 
The primary efficacy endpoint for LIBERTY 1 and LIBERTY 2 is the proportion of all women enrolled who achieve a menstrual blood loss volume of less than 80 mL and at least a 50% reduction in menstrual blood loss volume from baseline during the last 35 days of the 24-week treatment period as measured by the alkaline hematin method, a quantitative measurement of menstrual blood loss. The secondary endpoints include the proportion of women who achieve amenorrhea during the last 35 days of treatment, reduction in pelvic pain, reduction in fibroid volume, reduction in uterine volume, percent change from baseline to week 24 in menstrual blood loss, increase from baseline in hemoglobin, and an assessment of the impact of therapy on quality-of-life. Safety, including bone mineral density changes as measured by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry, is also being assessed. We will conduct a bridging study intended to support approval of the single-tablet fixed-dose combination including relugolix, 40 mg, estradiol, 1.0 mg, and norethindrone acetate, 0.5 mg. We are conducting additional clinical trials to further support the commercial potential of relugolix in uterine fibroids in the U.S. and other major markets.
On May 14, 2019, we announced that LIBERTY 1, the first of two Phase 3 studies of once daily relugolix combination therapy in women with uterine fibroids and heavy menstrual bleeding, met its primary efficacy endpoint and six key secondary endpoints. Relugolix combination therapy maintained bone mineral density at levels comparable to placebo over 24 weeks and was generally well tolerated. 
In the primary endpoint analysis, 73.4% of women receiving once daily oral relugolix combination therapy (relugolix 40 mg plus estradiol 1.0 mg and norethindrone acetate 0.5 mg) achieved the responder criteria compared with 18.9% of women receiving placebo (p < 0.0001). A response was defined as a menstrual blood loss volume of less than 80 mL and a 50 percent or greater reduction from baseline in menstrual blood loss volume during the last 35 days of the 24-week treatment period measured using the alkaline hematin method. On average, women receiving relugolix combination therapy experienced an 84.3% reduction in menstrual blood loss from baseline, a clinically relevant secondary endpoint.
Bone mineral density was comparable between the relugolix combination and placebo groups. The distribution of the change in bone mineral density, including outliers, was similar for the relugolix combination therapy and placebo groups at 24 weeks, as assessed by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA).
8

The 24-week study achieved six key secondary endpoints with statistical significance compared to placebo including mean change in menstrual blood loss from baseline to week 24, reduction in pain in women with pain at baseline, improvement in quality of life, amenorrhea defined as no or negligible blood loss, improvement in anemia in those women with anemia at baseline, and reduction in uterine volume. The seventh secondary endpoint, reduction in uterine fibroid volume, did not achieve statistical significance. 
The overall incidence of adverse events in the relugolix combination and placebo groups was comparable (62% vs. 66%). In the relugolix combination therapy group 5% of women discontinued treatment early due to adverse events compared with 4% in the placebo group. The only adverse event in the relugolix combination arm occurring in at least 10% of women and more frequently than in the placebo arm was hot flush (11% versus 8%). There were no pregnancies in the relugolix combination group and one in the placebo group. There were two serious adverse events related to study drug: one fibroid expulsion and one for pelvic pain.
These data represent a top-line analysis of the results of the LIBERTY 1 study.  Further review of the underlying data by Myovant is ongoing and may result in additional observations with respect to the study. We expect to submit data from LIBERTY 1 for presentation and publication in 2019.
We currently expect data from LIBERTY 2, the replicate Phase 3 study evaluating relugolix combination therapy in women with uterine fibroids and heavy menstrual bleeding, in the third quarter of calendar 2019, and, provided the LIBERTY 2 study is successful, we plan to submit a New Drug Application, or NDA, to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, in the fourth quarter of calendar 2019. 
Takeda’s Phase 3 Program for Uterine Fibroids 
In October 2017, Takeda reported positive top-line results from its Phase 3 trial in Japan evaluating the efficacy and safety of relugolix monotherapy compared with leuprorelin for the treatment of heavy menstrual bleeding associated with uterine fibroids. In this trial, approximately 280 patients were randomized 1:1 to receive either relugolix, 40 mg, administered orally once daily or leuprorelin acetate administered by injection once every four weeks. Relugolix achieved an 82.2% response rate, meeting the primary endpoint, which was the proportion of patients achieving a pre-defined reduction in menstrual bleeding (Pictorial Blood Loss Assessment Chart, or PBAC, score of <10), and was observed to be statistically non-inferior to leuprorelin alone (p = 0.0013). Additionally, in November 2017, Takeda reported positive top-line results from its Phase 3 trial in Japan evaluating the efficacy and safety of relugolix for the treatment of pain associated with uterine fibroids. In this trial, 65 patients were randomized 1:1 to receive either relugolix, 40 mg, or placebo administered orally once daily. Relugolix met the primary endpoint demonstrating a marked improvement in pain in 57.6% of women compared to 3.1% of women receiving placebo (p < 0.0001). A marked improvement was defined as decline from a maximum Numerical Rating Scale, or NRS, score of at least 4 on the 11-point scale during the baseline period (last menstrual cycle before the initiation of treatment) to a maximum NRS score of 1 or less over the last 28 days of treatment, representing a decline from moderate to severe pain to minimal or no pain. Adverse events in both studies were consistent with the mechanism of action of relugolix and adverse events observed in previous clinical trials. In February 2018, Takeda announced that it had submitted the data from both trials to the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare in Japan for marketing authorization of relugolix in Japan for the treatment of uterine fibroids. On January 8, 2019, Takeda and ASKA Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. announced that Takeda obtained marketing authorization in Japan for Relumina® Tablets 40 mg (generic name: relugolix) for the improvement of symptoms of uterine fibroids including heavy menstrual bleeding, lower abdominal pain, lower back pain, and anemia. The Phase 3 data from each of the trials described above will be available to us, and may be used to support our anticipated NDA submission to the FDA. Although we will be solely responsible for obtaining FDA approval for relugolix in the U.S., the FDA can accept the results of clinical trials conducted outside the U.S. that were not conducted under an investigational new drug application in support of an NDA under certain conditions. At a minimum, the trials must have been conducted in accordance with FDA’s good clinical practice requirements, and the FDA may also require that the foreign data be applicable to the U.S. population and U.S. medical practice. 
These studies were based on Takeda’s placebo-controlled dose-finding study evaluating relugolix in Japanese women with uterine fibroids and heavy menstrual bleeding. The study met its primary endpoint, with relugolix decreasing menstrual blood loss in a dose-dependent manner with the highest proportion of responses (84%, 95% confidence interval (74% to 93%) vs. 0% placebo) in the relugolix 40 mg group (p < 0.0003 vs. placebo). The most commonly observed adverse events (occurring in at least 10% of patients and more frequently in treatment groups vs. placebo) were mild or moderate in severity and included headache, metrorrhagia, menorrhagia and hot flush. Bone mineral density decreased from baseline in a dose-dependent fashion with the greatest loss (-2.3%) observed in the relugolix 40 mg group.

Endometriosis
Endometriosis is a disease in which tissue that normally lines the uterus is found outside the uterine cavity. Endometriosis lesions commonly appear in the lower abdomen or pelvis or on ovaries, the bladder, or the colon. During the menstrual cycle, the lesions grow, differentiate, and shed into the abdomen, thereby inducing a cascade of inflammatory events. The symptoms associated with endometriosis can include painful periods and chronic pelvic pain, painful ovulation, pain during or after sexual intercourse, heavy bleeding, fatigue, and even infertility. Endometriosis can also impact general physical, mental, and social well-being.
According to the Endometriosis Foundation, endometriosis affects an estimated 1-in-10 women during their reproductive years and, in the U.S., can take an average of 10 years from the onset of symptoms to accurately diagnose, often leading to unnecessary or inappropriate treatment. We estimate that approximately 6 million women in the U.S. suffer from symptomatic endometriosis, 1.2 million of whom are inadequately treated by oral contraceptives and require additional treatment.
Similar to uterine fibroids, lowering estrogen levels has been shown to reduce pain associated with endometriosis, and there are a variety of medical and surgical treatments available. Initial treatment usually involves over-the-counter pain medications, including NSAIDs, because pain is the primary symptom. In more severe cases, GnRH agonists such as leuprolide are used for short-term treatment and may involve hormonal combination therapy. The FDA has approved Lupaneta Pack, or leuprolide administered with norethindrone acetate (5 mg), to treat pain associated with endometriosis while lowering the side effect of bone mineral density loss and reducing vasomotor symptoms. For many patients, surgical intervention, typically laparoscopy with ablation of endometriotic lesions, is ultimately undertaken to relieve pain and opioid medications are frequently needed to control pain both before and after surgery. After treatment with hormonal therapy or laparoscopic procedures, recurrence of endometriosis and related symptoms is common, resulting in repeated procedures for many women. In addition, approximately 100,000 endometriosis-related hysterectomies are performed each year in the U.S., although hysterectomy is not a cure for endometriosis and pain associated with endometriosis will not necessarily subside following hysterectomy.
Our Phase 3 Program for the Treatment of Pain Associated with Endometriosis
We initiated a Phase 3 clinical program in June 2017, evaluating relugolix in women with pain associated with endometriosis. The program consists of two multinational replicate pivotal clinical trials, which we refer to as SPIRIT 1 and SPIRIT 2. Each trial randomizes women 1:1:1 to one of three treatment arms: relugolix 40 mg once daily co-administered in combination with low-dose hormonal therapy for 24 weeks (1.0 mg estradiol and 0.5 mg norethindrone acetate); relugolix 40 mg once daily monotherapy for 12 weeks followed by relugolix 40 mg once daily co-administered in combination with commercially available low-dose hormonal therapy for an additional 12 weeks; or placebo once daily for a period of 24 weeks. We expect to enroll approximately 600 women in each of the two replicate SPIRIT 1 and SPIRIT 2 trials. Eligible women completing the initial 24-week period are offered an active treatment extension with relugolix 40 mg once daily co-administered in combination with low-dose hormonal therapy for an additional 80-week period, or a total treatment period of 104 weeks, to evaluate the safety of longer-term treatment. 
The co-primary efficacy endpoints for the SPIRIT 1 and SPIRIT 2 trials are the proportion of all women enrolled with reductions in both dysmenorrhea, or menstrual pelvic pain, and nonmenstrual pelvic pain, as assessed by an endometriosis-specific patient questionnaire administered daily, with no increase in background pain medication. Secondary endpoints will include additional questionnaires assessing functional changes associated with endometriosis-specific pain and quality of life, and the use of pain medications to treat endometriosis. Safety, including bone mineral density changes as measured by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry, will be assessed. 
We currently expect to complete enrollment for the SPIRIT 1 and SPIRIT 2 trials in calendar 2019 with top-line results expected in the first quarter of calendar 2020. If the results of SPIRIT 1 and SPIRIT 2 are favorable, we intend to submit an NDA to the FDA. 
Takeda’s Phase 2 Clinical Trial of Women with Endometriosis
In a randomized, placebo-controlled, Phase 2 clinical trial of women with endometriosis conducted by Takeda from 2012 to 2014, 487 women were randomized to relugolix at doses of 10 mg, 20 mg or 40 mg administered orally once daily for 12 weeks, to placebo for 12 weeks, or to leuprolide, 3.75 mg administered subcutaneously every four weeks for 12 weeks. The trial demonstrated dose-dependent decreases from baseline in pelvic pain. Pelvic pain, including both non-menstrual pelvic pain and dysmenorrhea, was assessed by visual analog scale, or VAS, score. The primary endpoint was the change from baseline in mean VAS score for pelvic pain from week 8 through week 12. The mean pelvic pain VAS scores at baseline for the four groups ranged between 14.6 mm to 15.6 mm. All doses were significantly better than placebo, with the greatest benefit observed at the highest dose evaluated, 40 mg once daily. The mean change from baseline in the VAS score was -10.4 mm in the relugolix 40 mg arm versus -3.8 mm in the placebo arm (p < 0.0001). The mean changes from baseline in the VAS score were -8.1 and -6.2, respectively, for the relugolix 20 mg and 10 mg arms. The mean change from baseline in the VAS score for the leuprolide arm was -10.5 mm, which was similar to that of the relugolix 40 mg arm. Secondary efficacy endpoints also

demonstrated clinical benefit. Secondary efficacy endpoints included individual VAS scores for non-menstrual pelvic pain, menstrual pain and painful intercourse during the treatment period; the modified Biberoglu and Behrman score for pelvic pain, a commonly used endometriosis-specific patient questionnaire; use of analgesics to treat pelvic pain; proportion of women achieving amenorrhea, or the absence of menstrual blood loss; and quality of life using the endometriosis health profile-30 questionnaire. Clinical improvement was observed on all pain endpoints, including dose-dependent responses in mean VAS score for dysmenorrhea, mean modified Biberoglu and Behrman score for pelvic pain and mean modified Biberoglu and Berhman score for dysmenorrhea. In the 40 mg once-daily treatment arm, mean changes on these endpoints were -29.7, -0.325, and -1.16, respectively, compared to -5.21, -0.178, and -0.172 for patients receiving placebo. The changes from baseline in mean VAS score for dysmenorrhea were -19.9 and -14.2, respectively, in the relugolix 20 mg and 10 mg arms. The change from baseline in mean VAS score for dysmenorrhea for the leuprolide arm was -26.9. The mean percent changes from baseline in VAS score for dysmenorrhea were -97.1%, -60.1%, -31.8%, -11.7% and -98.5%, respectively, in the relugolix 40 mg, relugolix 20 mg, relugolix 10 mg, placebo and leuprolide arms. The proportion of days in which the women used analgesics and the amount of menstrual bleeding both decreased, while the proportion of women who achieved amenorrhea increased in a time-dependent manner depending on relugolix dose level. The effects of relugolix on pelvic pain were generally maintained and estradiol levels suppressed for the duration of the study in the 397 women who enrolled in an extension study and received an additional 12 weeks of treatment, or a total of 24 weeks of treatment.
Advanced Prostate Cancer
Prostate cancer is the second most prevalent form of cancer in men and the second leading cause of death due to cancer in men in the U.S. According to the National Cancer Institute, approximately 3.1 million men are currently living with prostate cancer in the U.S., and approximately 175,000 men are newly diagnosed each year. Men with prostate cancer are often asymptomatic at the earliest stages of disease and prostate cancer is generally understood to be slow to progress, leading to a median age at diagnosis of 66 years and a five-year survival rate of 98.2%. 
If prostate cancer is diagnosed at a stage where it is confined to the prostate gland and immediate surroundings, it is generally treated by surgical removal of the prostate gland, or prostatectomy, or with radiation. Often, these procedures are successful in curing men of their disease. Men whose disease progresses after prostatectomy or radiation are said to have advanced prostate cancer. Advanced prostate cancer is defined as any of the following: prostate-specific antigen, or PSA, biochemical relapse following primary surgical or radiation therapy of curative intent; newly diagnosed metastatic prostate cancer; or advanced localized disease for which immediate radiation or surgical therapy is not indicated. The cure rate following surgery, depending on the stage of the cancer, is about 70% overall and, following radiation, about 50% to 60%. Approximately 25% to 30% of men will, therefore, progress to advanced disease, excluding those with metastatic disease at the time of diagnosis. 
First-line treatment for advanced prostate cancer typically involves treatment with androgen deprivation therapies, or ADT, which are therapies that substantially reduce testosterone. This is because androgens, such as testosterone, promote the growth of cancerous prostate cells by binding to and activating the androgen receptor which, once activated, stimulates prostate cancer cell growth. ADT consisting of either medical castration or surgical castration, or removal of the testes which produce testosterone, can be successful in delaying prostate cancer progression. More than 80% of patients with advanced prostate cancer initially respond to ADT with varying degrees of tumor regression or stabilization. The duration and depth of response to ADT is presumably dependent on the underlying tumor biology and burden. Thus, patients with metastatic prostate cancer, or prostate cancer that has spread to other parts of the body, respond for an average of two years before any biochemical evidence of castration resistance occurs. By contrast, patients with biochemical-only evidence of progressive disease may respond to ADT for five years or more. As prostate cancer progresses, men remain on ADT while other therapies are added, typically until death. 
The most commonly prescribed ADTs are GnRH agonists, such as long-acting leuprolide depot injections. GnRH agonists initially stimulate testosterone production, but with chronic stimulation of the GnRH receptors, the pituitary gland desensitizes and luteinizing hormone decreases with a resultant reduction in testosterone three to four weeks after the initiation of therapy. The initial stimulation of testosterone can cause an initial worsening of symptoms, or clinical flare. GnRH agonists are often given as depot formulations, requiring injections every month, three months or six months, and testosterone remains suppressed for weeks and months after cessation of therapy. 
Our Phase 3 Program for the Treatment of Advanced Prostate Cancer
We initiated a Phase 3 clinical trial in March of 2017, evaluating the safety and efficacy of relugolix in men with advanced prostate cancer, which we refer to as the HERO trial. We believe the HERO trial, if successful, will be sufficient to support the submission of an NDA based on an End-of-Phase 2 meeting held with the FDA. The European Scientific Advice procedure and an End-of-Phase 2 meeting with the Japanese health authority have also been completed supporting the design of the HERO trial for approval in those regions should it be successful.
11

The HERO trial has completed enrollment after randomizing 934 men with advanced prostate cancer who require ADT in a 2:1 ratio to treatment with either oral relugolix 120 mg once daily (after a single oral loading dose of 360 mg) or a depot injection of leuprolide (per national or regional product label) for a period of at least 48 weeks. Based on FDA discussions, we believe that we will be required to conduct only one Phase 3 trial with a single relugolix arm to gain approval for relugolix in men with advanced prostate cancer in the U.S. Nonetheless, we have designed the trial to include a second arm with leuprolide to demonstrate that treatment with relugolix is noninferior to leuprolide in achieving sustained suppression of testosterone to castrate levels over 48 weeks, an outcome expected to be required for approval in other major markets such as Europe and Japan. 
The primary efficacy endpoint accepted by the FDA is testosterone suppression (≤ 50 ng/dL) from week 5, day 1 through week 48, day 7. Relugolix must demonstrate that the lower bound of the 2-sided 95% confidence interval for the percent of patients achieving testosterone suppression through 48 weeks is at least 90%. The secondary efficacy endpoint is PSA reduction as a percentage change from baseline. Testosterone suppression is an approvable endpoint in the U.S. and several hormonal therapies have been approved based on this endpoint. If the results of this trial are favorable, we intend to submit an NDA to the FDA. We may conduct additional clinical trials to further support the commercial potential of relugolix in prostate cancer in the U.S. and other major markets. We currently expect to present top-line results from the HERO trial in the fourth quarter of calendar 2019 and to submit an NDA in early calendar 2020.
In addition, we filed an amendment to the HERO protocol to continue to enroll approximately 120 additional men with metastatic prostate cancer with the objective of prospectively demonstrating that relugolix can delay the time to progression to the lethal state of the disease, castration-resistant prostate cancer, as compared to leuprolide. We believe that relugolix, a direct GnRH receptor antagonist, has the potential to delay the time to castration-resistant disease as compared with leuprolide, a GnRH agonist, because relugolix more rapidly suppresses testosterone and PSA and more fully suppresses follicle-stimulating hormone than leuprolide.
Takeda’s Phase 2 Clinical Trials of Men with Advanced Prostate Cancer
In 2014, Takeda initiated two Phase 2 clinical trials of relugolix in men with advanced prostate cancer requiring androgen deprivation therapy, or ADT, to demonstrate the ability of relugolix to achieve sustained castration (testosterone 50 ng/dL or less) over 24 weeks. Study C27002 enrolled 134 patients with advanced prostate cancer. In this open-label, parallel group study, men were enrolled to receive oral relugolix at a daily dose of 80 mg or 120 mg (after a single oral loading dose of 320 mg) or to receive GnRH agonist therapy (leuprolide 22.5 mg administered subcutaneously every 12 weeks) for up to 48 weeks. Study C27003 enrolled 103 men requiring six months ADT as neoadjuvant and adjuvant therapy to external beam radiation therapy. Patients were randomized to relugolix 120 mg once daily (after a single oral loading dose of 320 mg) or to degarelix 80 mg intramuscularly every four weeks for 24 weeks (after a single loading dose of 240 mg). In study C27002, 91% of men taking either relugolix 80 mg or relugolix 120 mg and 96% of men on leuprolide achieved sustained castration for 24 weeks. In study C27003, 95% of men taking relugolix and 89% of men taking degarelix achieved sustained castration for 24 weeks. The safety profile of relugolix in both trials was consistent with the known class effects of other GnRH analogs, and relugolix resulted in rapid suppression of testosterone levels and was not observed to cause a clinical flare of symptoms after initiation of treatment. In study C27002, relugolix demonstrated a more rapid reduction in prostate specific antigen, or PSA, compared to leuprolide. The percent of patients with at least a 50% reduction in PSA at Week 5 was 83%, 75% and 17%, respectively, in the relugolix 120 mg, relugolix 80 mg and leuprolide arms. The median time to PSA nadir was 12.3 weeks, 16.1 weeks and 20.5 weeks, respectively, in the relugolix 120 mg, relugolix 80 mg and leuprolide arms. No statistical comparisons were made between the relugolix and leuprolide arms. Study C27003 demonstrated rapid and sustained suppression of testosterone levels to below the castration threshold for the 24-week treatment duration. In study C27003, the testosterone recovery following the last dose of treatment was more rapid in the relugolix arm than in the degarelix arm. Baseline testosterone levels were similar between the two arms (405 ng/dL and 420 ng/dL in the relugolix and degarelix groups, respectively), but at 12 weeks after discontinuing therapy, the median testosterone levels were 285 ng/dL and 35 ng/dL, respectively. No statistical comparisons were made between the two arms.

MVT-602
As part of our license agreement with Takeda, or the Takeda License Agreement, we acquired the worldwide rights to MVT-602, our second product candidate, which previously has been evaluated in over 150 men. MVT-602 is an oligopeptide kisspeptin-1 receptor agonist. Kisspeptin, the ligand, is a naturally-occurring peptide that stimulates GnRH release and is required for puberty and maintenance of normal reproductive function, including production of sperm, follicular maturation and ovulation, and production of estrogen and progesterone in women and testosterone in men. MVT-602 is being developed as a potential treatment for female infertility in women as part of assisted reproduction, such as in vitro fertilization, or IVF. Approximately 1.5 million assisted reproduction cycles are performed each year worldwide. Further, approximately 25% of women suffering from infertility have problems achieving ovulation, including the inability to produce fully-matured eggs or the failure to ovulate, most commonly resulting from hormonal dysfunction in the GnRH-luteinizing hormone/follicle-stimulating hormone axis. We believe MVT-602 has the potential to be a safer alternative to human chorionic gonadotropin as a part of assisted reproduction for the treatment of female infertility.
In October 2018, we presented data from a Phase 1 trial of MVT-602 at the American Society of Reproductive Medicine (ASRM) Annual Congress. Results of the study showed that administration of MVT-602 in healthy premenopausal women in the follicular phase produced a dose-related increase in luteinizing hormone concentrations and expected effects on follicle-stimulating hormone and estradiol. A total of 24 women were randomized to one of three MVT-602 dose groups (0.3 µg, 1 µg or 3 µg) and then subsequently randomized within the assigned group to receive a single subcutaneous dose of MVT-602 or placebo in a 3:1 ratio. Results showed that administration of single subcutaneous dose of MVT-602 demonstrated dose-related increases in luteinizing hormone concentrations and expected post-dose increases in follicle-stimulating hormone and estradiol concentrations, with little effect observed on progesterone as expected. No serious adverse events were reported, and no subject discontinued from the study due to an adverse event. Adverse events were similar between the placebo and MVT-602 groups with no apparent dose-related effects.
Further assessment of the exposure-response profile of MVT-602 was conducted in a Phase 2a study during the pre-ovulatory phase in approximately 70 fertile women undergoing controlled ovarian stimulation. This study has been completed and we currently expect to present top-line results at the European Society of Human Reproduction in Vienna, Austria in June 2019. This study is intended to provide information for dose selection for a study of MVT-602 in infertile women seeking pregnancy.
We believe that MVT-602, an analog of the naturally-occurring kisspeptin peptide in humans, may mimic natural physiology by inducing a luteinizing hormone surge during IVF and other assisted reproductive technologies, enhancing the likelihood of successful egg maturation and ovulation at the right time without the serious side effect of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome, or OHSS. While assisted reproductive technologies are effective, typically resulting in pregnancy in 20% to 35% of patients, the standard procedure has remained largely unchanged since inception and has potentially serious side effects. The most serious side effect of assisted reproduction is OHSS. Severe OHSS has been reported to occur in up to 2% of the general assisted reproduction population, and in up to 20% of patients at high-risk for developing OHSS. OHSS is thought to occur as a result of the nonphysiologic elevations in luteinizing hormone that occur as a result of egg maturation triggered with human chorionic gonadotropin and to a lesser extent the GnRH receptor agonists.
By acting upstream in the GnRH-axis to promote the release of physiologically normal levels of key hormones in the assisted reproduction cycle such as luteinizing hormone, kisspeptin agonists, such as MVT-602, may have the potential to trigger egg maturation without causing OHSS. A recently published investigator-sponsored trial where a native kisspeptin peptide (specifically, kisspeptin 54) was used in place of human chorionic gonadotropin as the egg-maturation trigger in the assisted reproduction cycle showed that none of the 60 high-risk patients developed moderate-to-severe OHSS and resulted in a live birth rate of up to 65.1% at the maximally efficacious dose tested. These results validate the potential use of kisspeptin analogs as an alternative to the standard egg maturation trigger in assisted reproduction protocols. To our knowledge, MVT-602 is the only kisspeptin-1 receptor agonist in clinical development and thus has the potential to become a safe alternative egg-maturation trigger in this space.

Our Key Agreements
License Agreement with Takeda
In April 2016, we entered into the Takeda License Agreement. Pursuant to the Takeda License Agreement, Takeda granted to us an exclusive, royalty-bearing license under certain patents and other intellectual property controlled by Takeda to develop and commercialize relugolix and MVT-602, and products containing these compounds for all human diseases and conditions. The territory for our exclusive license for relugolix covers all countries worldwide, except that Takeda retains exclusive rights to Japan, China, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Korea, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand, and Vietnam (including, in each case, the territories and possession of each of the foregoing), which we collectively refer to as the Takeda Territory. Takeda has granted us a nonexclusive license in the Takeda Territory to manufacture relugolix and to conduct development of relugolix for prostate cancer solely for the purpose of developing, manufacturing and commercializing relugolix in our territory. The territory for our exclusive license for MVT-602 covers all countries worldwide. Our license includes a right of reference to regulatory materials related to relugolix and MVT-602 controlled by Takeda. On May 31, 2018, Takeda announced that they entered into a licensing agreement granting ASKA Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. exclusive commercialization right for uterine fibroids and exclusive development and commercialization rights for endometriosis in Japan.
Under the Takeda License Agreement, we granted to Takeda an exclusive, royalty-bearing license in the Takeda Territory under certain patents and other intellectual property controlled by us to develop and commercialize relugolix and products containing relugolix for all human diseases and conditions, subject to our nonexclusive rights to conduct development and manufacturing as described above. We also granted to Takeda a nonexclusive license in our territory to manufacture relugolix and MVT-602; and to conduct development of relugolix for uterine fibroids and endometriosis solely for the purpose of developing, manufacturing and commercializing relugolix in the Takeda Territory. Takeda’s license includes a right of reference to regulatory materials controlled by us. If Takeda determines not to seek regulatory approval for or to commercialize relugolix in any country in the Takeda Territory, then we have a right of first negotiation to acquire the rights to seek regulatory approval and commercialize relugolix in such country.
We are solely responsible, at our expense, for all activities related to the development of relugolix and MVT-602 in our territory and all activities related to the development of relugolix through the receipt of regulatory approval for prostate cancer in the Takeda Territory. Pursuant to the terms of the Takeda License Agreement, we are required to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and obtain regulatory approval of relugolix for the treatment, prevention, cure or control of symptoms associated with uterine fibroids or endometriosis and MVT-602 in our territory, as well as to develop and obtain regulatory approval of relugolix for prostate cancer in Japan and the U.S. We are solely responsible, at our expense, for all activities related to the commercialization of relugolix and MVT-602 in our territory and must use commercially reasonable efforts to do so in each country in our territory in which we obtain regulatory approval. Takeda is solely responsible, at its expense, for all activities related to the commercialization of relugolix in the Takeda Territory, and must use diligent efforts to commercialize relugolix for prostate cancer in the Takeda Territory following receipt of regulatory approval.
We will pay Takeda a fixed, high single-digit royalty on net sales of relugolix and MVT-602 products in our territory, subject to certain agreed reductions. Takeda will pay us a royalty at the same rate as ours on net sales of relugolix products for prostate cancer in the Takeda Territory, subject to certain agreed reductions. Royalties are required to be paid, on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis, until the latest to occur of the expiration of the last to expire valid claim of a licensed patent covering such product in such country, the expiration of regulatory exclusivity for such product in such country, or 10 years after the first commercial sale of such product in such country. Under the Takeda License Agreement, there was no upfront payment and there are no payments upon the achievement of clinical development or marketing approval milestones.
During the period commencing on the effective date of the Takeda License Agreement and ending two years after the first commercial sale of product containing relugolix in a major market country, we and our controlling shareholder, Roivant Sciences Ltd., or RSL, have both agreed that we will not, directly or indirectly, and will cause all of our respective affiliates (other than any affiliate that is a public company) not to, alone or with others, research (or fund any research), develop, make, use, sell, offer for sale, or import any competing product in our territory or the Takeda Territory or enter into any agreement with any third party with respect to a license or other acquisition of rights relating to any competing product in our territory or the Takeda Territory. For these purposes, a competing product is (1) any small molecule oral GnRH receptor antagonist (other than a product containing relugolix) for uterine fibroids, endometriosis, or prostate cancer, and (2) any product containing MVT-602 for prostate cancer in the Takeda Territory. If, during such period, we or any of our nonpublic affiliates is acquired by a third party that is developing or commercializing a competing product, then we must divest our interest or terminate the development or commercialization of the competing product or cause our affiliate to do so.
14

The Takeda License Agreement will expire, on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis, on the expiration of the royalty payment term described above for such product in such country. Either party may terminate the Takeda License Agreement for the other party’s uncured material breach, challenge to the patents licensed under the Takeda License Agreement, or insolvency. Takeda may terminate the Takeda License Agreement with respect to a compound if we cease development or commercialization of such compound. We may terminate the agreement at will, in our sole discretion, in its entirety, or with respect to relugolix for prostate cancer or both endometriosis and uterine fibroids, or on a compound by compound basis for all fields, upon prior notice, with the notice period depending on the compound and field to be terminated and the regulatory status at the time that notice of termination is given. We may also terminate the agreement with respect to a compound for safety reasons or lack of commercial viability. If the agreement is terminated in its entirety or with respect to relugolix for prostate cancer, other than for safety reasons or by us for Takeda’s uncured material breach, prior to receipt of the first regulatory approval of relugolix for prostate cancer in Japan, then we must either reimburse Takeda for its out of pocket costs and expenses directly incurred in connection with Takeda’s completion of the relugolix development for prostate cancer, up to an agreed cap, or complete ourselves the conduct of any clinical trials of relugolix for prostate cancer that are ongoing as of the effective date of such termination, at our cost and expense. If we reimburse Takeda for such costs, then under certain circumstances we may be later reimbursed by Takeda through a royalty on sales of the terminated relugolix product.
In connection with the Takeda License Agreement, we issued 5,077,001 of our common shares, then equal to 12% of our outstanding share capital, to Takeda pursuant to a subscription agreement, and also issued Takeda a warrant to enable it to maintain its 12% ownership of us through the one-year anniversary of the warrant, unless earlier terminated as a result of our change in control. We issued a total of 2,343,624 of our common shares to Takeda under this warrant prior to its expiration on April 30, 2017. We also entered into an investor rights agreement with Takeda, pursuant to which Takeda and RSL, the other shareholder party thereto, are entitled to certain rights with respect to the registration of their common shares under the Securities Act. 
Manufacture and Supply Agreements with Takeda 
In June 2016, we and one of Takeda’s affiliates, Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited, or Takeda Limited, entered into an agreement for the manufacture and supply of relugolix. Under this agreement, Takeda Limited is supplying us, and we are obtaining from Takeda Limited, all of our requirements for relugolix drug substance and drug product to be used under our development plans for all indications. Takeda Limited is also assisting us with a technical transfer of the manufacturing process for relugolix to us and our designee and we are paying the expenses related to such transfer. 
On May 30, 2018, we entered into a Commercial Manufacturing and Supply Agreement with Takeda, or the Takeda Commercial Supply Agreement, pursuant to which Takeda will manufacture and supply us with relugolix drug substance to support the commercial launch of relugolix, if marketing authorization is granted. Takeda has agreed to assist with the transfer of technology and manufacturing know-how to a second contract manufacturing organization of our subsidiary, Myovant Sciences GmbH. We will pay the expenses related to such transfers.
Right of First Negotiation and Board Observer Agreement with Pfizer
In October 2016, we and an entity affiliated with Pfizer Inc., or the Pfizer Affiliate, entered into a right of first negotiation and board observer agreement, or the Pfizer Agreement. Pursuant to the Pfizer Agreement, we granted to the Pfizer Affiliate, upon the closing of the sale of at least $30.0 million of our common shares to the Pfizer Affiliate in our initial public offering, or the IPO, a right of first negotiation with respect to any transaction that we would propose to a third party involving (A) the license or sale of rights to develop and commercialize relugolix or MVT-602 for the treatment of heavy menstrual bleeding associated with uterine fibroids, pain associated with endometriosis, advanced prostate cancer, or female infertility as part of assisted reproduction, in each case, in a major market country, or (B) a change of control of Myovant or the sale or disposition of all or substantially all of our assets. The right of first negotiation will terminate upon the earliest of (1) November 1, 2019 (the third anniversary of the IPO), (2) such time as the Pfizer Affiliate, together with its affiliates, owns less than 51% of the common shares purchased by the Pfizer Affiliate in the IPO, (3) a change of control of Myovant, (4) the sale or disposition of all or substantially all of our assets and (5) the liquidation or other dissolution of Myovant. In addition, during such period that the Pfizer Affiliate holds a right of first negotiation, one representative of the Pfizer Affiliate may attend any meetings of our board of directors in a non-voting observer capacity, subject to standard exceptions, such as conflict of interest. Such observer right will also terminate at such time as we file an NDA with the FDA for relugolix. The Pfizer Agreement will terminate upon the earliest of (1) November 1, 2021 (the fifth anniversary of the closing of the IPO), (2) such time as the Pfizer Affiliate, together with its affiliates, owns less than 51% of the common shares purchased by the Pfizer Affiliate in the IPO, (3) a change of control of Myovant, (4) the sale or disposition of all or substantially all of our assets, (5) the liquidation or other dissolution of Myovant, and (6) such time as we file an NDA with the FDA for relugolix. 
15

Option Agreement with Roivant Sciences Limited
In June 2016, we entered into an option agreement with RSL pursuant to which RSL granted to us an option to acquire the rights to products to which RSL or any non-public affiliate of RSL acquires the rights (other than a relugolix product or a competing product, as described under the section titled “—License Agreement with Takeda” above) for uterine fibroids or endometriosis, or for which the primary target indication is hormone-sensitive prostate cancer. Our option is exercisable at any time during the period commencing on November 1, 2016 (the date we closed the IPO) and ending two years following the date of first commercial sale of a relugolix product in a major market country. If we elect to exercise our option for a product, we will be required to reimburse RSL for 110% of any payments made by RSL or its affiliate for such product, and will receive an assignment of the agreement through which RSL or its affiliate acquired the rights to such product.
Information Sharing and Cooperation Agreement
In July 2016, we entered into an information sharing and cooperation agreement, or the Cooperation Agreement, with RSL. The Cooperation Agreement, among other things: (1) obligates us to deliver periodic financial statements and other financial information to RSL and to comply with other specified financial reporting requirements; and (2) requires us to supply certain material information to RSL to assist it in preparing any future U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, filings. On May 24, 2019, we entered into Amendment No. 1 to the Cooperation Agreement, pursuant to which RSL has agreed, in connection with each of our next three public offerings of our common shares, that RSL will (1) provide to us and the underwriter(s) engaged by us in connection with such public offering an indication of interest for RSL to participate as a purchaser in such public offerings, and (2) enter into a customary lock-up agreement with the underwriters in connection with such public offerings.
Subject to specified exceptions, the Cooperation Agreement will terminate upon the earlier of the mutual written consent of the parties or when RSL is no longer required by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or U.S. GAAP, to consolidate our results of operations and financial position, account for its investment in us under the equity method of accounting or, by any rule of the SEC, include our separate financial statements in any filings it may make with the SEC.
Services Agreements with Roivant Sciences, Inc. and Roivant Sciences GmbH
In July 2016, we and our wholly-owned subsidiary Myovant Sciences, Inc., or MSI, entered into a services agreement, or the RSI Services Agreement, with Roivant Sciences, Inc., or RSI, a wholly owned subsidiary of RSL, effective April 29, 2016, under which RSI agreed to provide certain administrative and research and development, or R&D, services to us. Under the RSI Services Agreement, we pay or reimburse RSI for expenses it, or third parties acting on its behalf, incurs for us. For any general and administrative, or G&A, and R&D activities performed by RSI employees, RSI charges us based upon the relative percentage of time utilized on our matters by the respective employee. All other third-party pass thru costs are billed to us at cost. 
In February 2017, we and MSI amended and restated the RSI Services Agreement, effective November 11, 2016, to include our wholly owned subsidiary, Myovant Sciences GmbH, or MSG, as a services recipient. In addition, in February 2017, MSG entered into a separate services agreement, or the RSG Services Agreement, with Roivant Sciences GmbH, or RSG, a wholly owned subsidiary of RSL, effective November 11, 2016, for the provisioning of services by RSG to MSG in relation to services related to clinical development, administrative and finance and accounting activities. We refer to the amended and restated services agreement with RSI and the RSG Services Agreement, collectively, as the Services Agreements.
We have replaced most of the services previously provided by RSI and RSG with our own internally developed capabilities or external professional service providers. Consequently, the level of support we receive from RSI and RSG has decreased substantially and is expected to continue to decrease as we further decentralize our activities from RSL. 
Sales and Marketing 
We are currently building our sales and marketing infrastructure; however, we currently do not have established marketing, sales, or distribution capabilities. In order to commercialize our product candidates, if approved for commercial sale, we must either develop a sales and marketing infrastructure or collaborate with third-parties that have sales and marketing experience. We plan to directly commercialize our product candidates in the U.S. In other markets for which commercialization may be less capital efficient for us, we may selectively pursue strategic collaborations with third parties in order to maximize the commercial potential of our product candidates. 
16

Manufacturing 
We do not own or operate, nor do we expect to own or operate, facilities for manufacturing, storage and distribution, or testing of our product candidates. In June 2016, we and Takeda Limited entered into an agreement for the manufacture and supply of relugolix. Under this agreement, Takeda Limited is supplying us, and we are obtaining from Takeda Limited, all of our requirements for relugolix drug substance and drug product to be used under our development plans for all indications. We also rely on a limited number of third-party contract manufacturers for packaging and distribution of finished drug products for our clinical trials, sourcing of comparator products, and development of new products. Takeda Limited is also assisting us with a technical transfer of the manufacturing process for relugolix drug substance and drug product to us and our designee and we are paying the expenses related to such transfer. 
We expect that the manufacturing support provided by Takeda to us under the Takeda License Agreement will be sufficient for us to complete our planned Phase 3 programs for relugolix. If relugolix is approved by the FDA, we also plan to rely on Takeda and other third-party manufacturers to supply us with sufficient commercial quantities of relugolix. On May 30, 2018, we entered into the Takeda Commercial Supply Agreement pursuant to which Takeda will manufacture and supply us with relugolix drug substance to support the commercial launch of relugolix, if marketing authorization is granted. Takeda has agreed to assist with the transfer of technology and manufacturing know-how to a second contract manufacturing organization of our subsidiary, Myovant Sciences GmbH. We will pay the expense related to such transfers. In anticipation of receiving marketing approval by a regulatory agency for any one of our products, we intend to and have entered into additional agreements with Takeda and/or other third-party contract manufacturers for the commercial production of those products.
We expect that the MVT-602 drug substance transferred from Takeda to us under the Takeda License Agreement will be sufficient for our near-term development plans; however, additional process development and manufacturing would be required in order for us to complete Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical studies for MVT-602. We intend to contract with third-party contract manufacturers to complete the additional development and manufacturing activities for our current MVT-602 programs and to fill, finish, supply, store, and distribute drug product for these programs.
If there are delays in initiating new relationships with one or more other third-party manufacturers for relugolix and/or MVT-602, or a delay in completing technology transfer to any of these manufacturers, we could experience delays in our development and commercialization efforts.
Manufacturing of any product candidate is subject to extensive regulations that impose various procedural and documentation requirements, which govern recordkeeping, manufacturing processes and controls, personnel, quality control and quality assurance, among others. We expect that all of our contract manufacturing organizations will manufacture relugolix and MVT-602 under current Good Manufacturing Practice, or cGMP, conditions, which set forth the regulatory standards for the production of pharmaceuticals to be used in humans.
Competition
The pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical industries are highly competitive and require an ongoing, extensive search for technological innovation. These industries are characterized by rapid and significant technological advancements, intense competition, and a strong emphasis on proprietary products. While we believe that our product candidates, knowledge, experience, and scientific resources provide us with competitive advantages, we face competition from major pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions, governmental agencies and public and private research institutions, among others. Any product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with existing therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future. Our ability to compete will significantly depend upon our ability to effectively complete necessary clinical trials and regulatory approval processes, and effectively commercialize, market, and promote approved products. The primary competitive factors that will affect the commercial success of any product candidate for which we may receive marketing approval include efficacy, safety and tolerability profile, acceptance by physicians, ease of patient compliance, dosing convenience, price, insurance and other reimbursement coverage, patent position, distribution, and marketing. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or other regulatory approvals for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market.
Many of our existing or potential future competitors have substantially greater financial, technical, and human resources than we do and significantly greater experience in the discovery and development of product candidates, as well as in obtaining regulatory approvals of those product candidates in the U.S. and in foreign countries. Our current and certain potential future competitors also have significantly more experience in manufacturing and commercializing drugs that have been approved for marketing. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaboration agreements with larger more established companies. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific, sales force, and management personnel and establishing clinical trial sites and patient enrollment and retention for clinical trials. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries could result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. 
17

Accordingly, our competitors may be more successful than us in obtaining regulatory approval for therapies and in achieving widespread market acceptance of their drugs. It is also possible that the development of a cure or more effective treatment method for uterine fibroids, endometriosis or prostate cancer by a competitor could render our product candidates non-competitive or obsolete or reduce the demand for our product candidates before we can recover our development and commercialization expenses. 
We consider relugolix’s most direct competitor for the treatment of heavy menstrual bleeding associated with uterine fibroids and for pain associated with endometriosis to be ORILISSA™ (elagolix), an oral GnRH receptor antagonist for the management of moderate to severe pain associated with endometriosis, which has been approved as monotherapy (150 mg once a day or 200 mg twice a day) by the FDA and launched by AbbVie in August 2018. Abbvie also commenced two Phase 3b trials of elagolix in combination with hormonal therapy in women with pain associated with endometriosis in 2017, which are ongoing. In 2018, AbbVie announced that each of its two pivotal Phase 3 trials evaluating elagolix 300 mg twice a day with and without hormonal add-back therapy in women with heavy menstrual bleeding associated with uterine fibroids, met their primary endpoint. In addition, ObsEva SA, a Swiss-based clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company, reported the commencement of two Phase 3 clinical trials of linzagolix (OBE2109), also an oral GnRH receptor antagonist, in women with heavy menstrual bleeding associated with uterine fibroids in the first half of 2017. We expect ObsEva to initiate a Phase 3 program evaluating linzagolix in women with endometriosis-associated pain in 2019. We believe the development of multiple GnRH receptor antagonists by other biopharmaceutical companies adds further validation to the therapeutic relevance of GnRH as a target for the treatment of women’s health and endocrine diseases and will help fuel growth in this market which has lacked innovative new medical therapies.
In January 2017, Allergan and Gedeon Richter announced positive results from the second of two pivotal Phase 3 clinical trials evaluating the efficacy and safety of ulipristal acetate, a selective progesterone receptor modulator, in women with abnormal bleeding due to uterine fibroids. The FDA accepted the filing of their NDA submission for this indication in October 2017. On May 18, 2018, the European Medicines Agency Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee, or PRAC, completed its review of Esmya (ulipristal acetate) following reports of serious liver injury. The PRAC concluded that Esmya may have contributed to the development of some cases of serious liver injury. The PRAC has recommended that Esmya must not be used in women with known liver problems and should be used for more than one treatment course only in women who are not eligible for surgery. Liver function testing should be performed at the start of each treatment course and once a month and for two to four weeks after stopping treatment for the first two treatment courses. In February 2018, Allergan announced that the U.S. FDA had extended the Prescription Drug User Fee Act date by three months to the third quarter of 2018 to provide time for a full review of the file. In August 2018, the FDA issued a complete response letter to Allergan indicating it could not approve ulipristal acetate in its current form due to safety concerns related to post-marketing reports outside the U.S. The launch of Esmya in the U.S. is on hold. Other selective progesterone receptor modulators are also in development, including vilaprisan, a selective steroidal progesterone receptor modulator, for which Bayer was conducting a head-to-head study of vilaprisan compared with ulipristal acetate in women with heavy menstrual bleeding due to uterine fibroids and a long-term safety study of vilaprisan compared with standard of care. In December 2018, Bayer put clinical development of its ongoing vilaprisan trials on hold following safety findings in long-term toxicology studies. 
In addition to other GnRH receptor antagonists and selective progesterone receptor modulators in active development, we are aware of other biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies as well as academic institutions, government agencies, and private and public research institutions that are developing, and may in the future develop and commercialize, products for gender-specific hormone disorders.
Intellectual Property
Our commercial success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain proprietary protection for relugolix, MVT-602 and any of our future product candidates. We seek to protect our proprietary position by, among other methods, filing and in-licensing U.S. and foreign patents and patent applications. We also rely on trademarks, trade secrets and know-how to develop and maintain our proprietary position.
Generally, issued patents are granted a term of 20 years from the earliest claimed non-provisional filing date. In certain instances, patent term can be adjusted to recapture a portion of delay by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) in examining the patent application (patent term adjustment, or PTA) or extended to account for term effectively lost as a result of the FDA regulatory review period (patent term extension, or PTE), or both. In addition, we cannot provide any assurance that any patents will be issued from our pending or future applications or that any issued patents will adequately protect our products or product candidates. 
Under the Takeda License Agreement, we are the exclusive licensee of multiple granted U.S. patents, and pending patent applications, as well as patents and patent applications in numerous foreign jurisdictions relating to relugolix and MVT-602. 
18

For relugolix, we are the exclusive worldwide licensee, excluding the Takeda Territory. These patents and patent applications cover the relugolix molecule and certain analogs and the use of relugolix to treat sex-hormone dependent prostate cancer and hysteromyoma (uterine fibroids); methods of manufacturing; and certain formulations. The patent family directed to the relugolix molecule and its use expires in 2024, subject to any extension of patent term that may be available in a particular country. We intend to apply for PTE for a patent covering relugolix. If granted, the patent term covering relugolix as a composition of matter may be extended for up to five years, or 2029. The patents and patent applications directed to methods of manufacturing and formulations, if issued, expire in 2033 and 2036, respectively, subject to any adjustment or extension of patent term that may be available in a particular country. We have also filed patent applications directed to uses of relugolix combination therapy in treating, among other conditions, heavy menstrual bleeding associated with uterine fibroids and for pain associated with endometriosis, and to the use of relugolix as a monotherapy to treat advanced prostate cancer. These applications are co-owned with Takeda under the Takeda License Agreement. These patent applications, if issued, would expire in 2037 subject to any adjustment or extension of patent term that may be available in a particular country. 
For MVT-602, we are the exclusive worldwide licensee of multiple patents and patent applications in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. These patents and patent applications cover the MVT-602 molecule and its use in treating advanced prostate cancer, as well as certain sustained release formulations containing MVT-602. The patent family directed to the MVT-602 molecule and method of use expires in 2028 in the U.S. (because of PTA) and in 2026 ex-U.S., subject to any adjustment or extension of patent term that may be available in a particular country. The patents and patent applications directed to sustained-release formulations of MVT-602, if issued, would expire between 2030 and 2031, subject to any adjustment or extension of patent term that may be available in a particular country. We intend to apply for PTE for a patent covering MVT-602. If granted, the patent term covering MVT-602 may be extended. We are also the owner of patent applications directed to uses of MVT-602 in treating infertility. These applications, if issued, would expire in 2037 subject to any adjustment or extension of patent term that may be available in a particular country.
In addition to patents, we also rely upon trademarks, trade secrets, know-how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position. We maintain both registered and common law trademarks. Common law trademark protection typically continues where and for as long as the mark is used. Registered trademarks continue in each country for as long as the trademark is registered. We seek to protect our proprietary information, in part, using confidentiality agreements with our commercial partners, collaborators, employees and consultants, and invention assignment agreements with our employees. We also have confidentiality agreements or invention assignment agreements with our commercial partners and selected consultants. These agreements may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors. To the extent that our commercial partners, collaborators, employees, and consultants use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions.
Obtaining patents does not guarantee our right to practice the patented technology or commercialize the patented product. Third parties may have or obtain rights to patents which could be used to prevent or attempt to prevent us from commercializing our product candidates. If third parties prepare and file patent applications in the U.S. that also claim technology to which we have rights, we may have to participate in interference or derivation proceedings in the USPTO to determine priority of invention.
Government Regulation
FDA Drug Approval Process 
In the U.S., pharmaceutical products are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, and other federal and state statutes and regulations, govern, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, storage, recordkeeping, approval, labeling, promotion and marketing, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, sampling, and import and export of pharmaceutical products. Failure to comply with applicable U.S. requirements may subject a company to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as FDA refusal to approve pending NDAs, warning or untitled letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, civil penalties, and criminal prosecution. 
We cannot market a drug product candidate in the U.S. until the drug has received FDA approval. The steps required before a drug may be marketed in the U.S. generally include the following:

• | completion of extensive nonclinical laboratory tests, animal studies, and formulation studies in accordance with the FDA’s Good Laboratory Practice, or GLP, regulations;


• | submission to the FDA of an Investigational New Drug, or IND, application for human clinical testing, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;


• | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with Good Clinical Practice, or GCP, requirements to establish the safety and efficacy of the drug for each proposed indication;

19


• | submission to the FDA of an NDA after completion of all pivotal clinical trials;


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the active pharmaceutical ingredient, or API, and finished drug product are produced and tested to assess compliance with Good Manufacturing Practice, or GMP, requirements; and


• | FDA review and approval of the NDA prior to any commercial marketing or sale of the drug in the U.S.

Satisfaction of FDA pre-marketing approval requirements typically takes many years and the actual time required may vary substantially based upon the type, complexity, and novelty of the product or disease. 
Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, formulation, and toxicity, as well as animal trials to assess the characteristics and potential safety and efficacy of the product. The conduct of the nonclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements, including GLP regulations. The results of nonclinical testing are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND along with other information, including information about product chemistry, manufacturing and controls, and a proposed clinical trial protocol. Long-term nonclinical tests, such as animal tests of reproductive toxicity and carcinogenicity, may continue after the IND is submitted. 
A 30-day waiting period after the submission of each IND is required prior to the commencement of clinical testing in humans. If the FDA has neither commented on nor questioned the IND within this 30-day period, the clinical trial proposed in the IND may begin. If the FDA raises concerns or questions about the conduct of the trial, such as whether human research subjects will be exposed to an unreasonable health risk, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding FDA concerns or questions before clinical trials can proceed. 
Clinical trials involve the administration of an investigational new drug to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of a qualified investigator. Clinical trials must be conducted in compliance with federal regulations, including GCP requirements, as well as under protocols detailing the objectives of the trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety, and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. Each protocol and subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. 
The FDA may order the temporary or permanent discontinuation of a clinical trial at any time or impose other sanctions if it believes that the clinical trial either is not being conducted in accordance with FDA requirements or presents an unacceptable risk to the clinical trial patients. The study protocol and informed consent information for patients in clinical trials must also be submitted to an institutional review board, or IRB, for approval at each site at which the clinical trial will be conducted. An IRB may also require the clinical trial at the site to be halted, either temporarily or permanently, for failure to comply with the IRB’s requirements, or may impose other conditions.
Clinical trials to support NDAs for marketing approval are typically conducted in three sequential phases, but the phases may overlap. In Phase 1, the initial introduction of the drug into healthy human subjects or patients, the drug is tested to assess pharmacological actions, side effects associated with increasing doses, and, if possible, early evidence on effectiveness. Other Phase 1 studies are usually conducted to understand the absorption, distribution, and metabolism of the drug in special populations and to characterize potential for drug-drug interaction or food effects. Phase 2 usually involves trials in a limited patient population to determine metabolism, pharmacokinetics, the effectiveness of the drug for a particular indication, dosage tolerance, and optimum dosage, and to identify common adverse effects and safety risks. If a compound demonstrates evidence of effectiveness and an acceptable safety profile in Phase 2 evaluations, Phase 3 clinical trials, also called pivotal or registration trials, are undertaken to obtain the additional information about clinical efficacy and safety in a larger number of patients, typically at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, to permit the FDA to evaluate the overall benefit-risk relationship of the drug and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the drug. In most cases, the FDA requires two adequate and well-controlled Phase 3 clinical trials to demonstrate the efficacy of the drug. A single Phase 3 clinical trial with other confirmatory evidence may be sufficient in rare instances where the study is a large multicenter trial demonstrating internal consistency and a statistically very persuasive finding of a clinically meaningful effect on mortality, irreversible morbidity, or prevention of a disease with a potentially serious outcome and where confirmation of the result in a second trial would be practically or ethically impossible.
After completion of the required clinical testing, an NDA is prepared and submitted to the FDA. FDA approval of the NDA is required before marketing of the product may begin in the U.S. The NDA must include the results of all nonclinical, clinical, and other testing, and a compilation of data relating to the product’s pharmacology, chemistry, manufacture and controls. The cost of preparing and submitting an NDA is substantial. The submission of most NDAs is additionally subject to a substantial application user fee, and the manufacturer and/or sponsor under an approved NDA are also subject to annual program user fees. These fees are typically increased annually.
20

The FDA has 60 days from its receipt of an NDA to determine whether the application will be accepted for filing based on the agency’s threshold determination that it is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review. The FDA has established internal substantive review goals of ten months for most NDAs once they have been accepted for filing and 6 months for most applications for priority review once they have been accepted for filing. Priority review can be applied to drugs to treat serious conditions that the FDA determines offer significant improvement in safety or effectiveness. The review process for both standard and priority review may be extended by the FDA for three additional months to consider certain late-submitted information, or information intended to clarify information already provided in the submission.
The FDA may also refer applications for novel drug products, or drug products that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy, to an advisory committee—typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts—for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it generally follows such recommendations. Before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP requirements. Additionally, the FDA will inspect the facility or the facilities at which the drug is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the product unless compliance with GMP requirements is satisfactory and the NDA contains data that provide substantial evidence that the drug is safe and effective in the indication studied.
After the FDA evaluates the NDA and the manufacturing facilities, it issues either an approval letter or a complete response letter. A complete response letter generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing, or information, in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. If, or when, those deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA’s satisfaction in a resubmission of the NDA, the FDA will issue an approval letter. The FDA has committed to reviewing such resubmissions in two or six months depending on the type of information included.
An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications. As a condition of NDA approval, the FDA may require a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, to ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh the potential risks. A REMS can include a medication guide, a communication plan for healthcare professionals, and elements to assure safe use, such as special training and certification requirements for individuals who prescribe or dispense the drug, requirements that patients enroll in a registry, and other measures that the FDA deems necessary to assure the safe use of the drug. The requirement for a REMS can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the drug. Moreover, product approval may require substantial post-approval testing and surveillance to monitor the drug’s safety or efficacy. Once granted, product approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or problems are identified following initial marketing.
Changes to some of the conditions established in an approved application, including changes in indications, labeling, or manufacturing processes or facilities, require submission and FDA approval of a new NDA or NDA supplement before the change can be implemented. An NDA supplement for a new indication typically requires clinical data similar to that in the original application, and the FDA uses the same procedures and actions in reviewing NDA supplements as it does in reviewing NDAs. Such supplements are typically reviewed within 10 months of receipt.
Post-Approval Requirements 
Once an NDA is approved, a product is subject to post-approval requirements. For instance, the FDA closely regulates the post-approval marketing and promotion of drugs, including standards and regulations for direct-to-consumer advertising, off-label promotion, industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities, and promotional activities involving the Internet and social media. Drugs may be marketed only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved labeling. However, companies may share truthful and not misleading information that is otherwise consistent with a product’s FDA approved labeling.
Adverse event reporting and submission of periodic reports is required following FDA approval of an NDA. The FDA also may require post-marketing testing, REMS, or surveillance to monitor the effects of an approved product, or restrictions on the distribution or use of the product. In addition, quality-control, drug manufacture, packaging, and labeling procedures must continue to conform to GMP requirements after approval. Drug manufacturers and certain of their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies. Registration with the FDA subjects entities to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA, during which the agency inspects manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with GMP requirements. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the areas of production and quality-control to maintain compliance with GMP requirements. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in, among other things:

• | restrictions on the marketing or manufacture of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market, or product recalls;

21


• | fines, warning letters, or holds on post-approval clinical trials;


• | refusal of the FDA to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications, or suspension or revocation of product approvals;


• | product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; or


• | injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.

Disclosure of Clinical Trial Information
Sponsors of clinical trials of FDA-regulated products, including drugs and biologics, are required to register and disclose certain clinical trial information, which is publicly available at www.clinicaltrials.gov. Information related to the product, patient population, phase of investigation, study sites and investigators, and other aspects of the clinical trial is then made public as part of the registration. Sponsors are also obligated to disclose the results of their clinical trials after completion. Disclosure of the results of these trials can be delayed until the new product or new indication being studied has been approved. Competitors may use this publicly available information to gain knowledge regarding the progress of development programs. 
Foreign Regulation 
In order to market any product outside of the U.S., we would need to comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other countries and jurisdictions regarding quality, safety, and efficacy and governing, among other things, clinical trials, marketing authorization, commercial sales, and distribution of our products. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we would need to obtain the necessary approvals by the comparable foreign regulatory authorities before we can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in foreign countries and jurisdictions. Although many of the issues discussed above with respect to the U.S. apply similarly in the context of the European Union, the approval process varies between countries and jurisdictions and can involve additional product testing and additional administrative review periods. The time required to obtain approval in other countries and jurisdictions might differ from and be longer than that required to obtain FDA approval. Regulatory approval in one country or jurisdiction does not ensure regulatory approval in another, but a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country or jurisdiction may negatively impact the regulatory process in others.
Other Healthcare Laws and Compliance Requirements
Although we currently do not have any products on the market, our current and future business operations may be subject to additional healthcare regulation and enforcement by the federal government and by authorities in the states and foreign jurisdictions in which we conduct our business. Such laws include, without limitation, state and federal anti-kickback, fraud and abuse, false claims, privacy and security, price reporting, and physician sunshine laws. Some of our pre-commercial activities are subject to some of these laws. 
Because we intend to commercialize products that could be reimbursed under a federal healthcare program and other governmental healthcare programs, we are in the process of developing a comprehensive compliance program that establishes internal controls to facilitate adherence to the rules and program requirements to which we will or may become subject. Although the development and implementation of compliance programs designed to establish internal control and facilitate compliance can mitigate the risk of violating these laws, and the subsequent investigation, prosecution, and penalties assessed for violations of these laws, the risks cannot be entirely eliminated. 
If our operations are found to be in violation of any of such laws or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to significant penalties, including, without limitation, administrative, civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, additional reporting requirements, and oversight if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or similar agreement, the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs, and imprisonment, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results. 
22

Anti-Kickback Laws
U.S. federal laws, including the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, prohibit fraud and abuse involving state and federal healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid. These laws are interpreted broadly and enforced aggressively by various federal agencies, including the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, the Department of Justice, and the Office of the Inspector General for the United States Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, and various state agencies. These anti-kickback laws, among other things, make it illegal for any person or entity, including a prescription drug manufacturer or a party acting on its behalf, to knowingly and willfully solicit, receive, offer, or pay any remuneration, directly or indirectly, that is intended to induce the referral of business, including the purchase, order, lease of any good, facility, item, or service for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program, such as Medicare or Medicaid. The term “remuneration” has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value, including cash, improper discounts, and free or reduced-price items and services. The federal Anti-Kickback Statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on one hand and prescribers, purchasers, formulary managers, beneficiaries, and others on the other hand. Although there are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting some common activities from prosecution, the exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly. Practices that involve remuneration that may be alleged to be intended to induce prescribing, purchases, or recommendations may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exception or safe harbor. Failure to meet all of the requirements of a particular applicable statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor does not make the conduct per se illegal under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute. Instead, the legality of the arrangement will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis based on a cumulative review of all its facts and circumstances. Several courts have interpreted the statute’s intent requirement to mean that if any one purpose of an arrangement involving remuneration is to induce referrals of federal healthcare covered business, the federal Anti-Kickback Statute has been violated. 
Additionally, the intent standard under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute was amended by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, collectively the Affordable Care Act, or ACA, to a stricter standard such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. In addition, the ACA codified case law that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act. 
Federal and State Prohibitions on False Claims
The federal civil False Claims Act prohibits, among other things, any person or entity from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, for payment to, or approval by, federal programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, claims for items or services, including drugs, that are false or fraudulent or not provided as claimed. Persons and entities can be held liable under these laws if they are deemed to “cause” the submission of false or fraudulent claims by, for example, providing inaccurate billing or coding information to customers or promoting a product off-label. In addition, certain of our future activities relating to the reporting of wholesaler or estimated retail prices for our products, the reporting of prices used to calculate Medicaid rebate information, and other information affecting federal, state, and third-party payor reimbursement for our products, and the sale and marketing of our products, are subject to scrutiny under this law. Many states have enacted similar laws modeled after the federal civil False Claims Act that apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state healthcare programs, and, in several states, such laws apply to claims submitted to all payors. Given the significant size of actual and potential settlements, it is expected that the government authorities will continue to devote substantial resources to investigating healthcare providers’ and manufacturers’ compliance with applicable fraud and abuse laws.
Federal Prohibitions on Healthcare Fraud and False Statements Related to Healthcare Matters
The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, created new federal civil and criminal statutes that prohibit among other actions, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors, knowingly and willfully embezzling or stealing from a healthcare benefit program, willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a healthcare offense, and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing, or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items, or services. Like the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, the ACA amended the intent standard for certain healthcare fraud statutes under HIPAA such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. 
The civil monetary penalties statute imposes penalties against any person or entity that, among other things, is determined to have presented or caused to be presented a claim to a federal health program that the person knows or should know is for an item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent. 
23

Healthcare Privacy and Security Laws
HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, and their implementing regulations, including the final omnibus rule published on January 25, 2013, mandates, among other things, the adoption of uniform standards for the electronic exchange of information in common healthcare transactions, as well as standards relating to the privacy and security of individually identifiable health information, which require the adoption of administrative, physical, and technical safeguards to protect such information. Among other things, HITECH makes HIPAA’s security standards directly applicable to business associates, defined as independent contractors or agents of covered entities, which includes certain healthcare providers, health plans, and healthcare clearinghouses, that create, receive, or obtain protected health information in connection with providing a service for or on behalf of a covered entity. At present, it is unclear if we would be considered a business associate subject to HIPAA based on our business activities and service offerings upon the commercialization of a product. HITECH also increased the civil and criminal penalties that may be imposed against covered entities and business associates, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorney’s fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. In addition, certain state and foreign laws, regulations, standards and regulatory guidance govern the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, some of which are more stringent than HIPAA and many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts. 
Outside the U.S., our clinical trial programs and research collaborations may implicate international data protection laws, including the General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, in the European Union. The GDPR became effective on May 25, 2018, increasing our responsibility and liability in relation to the processing of personal data of individuals in the EU. The GDPR, together with the national legislation of the EU member states governing the processing of personal data, impose strict obligations and restrictions on the ability to collect, analyze and transfer personal data, including health data from clinical trials and adverse event reporting. In particular, these obligations and restrictions concern the consent of the individuals to whom the personal data relates, the disclosures provided to the individuals, the transfer of personal data out of the EU, security breach notifications, security and confidentiality of the personal data. In addition, violations of the GDPR carry fines of up to the greater of 20 million Euros or 4% of annual global revenue. Data protection authorities from the different EU member states have issued limited guidance, may interpret the GDPR and national laws differently and may impose additional requirements, which complicates the effort to comply with these laws. 
Additionally, California recently enacted legislation that has been referred to as the first “GDPR-like” law in the U.S. Known as the California Consumer Privacy Act, or CCPA, it creates new individual privacy rights for California residents and places increased privacy obligations on entities handling personal data of California residents or households. When it goes into effect on January 1, 2020, the CCPA will give California residents expanded rights to access and require deletion of their personal information, opt out of certain personal information sharing, and receive detailed information about how their personal information is collected, used and shared. The CCPA provides for civil penalties for violations, as well as a private right of action for data breaches that may increase data breach litigation. Although the CCPA includes exemptions for certain clinical trials data, as well as HIPAA protected health information, the law may increase our compliance costs and potential liability with respect to other personal information we collect about California residents. The CCPA has prompted a wave of proposals for new federal and state privacy legislation that, if passed, could increase our potential liability, increase our compliance costs, and adversely affect our business. 
Physician Payments Sunshine Act
The ACA through the enactment of the Physician Payments Sunshine Act, imposes, among other things, annual reporting requirements for covered manufacturers for certain payments and other transfers of value provided to physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as certain ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. 
Many states have similar fraud and abuse statutes or regulations that may be broader in scope and may apply regardless of payor, in addition to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs. We may also be subject to state laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government, state laws that require drug manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers, marketing expenditures, or drug pricing, as well as state and local laws that require the registration of pharmaceutical sales and medical representatives. Additionally, to the extent that any of our products are sold in a foreign country, we may be subject to similar foreign laws.
24

Foreign Corrupt Practices Act
We are subject to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended, or FCPA. The FCPA prohibits U.S. companies and their representatives from processing, offering, or making payments of money or anything of value to foreign officials with the intent to obtain or retain business or seek a business advantage. In certain countries, the health care professionals we regularly interact with may meet the definition of a foreign government official for the purposes of the FCPA. Our international activities create the risk of unauthorized payments or offers of payments by our employees, consultants and agents, even though they may not always be subject to our control. We discourage these practices by our employees, consultants, and agents. However, our existing safeguards may prove to be less than effective, and our employees, consultants, and agents may engage in conduct for which we might be held responsible. Recently, there has been a substantial increase in anti-bribery law enforcement activity by U.S. regulators, with more frequent and aggressive investigations and enforcement activity by both the Department of Justice and the SEC. A determination that our operations or activities are not, or were not, in compliance with U.S. or foreign laws or regulations could result in the imposition of substantial fines, interruptions of business, loss of suppliers, vendor or other third-party relationships, termination of necessary licenses or permits, and legal or equitable sanctions. Other internal or governmental investigations or legal or regulatory proceedings, including lawsuits brought by private litigants, may also follow as a consequence. 
Other Applicable Laws
We are subject to a variety of financial disclosure and securities trading regulations as a public company in the U.S., including laws relating to the oversight activities of the SEC and the regulations of the New York Stock Exchange, on which our common shares are traded. 
We are also subject to various other federal, state, and local laws and regulations, including those related to safe working conditions, and the storage, transportation, or discharge of items that may be considered hazardous substances, hazardous waste, or environmental contaminants. 
Our operations extend to countries around the world, and many of these jurisdictions have established privacy legal frameworks with which we, our customers or our vendors must comply.
Health Reform 
The U.S. and certain foreign jurisdictions are considering or have enacted a number of legislative and regulatory proposals to change the healthcare system in ways that could affect our future results of operations and our ability to sell our product candidates profitably, even if approved for sale. Among policy makers and payors in the U.S. and elsewhere, there is significant interest in promoting changes in healthcare systems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs, improving quality, and/or expanding access. In the U.S., the pharmaceutical industry has been a particular focus of these efforts and has been significantly affected by major legislative initiatives. 
25

In particular, the ACA has had, and is expected to continue to have, a significant impact on the healthcare industry. The ACA was designed to expand coverage for the uninsured while at the same time containing overall healthcare costs. Some of the provisions of the ACA have yet to be implemented, and there have been judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the ACA, as well as recent efforts by the Trump administration to repeal or replace certain aspects of the ACA. Since January 2017, President Trump has signed two Executive Orders and other directives designed to delay the implementation of certain provisions of the ACA or otherwise circumvent some of the requirements for health insurance mandated by the ACA. Concurrently, Congress has considered legislation that would repeal or repeal and replace all or part of the ACA. While Congress has not passed comprehensive repeal legislation, two bills affecting the implementation of certain taxes under the ACA have been signed into law. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, or the Tax Act, included a provision which repealed, effective January 1, 2019, the tax-based shared responsibility payment imposed by the ACA on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year that is commonly referred to as the “individual mandate.” On January 22, 2018, President Trump signed a continuing resolution on appropriations for fiscal year 2018 that delayed the implementation of certain ACA- mandated fees including the so called “Cadillac” tax on certain higher cost employer-sponsored insurance plans, the annual fee imposed on certain health insurance providers based on market share, and the medical device excise tax on non-exempt medical devices. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, or the BBA, among other things, amended the ACA, effective January 1, 2019, to close the coverage gap in most Medicare drug plans, commonly referred to as the “donut hole,” and increased, effective January 1, 2019, from 50% to 70% the point-of-sale discount that is owed by pharmaceutical manufacturers who participate in the Medicare Part D program. In July 2018, CMS published a final rule permitting further collections and payments to and from certain ACA qualified health plans and health insurance issuers under the ACA risk adjustment program in response to the outcome of federal district court litigation regarding the method CMS uses to determine this risk adjustment. On December 14, 2018, a Texas U.S. District Court Judge ruled that the ACA is unconstitutional in its entirety because the “individual mandate” was repealed by Congress as part of the Tax Act. The Texas U.S. District Court Judge, as well as the Trump administration and CMS, have stated that the ruling will have no immediate effect pending appeal of the decision. 
Further, there has been heightened government scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed pharmaceutical products. Such scrutiny has resulted in several recent Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to pharmaceutical product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for products. For example, at the federal level, the Trump administration released a “Blueprint” to lower drug prices and reduce out of pocket costs of drugs and contains additional proposals to increase manufacturing competition, increase the negotiating power of certain federal healthcare programs, incentivize manufacturers to lower the list price of their products and reduce the out-of-pocket costs of drug products paid by consumers. On January 31, 2019, the HHS Office of Inspector General proposed modifications to federal Anti-Kickback Statute safe harbors for the purpose of reducing the cost of drug products to consumers which, among other things, if finalized, will affect discounts paid by manufacturers to Medicare Part D plans, Medicaid managed care organizations and pharmacy benefit managers working with these organizations. Although a number of these, and other proposed measures may require authorization through additional legislation to become effective, Congress and the Trump administration have each indicated that it will continue to seek new legislative and/or administrative measures to control drug costs. At the state level, legislatures have also increasingly passed legislation and implemented regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. There may be additional challenges and amendments to the ACA in the future. 
Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the ACA was enacted. These changes include aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year pursuant to the Budget Control Act of 2011, which began in 2013, and due to subsequent legislative amendments to the statute, including the BBA, will remain in effect through 2027 unless additional Congressional action is taken. The American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals and cancer treatment centers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years.
Further, on May 30, 2018, the Trickett Wendler, Frank Mongiello, Jordan McLinn, and Matthew Bellina Right to Try Act of 2017, or the Right to Try Act, was signed into law. The law, among other things, provides a federal framework for certain patients to access certain investigational new drug products that have completed a Phase I clinical trial and that are undergoing investigation for FDA approval. Under certain circumstances, eligible patients can seek treatment without enrolling in clinical trials and without obtaining FDA permission under the FDA expanded access program. There is no obligation for a pharmaceutical manufacturer to make its drug products available to eligible patients as a result of the Right to Try Act.

Moreover, the Drug Supply Chain Security Act imposes new obligations on manufacturers of pharmaceutical products, among others, related to product tracking and tracing, which is being phased in over several years beginning in 2015. Among the requirements of this new legislation, manufacturers will be required to provide certain information regarding the drug product to individuals and entities to which product ownership is transferred, label drug product with a product identifier, and keep certain records regarding the drug product. The transfer of information to subsequent product owners by manufacturers will eventually be required to be done electronically. Manufacturers will also be required to verify that purchasers of the manufacturers’ products are appropriately licensed. Further, under this new legislation, manufacturers will have drug product investigation, quarantine, disposition, and notification responsibilities related to counterfeit, diverted, stolen, and intentionally adulterated products, as well as products that are the subject of fraudulent transactions or which are otherwise unfit for distribution such that they would be reasonably likely to result in serious health consequences or death.
Coverage and Reimbursement 
Sales of our products, if and when approved, will depend, in part, on the extent to which the costs of our products will be covered by third-party payors, such as government healthcare programs, private health insurers, and managed care organizations. Third-party payors generally decide which drugs they will cover and establish certain reimbursement levels for such drugs. In particular, in the U.S., private health insurers and other third-party payors often provide reimbursement for products and services based on the level at which the government (through the Medicare or Medicaid programs) provides reimbursement for such treatments. Patients who are prescribed treatments for their conditions and providers performing the prescribed services generally rely on third-party payors to reimburse all or part of the associated healthcare costs. Patients are unlikely to use our products, if and when approved, unless coverage is provided and reimbursement is adequate to cover a significant portion of the cost of our products. Sales of our product candidates, and those of any future product candidate, will therefore depend substantially on the extent to which the costs of our product candidates, and those of any future product candidate, will be paid by third-party payors. Additionally, the market for our product candidates, and those of any future product candidate, will depend significantly on access to third-party payors’ formularies without prior authorization, step therapy, or other limitations such as approved lists of treatments for which third-party payors provide coverage and reimbursement. Additionally, coverage and reimbursement for therapeutic products can differ significantly from payor to payor. One third-party payor’s decision to cover a particular medical product or service does not ensure that other payors will also provide coverage for the medical product or service, or will provide coverage at an adequate reimbursement rate. As a result, the coverage determination process will require us to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of our products to each payor separately and will likely be a time-consuming process.
Third-party payors are developing increasingly sophisticated methods of controlling healthcare costs and challenging the prices charged for medical products and services. Additionally, the containment of healthcare costs (including drug prices) has become a priority of federal and state governments. The U.S. government, state legislatures, and foreign governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement, and requirements for substitution by generic products. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could limit our net revenue and results. If these third-party payors do not consider our products to be cost-effective compared to other therapies, they may not cover our products once approved as a benefit under their plans or, if they do, the level of reimbursement may not be sufficient to allow us to sell our products on a profitable basis. Decreases in third-party reimbursement for our products once approved or a decision by a third-party payor to not cover our products could reduce or eliminate utilization of our products and have an adverse effect on our sales, results of operations, and financial condition. In addition, state and federal healthcare reform measures have been and will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services, which could result in reduced demand for our products once approved or additional pricing pressures.
Brexit and the Regulatory Framework in the United Kingdom
In June 2016, the United Kingdom, or UK, held a referendum in which voters approved an exit from the EU, commonly referred to as “Brexit.” This referendum has created political and economic uncertainty, particularly in the UK and the EU, and this uncertainty may persist for years. Since the regulatory framework for pharmaceutical products in the UK covering quality, safety and efficacy of pharmaceutical products, clinical trials, marketing authorization, commercial sales and distribution of pharmaceutical products is derived from EU directives and regulations, Brexit could materially impact the future regulatory regime which applies to products and the approval of product candidates in the United Kingdom. In addition, withdrawal could, among other outcomes, disrupt the free movement of goods, services and people between the UK and the EU, and result in increased legal and regulatory complexities, as well as potential higher costs of conducting business in Europe. This is particularly the case if the UK and the EU do not reach agreement on how the UK will exit the EU, commonly referred to as “hard Brexit.” The UK’s vote to exit the EU could also result in similar referendums or votes in other European countries in which we do business. Given the lack of comparable precedent, it is unclear what financial, trade and legal implications the withdrawal of the UK from the EU would have and how such withdrawal would affect us.

Financial History
We have incurred, and expect to continue to incur, significant operating losses and negative cash flows as we continue to develop our product candidates and prepare for potential future regulatory approvals and commercialization of relugolix. To date, we have not generated any revenue, and we do not expect to generate revenue unless and until we successfully complete development and obtain regulatory approval for at least one of our product candidates. We have funded our operations primarily from the issuance and sale of our common shares, from the issuance of notes to NovaQuest Capital Management, or NovaQuest, and the funds received from the Term Loans with Hercules Capital, Inc., or Hercules. 
A significant portion of our operating expense is related to R&D activities. Our R&D activities primarily include activities related to the Phase 3 development of our lead product candidate, relugolix, for the treatment of heavy menstrual bleeding associated with uterine fibroids, pain associated with endometriosis, and advanced prostate cancer, as well as activities related to the development of MVT-602 for the treatment of female infertility as part of assisted reproduction.
