ITEM 1.    BUSINESS.
OVERVIEW
Pennsylvania Real Estate Investment Trust, a Pennsylvania business trust founded in 1960 and one of the first equity real estate investment trusts (“REITs”) in the United States, has a primary investment focus on retail shopping malls located in the eastern half of the United States, primarily in the Mid-Atlantic region.
We currently own interests in 27 retail properties, of which 25 are operating properties and two are development or redevelopment properties. The 25 operating properties include 21 shopping malls and four other retail properties, have a total of 20.1 million square feet and are located in nine states. We and partnerships in which we hold an interest own 15.7 million square feet at these properties (excluding space owned by anchors or third parties). 
There are 19 operating retail properties in our portfolio that we consolidate for financial reporting purposes. These consolidated properties have a total of 16.0 million square feet, of which we own 12.9 million square feet. The six operating retail properties that are owned by unconsolidated partnerships with third parties have a total of 4.1 million square feet, of which 2.8 million square feet are owned by such partnerships.
We have one property under redevelopment classified as “retail” (redevelopment of The Gallery at Market East into Fashion District Philadelphia). This redevelopment is expected to open in 2019 and stabilize in 2021. We have one property in our portfolio that is classified as under development, however we do not currently have any activity occurring at this property. 
The above property counts do not include undeveloped land parcels located in Gainesville, Florida and New Garden Township, Pennsylvania because these properties were classified as “held for sale” as of December 31, 2018.
We are a fully integrated, self-managed and self-administered REIT that has elected to be treated as a REIT for federal income tax purposes. In general, we are required each year to distribute to our shareholders at least 90% of our net taxable income and to meet certain other requirements in order to maintain the favorable tax treatment associated with qualifying as a REIT.
PREIT’S BUSINESS
We are primarily engaged in the ownership, management, leasing, acquisition, redevelopment, and disposition of shopping malls. In general, our malls include tenants that are national or regional department stores, large format retailers or other anchors and a diverse mix of national, regional and local in-line stores offering apparel (women’s, family, teen, children’s, men’s), shoes, eyewear, cards and gifts, jewelry, sporting goods, home furnishings and personal care items, among other things. In recent years, we have increased the portion of our mall properties that is leased to non-traditional mall tenants. Approximately 23% of our mall space is committed to non traditional tenants offering services such as dining and entertainment, health and wellness, off price retail and fast fashion.
To enhance the experience for shoppers, most of our malls have restaurants and/or food courts, and some of the malls have multi-screen movie theaters and other entertainment options, either as part of the mall or on outparcels around the perimeter of the mall property. In addition, many of our malls have outparcels containing restaurants, banks or other stores. Our malls frequently serve as a central place for community, promotional and charitable events in their geographic trade areas.
The largest mall in our retail portfolio is 1.4 million square feet and contains 169 stores, and the smallest mall is 0.5 million square feet and contains 76 stores. The other properties in our retail portfolio range from 370,000 to 780,000 square feet.
We derive the substantial majority of our revenue from rent received under leases with tenants for space at retail properties in our real estate portfolio. In general, our leases require tenants to pay minimum rent, which is a fixed amount specified in the lease, and which is often subject to scheduled increases during the term of the lease for longer term leases. In 2018, 86% of the new leases that we signed contained scheduled rent increases, and these increases, which are typically scheduled to occur between two and four times during the term, ranged from 1.5% to 19.7%, with approximately 87% ranging from 2.0% to 4.0%. In addition or in the alternative, certain tenants are required to pay percentage rent, which can be either a percentage of their sales revenue that exceeds certain levels specified in their lease agreements, or a percentage of their total sales revenue. 
The majority of our leases also provide that the tenant will reimburse us for certain expenses relating to the property for common area maintenance (“CAM”), real estate taxes, utilities, insurance and other operating expenses incurred in the operation of the property subject, in some cases, to certain limitations. The proportion of the expenses for which tenants are responsible was historically related to the tenant’s pro rata share of space at the property. We have continued to shift the CAM 
2


provision in our leases to be a fixed amount, which gives greater predictability to tenants, and a majority of such revenue is derived from leases specifying fixed CAM reimbursements. 
Retail real estate industry participants sometimes classify malls based on the average sales per square foot of non-anchor mall tenants occupying spaces under 10,000 square feet in size, the population and average household income of the trade area and the geographic market, the growth rates of the population and average household income in the trade area and geographic market, and numerous other factors. Based on these factors, in general, malls that have high average sales per square foot and are in trade areas with large populations and high household incomes and/or growth rates are considered Class A malls, malls with average sales per square foot that are in the middle range of population or household income and/or growth rates are considered Class B malls, and malls with lower average sales and smaller populations and lower household incomes and/or growth rates are considered Class C malls. Although these classifications are defined differently by different market participants, in general, most of our malls would be classified as Class A or Class B properties. The classification of a mall can change, and one of the goals of our current property strategic plans and remerchandising programs is to increase the average sales per square foot of certain of our properties and correspondingly increase their rental income and cash flows, and thus potentially their class, in order to maximize the value of the property. The malls that we have sold over the past several years pursuant to our strategic property disposition program generally have been Class C properties. 
BUSINESS STRATEGY 
Our primary objective is to maximize the long-term value of the Company for our shareholders. To that end, our business goals are to obtain the highest possible rental income, tenant sales and occupancy at our properties in order to maximize our cash flows, net operating income, funds from operations, funds available for distribution to shareholders and other operating measures and results, and ultimately to maximize the values of our properties. 
To achieve this primary goal, we have developed a business strategy focused on increasing the values of our properties, and ultimately of the Company, which includes: 

• | Raising the overall level of quality of our portfolio and of individual properties in our portfolio;


• | Improving the operating results of our properties;


• | Taking steps to position the Company for future growth opportunities; and


• | Improving our balance sheet by reducing debt and leverage, and maintaining a solid liquidity position.

Raising the Overall Level of Quality of Our Portfolio and of Individual Properties in Our Portfolio 
Portfolio Actions. We continue to refine our collection of properties to enhance the overall quality of the portfolio. We seek to have a portfolio that derives most of its NOI (a non-GAAP measure; as defined below) from higher productivity properties and from properties located in major metropolitan markets. We hold ownership interests in 10 properties in the Philadelphia metro area, four properties in the Washington, D.C. metro area and one property in the Boston-Providence metro area. One method we have used and continue to use for raising the level of quality of our portfolio is disposing of assets that had certain economic features, such as sales productivity or occupancy levels below the average for our portfolio and significantly lower expected income due to anchor closures. In 2018, we designated the following three properties as non core malls (“Non Core Malls” or “Non Core Properties”): (1) Exton Square Mall, because we have completed the first phase of a redevelopment with the opening of Whole Foods and the sale of a land parcel to a multifamily developer as part of our densification effort (as discussed below) and as we consider the possible inclusion of other non-retail uses on the site; (2) Valley View Mall, which currently has three vacant anchors and where we are evaluating strategic options for the property; and (3) Wyoming Valley Mall, which is financed with a non-recourse mortgage loan and with respect to which we are working with the special servicer regarding a potential deed in lieu of foreclosure.
Redevelopment. We might also seek to improve particular properties, to increase the potential value of properties in our portfolio, and to maintain or enhance their competitive positions by redeveloping them. We do so in order to make the properties more attractive to customers and retailers, which we expect to lead to increases in shopper traffic, sales, occupancy and rental rates. Redevelopments are generally more involved than strategic property plans or remerchandising programs and require the investment of capital. We give redevelopment priority to properties in our portfolio that are of a higher quality, and where the redevelopment can be economically transformative. Our property redevelopments focus primarily on anchor replacement and remerchandising. We believe these activities will enable us to optimize our financial returns.

(2) Total Project Costs are net of $25.0 million of approved public financing grants that are reflected as a reduction of costs.
Densification. We seek to maximize the value of our retail properties by adding other uses where appropriate. We believe that by incorporating residential, hotel or office uses into some of our retail properties, we will increase the value of those properties. The addition of other property types to our sites may provide synergies to both the retail and non-retail uses. The presence of residents, hotel guests or office workers in close proximity to the retail center may result in additional visits to the 
4


retail property. The shopping, dining and entertainment offerings of a retail center provide amenities that could increase the relative value of the other uses. In November 2018, we sold a four-acre parcel of land adjacent to our Exton Square Mall to a residential developer who expects to construct approximately 300 multifamily units on that site. The residential project is expected to open in 2019. We are currently pursuing other residential, hotel and office uses at several of our properties.
Since 2014, we, along with our 50/50 joint venture partner, The Macerich Company (“Macerich”), have been engaged in a redevelopment of Fashion District Philadelphia (formerly The Gallery). In connection therewith, we contributed and sold real estate assets to the venture and Macerich acquired its interest in the venture and real estate from us for $106.8 million in cash. We and Macerich are jointly and severally responsible for a minimum investment in the project of $300.0 million. Fashion District Philadelphia is in a key location in central Philadelphia, strategically positioned above regional mass transit, adjacent to the convention center and tourism sites, and amidst numerous offices and residential sites.
In January 2018, we along with Macerich, entered into a $250.0 million term loan (the “FDP Term Loan”). The initial term of the FDP Term Loan is five years and bears interest at a variable rate of 2.00% over LIBOR. PREIT and Macerich secured the FDP Term Loan by pledging their respective equity interests of 50% each in the entities that own Fashion District Philadelphia. The entire $250.0 million available under the FDP Term Loan was drawn during the first quarter of 2018, and we received an aggregate $123.0 million as a distribution of our share of the draws in 2018.
An important aspect of any redevelopment project, including the redevelopment of Fashion District Philadelphia, is its effect on the property and on the tenants and customers during the time that a redevelopment is taking place. While we might undertake a redevelopment to maximize the long term performance of the property, in the short term, the operations and performance of the property, as measured by sales, occupancy and NOI, will often be negatively affected. Tenants might be relocated or closed as space for the redevelopment is aggregated, which affects overall tenant sales and rental rates. As Fashion District Philadelphia was being redeveloped, occupancy, sales and NOI decreased from their levels prior to the commencement of the redevelopment. Those trends are expected to reverse when the newly constructed space is completed, leased and occupied. As of December 31, 2018, the retail portion of Fashion District Philadelphia that was formerly known as Gallery I, Gallery II and 907 Market was closed. Only two retail tenants, Burlington and Century 21, remained open and operating during the redevelopment. We currently expect to reopen the property in September 2019. Through December 31, 2018, we had incurred costs of $167.4 million relating to our share of the redevelopment costs of the project.
Mall-Specific Plans. We seek to unlock value in our portfolio through a variety of targeted efforts at our properties. We believe that certain of our properties, including ones which are in trade areas around major cities or are leading properties in secondary markets, can benefit from strategic remerchandising strategies, including, for example, selective re-tenanting of certain spaces in certain properties with higher quality, better-matched tenants. Based on the demographics of the trade area or the relevant competition, we believe that this subset of properties provides opportunities for meaningful value creation at the property level. We believe that we can successfully implement particular strategies at these assets by incorporating in-demand uses such as dining, entertainment and fitness, adding discount, specialty, fast fashion and native internet retailer tenants, and by closing, relocating and right-sizing certain existing mall tenants. Some examples of in-demand tenants include Apple and The Cheesecake Factory. We also continuously work to optimize the match between the demographics of the trade area, such as the household income level, and the nature and mix of tenants at such properties. We strive to work closely with tenants to enhance their merchandising opportunities at our properties. We believe that these approaches can attract more national and other tenants to the property and can lead to higher occupancy and NOI. 
Shopper Experiences. In addition to such property-wide remerchandising efforts, we also seek to offer unique shopper experiences at our properties by having tenants that provide products, services or interactions that are unlike other offerings in the trade area. We seek to add first-to-market tenants, dining and entertainment options, beauty and fashion purveyors, off-price retail, traditionally online retailers and health and fitness destinations such as Legoland Discovery Center, Peloton, HomeSense, Dave & Buster's, Balsam Hill and the 1776 retail incubator, among others, as well as providing amenities like children’s play areas and mall shopping smartphone apps.
Vacant Anchor Replacements. In recent years, through property dispositions, proactive store recaptures, lease terminations and other activities, we have made efforts to reduce our risks associated with certain department store concentrations. Since 2012, we reduced the number of Sears locations from 27 to 6, and the number of Macy’s locations from 25 to 14.
From the beginning of 2015 through December 31, 2018, 13 department stores within our portfolio were recaptured or closed. To date, all or a significant portion of these former department stores have tenants that either opened, are currently under construction, or have leases that are executed or near execution. In one case, a replacement anchor tenant at Valley View Mall subsequently closed in the third quarter of 2018. During the third and fourth quarters of 2018, three additional department

stores closed at Valley View Mall and Wyoming Valley Mall. No replacement tenants have been identified to replace the vacant anchor stores at these two properties. The status of our anchor replacements at our other properties is summarized in the table below.

Improving the Operating Results of Our Properties 
We aim to improve the overall operational performance of our portfolio of properties with a multi-pronged approach. 
Occupancy. We continue to work to increase non-anchor and total occupancy in our properties. From 2017 to 2018, total occupancy for our retail portfolio including consolidated and unconsolidated properties (and including all tenants irrespective of the term of their agreement) decreased 270 basis points to 92.7%, and total occupancy at our malls other than the Non Core Malls and Fashion District Philadelphia, which is under redevelopment (such other malls being called the “Core Malls”) decreased 30 basis points to 96.0%. 
In connection with the remerchandising plans at several of our properties, we are seeking or have obtained tenants for new space of different types, such as pads or kiosks. We are also seeking tenants that have not previously been prevalent at our mall properties. 
6


Key Tenants; Mall Leasing. We continue to recruit, and expand our relationships with, certain high profile retailers, and to initiate and expand our relationships with other quality and first-to-market retailers or concepts. We coordinate closely with tenants on new store locations in an effort to position our properties for our tenants’ latest concept or store prototype, in order to drive traffic to our malls and stimulate customer spending. We believe that increasing our occupancy in ways that are tailored to particular properties will be helpful to our leasing efforts and will help increase rental rates and tenant sales. We have also diversified the mix of tenants within our portfolio, with approximately 23% of our mall space committed to non traditional tenants offering services such as dining and entertainment, health and wellness, off price retail and fast fashion.
Rental Rates and Releasing Spreads. For the year ended December 31, 2018, we generated sales per square foot of $510 from our Core Malls, an increase of 3.4% from 2017. At properties with improved or already higher sales per square foot, these sales levels have helped attract new tenants and helped us retain current tenants that seek to take advantage of the property’s increased productivity. We have worked to capitalize on the increase in, or high level of, sales per square foot by seeking positive rent renewal spreads, including from renewals and new leases following expirations of leases entered into during the economic downturn of past years. In 2018, total renewal spreads increased 6.9% on all non-anchor leases.
As discussed above, since 2012, we sold 17 low-productivity or underperforming malls. We believe that the disposition of these less productive assets will help improve our negotiating position with retailers with multiple stores in our portfolio (including stores at these properties), and potentially enable us to obtain higher rental rates from them at our remaining properties. 
Specialty Leasing and Partnership Marketing. Some space at our properties might be available for a shorter period of time, pending a lease with a permanent tenant or in connection with a redevelopment. We strive to manage the use of this space through our specialty leasing function, which manages the short term leasing of stores and the licensing of income-generating carts and kiosks, with the goal of maximizing the rent we receive during the period when a space is not subject to a longer term lease. 
We also seek to generate ancillary revenue (such as sponsorship marketing revenue and promotional income) from the properties in our portfolio. We believe that increased efforts in this area can enable us to increase the proportion of net operating income derived from ancillary revenue. 
Operating Expenses and CAM Reimbursements. Our strategy for improving operating results also includes efforts to control or reduce the costs of operating our properties. With respect to operating expenses, we have taken steps to manage a significant proportion of them through contracts with third party vendors for housekeeping and maintenance, security services, landscaping and trash removal. These contracts provide reasonable control, certainty and predictability. We also seek to contain certain expenses through our active programs for managing utility expense and real estate taxes. We have taken advantage of opportunities to buy electricity economically in states that have opened their energy markets to competition, and we expect to continue with this approach. We have instituted a solar energy program at five of our properties, which we expect will lower our utility expenses and reduce our carbon footprint. We also review the annual tax assessments of our properties and, when appropriate, pursue appeals.
With respect to CAM reimbursements, we have converted most of our leases to fixed CAM reimbursement, in contrast to the traditional pro-rata CAM reimbursement. Fixed CAM reimbursement, while shifting some risk to us as landlord, offers tenants increased predictability of their costs, a decrease in the number of items to be negotiated in a lease thus speeding lease execution, and reduced need for detailed CAM billings, reconciliations and collections. 
Taking Steps to Position the Company for Future Growth Opportunities 
We are taking steps to position the Company to generate future growth. In connection therewith, we have implemented processes designed to ensure strong internal discipline in the use, harvesting and recycling of our capital, and these processes will be applied in connection with proposals to redevelop properties or to reposition properties with a mix of uses, or possibly, in the future, to acquire additional properties.
External Opportunities. We seek to acquire, in an opportunistic, selective and disciplined manner, properties that are well-located, that are in trade areas with growing or stable demographics, that have operating metrics that are better than or equal to our existing portfolio averages, and that we believe have strong potential for increased cash flows and appreciation in value if we call upon our relationships with retailers and apply our skills in asset management and redevelopment. We also seek to acquire additional parcels or properties that are included within, or adjacent to, the properties already in our portfolio, in order to gain greater control over the merchandising and tenant mix of a property. Taking advantage of any acquisition opportunities will likely involve some use of debt or equity capital. 
7


We pursue development of retail and mixed use projects that we expect can meet the financial and strategic criteria we apply, given economic, market and other circumstances. We seek to leverage our skill sets in site selection, entitlement and planning, design, cost estimation and project management to develop new retail and mixed use properties. We seek properties in trade areas that we believe have sufficient demand, once developed, to generate cash flows that meet the financial thresholds we establish in the given environment. We manage all aspects of these undertakings, including market and trade area research, acquisition, preliminary development work, construction and leasing. 
Depending on the nature of the acquisition or development opportunity, we might involve a partner, including in connection with projects involving a use other than retail. 
In light of the redevelopment and densification opportunities in our existing portfolio and the capital required to complete these investments, together with a limited availability of properties that meet our investment criteria, we are not currently emphasizing external opportunities as part of our growth strategy. 
Organic Opportunities. We look for ways to maximize the value of our assets by adding a mix of uses, such as office or multi-family residential housing, initiated either by ourselves or with a partner, that are designed to attract a greater number of people to the property. Multiple constituencies, from local governments to city planners to citizen groups, have indicated a preference for in-place development, development near transportation hubs, the addition of uses to existing properties, and sustainable development, as opposed to locating, acquiring and developing new green field sites. Also, if appropriate, we will seek to attract certain nontraditional tenants to these properties, including tenants using the space for purposes such as entertainment, education, health care, government and child care, which can bring larger numbers of people to the property, as well as regional, local or nontraditional retailers. Such uses will, we believe, increase traffic and enable us to generate additional revenue and grow the value of the property. 
Improving Our Balance Sheet by Reducing Debt and Leverage; Maintaining Liquidity 
Leverage. We continue to seek ways to reduce our leverage by improving our operating performance and through a variety of other means available to us. These means might include selling properties or interests in properties with values in excess of their mortgage loans and applying any excess proceeds to debt reduction; entering into joint ventures or other partnerships or arrangements involving our contribution of assets; issuing common or preferred equity or equity-related securities if market conditions are favorable; or through other actions.
Mortgage Loan Refinancings and Repayments. We might pursue opportunities to make favorable changes to individual mortgage loans on our properties. When we refinance such loans, we might seek a new term, better rates and excess proceeds. An aspect of our approach to debt financing is that we strive to lengthen and stagger the maturities of our debt obligations in order to better manage our future capital requirements. We might seek to repay certain mortgage loans in full in order to unencumber the associated properties, which enables us to increase our pool of unencumbered assets, have greater financial flexibility and obtain additional financing. 
Liquidity. As of December 31, 2018, our consolidated balance sheet reflected $18.1 million in cash and cash equivalents. We believe that this amount and our net cash provided by operations, together with the available credit under the 2018 Revolving Facility and other sources of capital, provide sufficient liquidity to meet our liquidity requirements and to take advantage of opportunities in the short to intermediate term. 
Capital Recycling. We regularly conduct portfolio property reviews and, if appropriate, we seek to dispose of malls, other retail properties or outparcels that we do not believe meet the financial and strategic criteria we apply, given economic, market and other circumstances. Disposing of these properties can enable us to redeploy or recycle our capital to other uses, such as to repay debt, to reinvest in other real estate assets and development and redevelopment projects, and for other corporate purposes. Along these lines, during 2018 we sold a non-core office property, outparcels and a land parcel for an aggregate of $35.3 million. Since we began our disposition program in 2013, we have sold 17 malls, four power centers, two street retail properties, three office properties and several land parcels and other real estate assets for a total of $825.6 million. The proceeds generated from these sales were reinvested in our existing redevelopment program or used to repay debt. We expect to continue to look for opportunities to sell non-core assets, including land parcels, to residential, hotel and office developers at some of our mall properties.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
Operating Performance
Our net loss increased by $93.7 million to a net loss of $126.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 from a net loss of $32.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The change in our 2018 results of operations was primarily due to increased impairment losses in 2018 as compared to 2017 and dilution from asset sales.
Funds From Operations (“FFO”), a non-GAAP measure, decreased 9.4% from the prior year, and FFO as adjusted, another non-GAAP measure, decreased 7.4% from the prior year. Adjustments to FFO included impairment of the Wiregrass Commons Mall mortgage loan receivable, loss on redemption of the Series A Preferred Shares, provision for employee separation expense, insurance recoveries, prepayment penalties, and accelerated amortization of deferred financing costs. FFO as adjusted per share decreased 7.8% from 2017.
Same Store net operating income (“Same Store NOI”), a non-GAAP measure, increased 0.3% over the prior year. Same Store NOI, excluding lease termination revenue, decreased 2.2% compared to 2017. 
Renewal spreads at our properties increased 5.0% on non-anchor leases under 10,000 square feet and increased 11.9% for non-anchor leases of at least 10,000 square feet. 
Retail portfolio occupancy at December 31, 2018 was 92.7%, a decrease of 270 basis points compared to 2017. Non-anchor occupancy was 92.6%, a decrease of 70 basis points compared to 2017. Core Mall occupancy decreased by 30 basis points to 96.0%. Core Mall non-anchor occupancy was 93.6%, a decrease of 60 basis points. 
Sales per square foot at our Core Malls was $510, an increase of 3.4% from 2017, including consolidated and unconsolidated properties.

Financing Activity
We have entered into two credit agreements (collectively, the “Credit Agreements”): (1) the 2018 Credit Agreement, which includes (a) the 2018 Revolving Facility and (b) the 2018 Term Loan Facility, and (2) the 2014 7-Year Term Loan. The 2014 7-Year Term Loan and the 2018 Term Loan Facility are collectively referred to as the “Term Loans.” 
We, along with The Macerich Company (“Macerich”), our partner in the Fashion District Philadelphia redevelopment project, have also entered into a $250.0 million term loan (the “FDP Term Loan”). We own a 50% partnership interest in Fashion District Philadelphia. The FDP Term Loan matures in January 2023, and bears interest at a variable rate of LIBOR plus 2.00%. We and Macerich secured the FDP Term Loan by pledging each of our respective equity interests in the entities that own Fashion District Philadelphia. The entire $250.0 million available under the FDP Term Loan was drawn during the first quarter of 2018, and we received an aggregate $123.0 million as a distribution of our share of the draws in 2018.
Leverage. Our ratio of Total Liabilities to Gross Asset Value under our Credit Agreements increased by 310 basis points from 50.7% at December 31, 2017 to 53.8% as of December 31, 2018. 
Mortgage Loan Activity. 
In January 2018, we amended and extended a $68.5 million mortgage loan secured by Francis Scott Key Mall in Frederick, Maryland. The mortgage loan has a four year term with one 1-year borrower extension option and bears interest at LIBOR Plus 2.60%.
In February 2018, we borrowed an additional $10.2 million on the mortgage loan secured by Viewmont Mall in Scranton, Pennsylvania. Following this borrowing, this mortgage loan has $67.2 million outstanding with an interest rate of LIBOR plus 2.35% and a maturity date of March 2021.
In February 2018, the mortgage loan secured by Pavilion at Market East in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania was amended and

extended to February 2021, and bears interest at a variable rate of LIBOR plus 2.85%. We own a 40% partnership interest in Pavilion at Market East, which owns non-operating land held for development.
In March 2018, the unconsolidated partnership that owns Gloucester Premium Outlets in Blackwood, New Jersey, in which we own a 25% partnership interest, entered into a $86.0 million interest only mortgage loan secured by the property, with an interest rate of LIBOR plus 1.50% and a maturity date of March 2022, with one option of the unconsolidated partnership to extend by 12 months. The proceeds were used to repay the existing $84.1 million mortgage loan plus accrued interest. 
CAPITAL STRATEGY
In support of the business strategies described above, our long-term corporate finance objective is to maximize the availability and minimize the cost of the capital we employ to fund our operations. In pursuit of this objective and for other business reasons, we seek the broadest range of funding sources (including commercial banks, institutional lenders, equity and debt investors and joint venture partners) and funding vehicles (including mortgage loans, commercial loans, sales of properties or interests in properties, and debt and equity securities) available to us on the most favorable terms. We pursue this goal by maintaining relationships with various capital sources and utilizing a variety of financing instruments, enhancing our flexibility to execute our business strategy in different economic environments or at different points in the business cycle.
We have no wholly-owned property mortgage maturities until July 2020. While mortgage interest rates remain relatively low, we will continue to seek to extend the maturity dates of our mortgage loans to the maximum extent possible, or to replace them with longer term mortgage loans.
In May 2018, we completed a recast and extension of $700.0 million of senior unsecured borrowings consisting of (i) a $400 million senior unsecured revolving credit facility (the “2018 Revolving Facility”) and (ii) a $300 million term loan facility (the “2018 Term Loan Facility”), which was used to pay off two previously existing $150 million five year term loans. The maturity date of the revolving facility was extended to May 2022, subject to two six-month extensions at our election, and the maturity date of the term loan is May 2023. In connection with this activity, we recorded accelerated amortization of financing costs of $0.4 million. 
In June 2018, we amended the 2014 7-Year Term Loan to conform certain provisions of that loan to the recast unsecured borrowings described in the previous paragraph. The amendment did not extend the maturity date or change the amounts that can be borrowed thereunder. Additional information is contained in Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements.
In general, in determining the amount and type of debt capital to employ in our business, we consider several factors, including: general economic conditions, the capital market environment, prevailing and forecasted interest rates for various debt instruments, the cost of equity capital, property values, capitalization rates for mall properties, our financing needs for acquisition, redevelopment and development opportunities, the debt ratios of other mall REITs and publicly-traded real estate companies, and the federal tax law requirement that REITs distribute at least 90% of net taxable income, among other factors. 
In the normal course of business, we are exposed to financial market risks, including interest rate risk on our interest-bearing liabilities. We attempt to limit these risks by following established risk management policies, procedures and strategies, including the use of various types of financial instruments. To manage interest rate risk and limit overall interest cost, we may employ interest rate swaps, options, forwards, caps and floors or a combination thereof depending on our underlying exposure, and subject to our ability to satisfy collateral requirements.
Capital Availability
To maintain our status as a REIT, we are required, under federal tax laws, to distribute to shareholders 90% of our net taxable income, which generally leaves insufficient funds to finance major initiatives internally. Because of these requirements, we ordinarily fund most of our significant capital requirements, such as the capital for acquisitions, redevelopments and developments, through secured and unsecured indebtedness, sales of properties or interests in properties and, when appropriate, the issuance of additional debt, equity or equity-related securities.
Aggregate borrowings under our $400 million senior unsecured revolving credit facility, $300 million five-year term loan facility and $250 million 7-year term loan may be limited by the Unencumbered Debt Yield covenant included in these loan agreements. The aggregate borrowing capacity, including support for letters of credit, under these facilities is determined by dividing the net operating income (“NOI”) from the Company’s unencumbered properties by 11%. The maximum amount that was available to be borrowed by us under our revolving credit facility as of December 31, 2018 was $179.3 million. As of the filing date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, $88.0 million was outstanding under the 2018 Revolving Facility.

In addition, our ability to finance our growth using these sources depends, in part, on our creditworthiness, the availability of credit to us, the market for our securities at the time or times we need capital and prevailing conditions in the capital and credit markets, among other things. We believe that we have adequate access to capital to fund the remaining cost of our anchor replacement and redevelopment program, which we currently estimate to be between $190.0 million and $230.0 million.
OWNERSHIP STRUCTURE
We hold our interests in our portfolio of properties through our operating partnership, PREIT Associates, L.P. We are the sole general partner of PREIT Associates and, as of December 31, 2018, held a 89.5% controlling interest in PREIT Associates. We consolidate PREIT Associates for financial reporting purposes. We own our interests in our properties through various ownership structures, including partnerships and tenancy in common arrangements (collectively, “partnerships”). PREIT Associates’ direct or indirect economic interest in the properties ranges from 25% or 50% (for eight partnership properties) up to 100%. See “Item 2. Properties—Retail Properties.”
We provide management, leasing and real estate development services through two of our subsidiaries: PREIT Services, LLC (“PREIT Services”), which generally develops and manages properties that we consolidate for financial reporting purposes, and PREIT-RUBIN, Inc. (“PRI”), which generally develops and manages properties that we do not consolidate for financial reporting purposes, including properties owned by partnerships in which we own an interest, and properties that are owned by third parties in which we do not have an interest. PREIT Services and PRI are consolidated. PRI is a taxable REIT subsidiary, as defined by federal tax laws, which means that it is able to offer additional services to tenants without jeopardizing our continuing qualification as a REIT under federal tax law.
COMPETITION
Competition in the retail real estate market is intense. We compete with other public and private retail real estate companies, including companies that own or manage malls, power centers, strip centers, lifestyle centers, factory outlet centers, theme/festival centers and community centers, as well as other commercial real estate developers and real estate owners, particularly those with properties near our properties, on the basis of several factors, including location and rent charged. We compete with these companies to attract customers to our properties, as well as to attract anchor and in-line stores and other tenants. We also compete to acquire land for new site development or to acquire parcels or properties to add to our existing properties. Our malls and our other retail properties face competition from similar retail centers, including more recently developed or renovated centers that are near our retail properties. We also face competition from a variety of different retail formats, including internet retailers, discount or value retailers, home shopping networks, mail order operators, catalogs, and telemarketers. Our tenants face competition from companies at the same and other properties and from other retail channels or formats as well, including internet retailers. This competition could have a material adverse effect on our ability to lease space and on the amount of rent and expense reimbursements that we receive.
The existence or development of competing retail properties and the related increased competition for tenants might, subject to the terms and conditions of our Credit Agreements, lead us to make capital improvements to properties that we would have deferred or would not have otherwise planned to make and might affect occupancy and net operating income of such properties. Any such capital improvements, undertaken individually or collectively, would involve costs and expenses that could adversely affect our results of operations.
We compete with many other entities engaged in real estate investment activities for acquisitions of malls, other retail properties and prime development sites or sites adjacent to our properties, including institutional pension funds, other REITs and other owner-operators of retail properties. When we seek to make acquisitions, competitors might drive up the price we must pay for properties, parcels, other assets or other companies or might themselves succeed in acquiring those properties, parcels, assets or companies. In addition, our potential acquisition targets might find our competitors to be more attractive suitors if they have greater resources, are willing to pay more, or have a more compatible operating philosophy. In particular, larger REITs might enjoy significant competitive advantages that result from, among other things, a lower cost of capital, a better ability to raise capital, a better ability to finance an acquisition, better cash flow and enhanced operating efficiencies. We might not succeed in acquiring retail properties or development sites that we seek, or, if we pay a higher price for a property or site, or generate lower cash flow from an acquired property or site than we expect, our investment returns will be reduced, which will adversely affect the value of our securities.

ENVIRONMENTAL
Under various federal, state and local laws, ordinances, regulations and case law, an owner, former owner or operator of real estate might be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances present at, on, under, in or released from its property, regardless of whether the owner, operator or other responsible party knew of or was at fault for the release or presence of hazardous or toxic substances. Contamination might adversely affect the owner’s ability to sell or lease real estate or borrow with real estate as collateral. In connection with our ownership, operation, management, development and redevelopment of properties, or any other properties we acquire in the future, we might be liable under these laws and might incur costs in responding to these liabilities.
Each of our retail properties has been subjected to a Phase I or similar environmental audit (which involves a visual property inspection and a review of records, but not soil sampling or ground water analysis) by environmental consultants. These audits have not revealed, and we are not aware of, any environmental liability that we believe would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. It is possible, however, that there are material environmental liabilities of which we are unaware.
We are aware of certain past environmental matters at some of our properties. We have, in the past, investigated and, where appropriate, performed remediation of such environmental matters, but we might be required in the future to perform testing relating to these matters or to satisfy requirements for further remediation, or we might incur liability as a result of such environmental matters. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business and Our Properties—We might incur costs to comply with environmental laws, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.”
SUSTAINABILITY
We strive to be socially and environmentally conscious. We now have the capacity to produce more than 8 million kilowatt hours of electricity per year from solar arrays at five of our properties. The annual environmental benefit accrued through the production of renewable energy at these five properties is equivalent to a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions from more than 1,200 passenger vehicles. We also currently offer electric vehicle charging stations at three of our properties, with plans underway for such stations at two more mall locations. Additionally, as part of our redevelopment at Woodland Mall in Grand Rapids, Michigan, we diverted more than 20,000 tons of concrete from two former Sears buildings from landfills, instead recycling it for reuse as building pads, parking lot base and site grading during the expansion phase of the mall.
EMPLOYEES
We had 274 employees at our properties and in our corporate office as of December 31, 2018. None of our employees are represented by a labor union.
INSURANCE
We have comprehensive liability, fire, flood, cyber liability, terrorism, extended coverage and rental loss insurance that we believe is adequate and consistent with the level of coverage that is standard in our industry. We cannot assure you, however, that our insurance coverage will be adequate to protect against a loss of our invested capital or anticipated profits, or that we will be able to obtain adequate coverage at a reasonable cost in the future.
STATUS AS A REIT
We conduct our operations in a manner intended to maintain our qualification as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. Generally, as a REIT, we will not be subject to federal or state income taxes on our net taxable income that we currently distribute to our shareholders. Our qualification and taxation as a REIT depend on our ability to meet various qualification tests (including dividend distribution, asset ownership and income tests) and certain share ownership requirements prescribed in the Internal Revenue Code.
CORPORATE HEADQUARTERS
Our principal executive offices are located at The Bellevue, 200 South Broad Street, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19102. We currently lease our principal executive offices from Bellevue Associates, an entity that is owned by Ronald Rubin, one of our former trustees, collectively with members of his immediate family and affiliated entities.. This lease expires in October 2019. We have entered into a lease for new office space at One Commerce Square which is located at 2005 Market Street, Philadelphia, PA 19103. We expect to relocate our principal executive offices to that location during the third quarter of 2019.

SEASONALITY
There is seasonality in the retail real estate industry. Retail property leases often provide for the payment of all or a portion of rent based on a percentage of a tenant’s sales revenue, or sales revenue over certain levels. Income from such rent is recorded only after the minimum sales levels have been met. The sales levels are often met in the fourth quarter, during the December holiday season. Also, many new and temporary leases are entered into later in the year in anticipation of the holiday season and a higher number of tenants vacate their space early in the year. As a result, our occupancy and cash flows are generally higher in the fourth quarter and lower in the first and second quarters. Our concentration in the retail sector increases our exposure to seasonality and has resulted, and is expected to continue to result, in a greater percentage of our cash flows being received in the fourth quarter.
