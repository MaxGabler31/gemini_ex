Item 1. | Business
------------+---------

 
Rennova Health, Inc. (together with its subsidiaries, “Rennova”, “we” or the “Company”) is a provider of an expanding group of health care services for healthcare providers, patients and individuals. Beginning in 2018, the Company intends to focus on and operate two synergistic divisions: 1) Clinical diagnostics through its clinical laboratories; and 2) Hospital operations through its Big South Fork Medical Center, which opened on August 8, 2017, and a hospital in Jamestown Tennessee, including a doctor’s practice, the assets of which we expect to acquire in the second quarter of 2018, pursuant to the terms of a definitive asset purchase agreement that we entered into on January 31, 2018, as more fully discussed below. We believe that our approach will produce a more sustainable business model and the capture of multiple revenue streams from medical providers, patients and hospital services. Management determined that because Big South Fork Medical Center was reopened after being closed and contracts with payers had to be negotiated and implemented during the first months of operation, they would recognize a 20% collection rate for the period to December 31, 2017 until there was adequate collection history to analyze and confirm anticipated collections. Jamestown is a fully operating facility.


On July 12, 2017, the Company announced plans to spin off its Advanced Molecular Services Group (“AMSG”) and in the third quarter 2017 the Company’s Board of Directors voted unanimously to spin off the Company’s wholly-owned subsidiary, Health Technology Solutions, Inc. (“HTS”), as independent publicly traded companies by way of tax-free distributions to the Company’s stockholders. Completion of these spinoffs is expected to occur in the third quarter of 2018. Our Board of Directors is currently considering if AMSG and HTS would be better as one combined spinoff instead of two. The spinoffs are subject to numerous conditions, including effectiveness of Registration Statements on Form 10 to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, and consents, including under various funding agreements previously entered into by the Company. A record date to determine those stockholders entitled to receive shares in the spinoffs should be approximately 30 to 60 days prior to the dates of the spinoffs. The strategic goal of the spinoffs is to create three (or two) public companies, each of which can focus on its own strengths and operational plans. In addition, after the spinoffs, each company will provide a distinct and targeted investment opportunity.
 
The Company has reflected the amounts relating to AMSG and HTS as disposal groups classified as held for sale and included in discontinued operations in the Company’s accompanying consolidated financial statements. Prior to being classified as held for sale, AMSG had been included in the Decision Support and Informatics division, except for the Company’s subsidiary, Alethea Laboratories, Inc., which had been included in the Clinical Laboratories division and HTS had been included in the Company’s Supportive Software Solutions division. The Company believes it will be able to recognize the expenditures to date, which is in excess of $20 million, as an investment after the spinoff(s) are complete.
 
We have received approximately $15.7 million in cash from the issuances of debentures and warrants during 2017 (see Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements), $4.3 million from related parties (see Notes 7 and 8 to the consolidated financial statements) and an additional $4.0 million of proceeds on October 30, 2017 from the issuance of our convertible preferred stock (see Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements). Subsequent to December 31, 2017, we received $2 million from the issuance of debentures and $0.8 million from the sale of stock we owned (see Note 20).
 
The protective covenants in the various agreements combined with the Company’s current inability to issue new shares and nonpayment of certain liabilities means that $12.4 million that might otherwise be treated as equity have been treated as derivative liabilities and had the relative effect applied to the Company’s financial statements including the profit and loss and balance sheet.
 
Our net loss from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $50.9 million, as compared to $22.6 million for the same period of a year ago. The change is primarily due to the decrease in operating expenses of $5.1 million and the increase in revenue of $1.3 million offset by $12.4 million additional expense related to the value of derivative liabilities referred to above, an increase of $15.2 million in interest expense, the decrease of $5.3 million in other income (expense), and additional income tax expense of $1.8 million.
 
History and Development of the Company
 
Medytox Solutions, Inc. (“Medytox”) was organized on July 20, 2005 under the laws of the State of Nevada. In the first half of 2011, Medytox’s management elected to reorganize as a holding company, and Medytox established and acquired a number of companies in the medical service and software sector between 2011 and 2014.
 
On November 2, 2015, pursuant to the terms of the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of April 15, 2015, by and among CollabRx, Inc. (“CollabRx”), CollabRx Merger Sub, Inc. (“Merger Sub”), a direct wholly-owned subsidiary of CollabRx formed for the purpose of the merger, and Medytox, Merger Sub merged with and into Medytox, with Medytox as the surviving company and a direct, wholly-owned subsidiary of CollabRx (the “Merger”). Prior to closing, the Company amended its certificate of incorporation to effect a 1-for-10 reverse stock split and to change its name to Rennova Health, Inc. In connection with the Merger, (i) each share of common stock of Medytox was converted into the right to receive 0.4096 shares of common stock of the Company, (ii) each share of Series B Preferred Stock of Medytox was converted into the right to receive one share of a newly-authorized Series B Convertible Preferred Stock of the Company, and (iii) each share of Series E Convertible Preferred Stock of Medytox was converted into the right to receive one share of a newly-authorized Series E Convertible Preferred Stock of the Company. This transaction was accounted for as a reverse merger in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”) and, as such, the historical financial statements of Medytox became the historical financial statements of the Company.
 
Holders of Company equity prior to the closing of the Merger (including all outstanding Company common stock and all restricted stock units, options and warrants exercisable for shares of Company common stock) held 10% of the Company’s common stock immediately following the closing of the Merger, and holders of Medytox equity prior to the closing of the Merger (including all outstanding Medytox common stock and all outstanding options exercisable for shares of Medytox common stock, but less certain options that were cancelled upon the closing pursuant to agreements between Medytox and such optionees) held 90% of the Company’s common stock immediately following the closing of the Merger, in each case on a fully diluted basis, provided, however, outstanding shares of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock and Series E Convertible Preferred Stock, certain outstanding convertible promissory notes exercisable for Company common stock after the closing and certain option grants expected to be made following the closing of the Merger were excluded from such ownership percentages.

Common Stock Listing
 
On November 3, 2015, the common stock of Rennova Health, Inc. commenced trading on The NASDAQ Capital Market under the symbol “RNVA.” Prior to that date, our common stock was listed on The NASDAQ Capital Market under the symbol “CLRX.”
 
On April 18, 2017, the Company was notified by NASDAQ that the stockholders’ equity balance reported on the Company’s Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016 fell below the $2.5 million minimum requirement for continued listing under The Nasdaq Capital Market’s Listing Rule 5550(b)(1) (the “Rule”). In accordance with the Rule, the Company submitted a plan to Nasdaq outlining how it intended to regain compliance. On August 17, 2017, Nasdaq notified the Company that its plan to correct the stockholders’ equity deficiency did not contain sufficient evidence to support a correction being achieved in the required time frame. The Company appealed this decision to a Hearing Panel which, on October 23, 2017, maintained this position and denied the Company a continued listing. Effective October 25, 2017, the Company’s common stock (RNVA) and warrants to purchase common stock (RNVAW) were no longer listed on The Nasdaq Capital Market but began trading on the OTCQB instead.
 
Reverse Stock Splits
 
On February 7, 2017, the Company’s Board of Directors approved an amendment to the Company’s Certificate of Incorporation to effect a 1-for-30 reverse stock split of the Company’s shares of common stock effective on February 22, 2017 and on September 21, 2017, the Company’s Board of Directors approved an amendment to the Company’s Certificate of Incorporation to effect a 1-for-15 reverse stock split effective October 5, 2017 (the “Reverse Stock Splits”). The stockholders of the Company had approved these amendments to the Company’s Certificate of Incorporation on December 22, 2016 for the February 22, 2017 reverse stock split and on September 20, 2017 for the October 5, 2017 reverse stock split. In both cases, the Company’s stockholders had granted authorization to the Board of Directors to determine in its discretion the specific ratio, subject to limitations, and the timing of the reverse splits within certain specified effective dates.
 
As a result of the Reverse Stock Splits, every 30 shares of the Company’s then outstanding common stock was combined and automatically converted into one share of the Company’s common stock, par value $0.01 per share, on February 22, 2017 and every 15 shares of the Company’s then outstanding common stock was combined and automatically converted into one share of the Company’s common stock, par value $0.01 per share, on October 5, 2017. In addition, the conversions and exercise prices of all of the Company’s outstanding preferred stock, common stock purchase warrants, stock options, restricted stock, equity incentive plans and convertible notes payable were proportionately adjusted at the 1:30 reverse split ratio and again at the 1:15 reverse split ratio in accordance with the terms of such instruments. In addition, proportionate voting rights and other rights of common stockholders were not affected by the Reverse Stock Splits, other than as a result of the rounding up of fractional shares in the February reverse split and the payment of cash in lieu of fractional shares in the October reverse split, as no fractional shares were issued in connection with the Reverse Stock Splits.
 
The par value and other terms of the common stock were not affected by the Reverse Stock Splits. The authorized capital of the Company of 500,000,000 shares of common stock and 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock were also unaffected by the Reverse Stock Splits. All share, per share and capital stock amounts as of and for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 have been restated to give effect to the Reverse Stock Splits.

Our Services
 
We are a healthcare enterprise that delivers products and services to healthcare providers, their patients and individuals. We operate in two synergistic divisions: 1) Clinical diagnostics services through our clinical laboratories; and 2) Hospital operations through our Big South Fork Medical Center and a hospital in Jamestown, Tennessee, the assets of which we expect to acquire in the second quarter of 2018. We aspire to create a more sustainable relationship with our customers by offering needed and interoperable solutions to capture multiple revenue streams from medical providers.
Clinical Diagnostics 
 
Our principal line of business over the past few years has been clinical laboratory blood and urine testing services, with a particular emphasis on the provision of urine drug toxicology testing to physicians, clinics and rehabilitation facilities in the United States. As we expand our customer base to include pain management and other healthcare providers, testing services to rehabilitation facilities represented approximately 51% of the Company’s revenues for the year ended December 31, 2017 and approximately 100% of the Company’s revenues for the year ended December 31, 2016. We believe that we are responding to the challenges faced by today’s healthcare providers to adopt paper free and interoperable systems, and to market demand for solutions by strategically expanding our offering of diagnostics services to include a full suite of clinical laboratory services. The drug and alcohol rehabilitation and pain management sectors provide an existing and sizable target market, where the need for our services already exists and opportunity is being created by a continued secular growth and need for compliance. This sector has been fraught with difficulties over the past two years as payers reduce reimbursement and cover for diagnostics in this sector. The lack of consistency between payer’s policies and their requirement for proof of medical necessity has created uncertainty for ordering physicians and testing laboratories and their ability to receive payment. We have reduced the number of laboratories we operate in first quarter 2018 to one facility in West Palm Beach, Florida.
 
The Company owns and operates the following products and services to support its business objectives and to enable it to offer these services to its customers:
 
Medytox Diagnostics, Inc. (“MDI”)
 
Through our CLIA certified laboratories, Rennova offers toxicology, clinical pharmacogenetics and esoteric testing. Rennova seeks to provide these testing services with superior logistics and specimen integrity, competitive turn-around times and excellent customer service.

Clinical Laboratory Operations
 
The Company, through its wholly-owned MDI subsidiary, owns and operates the following clinical laboratory:
 

Laboratory | Location 
------------------------------+----------------------
EPIC Reference Labs, Inc. | Riviera Beach, FL 

 
During the year 2016 and year ended December 31, 2017, the Company experienced a substantial decline in the volume of samples processed at its laboratories and continued difficulty in receiving reimbursement for certain diagnostics. As result, in an effort to reduce costs, the Company is currently operating all of its Clinical Laboratory Operations business segment out of its EPIC Reference Labs, Inc. (“EPIC”) laboratory, and cost reduction efforts are continuing in response to the operating losses incurred. MDI formed EPIC as a wholly-owned subsidiary on January 29, 2013 to provide reference, confirmation and clinical testing services. The Company acquired necessary equipment and licenses in order to allow EPIC to test urine for drugs and medication monitoring. Operations at EPIC began in January 2014 using approximately 2,500 square feet and the premises has since been expanded to occupy approximately 12,500 square feet.
 
The Company’s Medytox Medical Marketing & Sales, Inc. subsidiary was formed on March 9, 2013 as a wholly-owned subsidiary to provide marketing, sales, and customer service exclusively for our clinical laboratories.
 
Hospital Operations
 
The Company believes that the acquisition or development of rural hospitals will create a stable revenue base as a needed service and believes that it can expand the sales of its products and services to surrounding medical providers and doctors’ groups.
 
On January 13, 2017, we acquired the Hospital Assets in Oneida Tennessee, which include a 52,000-square foot hospital building and 6,300 square foot professional building on approximately 4.3 acres. Scott County Community Hospital, since renamed Big South Fork Medical Center, is classified as a Critical Access Hospital (rural) with 25 beds, a 24/7 emergency department, operating rooms and a laboratory that provides a range of diagnostic services. The hospital began operations on August 8, 2017, following the receipt of the required licenses and regulatory approvals and generated revenues of approximately $1.8 million during the period from August 8, 2017 to December 31, 2017.
 
The hospital had unaudited annual revenues of approximately $12 million, and a normalized EBITDA of approximately $1.3 million for Fiscal 2015, the last full year of the hospital’s operation. These revenues were attributable to the typical services of a rural acute care hospital, including emergency room visits, outpatient procedures, diagnostic ancillary tests, physical therapy and inpatient hospital stays. Based on the hospital’s historical information, we believe the hospital offers an established patient and stable revenue base as it serves the general healthcare needs of its community and supports local physicians. Management determined that because Big South Fork Medical Center was reopened after being closed and contracts with payers had to be negotiated and implemented during the first months of operation, they would recognize a 20% collection rate for the period to December 31, 2017 until there was adequate collection history to analyze and confirm anticipated collections.
 
On January 31, 2018, we entered into an asset purchase agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”) to acquire certain assets related to an acute care hospital and separate doctor’s practice located in Jamestown, Tennessee. The hospital is known as Tennova Healthcare – Jamestown. The transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of 2018, subject to customary regulatory approvals and closing conditions. Tennova Healthcare – Jamestown is a fully-operational 85-bed facility including a 24/7 emergency department, radiology department, surgical center, and a wound care and hyperbaric center. The purchase includes a 90,000-square foot hospital building on approximately eight acres. Tennova Healthcare – Jamestown is located 38 miles from the Company’s existing hospital, the Big South Fork Medical Center, which is located in Oneida Tennessee.
 
Marketing Strategy
 
Rennova provides a suite of products and services to the medical services sector. We endeavor to be a single source for multiple business solutions that serve the medical services industry. The Company intends to expand, through its acquisition and subsequent integration of businesses, into a robust business model providing an extensive range of services to medical providers that demonstrate improved patient care and outcomes.
Competition
 
The Company competes in a fragmented diagnostics industry split between independently-owned and physician-owned laboratories. There are three predominant players in the industry that operate as full-service clinical laboratories (processing blood, urine and other tissue). In addition, the competition ranges from smaller privately-owned laboratories (3-6 employees) to large publicly-traded laboratories with significant market capitalizations. The healthcare industry is highly competitive among hospitals and other healthcare providers for patients, affiliations with physicians and acquisitions. The most significant competition our hospital, and any other hospitals we may acquire, face comes from hospitals that provide more complex services, other healthcare providers, including outpatient surgery, orthopedic, oncology and diagnostic centers that also compete for patients. Our hospitals, our competitors, and other healthcare industry participants are increasingly implementing physician alignment strategies, such as acquiring physician practice groups, employing physicians and participating in ACOs or other clinical integration models, which may impact our competitive position. In addition, increasing consolidation within the payor industry, vertical integration efforts involving payors and healthcare providers, and cost-reduction strategies by large employer groups and their affiliates may impact our ability to contract with payors on favorable terms and otherwise affect our competitive position.

Governmental Regulation
 
General
 
The healthcare industry is subject to significant governmental laws and regulations at the federal, state and local levels. As described below, these laws and regulations concern licensure and operation of clinical laboratories and hospitals, claim submission and payment for services, health care fraud and abuse, security, privacy and confidentiality of health information, quality and environmental and occupational safety.
Regulation of Clinical Laboratories
 
The Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (“CLIA”) are regulations that include federal standards applicable to all U.S. facilities or sites that test human specimens for health assessment or to diagnose, prevent, or treat disease. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (“CDC”), in partnership with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (“CMS”) and the Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”), supports the CLIA program and clinical laboratory quality. CLIA requires that all clinical laboratories meet quality assurance, quality control and personnel standards. Laboratories also must undergo proficiency testing and are subject to inspections.
 
Standards for testing under CLIA are based on the complexity of the tests performed by the laboratory, with tests classified as “high complexity,” “moderate complexity,” or “waived.” Laboratories performing high complexity testing are required to meet more stringent requirements than moderate complexity laboratories. Laboratories performing only waived tests, which are tests determined by the FDA to have a low potential for error and requiring little oversight, may apply for a certificate of waiver exempting them from most of the requirements of CLIA. All Company laboratory facilities hold CLIA certificates to perform high complexity testing. The sanctions for failure to comply with CLIA requirements include suspension, revocation or limitation of a laboratory’s CLIA certificate, which is necessary to conduct business, cancellation or suspension of the laboratory’s approval to receive Medicare and/or Medicaid reimbursement, as well as significant fines and/or criminal penalties. The loss or suspension of a CLIA certification, imposition of a fine or other penalties, or future changes in the CLIA law or regulations (or interpretation of the law or regulations) could have a material adverse effect on the Company.
 
In addition to compliance with the federal regulations, the Company is also subject to state and local laboratory regulation. CLIA provides that a state may adopt laboratory regulations different from or more stringent than those contained in Federal law and a number of states have implemented their own laboratory requirements. State laws may require that laboratory personnel meet certain qualifications, specify certain quality controls, or require maintenance of certain records. There are a number of states that have even more stringent requirements with which lab personnel must comply to obtain state licensure or a certificate of qualification.
 
The Company believes that it is in compliance with all applicable laboratory requirements. The Company’s laboratories have continuing programs to ensure that their operations meet all such regulatory requirements, but no assurances can be given that the Company’s laboratories will pass all future licensure or certification inspections. We embrace compliance as an integral part of our culture and we consistently promote that culture of ethics and integrity.
 
The FDA has regulatory responsibility over instruments, test kits, reagents and other devices used by clinical laboratories. The FDA has issued draft guidance regarding FDA regulation of laboratory-developed tests (“LDTs”), but if or how the draft guidance will be implemented is uncertain. On November 18, 2016, the FDA announced it would not release final guidance at this time and instead would continue to work with stakeholders, the new administration and Congress to determine the right approach, and on January 3, 2017, the FDA released a discussion paper outlining a possible risk-based approach for FDA and CMS oversight of LTDs. Later in 2017, the FDA indicated that Congress should enact legislation to address improved oversight of diagnostics, including LTDs, rather than the FDA addressing the issue through administrative proposals. There are many other regulatory and legislative proposals that would increase general FDA oversight of clinical laboratories and LDTs. The outcome and ultimate impact of such proposals on the business is difficult to predict at this time. Our point of collection testing devices are regulated by the FDA. The FDA has authority to take various administrative and legal actions for non-compliance, such as fines, product suspension, warning letters, injunctions and other civil and criminal sanctions. We make every good faith effort to exercise proactive monitoring and review of pending legislation and regulatory action.
 
Payment for Services
 
In each of 2017 and 2016, the Company’s laboratories derived 16% and 12%, respectively, of their net sales directly from the Medicare and Medicaid programs. In addition, the Company’s other business depends significantly on continued participation in these programs and in other government healthcare programs. In recent years, both governmental and private sector payers have made efforts to contain or reduce health care costs, including reducing reimbursement for services.

Reimbursement under the Medicare program for clinical diagnostic laboratory services is subject to a clinical laboratory fee schedule that sets the maximum amount payable in each Medicare carrier’s jurisdiction. This clinical laboratory fee schedule is updated annually. Laboratories bill the program directly for covered tests performed on behalf of Medicare beneficiaries. State Medicaid programs are prohibited from paying more than the Medicare fee schedule limit for clinical laboratory services furnished to Medicaid recipients.
 
For hospitals, the federal government similarly generally reviews payment rates under its various programs annually, and changes in reimbursement rates under such programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, generally occur based on the fiscal year of the federal government.
 
Medicare, Medicaid and other government program payment reductions will not currently have a direct adverse effect on the Company’s net earnings and cash flows, due to insignificant revenue earned, however, it is not currently possible to project what impact will be had in future years.
 
In addition to reimbursement rates, the Company is also impacted by changes in coverage policies. Congressional action in 1997 required the Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”) to adopt uniform coverage, administration and payment policies for many of the most commonly performed lab tests using a negotiated rulemaking process. The negotiated rulemaking committee established uniform policies limiting Medicare coverage for certain tests to patients with specified medical conditions or diagnoses, replacing local Medicare coverage policies which varied around the country. The final rules generally became effective in 2002, and the use of uniform policies improves the Company’s ability to obtain necessary billing information in some cases, but Medicare, Medicaid and private payer diagnosis code requirements and payment policies continue to negatively impact the Company’s ability to be paid for some of the tests it performs. Further, some payers require additional information to process claims or have implemented prior authorization policies, which delay or prohibit payment. Due to the range of payers and policies, the extent of this impact continues to be difficult to quantify.
 
Future changes in federal, state and local laws and regulations (or in the interpretation of current regulations) affecting government payment could have a material adverse effect on the Company. In March 2010, comprehensive healthcare legislation, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (“ACA”), was enacted. Numerous proposals continue to be discussed in Congress and the administration to repeal, amend or replace the ACA. Based on currently available information, the Company is unable to predict what type of changes in legislation or regulations, if any, will occur.
 
Standard Electronic Transactions, Security and Confidentiality of Health Information and Other Personal Information
 
The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”) was designed to address issues related to the security and confidentiality of health insurance information. In an effort to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the health care system by facilitating the electronic exchange of information in certain financial and administrative transactions, HIPAA regulations were promulgated. These regulations apply to health plans, health care providers that conduct standard transactions electronically and health care clearinghouses (“covered entities”). Six such regulations include: (i) the Transactions and Code Sets Rule; (ii) the Privacy Rule; (iii) the Security Rule; (iv) the Standard Unique Employer Identifier Rule, which requires the use of a unique employer identifier in connection with certain electronic transactions; (v) the National Provider Identifier Rule, which requires the use of a unique health care provider identifier in connection with certain electronic transactions; and (vi) the Health Plan Identifier Rule, which requires the use of a unique health plan identifier in connection with certain electronic transactions.
 
The Privacy Rule regulates the use and disclosure of protected health information (“PHI”) by covered entities. It also sets forth certain rights that an individual has with respect to his or her PHI maintained by a covered entity, such as the right to access or amend certain records containing PHI or to request restrictions on the use or disclosure of PHI. The Privacy Rule requires covered entities to contractually bind third parties, known as business associates, in the event that they perform an activity or service for or on behalf of the covered entity that involves the creation, receipt, maintenance or transmission of PHI. The Security Rule establishes requirements for safeguarding patient information that is electronically transmitted or electronically stored. The Company believes that it is in compliance in all material respects with the requirements of the HIPAA Privacy and Security Rules.
 
The Federal Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (“HITECH”), which was enacted in February 2009, with regulations effective on September 23, 2013, strengthens and expands the HIPAA Privacy and Security Rules and their restrictions on use and disclosure of PHI. HITECH includes, but is not limited to, prohibitions on exchanging PHI for remuneration, and additional restrictions on the use of PHI for marketing. HITECH also fundamentally changes a business associate’s obligations by imposing a number of Privacy Rule requirements and a majority of Security Rule provisions directly on business associates that were previously only directly applicable to covered entities. Moreover, HITECH requires covered entities to provide notice to individuals, HHS, and, as applicable, the media when PHI is breached, as that term is defined by HITECH. Business associates are similarly required to notify covered entities of a breach. The Company believes its policies and procedures are fully compliant with the HITECH requirements.

On February 6, 2014, the CMS and HHS published final regulations that amended the HIPAA Privacy Rule to provide individuals (or their personal representatives) with the right to receive copies of their test reports from laboratories subject to HIPAA, or to request that copies of their test reports be transmitted to designated third parties. Previously, laboratories that were CLIA-certified or CLIA-exempt were not subject to the provision in the Privacy Rule that provides individuals with the right of access to PHI. The HIPAA Privacy Rule amendment resulted in the preemption of a number of state laws that prohibit a laboratory from releasing a test report directly to the individual. The Company revised its policies and procedures to comply with these new access requirements and has updated its privacy notice to reflect individuals’ new access rights under this final rule.
 
The standard unique employer identifier regulations require that employers have standard national numbers that identify them on standard transactions. The Employer Identification Number, also known as a Federal Tax Identification Number, issued by the Internal Revenue Service, was selected as the identifier for employers and was adopted effective July 30, 2002. The Company believes it is in compliance with these requirements.
 
The administrative simplification provisions of HIPAA mandate the adoption of standard unique identifiers for health care providers. The intent of these provisions is to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the electronic transmission of health information. The National Provider Identification Rule requires that all HIPAA-covered health care providers, whether they are individuals or organizations, must obtain a National Provider Identifier (“NPI”) to identify themselves in standard HIPAA transactions. NPI replaces the unique provider identification number - as well as other provider numbers previously assigned by payers and other entities - for the purpose of identifying providers in standard electronic transactions. The Company believes that it is in compliance with the HIPAA National Provider Identification Rule in all material respects.
 
The Health Plan Identifier (HPID) is a unique identifier designed to furnish a standard way to identify health plans in electronic transactions. CMS published the final rule adopting the HPID for health plans required by HIPAA on September 12, 2012. Effective October 31, 2014, CMS announced a delay, until further notice, in the enforcement of regulations pertaining to health plan enumeration and use of the HPID in HIPAA transactions adopted in the HPID final rule. The delay remains in effect. The Company will continue to monitor future developments related to the HPID and respond accordingly.
 
Violations of the HIPAA provisions could result in civil and/or criminal penalties, including significant fines and up to 10 years in prison. HITECH also significantly strengthened HIPAA enforcement. It increased the civil penalty amounts that may be imposed, required HHS to conduct periodic audits to confirm compliance and also authorized state attorneys general to bring civil actions seeking either injunctions or damages in response to violations of the HIPAA privacy and security regulations that affect the privacy of state residents.
 
The total cost associated with the requirements of HIPAA and HITECH is not expected to be material to the Company’s operations or cash flows. However, future regulations and interpretations of HIPAA and HITECH could impose significant costs on the Company.
 
In addition to the HIPAA regulations described above, there are a number of other Federal and state laws regarding the confidentiality and security of medical information, some of which apply to our business. These laws vary widely, but they most commonly regulate or restrict the collection, use and disclosure of medical and financial information and other personal information. In some cases, state laws are more restrictive than and therefore not preempted by HIPAA. Penalties for violation of these laws may include sanctions against our licensure, as well as civil and/or criminal penalties. Additionally, numerous other countries have or are developing similar laws governing the collection, use, disclosure and transmission of personal and/or patient information.
 
The Company believes that it is in compliance in all material respects with the current Transactions and Code Sets Rule. The Company implemented Version 5010 of the HIPAA Transaction Standards and believes it has fully adopted the ICD-10-CM code set. The compliance date for ICD-10-CM was October 1, 2015. The costs associated with ICD-10-CM Code Set were substantial, and failure of the Company, third party payers or physicians to apply the new code set could have an adverse impact on reimbursement, day’s sales outstanding and cash collections. As a result of inconsistent application of transaction standards by payers or the Company’s inability to obtain certain billing information not usually provided to the Company by physicians, the Company could face increased costs and complexity, a temporary disruption in receipts and ongoing reductions in reimbursements and net revenues.
 
On January 2, 2018, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) announced the finalization of proposed changes to the Confidentiality of Substance Use Disorder Patient Records regulation, 42 CFR Part 2. This regulation protects the confidentiality of patient records relating to the identity, diagnosis, prognosis, or treatment that are maintained in connection with the performance of any federally assisted program or activity relating to substance use disorder education, prevention, training, treatment, rehabilitation, or research. Under the regulation, patient identifying information may only be released with the individual’s written consent, subject to certain limited exceptions. The latest changes to this regulation seek to align its requirements more closely with HIPAA, while maintaining more stringent confidentiality of substance use disorder information. The Company will adopt such changes to its policies and procedures as may be necessary for compliance.
 
The Company believes it is in compliance in all material respects with the Operating Rules for electronic funds transfers and remittance advice transactions, for which the compliance date was January 1, 2014.
 
Fraud and Abuse Laws and Regulations
 
Existing federal laws governing federal health care programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, as well as similar state laws, impose a variety of broadly described fraud and abuse prohibitions on health care providers. These laws are interpreted liberally and enforced aggressively by multiple government agencies, including the U.S. Department of Justice, HHS’ Office of Inspector General (“OIG”), and various state agencies. Historically, the clinical laboratory industry has been the focus of major governmental enforcement initiatives. The federal government’s enforcement efforts regarding health care providers have been increasing over the past decade, in part as a result of the enactment of HIPAA, which included several provisions related to fraud and abuse enforcement, including the establishment of a program to coordinate and fund federal, state and local law enforcement efforts. The Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 also included new requirements directed at Medicaid fraud, including increased spending on enforcement and financial incentives for states to adopt false claims act provisions similar to the federal False Claims Act. Amendments to the False Claims Act, as well as other enhancements to the federal fraud and abuse laws enacted as part of the ACA, have further increased fraud and abuse enforcement efforts and compliance issues. For example, the ACA established an obligation to report and refund overpayments from Medicare or Medicaid within 60 days of identification (whether or not paid through any fault of the recipient); failure to comply with this new requirement can give rise to additional liability under the False Claims Act and Civil Monetary Penalties statute. On February 11, 2016, CMS issued the final rule clarifying certain aspects of the overpayment requirement for purposes of Medicare, effective on March 14, 2016.

The federal health care programs’ anti-kickback law (the “Anti-Kickback Law”) prohibits knowingly providing anything of value in return for, or to induce the referral of, Medicare, Medicaid or other federal health care program business. Violations can result in imprisonment, fines, penalties, and/or exclusion from participation in federal health care programs. The OIG has published “safe harbor” regulations which specify certain arrangements that are protected from prosecution under the Anti-Kickback Law if all conditions of the relevant safe harbor are met. Failure to fit within a safe harbor does not necessarily constitute a violation of the Anti-Kickback Law; rather, the arrangement would be subject to scrutiny by regulators and prosecutors and would be evaluated on a case by case basis. Many states have their own Medicaid anti-kickback laws and several states also have anti-kickback laws that apply to all payers (i.e., not just government health care programs).
 
From time to time, the OIG issues alerts and other guidance on certain practices in the health care industry that implicate the Anti-Kickback Law or other federal fraud and abuse laws. Examples of such guidance documents particularly relevant to the Company and its operations follow.
 
In October 1994, the OIG issued a Special Fraud Alert on arrangements for the provision of clinical laboratory services. The Fraud Alert set forth a number of practices allegedly engaged in by some clinical laboratories and health care providers that raise issues under the federal fraud and abuse laws, including the Anti-Kickback Law. These practices include: (i) providing employees to furnish valuable services for physicians (other than collecting patient specimens for testing) that are typically the responsibility of the physicians’ staff; (ii) offering certain laboratory services at prices below fair market value in return for referrals of other tests which are billed to Medicare at higher rates; (iii) providing free testing to physicians’ managed care patients in situations where the referring physicians benefit from such reduced laboratory utilization; (iv) providing free pick-up and disposal of bio-hazardous waste for physicians for items unrelated to a laboratory’s testing services; (v) providing general-use facsimile machines or computers to physicians that are not exclusively used in connection with the laboratory services; and (vi) providing free testing for health care providers, their families and their employees (i.e., so-called “professional courtesy” testing). The OIG emphasized in the Special Fraud Alert that when one purpose of such arrangements is to induce referrals of program-reimbursed laboratory testing, both the clinical laboratory and the health care provider (e.g., physician) may be liable under the Anti-Kickback Law, and may be subject to criminal prosecution and exclusion from participation in the Medicare and Medicaid programs. More recently, in June 2014, the OIG issued another Special Fraud Alert addressing compensation paid by laboratories to referring physicians for blood specimen processing and for submitting patient data to registries. This Special Fraud Alert reiterates the OIG’s longstanding concerns about payments from laboratories to physicians in excess of the fair market value of the physician’s services and payments that reflect the volume or value of referrals of federal healthcare program business.
 
Another issue the OIG has expressed concern about involves the provision of discounts on laboratory services billed to customers in return for the referral of federal health care program business. In a 1999 Advisory Opinion, the OIG concluded that a proposed arrangement whereby a laboratory would offer physicians significant discounts on non-federal health care program laboratory tests might violate the Anti-Kickback Law. The OIG reasoned that the laboratory could be viewed as providing such discounts to the physician in exchange for referrals by the physician of business to be billed by the laboratory to Medicare at non-discounted rates. The OIG indicated that the arrangement would not qualify for protection under the discount safe harbor to the Anti-Kickback Law because Medicare and Medicaid would not get the benefit of the discount. Similarly, in a 1999 correspondence, the OIG stated that if any direct or indirect link exists between a discount that a laboratory offers to a skilled nursing facility (“SNF”) for tests covered under Medicare’s payments to the SNF and the referral of tests billable by the laboratory under Medicare Part B, then the Anti-Kickback Law would be implicated.
 
The OIG also has issued guidance regarding joint venture arrangements that may be viewed as suspect under the Anti-Kickback Law. These documents have relevance to clinical laboratories that are part of (or are considering establishing) joint ventures with potential sources of federal health care program business. The first guidance document, which focused on investor referrals to such ventures, was issued in 1989 and another concerning contractual joint ventures was issued in April 2003. Some of the elements of joint ventures that the OIG identified as “suspect” include: arrangements in which the capital invested by the physicians is disproportionately small and the return on investment is disproportionately large when compared to a typical investment; specific selection of investors who are in a position to make referrals to the venture; and arrangements in which one of the parties to the joint venture expands into a line of business that is dependent on referrals from the other party (sometimes called “shell” joint ventures). In a 2004 advisory opinion, the OIG expressed concern about a proposed joint venture in which a laboratory company would assist physician groups in establishing off-site pathology laboratories. The OIG indicated that the physicians’ financial and business risk in the venture was minimal and that the physicians would contract out substantially all laboratory operations, committing very little in the way of financial, capital, or human resources. The OIG was unable to exclude the possibility that the arrangement was designed to permit the laboratory to pay the physician groups for their referrals, and therefore was unwilling to find that the arrangement fell within a safe harbor or had sufficient safeguards to protect against fraud or abuse.

Violations of other fraud and abuse laws also can result in exclusion from participation in federal health care programs, including Medicare and Medicaid. One basis for such exclusion is an individual’s or entity’s submission of claims to Medicare or Medicaid that are substantially in excess of that individual’s or entity’s usual charges for like items or services. In 2003, the OIG issued a notice of proposed rulemaking that would have defined the terms “usual charges” and “substantially in excess” in ways that might have required providers, including the Company, to either lower their charges to Medicare and Medicaid or increase charges to certain other payers to avoid the risk of exclusion. On June 18, 2007, however, the OIG withdrew the proposed rule, saying it preferred to continue evaluating billing patterns on a case-by-case basis. In its withdrawal notice, the OIG also said it “remains concerned about disparities in the amounts charged to Medicare and Medicaid when compared to private payers,” that it continues to believe its exclusion authority for excess charges “provides useful backstop protection for the public fisc from providers that routinely charge Medicare or Medicaid substantially more than their other customers,” and that it will continue to use “all tools available … to address instances where Medicare or Medicaid are charged substantially more than other payers.” An enforcement action by the OIG under this statutory exclusion basis or an enforcement by Medicaid officials of similar state law restrictions could have a material adverse effect on the Company.
 
Under another federal statute, known as the “Stark Law” or “self-referral” prohibition, physicians may not refer Medicare and Medicaid patients to providers of a broad range of designated health services with which the physicians or their immediate family members have ownership or certain other financial arrangements unless an exceptions applies, regardless of the intent of the parties. Similarly, providers may not bill Medicare for services furnished pursuant to a prohibited self-referral. There are several Stark Law exceptions, including: 1) fair market value compensation for the provision of items or services; 2) payments by physicians to a laboratory for clinical laboratory services; 3) an exception for certain ancillary services (including laboratory services) provided within the referring physician’s own office, if certain criteria are satisfied; 4) physician investment in a company whose stock is traded on a public exchange and has stockholder equity exceeding $75.0 million; and 5) certain space and equipment rental arrangements that are set at a fair market value rate and satisfy other requirements. All of the requirements of a Stark Law exception must be met to take advantage of the exception. Many states have their own self-referral laws as well, which in some cases apply to all patient referrals, not just government reimbursement programs.
 
There are a variety of other types of federal and state fraud and abuse laws, including laws prohibiting submission of false or fraudulent claims. The Company seeks to conduct its business in compliance with all federal and state fraud and abuse laws. The Company is unable to predict how these laws will be applied in the future, and no assurances can be given that its arrangements will not be subject to scrutiny under such laws. Sanctions for violations of these laws may include exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal or state health care programs, significant criminal and civil fines and penalties, and loss of licensure. Any exclusion from participation in a federal or state health care program, or any loss of licensure, arising from any action by any federal or state regulatory or enforcement authority, would likely have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business. In addition, any significant criminal or civil penalty resulting from such proceedings could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business.
 
Environmental, Health and Safety
 
The Company is subject to licensing and regulation under federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and human health and safety laws and regulations relating to the handling, transportation and disposal of medical specimens, infectious and hazardous waste and radioactive materials. All Company laboratories are subject to applicable laws and regulations relating to biohazard disposal of all laboratory specimens and the Company generally utilizes outside vendors for disposal of such specimens. In addition, the federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration (“OSHA”) has established extensive requirements relating to workplace safety for health care employers, including clinical laboratories, whose workers may be exposed to blood-borne pathogens such as HIV and the hepatitis B virus. These regulations, among other things, require work practice controls, protective clothing and equipment, training, medical follow-up, vaccinations and other measures designed to minimize exposure to, and transmission of, blood-borne pathogens.
 
On November 6, 2000, Congress passed the Needle Stick Safety and Prevention Act, which required, among other things, that companies include in their safety programs the evaluation and use of engineering controls such as safety needles if found to be effective at reducing the risk of needle stick injuries in the workplace. The Company has implemented the use of safety needles at all of its service locations, where applicable.

Although the Company is not aware of any current material non-compliance with such federal, state and local laws and regulations, failure to comply could subject the Company to denial of the right to conduct business, fines, criminal penalties and/or other enforcement actions.
 
Drug Testing
 
There is no comprehensive federal law that regulates drug testing in the private sector. The Drug-Free Workplace Act does impose certain employee education requirements on companies that do business with the government, but it does not require testing, nor does it restrict testing in any way. Drug testing is allowed under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) because the ADA does not consider drug abuse a disability — but the law does not regulate or prohibit testing. Instead of a comprehensive regulatory system, federal law provides for specific agencies to adopt drug testing regulations for employers under their jurisdiction. As a general rule, testing is presumed to be lawful unless there is a specific restriction in state or federal law.
Controlled Substances
 
The use of controlled substances in testing for drugs of abuse is regulated by the Federal Drug Enforcement Administration. The Company believes that it is in compliance with these regulations as applicable.
Compliance Program
 
The Company continuously evaluates and monitors its compliance with all Medicare, Medicaid and other rules and regulations. The objective of the Company’s compliance program is to develop, implement, and update compliance safeguards as necessary. Emphasis is placed on developing and implementing compliance policies and guidelines, personnel training programs and various monitoring and audit procedures to attempt to achieve implementation of all applicable rules and regulations.
 
The Company seeks to conduct its business in compliance with all statutes, regulations, and other requirements applicable to its operations. The health care industry is, however, subject to extensive regulation, and many of these statutes and regulations have not been interpreted by the courts. There can be no assurance that applicable statutes and regulations will not be interpreted or applied by a prosecutorial, regulatory or judicial authority in a manner that would adversely affect the Company. Potential sanctions for violation of these statutes and regulations include significant civil and criminal penalties, fines, exclusions from participation in government health care programs and the loss of various licenses, certificates, and authorizations, necessary to operate as well as potential liabilities from third-party claims, all of which could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business.
 
Certificate of Need Requirements
 
A number of states require approval for the purchase, construction or expansion of various healthcare facilities, such as hospitals, including findings of need for additional or expanded healthcare facilities or services. Certificates of Need (“CONs”), which are issued by governmental agencies with jurisdiction over applicable healthcare facilities, are at times required for capital expenditures exceeding a prescribed amount, changes in bed capacity or the addition of services and certain other matters. Tennessee, the state in which the Big South Fork Medical Center and Tennova Healthcare-Jamestown are located, has a CON law that applies to such facilities. States periodically review, modify and revise their CON laws and related regulations.
 
The Company is unable to predict whether its subsidiaries’ hospitals will be able to obtain any CONs that may be necessary to accomplish their business objectives in any jurisdiction where such certificates of need are required. Violation of these state laws may result in the imposition of civil sanctions or the revocation of licenses for such facilities. In addition, future healthcare facility acquisitions also may occur in states that require CONs.
 
Future healthcare facility acquisitions also may occur in states that do not require CONs or which have less stringent CON requirements than the state in which Rennova currently operates a hospital. Any healthcare facility operated by the Company in such states may face increased competition from new or expanding facilities operated by competitors, including physicians.
 
Utilization Review Compliance and Hospital Governance
 
Healthcare facilities are subject to, and comply with, various forms of utilization review. In addition, under the Medicare prospective payment system, each state must have a peer review organization to carry out a federally mandated system of review of Medicare patient admissions, treatments and discharges in hospitals. Medical and surgical services and physician practices are supervised by committees of staff doctors at each healthcare facility, are overseen by each healthcare facility’s local governing board, the primary voting members of which are physicians and community members, and are reviewed by quality assurance personnel. The local governing boards also help maintain standards for quality care, develop long-range plans, establish, review and enforce practices and procedures and approve the credentials and disciplining of medical staff members.
Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act
 
The Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act (“EMTALA”) is a federal law that requires any hospital that participates in the Medicare program to conduct an appropriate medical screening examination of every person who presents to the hospital’s emergency department for treatment and, if the patient is suffering from an emergency medical condition or is in active labor, to either stabilize that condition or make an appropriate transfer of the patient to a facility that can handle the condition. The obligation to screen and stabilize emergency medical conditions exists regardless of a patient’s ability to pay for treatment. There are severe penalties under EMTALA if a hospital fails to screen or appropriately stabilize or transfer a patient or if the hospital delays appropriate treatment in order to first inquire about the patient’s ability to pay. Penalties for violations of EMTALA include civil monetary penalties and exclusion from participation in the Medicare program, the Medicaid program or both. In addition, an injured patient, the patient’s family or a medical facility that suffers a financial loss as a direct result of another hospital’s violation of the law can bring a civil suit against that other hospital. Although we believe that we comply with EMTALA, we cannot predict whether CMS will implement new requirements in the future and whether our subsidiaries’ hospitals will be able to comply with any new requirements.
Employees
 
As of March 16, 2018, we have 155 employees for our continuing operations, of which 98 are full time. Of our total employees from continuing operations, 7 are assigned to laboratory operations, 12 are assigned to sales and customer service, 4 are assigned to corporate administration, and 132 are assigned to our Big South Fork Medical Center. In addition, we have 18 employees associated with our discontinued operations. We continue to adjust our number of employees to achieve efficiencies and cost savings where applicable. We currently expect to have a total of approximately 134 additional hospital employees when our Tennova Healthcare - Jamestown hospital is acquired and is in full operation.
Available Information
 
We are required to file Annual Reports on Form 10-K and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) on a regular basis and are required to disclose certain material events in a Current Report on Form 8-K. All reports of the Company filed with the SEC are available free of charge through the SEC’s Web site at http://www.sec.gov. In addition, the public may read and copy materials filed by the Company at the SEC’s Public Reference Room located at 100 F Street, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20549. The public may also obtain additional information on the operation of the Public Reference Room by calling the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330.
