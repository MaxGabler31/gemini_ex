 Industry Overview and Market Opportunity 
 Digital transformation continues to advance the way individuals and businesses interact, and has had a sweeping impact on the markets and industries we serve. This transformation 
 
2 


  has introduced new distribution channels for marketers to reach their audiences, heightened the need for large amounts of personalized content, and amplified the requirement for a brand to stand out among its competitors. As brands distribute their content across a complex ecosystem of devices, screens, and online and offline operating platforms, organizations continue to modernize their technology solutions, seek support from trusted vendors, and increase the level of digital expertise and security across the entire organization. 
 Todays creative professionals have a far better understanding of the customer today than a decade ago. This has been fueled by advancements in technologies such as artificial intelligence, or AI, and by greater access to data than ever before. A continued challenge for creative professionals, however, is finding balance between data, technologies and their ability to deliver content that is engaging, on brand and relevant to the intended audience, seamlessly across online and offline platforms. For device manufacturers, the challenge is ensuring both the brand assets and designs deployed everywhere have the look and feel that the author intended. 
 Content Creators 
 Content creators who produce digital or printed material seek creative ways to convey meaning and differentiate a brands identity. Fonts are an important tool for this differentiation. For example, creative professionals at multinational corporations are increasingly tasked with creating solutions that extend their brand into new markets and onto new devices and operating platforms. The challenge is to ensure that branding efforts are reflected consistently in every communication, regardless of media. In addition, creative professionals need design tools that integrate seamlessly into their workflows, making them more efficient. Web fonts, which travel with the content to a users connected device for consistent viewing regardless of the environment, are an example of a solution that addresses the needs of creative professional customers. 
Marketers 
 As marketers leverage new digital media channels to reach their audience, they are forced to alter business and marketing strategies to better serve a mobile-first, multi-screen marketing landscape. Marketers need to have compelling content in order to participate in these channels without being viewed as intrusive or inauthentic. Two positive aspects of the changing landscape have emerged. First, consumers are actively seeking to align with brands that they view as reflecting their values and second, these media platforms (including social and messaging platforms) are offering more direct data on users and their interaction with the content. Marketers now have an opportunity to turn their best customers into advocates of the brand and creators of content. With the right technology platforms, marketers can leverage data generated from these interactions to refine programming. 
Consumer Device Manufacturers 
 Consumer devices require extensive multimedia functionality so that users can view, create and share videos, animations and other rich-media and interactive content across various mobile devices. Consumer device manufacturers must display multimedia content, including text, from these different sources. They must also provide a consistent look and feel across devices, supporting worldwide languages and, in many cases, supporting enhanced personalization. As technologies enable media to move seamlessly from one device 
 
3 


  to another, its critical that the devices access scalable, multilingual type and related display solutions that are optimized for these devices. For example: 
 

 | The automotive industry uses digital displays with complex, worldwide language requirements. As these manufacturers add more screens to automobiles, the demands for maintaining brand integrity increases.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Digital TVs incorporate scalable text for menu navigation, content delivery and connectivity.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Rich media functionality has moved to mobile platforms, driving the adoption of scalable text on phones, tablets and similar devices.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Makers of augmented reality and virtual reality, or AR/VR, devices that serve consumer, enterprise and government applications used text stabilization and display technology to reduce the physical discomfort some experience in these immersive environments.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Printer manufacturers are under cost pressure as consumers and businesses print less and store content digitally. Manufacturers of laser printers, typically those found in office environments, are responding by increasing the functionality of their products with new points of value such as a larger number of embedded fonts, expanded global language coverage and enhanced control panel functionality to create new printing paradigms and service offerings as well as lower costs. However, comprehensive global text solutions and related technologies continue to be an important part of printing platforms today and vital to the value manufacturers provide to their customers. 
 Independent Software Vendors and Developers 
 Independent software vendors, or ISVs, require multilingual text solutions for product user interfaces as well as a range of type to add functionality to applications. Mobile device game developers want a distinctive and consistent typeface for their games, especially when the game is designed to run on multiple devices and consoles. In addition, developers want to customize their offerings with fonts specific to their vertical market or geographic regions to ensure that text is displayed correctly on each device even when they have little control over how the content is consumed on the end device. 
 ISVs and platform developers are increasingly distributing their solutions through software-as-a-service (SaaS), cloud-based models and to multiple devices including PCs, mobile phones, game consoles, tablets and other devices. As a result, developers require font technologies that allow products to maintain a consistent, high-quality user experience regardless of the delivery model and device and its screen resolution. 
Our Products 
 Monotypes product offerings, primarily delivered through a term-based license or SaaS subscription, allow content creators and marketers to produce beautiful, authentic and impactful brands on any screen, in print or across the web.

7 


  increasing product flexibility. China, Japan and Korea are increasingly becoming centers of design, manufacturing and consumers of consumer devices, and we have more than 25 years of experience partnering with leading Asian companies such as Kyocera Mita. 
 Attractive Business Model. We have a significant, predictable base of licensing revenue that is based, in part, on multi-year financial commitments by our customers, mainly due to our established relationships with OEMs, the high volume of web transactions, recurring direct sales business and enterprise software through the sale of Mosaic. Other revenue contracts have renewable term licenses, and in Creative Professional, our Olapic offering is a subscription-based model that provides a recurring stream of revenue. Our business model produces an overall recurring and predictable revenue base of over approximately 85% of our total revenue. 
 Technological and Intellectual Property Leadership. Our technologies are key to providing unique, flexible and comprehensive solutions for content creation, distribution and consumption, and we continue to invest in extending our technology and market leadership positions. For example, the flexibility of our offerings enables us to provide tailored, comprehensive solutions for specific industries, such as the automotive industry. In addition, our Olapic technology platform for gathering, moderating, distributing and measuring user-generated content and other types of branded content, when utilized with our traditional offerings, provides our customers a unique solution for designing content and using that content for marketing purposes. 
 Our Strategy 
 Monotype empowers brand expression and engagement for creatives, designers, marketers and engineers whose three primary needs are to: 
 

 | Produce compelling content that drives brand expression
--+--------------------------------------------------------


 | Activate that content everywhere
--+---------------------------------


 | Understand the impact of that content to drive improvement over time
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------

 To serve these needs, Monotype provides design assets such as fonts and visual content tools to manage photos, videos and text. We provide technologies that aid in the discovery, management and activation of those visual assets, as well as custom design and brand advisory services. Through our technology offerings and an assortment of licensing models available, Monotype enables brands to activate their design assets throughout the globe across any environment, both in print and in digital formats. 
 From creating compelling brand experiences to cultivating engaging relationships between brands and their best customers, we strive to be the first place to turn for the design assets, technology and expertise that empower brand engagement and the best user experiences. The following are the key components of our strategy: 
 Creative Professional 
 Empower the Creative Process. Our focus is to help designers and other creative professionals succeed as workflows and publishing environments become more complex. Our customers are creating content that is distributed through a broad range of publishing environments, including the web, mobile devices, applications as well as print. We provide a comprehensive selection of typeface designs, custom typefaces, worldwide language support

  and fonts that are tuned to display in the highest quality, regardless of the output medium. Our licensing options provide flexible coverage to meet our customers evolving requirements. A key component of our strategy is offering simplified, flexible subscriptions to large portions of our font library, which is increasingly delivered through an enterprise software product offering, with the goal of making it easier for creative professionals to access and use any font. 
 Our customers creative needs are not limited to fonts. Just as distribution environments have grown in complexity, so too have the forms of content to which consumers respond. Consumers find content that they view as authentic (as opposed to staged) as more attractive. To that end, our strategy includes offering design assets and other types of content that meet this requirement. User-generated photos and videos, which reflect consumers interpretation of the brand, and branded assets, which allow consumers to express themselves using a brands imagery, are examples of how Monotype is expanding its offering to meet these broader creative requirements. 
 Cultivate Meaningful Digital Engagement. Our strategy now extends beyond the creation of content to marketers use of this content to communicate with their best customers. Monotype enables activation of branded user experiences to attract, acquire and engage our customers consumers. The goal is to provide content that resonates with these consumers through an authentic representation of the brand. Through our Olapic offerings, we offer a platform for gathering and moderating user-generated and influencer-generated content. The Content Engine platform allows brands to develop meaningful content, activate the content across myriad of distribution channels, and then measure response rates to determine what designs are most effective, which contributors offer the best content and what programs are most successful. 
 OEM 
 Display Imaging 
 Increase Penetration of our Technologies and Fonts into a Wide Range of Device Categories. Our technologies and fonts play an important role in the mass-market success of device categories such as automotive displays, smart TVs, wearables, mobile devices and e-book readers and tablets. We have an established base of customers in these categories, and we will seek to expand within existing accounts as new models are added, or as new product lines are introduced. We intend to continue to pursue new design wins such as next-generation in-vehicle displays, and help customers meet key requirements including brand integrity, high legibility and worldwide language support. We also seek to expand our value proposition to device manufacturers by providing a more holistic solution that serves both product experience and branding needs. Our offering is an important component of the user experience on consumer devices. Yet the user experience is only one manifestation of a manufacturers brand communication. As an example, a mobile smartphone manufacturer utilizes our font IP and embedded technology to optimize the user experience of the device. That same manufacturer uses our font IP and UGC technology to develop a brands identity and influence purchase decisions of its target audience in leading channels. Our strategy includes introducing a licensing model that meets not only the device-side needs of device engineers but also the design and marketing needs of creative professionals within these large organizations.

 Printer Imaging 
 Leverage Our Long-Term Relationships. We constantly strive to strengthen our long-term relationships by working closely with OEMs to fulfill evolving requirements, such as providing value-added solutions that differentiate offerings, reduce cost or capitalize on new technology paradigms. For example, we offer printer manufacturers flexible, high-performance printer driver tool kits that support popular operating systems. OEMs are able to integrate and customize robust printing capabilities to gain a competitive edge. Our flexible architecture, support for multiple print languages and extensive use of common code enables printer manufacturers to speed products to market while reducing development time and costs. Using our solution to support multiple page description languages, in combination with our fonts and drivers, provides a more complete offering. In addition, we offer licensing models that make deploying our fonts and technologies broadly within a printer manufacturers offering easy for the long term. 
Independent Software Vendors and Developers 
 Expand Support of ISVs to All Deployment Environments. Our ISV strategy is focused on licensing fonts and tools to provide the flexibility ISVs need to create compelling offerings for devices like tablets, smartphones and medical devices. Our core offering to ISVs and developers consists of fonts, custom typefaces and rendering technologies for language coverage, platform compatibility, user experience enhancement and creative expression. Options for accessing and deploying our software and applications have expanded from on-device to secure cloud-based services and combinations of the two. New environments such as AR/VR require our customers to display content in ways not envisioned previously. Our AR/VR solution enables ISVs to create a robust text experience within these applications. 
Overall, We Seek to: 
 Expand and Deepen our Global Presence. We intend to drive revenue growth by leveraging our knowledge of global markets and through global operations. Our strategy focuses on countries and regions where our target Creative Professional and OEM customers and prospects are concentrated. Our approach includes expanding our presence in key countries and developing a direct or indirect presence in countries that we evaluate as having strong potential for growth. Through this organic expansion and possible acquisitions, we intend to increase our ability to service consumer device manufacturers and creative professionals throughout the world. 
 Selectively Pursue Complementary Acquisitions, Strategic Partnerships and Third-Party Intellectual Property. We intend to continue to selectively pursue acquisitions, strategic partnerships and third-party intellectual property to accelerate our speed to market with complementary solutions, penetrate new geographies and enhance our intellectual property portfolio of fonts and technologies. We believe that the market for our solutions is still fragmented which presents opportunity for building out our global offerings. In markets and industries that are still developing or are undergoing significant change, we will continue to seek out strategic partnerships to help us evaluate the attractiveness of the segment and our ability to support solutions to those customers.

Further, we continue to advance our machine learning capabilities across the business. At Olapic, we leverage machine learning to streamline moderation of UGC for our clients by processing over 100 million images in 2018, training the Olapic platform to sort through images that are unfit for use. In type, we use machine learning to improve search and discovery of font IP for our customers that access our libraries via our e-commerce sites and applications. This aids the users in finding the right IP for their specific needs quickly and more accurately. Our research and development operations are located in Woburn, Massachusetts; Los Altos, California; Boulder, Colorado; Chicago, Illinois; New York, New York; Cordoba, Argentina; Salfords, United Kingdom; Bad Homburg and Berlin, Germany; Noida, India; and Hong Kong, China.

Further information on research and development expenses may be found in Item 7, Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 
 Intellectual Property 
 We rely on a combination of copyright, patent and trademark laws, and on contractual restrictions to establish and protect proprietary rights in our technologies and fonts. Whenever possible, we enter into non-disclosure agreements with our suppliers, partners and others to limit access to and disclosure of our proprietary information. 
 We apply for U.S. and international patents with respect to our technologies, and seek copyright registration of our software and U.S. and international trademark registration in those instances which we determine are competitively advantageous and cost effective to do so. We have been granted a total of 25 patents and have 7 patents pending with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office with many also filed in foreign jurisdictions. Some of our most important patents are related to our dynamic sub-setting, font compression and machine learning technologies. We have unregistered trademarks and, where appropriate, registered trademarks on the key fonts in our Monotype Libraries. We intend to continue our policy of taking all measures we deem necessary to protect our patent, copyright, trade secret and trademark rights. 
 Some of our fonts are owned by third parties that we license under exclusive or non-exclusive agreements. We have also collaborated with third parties in the production and development of fonts. 
Competition 
 Our solutions compete with those offered by a variety of companies, including vendors of print and screen imaging technologies, printer drivers and design tools, as well as designers and distributors of fonts. We compete principally on the basis of our technical innovation, engineering and customer support expertise, the breadth of our font offerings and the overall performance of our solutions, including reliability and timely delivery. Competition with our solutions comes from a variety of sources, including companies that license technologies and fonts, such as Adobe, and local providers of solutions that are specific to a particular countrys language requirements, such as Morisawa in Japan. We also compete with open source fonts and technologies, including the FreeType text renderer, a product of an open source collaborative organization that provides its Linux font rendering code for free, and Google, which provides open source fonts. In addition, we compete with several small players in the emergent components of the visual content marketing space in which we participate, such as, but not limited to, Bazaarvoice, Curalate and Pixlee. The competition for our custom font design services generally comes from companies offering their own type libraries and custom type services, including boutique font foundries and independent professionals.

These works councils have the right to participate in certain decisions by Monotype GmbH, including operational changes, such as relocation of the business or change of control transactions, and social matters such as wages and salaries and working hours.
