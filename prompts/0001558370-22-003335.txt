Item 1. Business
Overview 
We are a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company utilizing artificial intelligence approaches to develop transformative medicines in neuroscience and immuno-oncology. Our drug re-innovation approach leverages existing approved drugs and/or clinically validated product candidates together with big data and proprietary machine learning algorithms to identify new therapeutic indices. We believe that this differentiated approach has the potential to reduce the cost and time of drug development in diseases with a substantial unmet medical need. 


Our two most advanced clinical development programs are BXCL501, an investigational, proprietary, orally dissolving, sublingual thin film formulation of the adrenergic receptor agonist dexmedetomidine, or Dex, for the treatment of agitation resulting from neuropsychiatric disorders, and BXCL701, an investigational orally administered systemic innate immune activator for the treatment of castration resistant prostate cancer and advanced solid tumors that are refractory or treatment naïve to checkpoint inhibitors.
Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic
 During the first quarter ended March 31, 2020, and continuing through December 31, 2021, the novel coronavirus disease, or COVID-19, was declared a pandemic and spread to multiple regions across the globe, including the United States and Europe. The outbreak and government measures taken in response have had a significant impact, both direct and indirect, on businesses and commerce, as worker shortages have occurred; supply chains have been disrupted; facilities and production have been suspended; and demand for certain goods and services, such as medical services and supplies, has spiked, while demand for other goods and services, such as travel, has fallen.
To date, we have taken steps in line with guidance from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (“CDC”) and the State of Connecticut to protect the health and safety of our employees and the community. In particular, we implemented a work-from-home policy for all employees and have restricted on-site activities to certain chemical, manufacturing and control (“CMC”) and clinical trial activities. We continue to assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic to best mitigate risk and continue the operations of our business. Beginning late in the second quarter of 2020, we began to slowly bring our staff, in very limited numbers, back to our office. This modified return-to-work approach is continuing into 2022. We have taken steps to protect our workforce and have instituted strict work rules to protect our employees. 
We continue to work closely with our clinical sites to monitor the potential impact of the evolving COVID-19 pandemic. We remain committed to our clinical programs and development plans. Other than our Phase 2 clinical trial evaluating BXCL501 in patients with delirium, through December 31, 2021, we have not experienced any significant delays to our ongoing or planned clinical trials, except for challenges in accessing elderly care facilities and ICU settings; however, this could rapidly change.

Our Strategy 
Our goal is to become the leading AI-enabled neuroscience company while further developing our immuno-oncology assets. We continue to evaluate all strategic options available to us for these assets which could include licensing, partnering, co-commercialization or a spin-out. The key elements to achieving these goals are as follows:
Neuroscience

● | Advance BXCL501, a proprietary, orally dissolving thin film formulation of dexmedetomidine, or Dex, a selective α2a adrenergic receptor agonist, targeting symptoms from stress-related behaviors such as agitation and opioid withdrawal symptoms. BXCL501 is our most advanced neuroscience clinical program, currently being developed for the acute treatment of agitation related to schizophrenia, bipolar disorders, Alzheimer’s disease and delirium, the symptoms associated with opioid withdrawal, and as an adjunctive treatment for major depressive disorder (“MDD”) in conjunction with the use of Selective Serotonin / Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors (“SS/NRIs”). We have submitted a New Drug Application (NDA) utilizing the Section 505(b)(2) pathway for BXCL501 for the acute treatment of agitation associated with schizophrenia and bipolar disorders I and II. The United States Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) filed the application for review and assigned an April 5, 2022, Prescription Drug User Fee Act (“PUDFA”) goal date.

● | Neurological and Psychiatric Disorders. We believe that BXCL501, if approved, has the potential to become the standard of care for the acute treatment of agitation arising from diseases such as: 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


◾ | Schizophrenia and bipolar disorder (SERENITY I and II trials); and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------

7




◾ | Alzheimer’s disease (TRANQUILITY II and TRANQUILITY III trials within our pivotal Phase 3 program)
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | In addition, given the differentiated design of BXCL501 and its potential mechanism of action, we believe BXCL501 has the potential to address several diseases or conditions where agitation is a symptom of the condition or underlying disease, including:
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


◾ | As an adjunctive treatment for MDD;
--+------------------------------------

​

◾ | Opioid withdrawal (RELEASE trial);
--+-----------------------------------


◾ | Delirium (PLACIDITY trial); and
--+--------------------------------


◾ | Post-traumatic stress disorder (“PTSD”).
--+-----------------------------------------

Pipeline Opportunities for Franchise Expansion 
In December 2020, the VA Connecticut Healthcare System and Yale University Medical School were awarded a grant by the U.S. Department of Defense’s Congressionally Directed Medical Research Programs to evaluate BXCL501 in patients suffering from PTSD as well as alcohol use disorder. We plan to investigate BXCL501 as a potential chronic treatment for PTSD. 
We continue to explore the potential for a wearable device to measure early signs of agitation in patients who are consistent with the patient groups we are evaluating in BXCL501 clinical trials. Feasibility studies demonstrated that patients were able to wear these devices and that these devices were able to transmit data to our service vendor. Along with our service vendor, we are developing methods to use these data in an effort to construct algorithms designed to predict when a patient is becoming agitated. The goal of this program is to establish a predictive algorithm that would allow providers to treat patients before they become highly agitated. A study in healthy volunteers that are mildly agitated is scheduled to begin in Q1, 2022. 
 We are advancing our preparations for commercial and launch readiness in preparation for the potential approval of our NDA for BXCL501 by the FDA. We are optimizing the design and recruitment of our sales force and market access and pricing strategy for the potential commercial launch of BXCL501 for the acute treatment of agitation associated with schizophrenia and bipolar disorders I & II. This work will be a crucial foundation to launching additional potential follow-on indications, paving the way for our expanding neuroscience business. 
During the second half of 2021, we fully launched our unbranded disease education campaign to promote awareness around the treatment of agitation in schizophrenia and bipolar disorders. In addition, we fully deployed our Medical Science Liaison and Medical Managed Care teams who actively engaged with healthcare professionals and payors to provide key insights to support our commercial strategy. 
If BXCL501 is approved outside the United States we would consider launching the product through collaborations with third parties.
We recently identified and initiated the development of a second neuropsychiatric product candidate, BXCL502. We plan to evaluate BXCL502 initially as a monotherapy and possibly as a combination with BXCL501 for the chronic treatment of agitation in patients with dementia, including Alzheimer’s disease. The active pharmaceutical ingredient (“API”) underlying BXCL502 is designed to be a potent and selective antagonist of a G-protein coupled receptor (“GPCR”) that affects serotonergic signaling in the brain. Our preclinical data and machine learning results suggest BXCL502 has the potential to treat agitation and stress related neuropsychiatric symptoms in dementia. In previously published third party clinical trial data, daily administration of the API of BXCL502 demonstrated improvement in agitation using a well-established, clinically validated

symptom scale. Formulation and clinical development planning are currently underway with BXCL502.
Immuno-Oncology
BXCL701 is a potential first-in-class, oral, small-molecule immunomodulator designed to stimulate both the innate and acquired immune systems by inhibiting DPP 8/9. DPP 8/9 behave as "checkpoints" of pyroptosis and inflammasome activation. We believe that BXCL701, if successfully developed and approved, may establish a differentiated immuno-oncology platform by modulating multiple steps in the cancer immunity cycle and, when combined with checkpoint inhibitors and/or immune activating agents, may be able to convert immuno-resistant (“cold”) tumors to immuno-sensitive (“hot”) tumors.

● | Complete BXCL701 Phase 2 trials to evaluate its potential for the treatment of castrate resistant cancer (“CRPC”), including the neuroendocrine (“NEPC”) variety.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | NEPC (Orphan Segment of Prostate Cancer and Castrate Resistant Prostate Cancer). BXCL701 was previously studied in multiple clinical trials and demonstrated single agent anti-tumor activity in melanoma, an immune-sensitive tumor. In April 2020, we announced the initiation of the Phase 2 efficacy portion of the Phase 1b/2 trial evaluating BXCL701 in combination with KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab, a PD-1 inhibitor) for NEPC. In addition to the efficacy cohort in NEPC patients, in August 2020, we opened a separate cohort for CRPC patients who have failed taxane-based chemotherapy and up to two lines of second-generation androgen pathway blockers. Topline results from the Phase 1b portion of this trial were presented at the American Society of Clinical Oncology Genitourinary Symposium in February 2021. Interim data from the Phase 2 portion of the study were also presented at the European Society for Medical Oncology conference in September 2021. We reported updated interim data from the Phase 2 portion of this trial in NEPC and adenocarcinoma cohorts at the American Society of Clinical Oncology (“ASCO”) Genitourinary Cancers Symposium (“ASCO-GU”) in February 2022. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Basket Trial. BXCL701 is being evaluated in an open-label Phase 2 basket trial led by MD Anderson. The investigator led study is designed to evaluate the response rate of orally administered BXCL701, combined with Pembrolizumab (KEYTRUDA®) in patients with advanced solid cancers. The study will evaluate patients who are naïve to checkpoint therapy and those who are refractory to checkpoint therapy. Interim data were presented at the June 2021 ASCO annual meeting. In the first half of 2022, we expect to present additional interim efficacy data from the trial. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

● | Potential for Expedited Review Programs. Given that these indications represent high unmet medical needs with few treatment options, we intend to pursue breakthrough therapy designation and accelerated approval for NEPC. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Additional Indications. We believe BXCL701 may be active at multiple stages of the cancer immunity cycle and therefore, we believe BXCL701 offers a “pipeline in a product” platform given its potential for evaluation across other cancers. BXCL701 was granted orphan drug designation for the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia in September 2019, its fourth orphan drug designation in addition to pancreatic cancer, melanoma, and soft tissue sarcoma. We believe existing preclinical (and clinical) evidence supports the combination of BXCL701 with checkpoint inhibitors and/or agents that act on “co-stimulatory” pathways within immune effector cells. Moreover, we believe agents that stimulate antibody-dependent cell mediated cytotoxicity (“ADCC”), or cell-based therapies such as chimeric antigen receptor T cell, therapy, oncolytic viruses or therapeutic vaccines all represent potential combination with BXCL701. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Other
● Identify biomarkers to select patients who we believe have the highest likelihood to respond to our product candidates. Predicting optimal drug responses in patients requires the identification and validation of predictive biomarkers. We believe that our ability to identify patient subsets most likely to 

9



respond to our product candidates will increase the clinical benefit to patients and improve the probability of success of our clinical trials. The indications for our lead product candidate BXCL701 were chosen in part because they are known to overexpress dipeptidyl peptidase, or DPP 8/9, and fibroblast activation protein, or FAP. Our planned proof-of-concept clinical trial of BXCL701 will retrospectively examine biomarkers related to its molecular and cellular targets to identify those that may correlate with clinical efficacy and increase our likelihood of success.
● Maximize the commercial potential of our product candidates. We have worldwide development and commercialization rights to BXCL501, BXCL502, and BXCL701. If BXCL501 and BXCL701 are approved in the United States, we are developing plans to build a specialty sales force in the United States for BXCL501 and considering other opportunities to collaborate with third parties to maximize the potential of our product candidates.
● Enhance our R&D pipeline by leveraging our therapeutic area expertise with our growing internal capabilities to identify, develop and commercialize new product candidates in neuroscience and immune oncology. In addition to our leading clinical programs and our emerging and future pipeline, we have identified several potential product candidates and intend to select our next clinical program from among such candidates. We have established translational and development expertise, which we believe will help us advance the present and future product candidates in these fields. We may also opportunistically in-license additional product candidates identified through our AI platform approach within our core areas of expertise. 
​
Our Novel Drug Re-Innovation Approach 
We aim to develop and implement holistically throughout the drug development process an artificial intelligence (“AI”) eco system designed to rapidly identify drugs that engage novel targets related to our key focus areas in neuroscience and immuno-oncolgy. Our in-house, uniquely integrated AI -to -drug -development capability is complemented by BioXcel LLC’s services and technology. For example, we have constructed a labeled properties graph (also referred to as a “knowledge graph”) that visually relates neuropsychiatric symptoms, brain circuits, drug targets and existing drugs. By making these connections, new potential uses for existing drugs emerge. The knowledge graph may be queried to uncover not only single drugs but potentially new combinations of drugs that we believe may be more effective in treating disorders than single agents. New combinations of drugs provide the opportunity to evaluate lower, potentially tolerable doses of drugs and also provide the basis for stronger intellectual property positions. The AI team works closely with business development to prioritize the most valuable external opportunities in a data-driven manner. These opportunities may be found in new potential uses for launched drugs, in drugs that are part of pharmaceutical company pipelines that are no longer being pursued, or within academic efforts to develop new drug candidates. 
In addition to our AI approach to neuropsychiatric symptoms and neurological rare diseases, in oncology we are actively examining signaling pathways in tumors that we believe are potential targets for synergistic drug combinations . We believe synergistic drug combinations may allow more effective treatments by reducing the probability of drug adaptation by cancer cells. AI is useful in matching existing oncology drugs and their mechanism of action to specific types of cancer as well as identifying combinations that we believe may have a higher probability of success.
Traditional drug development is plagued with low success rates (13.8%, according to an MIT study of 186,000 trials from January 2000 to October 2015), long drug development cycles (10-15 years, according to PhRMA Key Facts 2016), and exorbitant development costs ($2.6 billion per drug, according to PhRMA Key Facts). Furthermore, many serious diseases continue to go unaddressed due to limitations of the current drug discovery paradigm. The pharmacological space spans more than 27,000 active pharmaceutical agents, and only approximately 4,000 are approved and marketed drugs benefiting patients. These marketed drugs may be applied to other indications, including rare diseases, and represent an untapped potential for meeting significant unmet medical need and recoupment of research and development investments. Many of the remaining agents are clinical candidates that are active, shelved, or have failed for reasons other than toxicity and that can potentially be re-engineered for different indications or patient segments. They potentially represent an unrealized investment of billions of research and development dollars by the private and public sectors, resulting in an immeasurable amount of patient suffering and sacrificing during clinical development. Also, these compounds usually have known pharmacokinetic properties allowing for a more data-driven 

10



selection of appropriate doses for development programs. Finally, with respect to neuropsychiatric indications, we prioritize those compounds with structural design features that may contribute to high blood-brain barrier permeability, which may increase the likelihood of compound penetration into the brain. Lack of brain penetration is a common cause for failure of many drugs developed for neuropsychiatric indications. In addition, BioXcel is prioritizing compounds with available human safety data, acceptable pharmacokinetic results, and data that supports a high probability of achieving reasonable brain concentrations after dosing. The compounds in our pipeline have been identified using this proprietary platform.
This drug re-innovation model has been exemplified by the successful development and commercialization of drugs such as Tecfidera® (Biogen, Inc.), Thalomid® (Celgene Corporation) and Viagra® (Pfizer, Inc.). All of these drugs were identified by insights in biology and disease pathophysiology. The successful business models of biotech companies like Axsome-Therapeutics, Inc. and Karuna Therapeutics, Inc. are based on the re-innovation and combination of existing clinical candidates or marketed drugs to provide novel solutions for patients. Unfortunately, such discoveries have been severely limited in scope due to the lack of a genuinely integrated approach of mining big data and advanced analytics. 
Our AI-based discovery and development process is the foundation of our drug re-innovation model for identifying the next wave of potential medicines. Our therapeutic area experts have over 200 years of combined experience across the drug discovery and development value chain. We believe that our method of finding potential product candidates gives us a higher probability of success because it combines the comprehensiveness and efficiency of machine learning and big data analytics with the expertise and intuition of human experience in drug development. We believe the combination of AI and drug discovery and development expertise facilitates the generation of therapeutic candidates and gives us a significant competitive advantage.
Our approach is illustrated below:

​
We continue to integrate and evolve our neuroscience and immuno-oncology AI machine learning and drug discovery and development platform. Our platform has led to the identification and rapid development of BXCL501, leading to the submission of our first NDA as well as the advancement of other potential indications. We are continuing to leverage our platform to identify and develop new neuroscience and immuno-oncology programs. 
BXCL501 Neuroscience Program 
Overview
BXCL501 is an investigational, proprietary, orally dissolving, thin film formulation of dexmedetomidine (Dex), a selective alpha-2 receptor agonist, targeting symptoms from stress-related behaviors such as agitation and opioid withdrawal symptoms. BXCL501 is our most advanced neuroscience clinical program, currently being developed for the acute treatment of agitation related to schizophrenia, bipolar disorders, dementia (Alzheimer’s disease) and delirium, the symptoms associated with opioid withdrawal as well as for the adjunctive treatment of MDD in conjunction with the use of SSRIs or SNRIs. As a selective adrenergic agent with a sublingual or buccal route of administration, BXCL501 is designed to be easy to administer and has shown a rapid onset of action in multiple clinical trials, including clinical trials studying patients with schizophrenia, bipolar disorders, and dementia. We believe the results from these studies suggest that BXCL501 has the potential to generate a calming effect without producing excessive sedation. We believe that BXCL501 is highly differentiated from antipsychotics currently used as a standard of care for the treatment of agitation, which often produce unwanted side effects such as excessive sedation and extra-pyramidal motor effects. Managing patient agitation in neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders represents a significant challenge for physicians and caregivers. We believe that BXCL501 has the potential to address these challenges while providing an efficient treatment regimen for patients.
Agitation Overview and Market Opportunity
Agitation in patients with neuropsychiatric diseases (psychomotor agitation) is a serious medical condition. Agitation is characterized by feelings of unease, excessive talking and/or unintentional and purposeless motions, such as wringing of the hands or pacing. People experiencing agitation may also express excitement, hostility, poor impulse control, tension, uncooperativeness, and sometimes disruptive behavior, which may lead to aggression and violence. In many cases, people develop agitation when treatment for their underlying disorder is not working well. Stressful situations or traumatic events can also trigger agitation. Agitation can occur suddenly or slowly and vary in length, lasting for a few minutes or for an extended period of time.
With the agitation issues associated with schizophrenia and bipolar disease coupled with a fast growing elderly population who are potentially likely to experience agitation associated with Alzheimer’s disease, the difficulties and expenses of acute treatment of agitation are expected to grow significantly. Based on our market research, estimates indicate that by 2031 drugs for mental disorders could be up to $59 billion. Below are estimated statistics associated with these indications. 
​

Treatments for Agitation
​
Antipsychotics, the current standard of care for acute treatment of agitation in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, are also used off-label to treat agitation in dementia and other conditions. Side effects of these medications include movement disorders, including akathisia and extrapyramidal symptoms. One of the serious limitations of these drugs is that they can sedate the patient and do not permit verbal interaction with the hospital staff to continue. Intramuscular (“IM”) delivered antipsychotics, such as haloperidol and olanzapine, are used extensively in this setting but are invasive and often require patient restraint. This type of treatment dehumanizes patients and can cause trauma that could have long-term impact on the patient. Furthermore, these treatments include a black box warning for use in elderly patients. 
While sublingual tablet formulations utilizing antipsychotics have been developed, these formulations have long half-lives (21-24 hours) and significant side effects when given acutely or chronically. Oral agents such as benzodiazepines are also used but have a slow onset of action and are consequently ineffective in the acute treatment of agitation. Side effects of these agents include sedation, amnesia, confusion, and paradoxical responses. They can intensify cognitive slowing and worsen memory and motor impairment can contribute to an increased risk of falls and fractures. In addition, long-term use of benzodiazepines has been found to be habit-forming and can cause addiction or relapse to abuse substances. Non-adherence with oral agents can also be problematic as patients may attempt to spit out these medications. We believe that based on the current method of administration of oral medicine for agitation, the orally-dissolving, mucoadhesive thin film offers compliance advantages as it will prevent patients from avoiding treatment.

There is precedent for FDA approval of a non-invasive therapy for the acute treatment of agitation. In 2012, Adasuve®, an inhaled version of the antipsychotic loxapine, became the first approved non-invasive acute treatment for agitation in patients with schizophrenia and bipolar 1 disorder. The use of Adasuve has been limited due to a risk management program and the risk of bronchospasm. Adasuve also has a high incidence of side effects. Upon launch, Adasuve was priced at $145 per dose.

The sublingual or buccal route of administration is an accepted alternative to oral administration of drug delivery to the central nervous system, or CNS, when rapid onset or more controlled delivery is required. Currently, there are six products that are approved for thin-film administration. For example, BioDelivery Sciences International, Inc., a 

13



commercial-stage specialty pharmaceutical company dedicated to patients living with chronic conditions, has developed a buccal film formulation of buprenorphine for chronic pain management and buprenorphine and naloxone for opioid dependence. We have developed BXCL501 as a differentiated sublingual thin film dosage form of Dex, which we believe, if approved, may offer benefits such as ease of use and quick absorption for rapid therapeutic effects.
Mechanism of Action: α2a Adrenergic Receptor and NE Role in Acute Agitation
BXCL501 is designed to be easily administered and to have a rapid onset of action. We believe that BXCL501, with its differentiated pharmacology and ease of administration, if approved, could potentially be a first in class, non-invasive acute treatment for agitation that can be rapidly administered by physicians and caregivers. Dex is approved in the United States for the sedation of initially intubated and mechanically ventilated patients during treatment in the intensive care unit (“ICU”). It is also used in the intensive care setting for sedation of non-intubated patients prior to and/or during surgical and other invasive procedures. Dex, launched in the United States as Precedex™ in 1999, is a selective α2a adrenergic receptor agonist that has a strong safety record and has been studied in over 130 clinical trials to date. It has also been sold in the European Union and other countries under the trade name Dexdor® as a sedative for intensive care patients. Dex was approved by the European Commission for sedation of adult ICU patients requiring a sedation level no deeper than arousal in response to verbal stimulation (corresponding to Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale (“RASS”) 0 to -3). It has been used to prevent or treat hyperactive delirium resulting from anesthesia in the ICU. Given these uses of the IV formulation of Dex, we believe Dex formulated in a sublingual thin film and at much lower doses will allow for ease of administration in settings where rapid acute treatment of agitation is needed.
BXCL501 Clinical Trials 
SERENITY I and SERENITY II
In July 2020, we announced topline results from the SERENITY I and II pivotal trials, which showed that treatment with BXCL501 was well-tolerated and resulted in clinically meaningful reductions in agitation in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder I and II patients. In October 2020, we held a pre NDA meeting with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) to discuss the content and format of our anticipated NDA submission. The FDA also agreed to a rolling review of our NDA, allowing us to submit completed sections of the application early. On March 5, 2021, we completed the rolling submission of our NDA to the FDA. In May 2021, we announced the FDA had notified us that our NDA submission was accepted for filing. The FDA assigned a PDUFA goal date of January 5, 2022. In December 2021, we announced the extension of the FDA review period of our NDA to April 5, 2022. We also have plans underway to submit a Marketing Authorization Application (“MAA”) to the European Medicines Agency (“EMA”) for BXCL501 for the acute treatment of agitation associated with schizophrenia and bipolar disorders I & II in the first half of 2022.
​
TRANQUILITY and TRANQUILITY II and III
In January 2021, we announced topline results from the TRANQUILITY trial, a Phase 1b/2 randomized, placebo-controlled, adaptive ascending dose-finding study that enrolled 54 patients with agitation related in dementia., including Alzheimer's disease. Patients received BXCL501 at either 30mcg (n=16), 60mcg (n=20), 90 mcg (n=4) or placebo (n=14). Overall, BXCL501 was well tolerated and demonstrated statistically significant, clinically meaningful, rapid, and durable reductions in agitation with the 60 mcg dose as measured by multiple rating scales. 
The trial’s primary endpoint was to evaluate safety and tolerability in elderly demented patients experiencing an acute episode of agitation. During the study, BXCL501 was well-tolerated and no severe or serious adverse events were reported. The most common adverse event was somnolence characterized as either mild (55% for 60 mcg, 50% for 30 mcg and 7.1% for placebo) or moderate (5% for 60 mcg and 0% for both 30 mcg and placebo), followed by hypotension (10%, 0%, 0%), orthostatic hypotension (5%, 6.3%, 0%) and dizziness (5%, 6.3% and 0%). There were no reported cases of syncope or falls in any of the patients studied. For the same dose, higher exposure levels of BXCL501 were observed in this elderly patient population compared to earlier trials in younger patient populations.
The trial met its secondary efficacy endpoints with the 60 mcg dose compared to placebo in all three agitation scales: the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale-Excitatory Component Score (“PEC” or “PANSS-EC”) the Pittsburgh 

14



Agitation Scale (“PAS”), and the Modified Cohen -Mansfield Inventory (“Mod-CMAI”). Treatment with BXCL501 demonstrated statistically significant and clinically meaningful reductions in total scores at two hours post-dosing (PEC p=0.0011; PAS p<0.0001; Mod-CMAI p<0.001; PEC response rate = 70%), numerical separation from placebo in PEC total score as early as 30 minutes with statistically significant reductions on both PEC and PAS at 60 minutes lasting 8 hours after treatment. 
Additional statistically significant reductions with the 60 mcg dose compared to placebo at the 2 hours post-dosing were observed with the Agitation and Calmness Scale (“ACES”) (ACES p=0.0006) and Clinical Global Impression-Improvement Scale (CGI p<0.0001, 90% responder rate).
The 30 mcg dose cohort showed numerical improvements across all scales.
On March 3, 2021, we announced that following a routine quality control review of the Company’s TRANQUILITY study data, the Company discovered that two patients dose assignments were mis-categorized within the 30 mcg cohort at the clinical site. After moving the two patients data into their appropriate placebo and 30 mcg treatment groups, the data from the 30 mcg cohort were re-analyzed, resulting in the 30 mcg dose crossing over to statistical significance at the two hour time point, as measured by PEC: p=0.0149; PAS: p=0.0195; and Mod-CMAI: p=0.0364.
The Company also announced that it extended the TRANQUILITY I trial to initiate a 46 patient (1:1 randomization) multicenter, double-blind placebo-controlled expansion study investigating a 40 mcg dose cohort of BXCL501. Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics modeling of BXCL501 data from the TRANQUILITY trial was supportive of evaluating the efficacy of a 40 mcg dose. Results of this expansion are expected to provide additional insights to support the Company’s clinical development strategy directed at all segments of the dementia market. 
On March 15, 2021 we announced that BXCL501 was granted Breakthrough Therapy designation from the FDA for the acute treatment of agitation associated with dementia. This designation is intended to expedite the development and review of certain product candidates designed to treat serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions, and the designation enables increased interaction and guidance from the FDA.
On December 15, 2021, after our initial Breakthrough Therapy designation meetings with FDA, we announced the initiation of our program to evaluate BXCL501 for the treatment of acute agitation associated with dementia in Alzheimer’s patients. The program’s two studies, TRANQUILITY II and TRANQUILITY III, are designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of BXCL501 in adults 65 years and older across the range of illness including mild, moderate and severe illness in assisted living or residential facilities and nursing homes.

• | The program will consist of two randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled, adaptive, parallel group pivotal trials, TRANQUILITY II and TRANQUILITY III.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Each study will enroll 150 dementia patients 65 years and older. Patients will self-administer 40 mcg or 60 mcg of BXCL501 or placebo whenever agitation episodes may occur over a three-month period.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | TRANQUILITY II will enroll patients with mild to moderately severe dementia in assisted living or residential facilities who generally require minimal assistance with activities of daily living. TRANQUILITY III will enroll patients in nursing homes with moderate to severe dementia who require moderate or greater assistance with their activities of daily living.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The studies are designed to assess agitation as measured by the changes from baseline in the PEC and PAS total scores. The primary efficacy endpoint for both studies will be the change in PEC total score from baseline measured at two hours after the initial dose and subsequent doses.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Patients who complete TRANQUILITY II or TRANQUILITY III will be eligible to enroll in an open label, 52-week safety study designed to describe the safety and efficacy of BXCL501 in continued use.

RELEASE
The RELEASE trial was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, ascending dose Phase 1b/2 trial designed to evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics, tolerability, and efficacy of BXCL501 administered twice daily for 7 days in patients experiencing symptoms of opioid withdrawal. 
In March 2021, we announced RELEASE top line results. The trial’s primary objective was to evaluate safety and tolerability of twice daily dosing of BXCL501 for 1 week. BXCL501 was well tolerated, with no severe or serious adverse events reported across all doses evaluated. 
With respect to retention, a secondary endpoint, the study showed that patients in multiple dose cohorts treated with BXCL501 had numerical improvements in retention rates, a key goal of opioid withdrawal treatment, compared to placebo. The 120 mcg and 180 mcg dose groups showed 42% and 52% rates of retention at day 6 of BXCL501 treatment, respectively, versus 24% for placebo, though these differences were not statistically significant. However, the results also showed that, of the 87% of patients who had fentanyl in their systems upon entry, with greater than 50% remaining fentanyl positive following the morphine stabilization phase of 5 days. Consequently, withdrawal symptoms were not equivalent across various dose cohorts, suggesting that morphine did not stabilize or ‘normalize’ withdrawal symptoms in these patients. Efficacy measures, including assessment of patients’ symptoms of acute opioid withdrawal following the morphine maintenance phase with the Clinical Opiate Withdrawal Scale (“COWS”) and the Short Opiate Withdrawal Scale of Gossop (“SOWS-Gossop”) were secondary objectives of the trial. Improvements were not observed in SOWS-Gossop”) or COWS total scores in the BXCL501 treatment arms compared to placebo. The Company believes that the high prevalence of fentanyl, and its extended washout may have contributed to the lack of normalization of withdrawal during morphine maintenance could have confounded results and made them difficult to interpret. 

We believe the favorable tolerability results observed in multiple dose regimens within the RELEASE trial provides valuable insights that support investigation across additional indications and treatment settings. 
PLACIDITY
In October 2020, we announced that we had received authorization to proceed under our Investigational New Drug (“IND”) application from the FDA for treatment of patients with agitation associated with delirium in intensive care units, including patients with COVID-19 and on February 25, 2021, we announced the initiation of the Phase 2 PLACIDITY trial of BXCL501. This program is intended to provide a potential synergy with the medical and commercial infrastructure being developed to support our first two indications.
The PLACIDITY trial is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, ascending dose-finding, adaptive Phase 2 study designed to evaluate the safety, efficacy, and pharmacokinetics of BXCL501 in intensive care unit adult patients experiencing delirium related agitation, including COVID-19 patients. Approximately 20 patients will be randomized into each sequential ascending dose cohort of BXCL501 (starting doses of 120 ug, 180 ug, 240 ug, or 300 ug), or matching placebos to determine an optimal starting dose that could effectively and safely reduce agitation. Elderly delirium patients (65 years or older) in these cohorts will receive half the dose. The primary endpoint is the reduction in agitation measured by at least a 2-point drop in the Richmond Agitation Sedation Scale (“RASS”) at two hours post BXCL501 administration. The secondary endpoint is the earliest time at which a 2-point drop is seen in RASS after BXCL501 administration. An exploratory endpoint of this trial will be to determine the overall clinical improvement after drug administration using the Clinical Global Impression – Improvement Scale (“CGI-I”). 
Agitation associated with delirium is a serious condition that affects patients in many hospital settings: ICUs, surgical & medical wards, and emergency departments. Currently, there are no FDA-approved medications for delirium or agitation associated with delirium.
PLACIDITY enrollment was voluntarily paused, and continues to be paused, to assess challenges posed in opening relevant clinical sites and enrolling delirium patients in the ICU settings, including as a result of the burden COVID-19 has placed on the ICU.

The Company and its collaborators, the VA Connecticut Healthcare System and the Yale University Medical School, are evaluating BXCL501 in patients suffering from PTSD related to alcohol and substance abuse disorder (“ASUD”). Yale University Medical School was awarded a grant by the U.S. Department of Defense’s (“DOD”) Congressionally Directed Medical Research Programs (“CDMRP”). The Company is investigating BXCL501 as a potential chronic treatment for patients with these conditions.
Given the significant market opportunities available to us developing BXCL501 for the treatment of agitation in patients with Alzheimer’s disease and MDD, we have determined it is the best interest of all stakeholders to focus our efforts in those disease areas and have decided to de-emphasize our opioid withdrawal and delirium indications. 
PEDIATRIC STUDY
​
In June 2021, we initiated a global clinical trial designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of BXCL501 in agitation associated with pediatric schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. The multisite, double-blind, placebo controlled, parallel group trial will enroll patients with schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, bipolar I and bipolar II disorder. Similar to the SERENITY I and II trials, the primary endpoint is the change from baseline PEC total score at 2 hours. The trial has been initiated in the U.S. and enrollment is ongoing.
​
Major Depressive Disorder 
​
We have recently expanded our programs to evaluate BXCL501 as an adjunctive treatment for MDD. We expect that the initial clinical study in this program will be a double-blind, placebo-controlled, multiple ascending dose trial to evaluate the safety and tolerability of twice daily doses of BXCL501 in healthy volunteers. A Phase 2 proof of concept study is planned to evaluate whether daily adjunctive use of BXCL501 provides a more rapid initial clinical antidepressant response than placebo when initiating SSRI or SNRI alone. We are preparing to submit an IND to the FDA and if allowed to proceed by the FDA, expect to initiate the first clinical trial in the first half of 2022. 
​
BXCL701, DPP 8/9 Inhibitor for the treatment of Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer 
​
BXCL701 is a potential first-in-class, oral, small-molecule immunomodulator designed to stimulate both the innate and acquired immune systems by inhibiting DPP 8/9. DPP 8/9 behave as "checkpoints" of pyroptosis and inflammasome activation. We believe that BXCL701, if successfully developed and approved, may establish a differentiated immuno-oncology platform by modulating multiple steps in the cancer immunity cycle and, when combined with checkpoint inhibitors and/or immune activating agents, may be able to convert immuno-resistant (“cold”) tumors to immuno-sensitive (“hot”) tumors. 
​
Clinically, BXCL701 has been evaluated in more than 700 healthy subjects and cancer patients across multiple clinical trials, which provided evidence regarding tolerability, proof of mechanism, and single agent anti-tumor activity. In the latter case, single agent activity was seen in melanoma patients, an immune sensitive tumor. While providing evidence regarding the safety profile of the drug, these clinical studies also identified a maximum tolerated and recommended Phase 2 dose to use in future clinical trials. 
​
BXCL701 is in development for the treatment of CRPC including the highly aggressive neuro endocrine variant of NEPC, a segment of prostate cancer patients that have progressed on second generation androgen inhibitors (Zytiga® and Xtandi®) . Approximately one in four patients treated with Zytiga and Xtandi are expected to develop NEPC based on current clinical literature. The combined global sales of Zytiga and Xtandi, which are only approved for prostate cancer treatment, were approximately $7 billion in 2020, and we believe such sales number gives a perspective of the potential market for BXCL701 in this indication. Additionally, generic alternatives for Zytiga became available in the U.S. market in 2019, and we, therefore, expect the number of patients with access to androgen inhibitor therapy to increase.

Prostate Cancer Overview and Market Opportunity
​
Prostate cancer is the most common malignancy and is the second leading cause of cancer death in men in the United States. In 2022, more than 3.1 million men in the United States are living with, or in remission from, prostate cancer. The American Cancer Society’s estimates for prostate cancer in the United States for 2022 are about 268,490 new cases of prostate cancer and about 34,500 deaths from prostate cancer. While the five year survival rate of local and regional prostate cancer is almost 100%, more aggressive forms of the disease such as metastatic prostate cancer have a five-year survival rate of approximately 30%. These aggressive forms of prostate cancer can initially be treated with androgen deprivation therapy. However, almost all patients experience a recurrence in tumor growth, which results in the patient having CRPC. An estimated 180,000 men in the United States are eligible for treatment with the second generation anti-androgen drugs Zytiga and Xtandi. These drugs have widely become the standard of care. 
​
Unfortunately, virtually all the patients who respond to Zytiga and Xtandi are expected to progress to even more aggressive forms of prostate cancer requiring further treatment. About one in five of the progressing patients will develop NEPC, for which there is no effective treatment based on information in an article published in the Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network in 2014 by Agarwal et. al. and an article published by Journal of Clinical Oncology in 2014 by Wang et. al. NEPC specifically displays neuroendocrine differentiation, either pathologically with the presence of the typical neuroendocrine small cells, or molecularly by expressing neuroendocrine markers.

Limitations of Current Treatments for CRPC
​
Despite demonstrated benefit of immunotherapies targeting PD-1—such as pembrolizumab—on clinical outcomes in many solid tumors, mCRPC remains largely resistant to such therapies with single-agent response rates of under 6%. Further exploration has been focused on combination therapies.
There is no approved therapy for NEPC. NEPC patients are treated off-label with cytotoxic chemotherapies, such as platinum-based regimens. These treatments have poor efficacy due to their short duration of response and substantial toxicity. While the immuno-oncology field has made several advances in the treatment of solid tumors, several trials of immuno-oncology agents in patients with prostate cancer, and specifically NEPC, have shown limited or no anti-tumor activity. 


BXCL701’s potential immunomodulatory mechanism of action may manipulate the tumor micro-environment in such a way to convert a “cold” tumor environment into an inflamed “hot” environment so that prostate cancer can overcome resistance to immunotherapy.

BXCL701 Immuno-Oncology Program
​
BXCL701 Clinical Trials
BXCL701 is currently being evaluated in two combination therapy clinical trials:
​
In April 2020, we announced the initiation of the Phase 2 efficacy portion of the Phase 1b/2 trial evaluating BXCL701 in combination with KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab, a PD-1 inhibitor) for NEPC. The Phase 1b safety assessment of BXCL701 identified a split dose totaling 0.6 mg per day as the recommended dose when used in combination with KEYTRUDA®. In addition to the efficacy cohort in NEPC patients, in August 2020, we opened a separate cohort for CRPC patients who have failed taxane-based chemotherapy and up to two lines of second-generation androgen pathway blockers. Data from the Phase 1b portion of this trial were presented at the Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer’s, or SITC’s, 35th Anniversary Annual Meeting in 2020, and an interim efficacy update was presented at ASCO GU Symposium in February 2021. We reported updated interim data from the Phase 2 portion of this trial in NEPC and adenocarcinoma cohort at the ASCO GU Symposium in February 2022. Data from the Phase 2 portion of the trial were previously presented at the European Society for Medical Oncology conference in September 2021 and at ASCO GU in February 2021.
 ​
The MD Anderson-led Phase 2 open-label basket trial is designed to evaluate the response rate of orally administered BXCL701, combined with KEYTRUDA, in two arms: Arm A is enrolling checkpoint naïve patients (where checkpoint therapy is indicated: “hot tumors”); and Arm B is enrolling patients who have progressed following checkpoint therapy alone. Interim data were presented at the June 2021 American Society of Clinical Oncology annual meeting. In the first half of 2022, we expect to present additional interim efficacy data from the trial.
​
Other Immuno-oncology Indications
​
In addition to CRPC and CPI-refractory tumors, we plan to leverage our existing preclinical and clinical data to identify other cancer types with high unmet medical need that we believe would benefit from BXCL701’s novel potential mechanism of action. We are prioritizing indications where the immuno suppressive microenvironment is driven by the potential molecular and cellular targets of BXCL701 and where the single agent activity of approved immune checkpoint inhibitors is limited. 
We believe that BXCL701, if successfully developed and approved, may provide a platform for combination with immunotherapy modalities that go beyond the currently approved immune checkpoint agents that target the PD 1/PD L1 axis. Following our proof-of-concept trials, we plan to conduct clinical trials covering a broad range of additional combinations with other immunotherapy agents, including:

● | immune checkpoint inhibitors (other than PD-1/PD-L1);
--+------------------------------------------------------

19




● | cellular therapies (CAR-T and chimeric antigen receptor natural killer cells);
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | therapeutic vaccines; and
--+--------------------------


● | ADCC driven monoclonal antibodies.
--+-----------------------------------

Other Product Candidates
Neuroscience Program 
We are targeting neuroscience disorders where there is a high unmet medical need, and therefore, a requirement for symptom management is a priority (such as agitation and symptoms resulting from stress-related behaviors) as well for transformative care for monogenic rare CNS disorders.
For symptomatic approaches, our neuroscience program is developing product candidates with a focus on treating symptoms for various neurological and psychiatric disorders. This entails re innovating existing agents through formulation changes and deuteration. The utilization of our expanding internal AI capabilities along with BioXcel LLC’s AI capability has identified several monogenic diseases with available animal models across rare neuroscience diseases. We utilize proprietary algorithms to identify associated mechanisms with existing pharmacology to test whether these agents can improve the disease profile in the animal model either through disease modification or symptomatic manner. The agents identified must be those that we believe are Phase 2 ready with a potential for a short, cost-effective development plan (four to five years to potential NDA submission).
Immuno-oncology Program
Our immuno-oncology program is based on utilizing a comprehensive map of all known relationships that link immuno-evasion and immuno-activation pathways and targets with thousands of pharmacological agents and tumor indications. This comprehensive map has permitted us to select a potential pipeline of candidates based on our ability to alter the tumor micro-environment and the potential to address relevant unmet medical needs for various tumor types.
Competition 
The pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition, and a strong emphasis on proprietary products. The immuno-oncology, neuroscience, and rare disease segments of the industry in particular are highly competitive. While we believe that our technology, development experience and scientific knowledge provide competitive advantages, we face potential competition from many different sources, including major pharmaceutical, specialty pharmaceutical, and biotechnology companies, academic institutions and governmental agencies, and public and private research institutions.
Many of our competitors may have significantly greater financial resources, and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical studies, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals, and marketing approved medicines than we do. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical, biotechnology, and diagnostic industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel and in establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to or necessary for our programs. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies.
The key competitive factors affecting the success of all of our product candidates, if approved, are likely to be their efficacy, safety, convenience, price, the effectiveness of companion diagnostics in guiding the use of related therapeutics, if any, the level of generic competition and the availability of reimbursement from government and other third-party payors.

20



Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize medicines that are safer, are more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient or are less expensive than any medicines we may develop. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their medicines more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market. In addition, our ability to compete may be affected in many cases by insurers or other third-party payors seeking to encourage the use of generic medicines. There are many generic medicines currently on the market for certain indications that we are pursuing, and additional generics are expected to become available over the coming years. If our therapeutic product candidates are approved, we expect that they will be priced at a significant premium over competitive generic medicines.
Any product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with existing therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future. If the product candidates of our priority programs are approved for the indications for which we are currently planning clinical trials, they will compete with the drugs discussed below and will likely compete with other drugs currently in development.
Neurological and Psychiatric Disorders
Drugs used for the acute treatment of agitation related to schizophrenia and bipolar disorder are antipsychotics frequently administered via IM injection which typically requires patient restraint. These include IM aripiprazole, olanzapine, ziprasidone and haloperidol. Oral products include the sublingually administered atypical antipsychotic asenapine as well as the benzodiazepines, lorazepam and midazolam. The typical antipsychotic Adasuve (loxapine) from Alexza is delivered via inhalation. 
Immuno-oncology 
The immuno-oncology field is characterized by the rapid evolution of technologies and products and by fierce competition based on the development of compounds, often with similar mechanisms of action. Clinical development plans are further compounded by the possibility of overlapping intellectual property. A wide variety of commercial players, large pharmaceutical companies, established and emerging biotechnology companies, and several not-for-profit entities are actively developing potentially competitive products in immuno-oncology and in our lead indications.
While we believe our product candidates, technology, knowledge, and experience provide us with competitive advantages, we face competition from established and emerging pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. Such companies include:

● | Major pharmaceutical companies developing multiple immuno-oncology agents: AstraZeneca PLC, Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, Celgene Corporation, Merck & Co., Inc., Novartis AG, Pfizer Inc., Roche Holding Ltd., and Sanofi SA. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Companies developing agents aimed at stimulating the immune response: AdaptImmune LLC, Idera Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Immune Design Corp., NewLink Genetic Corporation, Advaxis, Inc., Argos Therapeutics, Inc., Biovest International, Inc., ImmunoCellular Therapeutics, Ltd., Immune Design, Inc., Inovio Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Intrexon Corporation and Northwest Biotherapeutics, Inc. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Companies developing cell-based immunotherapy approaches: Intrexon Corporation, Juno Therapeutics, Inc., Kite Pharma, Inc. (acquired by Gilead Sciences, Inc.), Novartis AG and Pfizer Inc. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Manufacturing
We do not have manufacturing facilities. We currently rely on strategic manufacturing partners and expect to continue to rely on third parties for the manufacture of our product candidates for clinical research as well as for eventual, possible commercial manufacturing.

21



For the supply of drug substance and drug product for our BXCL501 clinical program, we have secured manufacturing partners. We have completed the manufacture of phase III clinical supply and registration batches of our proprietary, sublingual thin film product.
We produce clinical drug product for BXCL701 under exclusivity with the original manufacturers of the active pharmaceutical ingredient, or API, and drug product tablets, respectively. 
Manufacturing partners used for both programs currently manufacture commercial products, and we consider them to be suitable for commercial supply for our programs, if approved.
Commercialization
We plan to retain our worldwide commercialization rights for some of our key product candidates, while for other product candidates we could potentially consider collaboration opportunities to maximize returns.
As a Company we have no experience in commercializing products, however, we intend to build our own commercialization organization and capabilities over time. We are considering partnerships, joint ventures, and a variety of business partnerships for the Japanese and European Markets. We currently plan to retain U.S. rights and are working towards a potential BXCL501 approval on April 5, 2022. For example, in the second half of 2021 we fully launched our unbranded disease education campaign to promote awareness around the treatment of agitation in schizophrenia and bipolar disorders. In addition, we fully deployed our Medical Science Liaison and Medical Managed Care teams who actively engaged with healthcare professionals and payors to provide key insights to support our commercial strategy. If BXCL501 is approved outside the United States we would consider launching BXCL501 through collaborations with third parties.
As product candidates advance through our pipeline, our commercial plans may change. Clinical data, the size of the development programs, the size of the target market, the size of a commercial infrastructure, and manufacturing needs may all influence our United States, European Union, and rest-of-world strategies.
Intellectual Property 
​
Our policy is to protect and enhance the proprietary technologies, inventions, and improvements that are commercially important to our business by filing patent applications in the United States and other jurisdictions related to our proprietary technology, inventions, improvements, and product candidates. We also rely on trademarks, trade secrets, and know-how relating to our proprietary technologies and product candidates, continuing innovation, and in-licensing technology and products. This reliance is expected to develop, strengthen, and maintain our proprietary position for novel therapeutics and novel formulations of existing therapeutics across multiple therapeutic areas. We also plan to rely on data exclusivity, market exclusivity, and patent term extensions when available.
Patent Portfolio
​
As of February 1, 2022, our patent portfolio included 6 Patent Cooperation Treaty, or PCT, applications, 16 U.S. utility applications, 1 issued U.S. utility patent, 9 U.S. provisional patent applications, 89 pending non-U.S. applications, 9 allowed or granted non-U.S. patents, 1 design patent application, which is a U.S. design application, and 34 allowed or registered design patents. U.S. Pat. No. 10,792,246, directed to our proprietary sublingual thin-film formulation of Dex, was issued on October 6, 2020 and has a term that is set to expire no earlier than 2039. We plan to list the U.S. patent in the FDA's Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations, or Orange Book. We have filed applications in the core patent family protecting BXCL501 in the United States, Taiwan, and other major markets. We expect that patents issuing from these applications, if any, will expire no earlier than 2039. We have also filed applications in additional patent families that are relevant to BXCL501. We have applications pending in the United States, Europe and Japan directed to methods of treating insomnia using sublingual Dex. We expect that patents issuing from these applications, if any, will expire no earlier than 2035. We also have applications filed in 15 countries, including the United States, Europe, Japan, and China, directed to methods of treating agitation. We expect that patents issuing from these applications, if any, will expire no earlier than 2037. We have one U.S. application and one European 

22



application directed to intravenous administration of Dex. We expect that patents issuing from these applications, if any, will expire no earlier than 2039. We continue to file new applications on an ongoing basis, including provisional applications directed to treating mania and dementia. If patents issue from those cases, we expect them to expire no earlier than 2041 and 2042, respectively. 
 ​
We have multiple patent families filed to protect our BXCL701 program, including our core patent family directed to methods of using BXCL701 with immune checkpoint inhibitors, which is filed in the United States and 14 other countries. Any patents issuing from that family should expire no earlier than 2036. We have a PCT application directed to combination therapies using BXCL701 with immune checkpoint inhibitors and approaches for modifying T-cell activity. We expect any patents issuing from this family to expire no earlier than 2038. Additional PCT and ex-US applications are directed to administering BXCL701 in combinations with various other molecules and dosing regimens. We expect that patents issuing from these applications, if any, will expire no earlier than 2039. Finally, we have multiple provisional applications directed to various dosing regimens and combination therapies. Any patents issuing from those applications are expected to expire between 2039 and 2041 at the earliest. 
​
The term of individual patents depends upon the legal term for patents in the countries in which they are obtained. In most countries, including the United States, the patent term is 20 years from the earliest filing date of a non-provisional patent application. Depending upon the timing, duration, and specifics of FDA approval of our product candidates, a United States patent we own or license may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Act. The Hatch-Waxman Act permits a patent restoration term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during product development and the drug approval regulatory review process. However, patent term restoration cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date. The patent term restoration period is generally one-half the time between the effective date of an IND, and the submission date of a NDA, plus the time between the submission date of an NDA and the approval of that application. Only one patent applicable to an approved drug is eligible for the extension, and the application for extension must be made prior to the expiration of the patent. The United States Patent and Trademark Office, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration. In the future, we intend to apply for restorations of patent term for some of our currently owned or licensed patents to add patent life beyond their current expiration date, depending on the expected length of clinical trials and other factors involved in the submission of the relevant NDA.
​
The patent positions of companies such as ours are generally uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions. No consistent policy regarding the scope of claims allowable in patents in the field of method of use patents or reformulation patents has emerged in the United States. The relevant patent laws and their interpretation outside of the United States are also uncertain. Changes in either the patent laws or their interpretation in the United States and other countries may diminish our ability to protect our technology or product candidates and enforce the patent rights that we license, and also could affect the value of such intellectual property. In particular, our ability to stop third parties from making, using, selling, offering to sell, or importing products that infringe our intellectual property will depend in part on our success in obtaining and enforcing patent claims that cover our technology, inventions, and improvements. With respect to both licensed and company owned intellectual property, we cannot guarantee that patents will be granted with respect to any of our pending patent applications or with respect to any patent applications we may file in the future, nor can we be sure that any patents that may be granted to us in the future will be commercially useful in protecting our products, the methods of use, or the manufacture of those products. Patent and other intellectual property rights in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology space are evolving and involve many risks and uncertainties. For example, third parties may have blocking patents that could be used to prevent us from commercializing our product candidates and practicing our proprietary technology, and the issued patents that we in-license and those that may issue in the future may be challenged, invalidated, or circumvented, which could limit our ability to stop competitors from marketing related products or could limit the term of patent protection that otherwise may exist for our product candidates. In addition, the scope of the rights granted under any issued patents may not provide us with protection or competitive advantages against competitors with similar technology. Furthermore, our competitors may independently develop similar technologies that are outside the scope of the rights granted under any issued patents that we own or exclusively in license. For these reasons, we may face competition with respect to our product candidates. Moreover, because of the extensive time required for development, testing, and regulatory review of a potential product, it is possible that, before any particular product candidate can be commercialized, any patent protection for such product may expire or remain in 

23



force for only a short period following commercialization, thereby reducing the commercial advantage the patent provides. 
Our Relationship with BioXcel LLC 
​
BioXcel LLC currently holds a 31% interest in the Company and our pipeline compounds have been identified by applying our growing internal AI capabilities along with utilizing BioXcel LLC’s expertise in EvolverAI, for drug re-innovation.

Government Regulation 
Government Regulation and Product Approval
​
Government authorities in the United States, at the federal, state and local level, and other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, labeling, packaging, storage, record-keeping, promotion, advertising, distribution, marketing and export and import of drug products. A new drug must be approved by the FDA through the NDA process before it may be legally marketed in the United States. We, along with any third-party contractors, will be required to navigate the various preclinical, clinical and commercial approval requirements of the governing regulatory agencies of the countries in which we wish to conduct studies or seek approval of our products and product candidates. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with applicable federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources.

​
U.S. Drug Development Process
​
In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (“FDCA”), and its implementing regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. The process required by the FDA before a drug may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:
​

● | completion of preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies in accordance with FDA’s Good Laboratory Practice requirements and other applicable regulations;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

● | submission to the FDA of an IND which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

● | approval by an independent Institutional Review Board (“IRB”), or ethics committee at each clinical site before each trial may be initiated; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

● | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with good clinical practices (“GCPs”), to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug for its intended use; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​
Prior to beginning the first clinical trial with a product candidate in the United States, a sponsor must submit an IND to the FDA. An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational new drug product to humans. The central focus of an IND submission is on the general investigational plan and the protocol(s) for clinical studies. The IND also includes results of animal and in vitro studies assessing the toxicology, pharmacokinetics, pharmacology, and pharmacodynamic characteristics of the product; chemistry, manufacturing, and controls information; and any available human data or literature to support the use of the investigational product. An IND must become effective before human clinical trials may begin. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30-day time period, raises safety concerns or questions about the proposed clinical trial. In such a case, the IND may be placed on clinical hold and the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns or questions before the clinical trial can begin. Submission of an IND therefore may or may not result in FDA authorization to begin a clinical trial.
​
Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational product to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with GCPs, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent for their participation in any clinical study. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the study, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. A separate submission to the existing IND must be made for each successive clinical trial conducted during product development and for any subsequent protocol amendments. Furthermore, an independent IRB for each site proposing to conduct the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial and its informed consent form before the clinical trial begins at that site and must monitor the study until completed. 

25



Some studies also include oversight by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical study sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board, which provides authorization for whether or not a study may move forward at designated check points based on access to certain data from the study and may halt the clinical trial if it determines that there is an unacceptable safety risk for subjects or other grounds, such as no demonstration of efficacy. Depending on its charter, this group may determine whether a trial may move forward at designated check points based on access to certain data from the trial. The FDA or the sponsor may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. There are also requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical studies and clinical study results to public registries.
​
Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined:
​

• | Phase 1: The product candidate is initially introduced into healthy human subjects or patients with the target disease or condition. These studies are designed to test the safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism and distribution of the investigational product in humans, the side effects associated with increasing doses, and, if possible, to gain early evidence on effectiveness.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

• | Phase 2: The product candidate is administered to a limited patient population with a specified disease or condition to evaluate the preliminary efficacy, optimal dosages and dosing schedule and to identify possible adverse side effects and safety risks. Multiple Phase 2 clinical trials may be conducted to obtain information prior to beginning larger and more expensive Phase 3 clinical trials.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

• | Phase 3: The product candidate is administered to an expanded patient population to further evaluate dosage, to provide statistically significant evidence of clinical efficacy and to further test for safety, generally at multiple geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. These clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit ratio of the investigational product and to provide an adequate basis for product approval.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​
In some cases, the FDA may require, or companies may voluntarily pursue, additional clinical trials after a product is approved to gain more information about the product. These so-called Phase 4 studies, may be conducted after initial marketing approval, and may be used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication. In certain instances, the FDA may mandate the performance of Phase 4 clinical trials as a condition of approval of an NDA.
​
Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug and finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, the manufacturer must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final drug. In addition, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested, and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
​
While the IND is active, progress reports summarizing the results of the clinical trials and nonclinical studies performed since the last progress report, among other information, must be submitted at least annually to the FDA, and written IND safety reports must be submitted to the FDA and investigators for serious and unexpected suspected adverse events, findings from other studies suggesting a significant risk to humans exposed to the same or similar drugs, findings from animal or in vitro testing suggesting a significant risk to humans, and any clinically important increased incidence of a serious suspected adverse reaction compared to that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure. 
​
In addition, during the development of a drug, sponsors are given opportunities to meet with the FDA at certain points. These points may be prior to submission of an IND, at the end of Phase 2, and before an NDA is submitted. Meetings at other times may be requested. These meetings can provide an opportunity for the sponsor to share 

26



information about the data gathered to date, for the FDA to provide advice, and for the sponsor and the FDA to reach agreement on the next phase of development. Sponsors typically use the meetings at the end of the Phase 2 trial to discuss Phase 2 clinical results and present plans for the pivotal Phase 3 clinical trials that they believe will support approval of the drug.
​
U.S. Review and Approval Process
Assuming successful completion of all required testing in accordance with all applicable regulatory requirements, the results of product development, preclinical and other non-clinical studies and clinical trials, along with descriptions of the manufacturing process, analytical tests conducted on the chemistry of the drug, proposed labeling and other relevant information are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA requesting approval to market the product. Data can come from company-sponsored clinical studies intended to test the safety and effectiveness of a use of the product, or from a number of alternative sources, including studies initiated by independent investigators. The submission of an NDA is subject to the payment of substantial user fees; a waiver of such fees may be obtained under certain limited circumstances. Additionally, no user fees are assessed on NDAs for products designated as orphan drugs, unless the product also includes a non-orphan indication.
​
The FDA conducts a preliminary review of all NDAs within the first 60 days after submission, before accepting them for filing, to determine whether they are sufficiently complete to permit substantive review The FDA may request additional information rather than accept an NDA for filing. In this event, the NDA must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application also is subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once filed, the FDA reviews an NDA to determine, among other things, whether a product is safe and effective for its intended use and whether its manufacturing is cGMP-compliant to assure and preserve the product’s identity, strength, quality and purity. Under the PDUFA, guidelines that are currently in effect, the FDA has a goal of ten months from the filing date to complete a standard review of an NDA for a drug that is a new molecular entity, and of ten months from the date of NDA receipt to complete a standard review of an NDA for a drug that is not a new molecular entity. 
​
The FDA may refer an application for a novel drug to an advisory committee. An advisory committee is a panel of independent experts, including clinicians and other scientific experts, that reviews, evaluates and provides a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions.
​
Before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving a NDA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCPs. 
​
After the FDA evaluates an NDA and conducts inspections of manufacturing facilities where the investigational product and/or its drug substance will be produced, the FDA may issue an approval letter or a Complete Response Letter (“CRL”). An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the product with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A CRL will describe all of the deficiencies that the FDA has identified in the NDA, except that where the FDA determines that the data supporting the application are inadequate to support approval, the FDA may issue the CRL without first conducting required inspections and/or reviewing proposed labeling. In issuing the CRL, the FDA may recommend actions that the applicant might take to place the NDA in condition for approval, including requests for additional information or clarification. The FDA may delay or refuse approval of an NDA if applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied, require additional testing or information and/or require post-marketing testing and surveillance to monitor safety or efficacy of a product.
​
If regulatory approval of a product is granted, such approval will be granted for particular indications and may entail limitations on the indicated uses for which such product may be marketed. For example, the FDA may approve the NDA with a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (“REMS”) to ensure the benefits of the product outweigh its risks. A REMS is a safety strategy to manage a known or potential serious risk associated with a medicine and to enable patients 

27



to have continued access to such medicines by managing their safe use, and could include medication guides, physician communication plans, or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries, and other risk minimization tools. The FDA also may condition approval on, among other things, changes to proposed labeling or the development of adequate controls and specifications. The FDA may also require one or more Phase 4 post- market studies and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product’s safety and effectiveness after commercialization and may limit further marketing of the product based on the results of these post-marketing studies. 
​
In addition, the Pediatric Research Equity Act (“PREA”), requires a sponsor to conduct pediatric clinical trials for most drugs, for a new active ingredient, new indication, new dosage form, new dosing regimen or new route of administration. Under PREA, original NDAs and supplements must contain a pediatric assessment unless the sponsor has received a deferral or waiver. The required assessment must evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The sponsor or FDA may request a deferral of pediatric clinical trials for some or all of the pediatric subpopulations. A deferral may be granted for several reasons, including a finding that the drug is ready for approval for use in adults before pediatric clinical trials are complete or that additional safety or effectiveness data needs to be collected before the pediatric clinical trials begin. The FDA must send a non-compliance letter to any sponsor that fails to submit the required assessment, keep a deferral current or fails to submit a request for approval of a pediatric formulation.
​
Regulation of Combination Products in the United States
​
Certain products are comprised of components, such as drug components and device components, that would normally be subject to different regulatory frameworks by the FDA and frequently regulated by different centers at the FDA. These products are known as combination products. Under the FDCA, the FDA is charged with assigning a center with primary jurisdiction, or a lead center, for review of a combination product. The determination of which center will be the lead center is based on the “primary mode of action” of the combination product. Thus, if the primary mode of action of a drug-device combination product is attributable to the drug product, the FDA center responsible for premarket review of the drug product would have primary jurisdiction for the combination product. The FDA has also established the Office of Combination Products to address issues surrounding combination products and provide more certainty to the regulatory review process. That office serves as a focal point for combination product issues for agency reviewers and industry. It is also responsible for developing guidance and regulations to clarify the regulation of combination products, and for assignment of the FDA center that has primary jurisdiction for review of combination products where the jurisdiction is unclear or in dispute.
​
A combination product with a primary mode of action attributable to the drug component generally would be reviewed and approved pursuant to the drug approval processes set forth in the FDCA. In reviewing the NDA for such a product, however, FDA reviewers would consult with their counterparts in the device center to ensure that the device component of the combination product met applicable requirements regarding safety, effectiveness, durability and performance. In addition, under FDA regulations, combination products subject to cGMP requirements applicable to both drugs and devices, including the Quality System Regulations (“QSR”) applicable to medical devices.
​
Expedited Development and Review Programs
​
The FDA offers a number of expedited development and review programs for qualifying product candidates. For example, the Fast Track program is intended to expedite or facilitate the process for reviewing product candidates that are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the disease or condition. Fast Track designation applies to the combination of the product candidate and the specific indication for which it is being studied. The sponsor of a Fast Track product candidate has opportunities for more frequent interactions with the applicable FDA review team during product development and, once an NDA is submitted, the NDA may be eligible for priority review. An NDA for a Fast Track product candidate may also be eligible for rolling review, where the FDA may consider for review sections of the NDA on a rolling basis before the complete application is submitted, if the sponsor provides a schedule for the submission of the sections of the NDA, the FDA agrees to accept sections of the NDA and determines that the schedule is acceptable, and the sponsor pays any required user fees upon submission of the first section of the NDA. 

28



​
A product candidate intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition may also be eligible for Breakthrough Therapy designation to expedite its development and review. A product candidate can receive Breakthrough Therapy designation if preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product candidate, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs or biologics, may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. The designation includes all of the Fast Track program features, as well as more intensive FDA interaction and guidance beginning as early as Phase 1 and an organizational commitment to expedite the development and review of the product candidate, including involvement of senior managers.
​
Any marketing application for a drug submitted to the FDA for approval, including a product candidate with a Fast Track designation and/or Breakthrough Therapy designation, may be eligible for other types of FDA programs intended to expedite the FDA review and approval process, such as priority review and accelerated approval. An NDA is eligible for priority review if the product candidate is designed to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and if approved, would provide a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness compared to available alternatives for such disease or condition. For new-molecular-entity NDAs, priority review designation means the FDA’s goal is to take action on the marketing application within six months of the 60-day filing date, or with respect to non-new-molecular-entity NDAs, within six months of the NDA receipt date.
​
Additionally, product candidates studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions may receive accelerated approval upon a determination that the product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. As a condition of accelerated approval, the FDA will generally require the sponsor to perform adequate and well-controlled post-marketing clinical studies to verify and describe the anticipated effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit. Products receiving accelerated approval may be subject to expedited withdrawal procedures if the sponsor fails to conduct the required post-marketing studies or if such studies fail to verify the predicted clinical benefit. In addition, the FDA currently requires as a condition for accelerated approval pre-approval of promotional materials, which could adversely impact the timing of the commercial launch of the product. 
​
Fast Track designation, Breakthrough Therapy designation, priority review, and accelerated approval do not change the standards for approval, but may expedite the development or approval process. Even if a product candidate qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the product no longer meets the conditions for qualification or decide that the time period for FDA review or approval will not be shortened.
​
Orphan drug designation and exclusivity
​
Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a drug intended to treat a rare disease or condition, defined as a disease or condition with a patient population of fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or a patient population greater than 200,000 individuals in the United States and when there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making available the drug in the United States will be recovered from sales in the United States for that drug. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an NDA. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the generic identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA.
​
If a product that has orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for a particular active ingredient for the disease for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan product exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications, including a full NDA, to market the same drug for the same disease or condition for seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan drug exclusivity or if the FDA finds that the holder of the orphan drug exclusivity has not shown that it can assure the availability of sufficient quantities of the orphan drug to meet the needs of patients with the disease or condition for which the drug was designated. Orphan drug exclusivity does not prevent the FDA from approving a 

29



different drug for the same disease or condition, or the same drug for a different disease or condition. Among the other benefits of orphan drug designation are tax credits for certain research and a waiver of the NDA application user fee.
​
A designated orphan drug may not receive orphan drug exclusivity if it is approved for a use that is broader than the indication for which it received orphan designation. In addition, orphan drug exclusive marketing rights in the United States may be lost if the FDA later determines that the request for designation was materially defective or, as noted above, if a second applicant demonstrates that its product is clinically superior to the approved product with orphan exclusivity or the manufacturer of the approved product is unable to assure sufficient quantities of the product to meet the needs of patients with the rare disease or condition.
​
Post-approval Requirements
​
Drug products manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to record-keeping, reporting of adverse experiences, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, and advertising and promotion of the product. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims, are subject to prior FDA review and approval. There also are continuing, annual program fees for any marketed products. Drug manufacturers and their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP, which impose certain procedural and documentation requirements upon us and our third-party manufacturers. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated, and, depending on the significance of the change, may require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting requirements. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMP and other aspects of regulatory compliance.
​
The FDA may withdraw approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical studies to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution restrictions or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things:
​

• | restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

• | fines, warning letters, or untitled letters;
--+---------------------------------------------

​

• | clinical holds on clinical studies;
--+------------------------------------

​

• | refusal of the FDA to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications, or suspension or revocation of product approvals; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

• | product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

• | consent decrees, corporate integrity agreements, debarment or exclusion from federal healthcare programs; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

• | mandated modification of promotional materials and labeling and the issuance of corrective information; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

• | the issuance of safety alerts, Dear Healthcare Provider letters, press releases and other communications containing warnings or other safety information about the product; or
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

30




• | injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------

​
The FDA closely regulates the marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of drug products. A company can make only those claims relating to safety and efficacy, purity and potency that are approved by the FDA and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses. Failure to comply with these requirements can result in, among other things, adverse publicity, warning letters, corrective advertising and potential civil and criminal penalties. Physicians may prescribe, in their independent professional medical judgment, legally available products for uses that are not described in the product’s labeling and that differ from those tested by us and approved by the FDA. Physicians may believe that such off-label uses are the best treatment for many patients in varied circumstances. The FDA does not regulate the behavior of physicians in their choice of treatments. The FDA does, however, restrict manufacturer’s communications on the subject of off-label use of their products. However, companies may share truthful and not misleading information that is otherwise consistent with a product’s FDA-approved labelling.
​
Hatch-Waxman Act
​
Section 505 of the FDCA describes three types of marketing applications that may be submitted to the FDA to request marketing authorization for a new drug. A Section 505(b)(1) NDA is an application that contains full reports of investigations of safety and efficacy. A 505(b)(2) NDA is an application that contains full reports of investigations of safety and efficacy but where at least some of the information required for approval comes from investigations that were not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference or use from the person by or for whom the investigations were conducted. This regulatory pathway enables the applicant to rely, in part, on the FDA's prior findings of safety and efficacy for an existing product, or published literature, in support of its application. Section 505(j) establishes an abbreviated approval process for a generic version of approved drug products through the submission of an Abbreviated New Drug Application (“ANDA”). An ANDA provides for marketing of a generic drug product that has the same active ingredients, dosage form, strength, route of administration, labeling, performance characteristics and intended use, among other things, to a previously approved product. ANDAs are termed "abbreviated" because they are generally not required to include preclinical (animal) and clinical (human) data to establish safety and efficacy. Instead, generic applicants must scientifically demonstrate that their product is bioequivalent to, or performs in the same manner as, the innovator drug through in vitro, in vivo, or other testing. The generic version must deliver the same amount of active ingredients into a subject's bloodstream in the same amount of time as the innovator drug and can often be substituted by pharmacists under prescriptions written for the reference listed drug. In seeking approval for a drug through an NDA, applicants are required to list with the FDA each patent with claims that cover the applicant's drug or a method of using the drug. Upon approval of a drug, each of the patents listed in the application for the drug is then published in the FDA's Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations, commonly known as the Orange Book. Drugs listed in the Orange Book can, in turn, be cited by potential competitors in support of approval of an ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA.

​
Upon submission of an ANDA or a 505(b)(2) NDA, an applicant must certify to the FDA that (1) no patent information on the drug product that is the subject of the application has been submitted to the FDA; (2) such patent has expired; (3) the date on which such patent expires; or (4) such patent is invalid or will not be infringed upon by the manufacture, use or sale of the drug product for which the application is submitted. Generally, the ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA cannot be approved until all listed patents have expired, except where the ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA applicant challenges a listed patent through the last type of certification, also known as a paragraph IV certification. If the applicant does not challenge the listed patents or indicates that it is not seeking approval of a patented method of use, the ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA application will not be approved until all of the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired. If the ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA applicant has provided a Paragraph IV certification to the FDA, the applicant must send notice of the Paragraph IV certification to the NDA and patent holders once the application has been accepted for filing by the FDA. The NDA and patent holders may then initiate a patent infringement lawsuit in response to the notice of the paragraph IV certification. If the paragraph IV certification is challenged by an NDA holder or the patent owner(s) asserts a patent challenge to the paragraph IV certification, the FDA may not approve that application until the earlier of 30 months from the receipt of the notice of the paragraph IV certification, the expiration of the patent, when the infringement case concerning each such patent was favorably decided in the applicant's favor or settled, or such shorter or longer period as may be ordered by a court. This prohibition is generally referred to as the 30-month stay. In 

31



instances where an ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA applicant files a paragraph IV certification, the NDA holder or patent owner(s) regularly take action to trigger the 30-month stay, recognizing that the related patent litigation may take many months or years to resolve. Thus, approval of an ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA could be delayed for a significant period of time depending on the patent certification the applicant makes and the reference drug sponsor's decision to initiate patent litigation.
​
The Hatch-Waxman Act establishes periods of regulatory exclusivity for certain approved drug products, during which the FDA cannot approve (or in some cases accept) an ANDA or 505(b)(2) application that relies on the branded reference drug. For example, the holder of an NDA, including a 505(b)(2) NDA, may obtain five years of non-patent data exclusivity upon approval of a new drug containing new chemical entities that have not been previously approved by the FDA. A drug is a new chemical entity if the FDA has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the therapeutic activity of the drug substance. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not accept for review an ANDA or a 505(b)(2) NDA submitted by another company that contains the previously approved active moiety. However, an ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement. The Hatch-Waxman Act also provides three years of marketing exclusivity to the holder of an NDA (including a 505(b)(2) NDA) for a particular condition of approval, or change to a marketed product, such as a new formulation for a previously approved product, if one or more new clinical studies (other than bioavailability or bioequivalence studies) was essential to the approval of the application and was conducted/sponsored by the applicant. This three-year exclusivity period protects against FDA approval of ANDAs and 505(b)(2) NDAs for the condition of the new drug's approval. As a general matter, the three year exclusivity does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs or 505(b)(2) NDAs for generic versions of the original, unmodified drug product. Five-year and three-year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a full NDA; however, an applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to all of the preclinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and efficacy.
​
FDA Approval and Regulation of Medical Devices and Companion Diagnostics
​
If safe and effective use of a therapeutic depends on an in vitro diagnostic, then the FDA generally will require approval or clearance of that diagnostic, known as a companion diagnostic, at the same time that the FDA approves the therapeutic product. In August 2014, the FDA issued final guidance clarifying the requirements that will apply to approval of therapeutic products and in vitro companion diagnostics. According to the guidance, if FDA determines that a companion diagnostic device is essential to the safe and effective use of a novel therapeutic product or indication, FDA generally will not approve the therapeutic product or new therapeutic product indication if the companion diagnostic device is not approved or cleared for that indication. Approval or clearance of the companion diagnostic device will ensure that the device has been adequately evaluated and has adequate performance characteristics in the intended population. The review of in vitro companion diagnostics in conjunction with the review of our product candidates in development for cancer will, therefore, likely involve coordination of review by the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research and the FDA’s Center for Devices and Radiological Health Office of In Vitro Diagnostics and Radiological Health.

​
Under the FDCA, in vitro diagnostics, including companion diagnostics, are regulated as medical devices. In the United States, the FDCA and its implementing regulations, and other federal and state statutes and regulations govern, among other things, medical device design and development, preclinical and clinical testing, premarket clearance or approval, registration and listing, manufacturing, labeling, storage, advertising and promotion, sales and distribution, export and import, and post-market surveillance. Unless an exemption applies, medical devices, including companion diagnostic tests, require marketing clearance or approval from the FDA prior to commercial distribution. 
​
The two primary types of FDA marketing authorization applicable to a medical device are premarket notification, also called 510(k) clearance, and premarket approval (“PMA”). To obtain 510(k) clearance, a manufacturer must submit to the FDA a premarket notification submission demonstrating that the proposed device is “substantially equivalent” to a legally marketed predicate device. The FDA’s 510(k) clearance process usually takes from three to twelve months, but may take longer. The FDA may require additional information, including clinical data, to make a determination regarding substantial equivalence. If the FDA agrees that the device is substantially equivalent to a predicate device currently on the market, it will grant 510(k) clearance to commercially market the device. If the FDA determines that the 

32



device is “not substantially equivalent” to a previously cleared device, the device is automatically designated as a Class III (i.e., high-risk) device. The device sponsor must then fulfill more rigorous PMA requirements, or can request a risk-based classification determination for the device in accordance with the “de novo” process, which is a route to market for novel medical devices that are low to moderate risk and are not substantially equivalent to a predicate device. 

​
After a device receives 510(k) clearance, any modification that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a major change or modification in its intended use, will require a new 510(k) clearance or, depending on the modification, PMA approval or de novo classification. The FDA requires each manufacturer to determine whether the proposed change requires submission of a 510(k), de novo classification or a PMA in the first instance, but the FDA can review any such decision and disagree with a manufacturer’s determination. If the FDA disagrees with a manufacturer’s determination, the FDA can require the manufacturer to cease marketing and/or request the recall of the modified device until 510(k) marketing clearance, approval of a PMA, or issuance of a de novo classification. Also, in these circumstances, the manufacturer may be subject to significant regulatory fines or penalties.

​
The PMA process, including the gathering of clinical and preclinical data and the submission to and review by the FDA, can take several years or longer. It involves a rigorous premarket review during which the applicant must prepare and provide the FDA with reasonable assurance of the device’s safety and effectiveness and information about the device and its components regarding, among other things, device design, manufacturing and labeling. PMA applications are subject to an application fee. In addition, PMAs for certain devices must generally include the results from extensive preclinical and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to establish the safety and effectiveness of the device for each indication for which FDA approval is sought. In particular, for a diagnostic, a PMA application typically requires data regarding analytical and clinical validation studies. As part of the PMA review, the FDA will typically inspect the manufacturer’s facilities for compliance with the QSR which imposes elaborate testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance requirements.

​
PMA approval is not guaranteed, and the FDA may ultimately respond to a PMA submission with a not approvable determination based on deficiencies in the application and require additional clinical trial or other data that may be expensive and time-consuming to generate and that can substantially delay approval. If the FDA’s evaluation of the PMA application is favorable, the FDA typically issues an approvable letter requiring the applicant’s agreement to specific conditions, such as changes in labeling, or specific additional information, such as submission of final labeling, in order to secure final approval of the PMA. If the FDA’s evaluation of the PMA or manufacturing facilities is not favorable, the FDA will deny approval of the PMA or issue a not approvable letter. A not approvable letter will outline the deficiencies in the application and, where practical, will identify what is necessary to make the PMA approvable. The FDA may also determine that additional clinical trials are necessary, in which case the PMA approval may be delayed for several months or years while the trials are conducted and then the data submitted in an amendment to the PMA. If the FDA concludes that the applicable criteria have been met, the FDA will issue a PMA for the approved indications, which can be more limited than those originally sought by the applicant. The PMA can include post-approval conditions that the FDA believes necessary to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device, including, among other things, restrictions on labeling, promotion, sale and distribution. Once granted, PMA approval may be withdrawn by the FDA if compliance with post approval requirements, conditions of approval or other regulatory standards are not maintained or problems are identified following initial marketing.

​
After a device is placed on the market, it remains subject to significant regulatory requirements. Medical devices may be marketed only for the uses and indications for which they are cleared or approved. Device manufacturers must also establish registration and device listings with the FDA. A medical device manufacturer’s manufacturing processes and those of its suppliers are required to comply with the applicable portions of the QSR, which cover the methods and documentation of the design, testing, production, processes, controls, quality assurance, labeling, packaging and shipping of medical devices. Domestic facility records and manufacturing processes are subject to periodic unscheduled inspections by the FDA. The FDA also may inspect foreign facilities that export products to the United States.
​
International Regulations
​
In addition to regulations in the United States, we are and will be subject to a variety of regulations in other jurisdictions governing, among other things, clinical trials, marketing authorization, post-marketing requirements and 

33



any commercial sales and distribution of our products. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval of a product, we must obtain the requisite approvals from regulatory authorities in foreign countries prior to the commencement of clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. The requirements and process governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. Failure to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, may be subject to, among other things, fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution.
​
Non-Clinical Studies and Clinical Trials
​
Similarly to the U.S., the various phases of non-clinical and clinical research in the European Union (“EU”) are subject to significant regulatory controls.
​
Non-clinical studies are performed to demonstrate the health or environmental safety of new chemical or biological substances. Non-clinical studies must be conducted in compliance with the principles of good laboratory practice (“GLP”) as set forth in EU Directive 2004/10/EC. In particular, non-clinical studies, both in vitro and in vivo, must be planned, performed, monitored, recorded, reported and archived in accordance with the GLP principles, which define a set of rules and criteria for a quality system for the organizational process and the conditions for non-clinical studies. These GLP standards reflect the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development requirements.
​
Clinical trials of medicinal products in the EU must be conducted in accordance with EU and national regulations and the International Conference on Harmonization (“ICH”) guidelines on Good Clinical Practices (“GCP”) as well as the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki. If the sponsor of the clinical trial is not established within the EU, it must appoint an EU entity to act as its legal representative. The sponsor must take out a clinical trial insurance policy, and in most EU countries, the sponsor is liable to provide ‘no fault’ compensation to any study subject injured in the clinical trial.
​
The regulatory landscape related to clinical trials in the EU has been subject to recent changes. The EU Clinical Trials Regulation (“CTR”) which was adopted in April 2014 and repeals the EU Clinical Trials Directive, became applicable on January 31, 2022. Unlike directives, the CTR is directly applicable in all EU member states without the need for member states to further implement it into national law. The CTR notably harmonizes the assessment and supervision processes for clinical trials throughout the EU via a Clinical Trials Information System, which contains a centralized EU portal and database. 
​
While the Clinical Trials Directive required a separate clinical trial application (“CTA”) to be submitted in each member state, to both the competent national health authority and an independent ethics committee, much like the FDA and IRB respectively, the CTR introduces a centralized process and only requires the submission of a single application to all member states concerned. The CTR allows sponsors to make a single submission to both the competent authority and an ethics committee in each member state, leading to a single decision per member state. The CTA must include, among other things, a copy of the trial protocol and an investigational medicinal product dossier containing information about the manufacture and quality of the medicinal product under investigation. The assessment procedure of the CTA has been harmonized as well, including a joint assessment by all member states concerned, and a separate assessment by each member state with respect to specific requirements related to its own territory, including ethics rules. Each member state’s decision is communicated to the sponsor via the centralized EU portal. Once the CTA is approved, clinical study development may proceed. 
​
The CTR foresees a three-year transition period. The extent to which ongoing and new clinical trials will be governed by the CTR varies. For clinical trials whose CTA was made under the Clinical Trials Directive before January 31, 2022, the Clinical Trials Directive will continue to apply on a transitional basis for three years. Additionally, sponsors may still choose to submit a CTA under either the Clinical Trials Directive or the CTR until January 31, 2023 and, if authorized, those will be governed by the Clinical Trials Directive until January 31, 2025. By that date, all ongoing trials will become subject to the provisions of the CTR.

​
During the development of a medicinal product, the European Medicines Agency (“EMA”) and national regulators provide the opportunity for dialogue and guidance on the development program. At the EMA level, this is usually done 

34



in the form of scientific advice, which is given by the Scientific Advice Working Party of the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (“CHMP”). A fee is incurred with each scientific advice procedure. Advice from the EMA is typically provided based on questions concerning, for example, quality (chemistry, manufacturing and controls testing), nonclinical testing and clinical trials, and pharmacovigilance plans and risk-management programs. Advice is not legally binding with regard to any future marketing authorization application of the product concerned. 
​
Marketing Authorization
​
In order to market our product candidates in the EU and many other foreign jurisdictions, we must obtain separate regulatory approvals. More concretely, in the EU, medicinal products candidates can only be placed on the market after obtaining a marketing authorization (“MA”). To obtain regulatory approval of a product candidate in the EU, we must submit a MA application (“MAA”). The process for doing this depends, among other things, on the nature of the medicinal product. There are two types of MAs:
​

● | “Centralized MAs” are issued by the European Commission through the centralized procedure based on the opinion of the EMA’s CHMP, and are valid throughout the EU. The centralized procedure is compulsory for certain types of medicinal products such as: (i) medicinal products derived from biotechnology processes, such as genetic engineering, (ii) medicinal products containing a new active substance indicated for the treatment of certain diseases, such as HIV/AIDS, cancer, diabetes, neurodegenerative diseases, autoimmune and other immune dysfunctions and viral diseases, (iii) designated orphan medicinal products and (iv) advanced therapy medicinal products (“ATMPs”) such as gene therapy, somatic cell therapy or tissue-engineered medicines. The centralized procedure is optional for product candidates containing a new active substance not yet authorized in the EU, or for product candidates that constitute a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation or which are in the interest of public health in the EU. •
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

● | “National MAs” are issued by the competent authorities of the EU member states, only cover their respective territory, and are available for product candidates not falling within the mandatory scope of the centralized procedure. Where a product has already been authorized for marketing in an EU member state, this national MA can be recognized in another member state through the mutual recognition procedure. If the product has not received a national MA in any member state at the time of application, it can be approved simultaneously in various member states through the decentralized procedure. Under the decentralized procedure an identical dossier is submitted to the competent authorities of each of the member states in which the MA is sought, one of which is selected by the applicant as the reference member state.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​
Under the centralized procedure, the maximum timeframe for the evaluation of a MAA by the EMA is 210 days. This excludes so-called clock stops, during which additional written or oral information is to be provided by the applicant in response to questions asked by the CHMP. At the end of the review period, the CHMP provides an opinion to the European Commission. If this opinion is favorable, the Commission may then adopt a decision to grant an MA. In exceptional cases, the CHMP might perform an accelerated review of a MAA in no more than 150 days (not including clock stops). Innovative products that target an unmet medical need and are expected to be of major public health interest may be eligible for a number of expedited development and review programs, such as the PRIME scheme, which provides incentives similar to the breakthrough therapy designation in the U.S. PRIME is a voluntary scheme aimed at enhancing the EMA’s support for the development of medicines that target unmet medical needs. It is based on increased interaction and early dialogue with companies developing promising medicines, to optimize their product development plans and speed up their evaluation to help them reach patients earlier. Many benefits accrue to sponsors of product candidates with PRIME designation, including but not limited to, early and proactive regulatory dialogue with the EMA, frequent discussions on clinical trial designs and other development program elements, and accelerated MAA assessment once a dossier has been submitted. Importantly, a dedicated contact and rapporteur from the CHMP is appointed early in the PRIME scheme facilitating increased understanding of the product at EMA’s committee level. An initial meeting initiates these relationships and includes a team of multidisciplinary experts at the EMA to provide guidance on the overall development and regulatory strategies.
​

35



MAs have an initial duration of five years. After these five years, the authorization may be renewed on the basis of a reevaluation of the risk-benefit balance. Once renewed, the MA is valid for an unlimited period unless the European Commission or the national competent authority decides, on justified grounds relating to pharmacovigilance, to proceed with one additional five-year renewal.
​
Data and Marketing Exclusivity 
​
The EU also provides opportunities for market exclusivity. Upon receiving MA, reference product generally receive eight years of data exclusivity and an additional two years of market exclusivity. If granted, the data exclusivity period prevents generic or biosimilar applicants from relying on the pre-clinical and clinical trial data contained in the dossier of the reference product when applying for a generic or biosimilar MA in the EU during a period of eight years from the date on which the reference product was first authorized in the EU. The market exclusivity period prevents a successful generic or biosimilar applicant from commercializing its product in the EU until 10 years have elapsed from the initial MA of the reference product in the EU. The overall 10-year market exclusivity period can be extended to a maximum of eleven years if, during the first eight years of those 10 years, the MA holder obtains an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications which, during the scientific evaluation prior to their authorization, are held to bring a significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies. However, there is no guarantee that a product will be considered by the EU’s regulatory authorities to be a new chemical entity, and products may not qualify for data exclusivity.
​
​
Orphan Medicinal Products
​
The criteria for designating an “orphan medicinal product” in the EU are similar in principle to those in the United States. A medicinal product may be designated as orphan if (1) it is intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of a life-threatening or chronically debilitating condition; (2) either (a) such condition affects no more than five in 10,000 persons in the EU when the application is made, or (b) the product, without the benefits derived from orphan status, would not generate sufficient return in the EU to justify investment; and (3) there exists no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention or treatment of such condition authorized for marketing in the EU, or if such a method exists, the product will be of significant benefit to those affected by the condition. 
​
The application for orphan drug designation must be submitted before the MAA. Orphan designation entitles a party to incentives such fee reductions or fee waivers, protocol assistance, and access to the centralized procedure. Upon grant of a MA, orphan medicinal products are entitled to ten years of market exclusivity for the approved therapeutic indication. During the ten-year market exclusivity period, the competent authorities cannot accept a MAA, or grant a MA, or accept an application to extend a MA, for the same indication, in respect of a similar medicinal product. The period of market exclusivity is extended by two years for orphan medicinal products that have also complied with an agreed pediatric investigation plan (“PIP”). No extension to any supplementary protection certificate can be granted on the basis of pediatric studies for orphan indications. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process. 
​
The 10-year market exclusivity may be reduced to six years if, at the end of the fifth year, it is established that the product no longer meets the criteria for orphan designation, for example, if the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity. Additionally, a MA may be granted to a similar product for the same indication at any time if (1) the second applicant can establish that its product, although similar, is safer, more effective or otherwise clinically superior; (2) the applicant consents to a second orphan medicinal product application; or (3) the applicant cannot supply enough orphan medicinal product. 
​
Failure to comply with EU and member state laws that apply to the conduct of clinical trials, manufacturing approval, MA of medicinal products and marketing of such products, both before and after grant of the MA, manufacturing of pharmaceutical products, statutory health insurance, bribery and anti-corruption or with other applicable regulatory requirements may result in administrative, civil or criminal penalties. These penalties could include delays or refusal to authorize the conduct of clinical trials, or to grant MA, product withdrawals and recalls, product 

36



seizures, suspension, withdrawal or variation of the MA, total or partial suspension of production, distribution, manufacturing or clinical trials, operating restrictions, injunctions, suspension of licenses, fines and criminal penalties.
​
The aforementioned EU rules are generally applicable in the European Economic Area (“EEA”) which consists of the 27 EU member states plus Norway, Liechtenstein and Iceland.
​
The United Kingdom (“UK”) left the EU on January 31, 2020, following which existing EU medicinal product legislation continued to apply in the UK during the transition period under the terms of the EU-UK Withdrawal Agreement. The transition period, which ended on December 31, 2020, maintained access to the EU single market and to the global trade deals negotiated by the EU on behalf of its members. The transition period provided time for the UK and EU to negotiate a framework for partnership for the future, which was then crystallized in the Trade and Cooperation Agreement (“TCA”) and became effective on the January 1, 2021. The TCA includes specific provisions concerning pharmaceuticals, which include the mutual recognition of Good Manufacturing Practice (“GMP”) inspections of manufacturing facilities for medicinal products and GMP documents issued, but does not foresee wholesale mutual recognition of UK and EU pharmaceutical regulations.
​
Other Foreign Regulations
​
For other countries outside of Europe, such as countries in Eastern Europe, Latin America or Asia, the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. In all cases, again, the clinical trials are conducted in accordance with GCP and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.
​
If we fail to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, we may be subject to, among other things, fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution.
​
Regulation of Companion Diagnostics
​
In the EU, in vitro diagnostic medical devices are regulated by Directive 98/79/EC which regulates the placing on the market, the CE marking, the essential requirements, the conformity assessment procedures, the registration obligations for manufacturers and devices as well as the vigilance procedure. In vitro diagnostic medical devices must comply with the requirements provided for in the Directive, and with further requirements implemented at national level (as the case may be). 
​
The regulation of companion diagnostics will be subject to further requirements once the in-vitro medical diagnostic devices Regulation (No 2017/746) (“IVDR”) will become applicable on 26 May 2022. However, on October 14, 2021, the European Commission proposed a “progressive” roll-out of the IVDR to prevent disruption in the supply of in vitro diagnostic medical devices. The European Parliament and Council voted to adopt the proposed regulation on December 15, 2021 and the regulation entered into force on January 2022. The IVDR will fully apply on May 26, 2022 but there will be a tiered system extending the grace period for many devices (depending on their risk classification) before they have to be fully compliant with the regulation.
​
 The IVDR introduces a new classification system for companion diagnostics which are now specifically defined as diagnostic tests that support the safe and effective use of a specific medicinal product, by identifying patients that are suitable or unsuitable for treatment. Companion diagnostics will have to undergo a conformity assessment by a notified body. Before it can issue a CE certificate, the notified body must seek a scientific opinion from the EMA on the suitability of the companion diagnostic to the medicinal product concerned if the medicinal product falls exclusively within the scope of the centralized procedure for the authorization of medicines, or the medicinal product is already authorized through the centralized procedure, or a MAA for the medicinal product has been submitted through the centralized procedure. For other substances, the notified body can seek the opinion from a national competent authorities or the EMA.
​
The aforementioned EU rules are generally applicable in the EEA.

​
Pharmaceutical Coverage, Pricing and Reimbursement
​
Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any drug products for which we obtain regulatory approval. In the United States and markets in other countries, sales of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale will depend in part on the availability of reimbursement from third-party payors. Third-party payors include government health administrative authorities, managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations. The process for determining whether a payor will provide coverage for a drug product may be separate from the process for setting the price or reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the drug product. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific drug products on an approved list, or formulary, which might not include all of the FDA-approved drugs for a particular indication. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the price and examining the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of medical products and services, in addition to their safety and efficacy. We may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of our products, in addition to the costs required to obtain FDA approvals. Our product candidates may not be considered medically necessary or cost-effective. A payor’s decision to provide coverage for a drug product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development.
​
In 2003, the U.S. government enacted legislation providing a partial prescription drug benefit for Medicare beneficiaries, which became effective at the beginning of 2006. Government payment for some of the costs of prescription drugs may increase demand for any products for which we receive marketing approval. However, to obtain payments under this program, we would be required to sell products to Medicare recipients through prescription drug plans operating pursuant to this legislation. These plans will likely negotiate discounted prices for our products. 
​
Further, in March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, or ACA, was enacted and the Healthcare Reform Law substantially changes the way healthcare is financed in the United States by both government and private insurers. Among other cost containment measures, the ACA established:
​

• | an annual, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports certain branded prescription drugs and biologic agents;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program, in which pharmaceutical manufacturers who wish to have their drugs covered under Part D must offer discounts to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, or the “donut hole”; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a new formula that increases the rebates a manufacturer must pay under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​
Since its enactment, there have been judicial, executive and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the ACA. On June 17, 2021, the United States Supreme Court dismissed the judicial challenge to the ACA without specifically ruling on the constitutionality of the ACA. Prior to the United States Supreme Court’s decision, President Biden issued an executive order to initiate a special enrollment period from February 15, 2021 through August 15, 2021 for purposes of obtaining health insurance coverage through the ACA marketplace. The executive order also instructed certain governmental agencies to review and reconsider their existing policies and rules that limit access to healthcare, including among others, reexamining Medicaid demonstration projects and waiver programs that include work requirements, and policies that create unnecessary barriers to obtaining access to health insurance coverage through Medicaid or the ACA. In addition, we expect that federal, state and local governments in the United States will continue to consider legislation to limit the growth of healthcare costs, including the cost of prescription drugs. Future legislation could limit payments for pharmaceuticals such as the product candidates that we are developing.
​
Different pricing and reimbursement schemes exist in other countries. In the EU, governments influence the price of pharmaceutical products through their pricing and reimbursement rules and control of national health care systems that fund a large part of the cost of those products to consumers. Member states are free to restrict the range of pharmaceutical products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement, and to control the 

38



prices and reimbursement levels of pharmaceutical products for human use. Some jurisdictions operate positive and negative list systems under which products may only be marketed once a reimbursement price has been agreed. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval, some of these countries may require the completion of clinical trials that compare the cost-effectiveness of a particular product candidate to currently available therapies. Other member states allow companies to fix their own prices for medicines but monitor and control company profits. The downward pressure on health care costs in general, particularly prescription drugs, has become very intense. As a result, new products are facing increasingly high barriers to entry. In addition, in some countries, cross-border imports from low-priced markets exert a commercial pressure on pricing within a country.
​
The marketability of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale may suffer if the government and third-party payors fail to provide adequate coverage and reimbursement. In addition, an increasing emphasis on managed care in the United States has increased and we expect will continue to increase the pressure on pharmaceutical pricing. Coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is secured for one or more products for which we receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.
In order to raise sufficient financial resources to continue to advance our product candidates, we will need to address pricing pressures and potential third-party reimbursement coverage for our product candidates. In the United States and elsewhere, sales of pharmaceutical products depend in significant part on the availability of reimbursement to the consumer from third party payors, such as government and private insurance plans. Third party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services. It is and will continue to be time consuming and expensive for us or our strategic collaborators to go through the process of seeking reimbursement from Medicare and private payors. Our products may not be considered cost effective, and coverage and reimbursement may not be available or sufficient to allow us to sell our products on a competitive and profitable basis.
​
Other Healthcare Laws and Compliance Requirements
​
If we obtain regulatory approval for any of our product candidates, we may be subject to various federal, state and foreign laws targeting fraud and abuse in the healthcare industry. Such laws include, without limitation, U.S. federal and state anti-kickback, fraud and abuse, false claims, consumer fraud, data privacy and security, and transparency laws and regulations with respect to drug pricing and payments and other transfers of value made to physicians and other healthcare professionals, as well as similar foreign laws in the jurisdictions outside the U.S.
​
The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, to induce either the referral of an individual, or the furnishing, recommending, or arranging for a good or service, for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. A person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. Many states have adopted laws similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, some of which apply to the referral of patients for healthcare items or services reimbursed by any source, not only the Medicare and Medicaid programs.
​
The federal False Claims Act imposes liability on any person who, among other things, knowingly presents, or causes to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment by a federal healthcare program. In addition, the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the False Claims Act. The “qui tam” provisions of the False Claims Act allow a private individual to bring civil actions on behalf of the federal government alleging that the defendant has submitted a false claim to the federal government, and to share in any monetary recovery. In addition, various states have enacted false claims laws analogous to the False Claims Act. Many of these state laws apply where a claim is submitted to any third-party payer and not merely a federal healthcare program. When an entity is determined to have violated the False Claims Act, it may be required to pay up to three times the actual damages sustained by the government, plus significant civil penalties for each separate false claim.
​
Also, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”), created several federal crimes, including healthcare fraud, and false statements relating to healthcare matters. The health care fraud statute prohibits knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud any health care benefit program, including private third-party 

39



payers. The false statements statute prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for health care benefits, items or services. Similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation.
​
The Physician Payment Sunshine Act, or the Sunshine Act, which was enacted as part of the ACA, requires applicable manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologicals, or medical supplies covered under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program, to report annually to the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services payments or other transfers of value made by that entity, or by a third party as directed by that entity, to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors), certain non-physician providers including physician assistants and nurse practitioners, and teaching hospitals, or to third parties on behalf of such providers, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members during the course of the preceding calendar year. Failure to comply with the reporting requirements can result in significant civil monetary penalties for any payment or other transfer of value that is not reported. 
​
Moreover, analogous state and foreign laws and regulations may be broader in scope than the provisions described above and may apply regardless of payor. Some state laws require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and relevant federal government compliance guidance; require drug manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers, many of which differ from each other in significant ways, thus further complicating compliance efforts; and restrict marketing practices or require disclosure of marketing expenditures and pricing information. 
​
Violations of any of these laws or any other governmental laws and regulations that may apply include, without limitation, significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, fines, imprisonment, exclusion of products from government funded healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, disgorgement, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations.

​
Data Privacy & Security
​
Numerous state, federal and foreign laws, including consumer protection laws and regulations, govern the collection, dissemination, use, access to, confidentiality and security of personal information, including health-related information. In the United States, numerous federal and state laws and regulations, including data breach notification laws, health information privacy and security laws, including HIPAA, and federal and state consumer protection laws and regulations (e.g., Section 5 of the FTC Act), that govern the collection, use, disclosure, and protection of health-related and other personal information could apply to our operations or the operations of our partners. In addition, certain state and non-U.S. laws, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”), the California Privacy Rights Act (“CPRA”), and the EU General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), govern the privacy and security of personal information, including health-related information in certain circumstances, some of which are more stringent than HIPAA and many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts. Failure to comply with these laws, where applicable, can result in the imposition of significant civil and/or criminal penalties and private litigation. Privacy and security laws, regulations, and other obligations are constantly evolving, may conflict with each other to complicate compliance efforts, and can result in investigations, proceedings, or actions that lead to significant civil and/or criminal penalties and restrictions on data processing. Additionally, our use of artificial intelligence and machine learning may be subject to laws and evolving regulations regarding the use of artificial intelligence/machine learning, controlling for data bias, and antidiscrimination.
