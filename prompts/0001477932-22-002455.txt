Overview

Company History

iCoreConnect Inc., (the “Company”), a Nevada Corporation, is a market leading cloud-based software and technology company focused on increasing workflow productivity and customer profitability through its enterprise platform of applications and services.

Software as a Service (SaaS) Offerings

The Company currently markets secure Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) compliant cloud-based software as a service (SaaS) offering under the names of iCoreRx, iCorePDMP, iCoreEPCS, iCoreVerify, iCoreHuddle, iCoreHuddle+, iCoreCodeGenius, iCoreExchange, iCoreCloud, iCorePay, iCoreSecure, and iCoreIT. The Company’s software is sold under annual recurring revenue subscriptions.

iCoreRx – iCoreRx is a HIPAA compliant electronic prescription SaaS solution that integrates with popular practice management and electronic health record systems. It saves time by selecting exact medications at available doses with built-in support from a drug directory and provides full support for Electronic Prescriptions for Controlled Substances (iCoreEPCS). It protects both the patient and provider by viewing the patient’s complete medication history. It also speeds up the process by allowing the doctor to create a “favorites” list for commonly used medication sets. iCorePDMP is an add-on for iCoreRx that seamlessly integrates with state databases to automate prescription drug monitoring. Providers in many states are required to check the patient’s Prescription Drug Monitoring Program (PDMP) history before prescribing controlled substances. This service provides a one-click real-time access to the state databases without the need to manually enter data. This tool also generates patient risk scores and an interactive visualization of usage patterns to help the prescriber identify potential risk factors. The prescriber can then use this report to make decisions on objective insight into potential drug misuse or abuse which will ultimately lead to improved patient safety and better patient outcomes.

iCoreVerify - iCoreVerify is a HIPAA compliant SaaS solution that allows practices to verify patient insurance benefits automatically and on-demand using our real time technology. It provides the practice with the ability to check available patient benefits directly from the payer’s in real-time. The system returns results typically in less than one second for most responses. This substantially reduces the phone calls and labor hours for the practice. This tool integrates with most popular practice management systems.

iCoreHuddle and iCoreHuddle+ – iCoreHuddle is a powerful HIPAA compliant SaaS solution to instantly reveal the revenue potential of each patient. The service connects to most popular practice management and electronic health record systems to optimize revenue realization. It provides the practice with a dashboard containing various metrics, analytics, and Key Performance Indicators (“KPIs”). iCoreHuddle provides a daily view of patient schedules, including their outstanding balances, unscheduled treatment plans, recall information, procedure information and the amount of remaining insurance benefits. The software also provides one-click access to each patient’s insurance eligibility, including a detailed benefits and deductibles report. This tool aims to increase the workflow efficiency of the dentist’s practice by reducing the number of required lookups and clicks for each patient. iCoreHuddle+ offers enhanced analytical tools for practices to optimize their revenue generation process and workflows. 

iCoreCodeGenius – iCoreCodeGenius is a medical coding reference SaaS solution that provides the coding standards for the 10th revision of the International Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD-10), a medical classification list published by the World Health Organization (WHO). It contains codes for diseases, signs and symptoms, abnormal findings, complaints, social circumstances, and external causes of injury and diseases.

iCoreCodeGenius includes a full ICD-10 code lookup and guidance, automatic prompting of comorbidities and Hierarchical Condition Category’s (HCC) to aid in obtaining the appropriate reimbursement with a high degree of accuracy, and the ability to reduce or eliminate queries and denials.

iCoreExchange – iCoreExchange provides a secure, HIPAA compliant SaaS email solution using the Direct Protocol that allows doctors to send and receive secure email with attachments to and from other healthcare professionals in the network. iCoreExchange also provides a secure email mechanism to communicate with users outside the exchange e.g., patients and referrals. Users have the ability to build a community, access other communities and increase referrals and collaboration. Users can email standard office documents, JPEG, PDF as well as patient files with discrete data, which can then be imported and accessed on most Electronic Health Record (EHR) and Practice Management (PM) systems in a HIPAA compliant manner.

iCoreCloud - iCoreCloud offers customers the ability to backup their on-premise servers and computers to the cloud. iCoreCloud is a fully HIPAA compliant and automated backup solution. The data backed up is encrypted both in transit and while at rest. In case of full data loss, the mirrored data in the cloud can be seamlessly restored back to the practice on a new computer or a server. The data is stored encrypted in HIPAA compliant data centers with multiple layers of redundancy. The data centers are physically secure with restricted personnel and biometric access. The locations are also guarded by security 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.

iCorePay – iCorePay offers a seamless patient payment processing solutions for customers. iCorePay integrates into the practice workflow for payment and revenue cycle tracking.

iCoreSecure – Recent newscasts have been replete with reporting regarding many breaches of consumer personal information. We used our expertise and development capabilities from our HIPAA compliant iCoreExchange and developed iCoreSecure, an encrypted email solution for anyone that needs encrypted email to protect personal and financial data. iCoreSecure is a secure SaaS solution that solves privacy concerns in the insurance, real estate, financial and many other industry sectors that have a need for secure encrypted email.

iCoreIT - The trend in IT Services companies for over a decade has been to move away from a “Break/Fix '' model to a “Managed Service Provider (MSP)” and “Managed Software as a Service (MSaaS)” model with recurring revenue. 

The MSP/MSaaS approach, by using preventative measures, keeps computers and networks up and running while data is accessible and safeguarded. Installation of critical patches and updates to virus protection are automated. Systems are monitored and backed up in real-time. They are fixed or upgraded before they cause a service disruption. A Unified Threat Management solution is deployed to protect against virus, malware, SPAM, phishing and ransomware attacks. Remote technical support is a click away. All support is delivered at a predictable monthly cost.

Going forward, by leveraging MSP/MSaaS with our expertise in cloud computing, our customers can easily scale their business without extensive capital investment or disruption in services.

Competition - The Company experiences competition from a variety of sources with respect to virtually all of its products and services. The Company knows of no single entity that competes with it across the full range of its products and services; however, each of the lines of business in which the Company is engaged is highly competitive. Competition in the markets served is based on several considerations, which may include price, technology, applications, experience, know-how, reputation, service, and distribution. While we believe we offer a unique combination of products and services, a few competitors offer one or more similar products and services in one or more of our niche markets.

1. Secure, private, scalable, and reliable.

Our services have been designed to provide our customers with privacy and high levels of performance, reliability, and security.

We have designed, built, and continue to maintain a multi-tenant application architecture that has been designed to enable our service to scale securely, reliably and cost effectively. Our multi-tenant application architecture maintains the integrity and separation of customer data while still permitting all customers to use the same application functionality simultaneously.

2. Rapid deployment and lower total cost of ownership.

Our services can be deployed rapidly since our customers do not have to spend time procuring, installing, or maintaining the servers, storage, networking equipment, security products or other hardware and software. We enable customers to achieve up-front savings relative to the traditional enterprise software model. Customers benefit from the predictability of their future costs since they generally pay for the service on a per subscriber basis for the term of the subscription contract.

3. High levels of user adoption.

We have designed our products and services to be intuitive and easy to use. Our products and services contain many tools and features recognizable to users of popular consumer web services, so users have a more familiar user experience than typical EHR applications. As a result, our users can often use and gain benefit from our solutions with minimal training. We have also designed our products and services to be used on popular mobile devices, making it possible for people to conduct business from their smartphones or tablets.
