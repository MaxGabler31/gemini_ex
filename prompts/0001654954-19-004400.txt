  Item 1. Business
  
  Overview
  
 Capital Financial Holdings, Inc. (“CFH”) derives the majority of its revenues and net income from sales of mutual funds, insurance products, and various other securities through Capital Financial Services, Inc. (“CFS”), the Company’s broker-dealer subsidiary.
  
 The Company has been engaged in the financial services business since 1987. The Company was incorporated September 22, 1987, as a North Dakota corporation. The Company’s principal offices are located at 1821 Burdick Expressway W., Minot, North Dakota 58701. As of December 31, 2018, the Company had 14 full-time employees consisting of officers, principals, data processing, compliance, accounting, and clerical support staff.
  
  The Company’s Subsidiary
  
 The Company organizes its business units into two reportable segments: Broker-Dealer Services and Holding Company. The Broker-Dealer Services segment distributes securities and insurance products to retail investors through a network of registered representatives through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Capital Financial Services, Inc. (“CFS”), a Wisconsin corporation. The Holding Company encompasses cost associated with ownership of its office building, business development and acquisitions, dispositions of subsidiary entities and results of discontinued operations, dividend income and recognized gains or losses.
  
 The Company's reportable segments are strategic business units that offer different products and services. They are managed separately because each business requires different technology and marketing strategies.
  
 Capital Financial Holdings, Inc. derives all of its revenues and net income from sales of mutual funds, insurance products, and various other securities through Capital Financial Services, Inc. (“CFS”), the Company’s broker-dealer subsidiary.

 Description Of Business
  
  Brokerage Commissions
  
 CFS’s primary source of revenue is commission revenue in connection with sales of shares of mutual funds, insurance products, and various other securities. CFS receives commission and Rule 12b-1 servicing revenue generated from the sale of investment products originated by its registered representatives. CFS also receives investment advisory revenue as a registered investment advisor. CFS pays a portion of the revenue generated to its registered representatives and retains the balance. Commission income and the related clearing expenses are recorded based on the trade date. The revenue earned from 12b-1 is recognized ratably over the period received. Investment advisory fees are derived from account management and investment advisory services. These fees are determined based on a percentage of the customer’s assets under sponsor management or a flat fee, may be billed monthly or quarterly and recognized ratably over the period received. The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

  Regulation
  
 Virtually all aspects of the Company’s businesses are subject to various complex and extensive federal and state laws and regulations. Regulated areas include, but are not limited to, the effecting of securities transactions, the financial condition of the Company’s subsidiary, record-keeping and reporting procedures, relationships with clients, and experience and training requirements for certain employees. The Company’s subsidiary, Capital Financial Services, Inc. (“CFS”), is registered with various federal and state government agencies, including the SEC, as well as FINRA, a self-regulatory industry organization, as described below.
  
 CFS is a registered broker-dealer subject to extensive regulation and periodic examinations by the SEC, FINRA, and state agencies in those states in which CFS conducts business. As a broker-dealer, CFS is subject to the Net Capital Rule promulgated by the SEC under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”). This rule requires that a broker-dealer must maintain certain minimum net capital and that its aggregate indebtedness may not exceed specified limitations.
  
 Federal and state laws and regulations, and the rules of FINRA, grant broad powers to such regulatory agencies and organizations. These include the power to limit, restrict, or prevent the Company from carrying on its business if it fails to comply with such laws, regulations and rules. Other possible sanctions that may be imposed include the suspension of individual employees, restrictions on the Company expanding its business or paying cash dividends, the revocation of the investment advisor or broker dealer expulsions, censures, and/or fines.
  
 The Company operates under the provision of Paragraph (k)(2)(ii) of Rule 15c3-3 of the Securities and Exchange Commission and, accordingly, is exempt from the remaining provisions of that rule. To the best of its knowledge the Company met the identified exemption provisions from January 1, 2018 to December 31, 2018 without exception.
  
 Since 1993, FINRA rules have limited the amount of aggregate sales charges which may be paid in connection with the purchase and holding of investment company shares sold through broker-dealers. From time to time, Congress and the SEC have considered adding amendments to Rule 12b-1 and other statutory provisions and rules that regulate the distribution of mutual fund shares. The effect of the rule amendments and other legislative or regulatory actions might be to limit the amount of fees that could be paid pursuant to a fund’s 12b-1 Plan in a situation where a fund has no, or limited, new sales for a prolonged period of time, as well as the imposition of other limits on the use of fund assets to pay for distribution.
  
  Competition
  
 The Company derives substantially all of its revenues from commission revenue earned in connection with sales of shares of mutual funds, insurance products and various other securities, and also receives investment advisory revenue.
  
 The Company participates in retail brokerage, a highly competitive related sector of the financial services industry. The Company competes directly with full-service stock brokerage firms, insurance companies, banks, regional broker-dealers, other independent broker-dealers, and other financial institutions, as well as investment advisory firms. Each of these competitors offer to the public many of the same investment products and services offered by the Company. Further, other broker-dealers providing the same services heavily recruit the representatives and advisors transacting business through the Company. This competition forces the Company to maintain high levels of support services and commission payouts for these representatives and advisors. These high levels of services and payouts could have a materially adverse effect on the Company’s earnings.
