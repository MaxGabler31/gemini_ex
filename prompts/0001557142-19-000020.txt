 Item 1. Business
 Overview
 We are a fully integrated biopharmaceutical company engaged in the discovery, development and commercialization of small molecules and biologics to address significant unmet medical needs, with a focus on autoimmune, inflammatory and fibrotic diseases as well as immuno-oncology. Below is a brief description of our lead product candidates:
· | Autoimmune, Inflammatory and Fibrotic Diseases. We are developing oral small molecule inhibitors of Rho-associated coiled-coil kinase (ROCK) to treat autoimmune, inflammatory and fibrotic diseases. Research by Kadmon and several academic institutions has demonstrated that inhibition of ROCK can regulate aberrant immune responses and fibrotic processes.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | KD025. KD025, our most advanced product candidate, is an oral small molecule inhibitor of Rho-associated coiled-coil kinase 2 (ROCK2). We are conducting an open-label registration trial of KD025 for the treatment of chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD), a complication arising from allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation and Orphan Drug Designation to KD025 for the treatment of cGVHD.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  We plan to initiate a double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2 clinical trial of KD025 for the treatment of systemic sclerosis (a subtype of scleroderma), an immune and fibrotic disorder sharing several pathological complications with cGVHD, in the first half of 2019. 
 We are conducting a Phase 2 proof-of-concept clinical trial of KD025 for the treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). Initial findings from this trial demonstrated clinical benefit and tolerability of KD025 in IPF. We anticipate that data from this trial will support the ongoing development of our novel ROCK inhibitors for the treatment of fibrotic diseases, including IPF. 

o | KD045. KD045 is a pan-ROCK inhibitor in development for fibrotic diseases and is the lead product candidate from our internal effort to identify and develop next-generation ROCK inhibitors. KD045 inhibited key fibrotic processes in multiple in vivo pharmacology models, including models of bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis, renal fibrosis and liver fibrosis. We expect to complete an IND submission and initiate a clinical trial of KD045 in the second half of 2019.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Immuno-oncology. We have a biologics research platform focused on the development of IL-15-containing fusion proteins for the treatment of cancer.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | KD033. KD033 is an anti-PD-L1/IL-15 fusion protein and is the most advanced product candidate from our IL-15-fused biologics platform. KD033 significantly inhibited tumor growth in many mouse syngeneic models including PD-L1-expressing models that are resistant to approved immunotherapies. In these models, KD033 has demonstrated long-lasting responses through the induction of immune system memory. We expect to complete an IND submission and initiate a clinical trial of KD033 in the second half of 2019.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Generic Product Candidate for Wilson’s Disease. We have developed KD034, a generic to Syprine (trientine hydrochloride), for the treatment of Wilson’s disease, a genetic liver disease.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | KD034. We have submitted Abbreviated New Drug Applications (ANDAs) to the FDA for bottled KD034 capsules as well as for KD034 in proprietary blister packaging that offers room temperature stability, which we believe has the potential to address shortcomings of the currently marketed trientine hydrochloride. We are continuing dialogue with the FDA regarding the potential approval of KD034. We intend to use Kadmon Pharmaceuticals, LLC (Kadmon Pharmaceuticals), our specialty‑focused commercial operation, to market our KD034 product candidates, if approved.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Kadmon Pharmaceuticals markets and distributes pharmaceutical products in a variety of therapeutic areas. We do not currently depend on commercial revenues from Kadmon Pharmaceuticals to support our non-commercial operations. Our commercial infrastructure, including the regulatory, compliance, quality and chemistry, manufacturing and controls (CMC) teams of Kadmon Pharmaceuticals, currently supports the development of our clinical-stage product candidates. We plan to leverage our commercial infrastructure to commercialize our product candidates, if approved.

     Our Strategy
 Our goal is to develop innovative therapies for significant unmet medical needs. Our key strategies to achieve this goal are listed below:

· | Advance KD025 for the treatment of autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. We are conducting a registration trial of KD025 in cGVHD and expect to complete enrollment and potentially meet the study’s primary endpoint in the second half of 2019. We also plan to initiate a Phase 2 clinical trial of KD025 in systemic sclerosis in the first half of 2019. In addition, we are conducting a proof-of-concept clinical trial of KD025 in IPF and anticipate that date from trial will support the rationale for our ongoing development of KD045, our pan-ROCK inhibitor, for the treatment of fibrotic diseases.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Develop KD045 for the treatment of fibrotic diseases. We plan to complete an IND submission and initiate a first-in-human clinical trial of KD045, our pan-ROCK inhibitor, in the second half of 2019.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Develop KD033 for the treatment of cancer. We plan to complete an IND submission initiate a first-in-human clinical trial of KD033, our anti-PD-L1/IL-15 fusion protein, in the second half of 2019.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Leverage our research platforms to develop new product candidates in the areas of fibrosis, autoimmunity and immuno-oncology. In addition to KD045 and KD033, we are using our small molecule and biologics research platforms to develop new therapies in the areas of fibrosis, autoimmunity and immuno-oncology.

  Our Clinical‑Stage Pipeline

 ROCK Inhibitors for Autoimmune, Inflammatory and Fibrotic Diseases 
 ROCK is an “on” switch in cells that regulates cell movement, shape and differentiation. Two ROCK isoforms exist: ROCK1 and ROCK2, and dysregulation of ROCK is implicated in many chronic diseases. Kadmon’s research has demonstrated that inhibition of ROCK can regulate aberrant immune responses and fibrotic processes.
 Kadmon’s ROCK portfolio includes a ROCK2-selective inhibitor, KD025, for the treatment of autoimmune and inflammatory diseases, and KD045, a ROCK inhibitor for the treatment of fibrotic diseases.  
 A central goal in the study of autoimmune and inflammatory diseases is to develop therapies that down-regulate pro-inflammatory immune responses while preserving the immune system’s ability to fight infections and tumors. Our research has demonstrated that selective ROCK2 inhibition rebalances the immune system. In clinical and preclinical studies, KD025 down-regulated pro-inflammatory responses driven by T helper 17 (Th17) cells through the down-regulation of STAT3, a key transcription factor and regulator of the inflammatory pathway. ROCK2 inhibition concurrently increased regulatory T cells (Tregs) through activation of STAT5, a controller of regulatory cell function, helping to resolve inflammation with a minimal effect on the rest of the immune response.

     In fibrotic diseases, research by Kadmon and others has demonstrated that ROCK signaling is up-regulated throughout the fibrotic process, regardless of initiating factor, affecting macrophage infiltration, endothelial cell activation and fibroblast to myofibroblast differentiation. These processes result in the deposition of excess collagen and creation of scar tissue. We believe that ROCK inhibition has the potential to halt these processes to successfully treat fibrotic diseases.
 KD025 Clinical Program
 To date, more than 450 subjects have been dosed with KD025 for autoimmune, inflammatory or fibrotic diseases or as healthy volunteers. KD025 has been well tolerated and demonstrated clinical activity.
 KD025 for the Treatment of Chronic Graft-Versus-Host Disease 
 Medical Need: Chronic Graft-Versus-Host Disease

cGVHD is a major cause of morbidity and mortality after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) in patients that suffered from hematologic malignancies. Clinically, cGVHD is a multiorgan syndrome involving tissue inflammation and fibrosis that often results in permanent organ dysfunction. Approximately 14,000 people are living with cGVHD in the United States, with approximately 5,200 new patients per year. Preclinical research has demonstrated that IL-21 and IL-17, two pro-inflammatory cytokines, play a key role in cGVHD pathogenesis. 
 KD025 in Chronic Graft-Versus-Host Disease
 KD025 has demonstrated clinical activity and tolerability in an ongoing Phase 2 clinical trial in patients with steroid-dependent or steroid-refractory cGVHD with 1-3 prior lines of treatment for the disease (KD025-208). Three cohorts of patients, (KD025 200 mg QD (n=17), KD025 200 mg BID (n=16) and KD025 400 mg QD (n=21)), were enrolled sequentially following a safety assessment of the previous cohort. KD025 achieved Overall Response Rates (ORRs) of approximately 60% across all three cohorts. Responses were observed across all affected organ systems, including in organs with fibrotic disease. Responses were durable, and patients reported improvements in quality of life and were also able to reduce and/or completely discontinue doses of corticosteroids and other immunosuppressants. Pharmacodynamics (PD) data showed a decrease in Th17 cells and an increase in Treg cells during KD025 treatment, consistent with KD025 mechanism of action. KD025 was well tolerated, with no treatment-related serious adverse events and no apparent increased risk of infection. 
 Ongoing Registration Trial of KD025 in Chronic Graft‑Versus‑Host Disease (KD025-213)
 We are conducting an open-label, two-arm registration clinical trial of KD025 in patients with cGVHD who have received two or more prior lines of systemic therapy. Patients are randomized to receive KD025 200 mg QD or 200 mg BID (63 patients per arm). Either KD025 dose may be considered by the FDA for registration. The primary endpoint is the ORR, defined as the percentage of patients who meet the 2014 National Institutes of Health (NIH) Consensus Conference overall response criteria of Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR). During a Type C meeting in March 2018, the FDA provided guidance to Kadmon on how to design a pivotal study of KD025 in cGVHD. The FDA granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation to KD025 in cGVHD in October 2018. We plan to continue our dialogue with regulatory authorities throughout 2019 to obtain further guidance on a regulatory pathway to approval for KD025 in cGVHD. 
 KD025 for the Treatment of Systemic Sclerosis
 Medical Need: Systemic Sclerosis 

Systemic sclerosis (a subtype of scleroderma) is a chronic multi-system disease characterized by skin thickening and internal organ fibrosis. Approximately 75,000 to 100,000 people in the United States are living with systemic sclerosis. There are no FDA-approved targeted therapies for systemic sclerosis. KD025 in Systemic Sclerosis 

In the first half of 2019, we plan to initiate a double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2 clinical trial of KD025 in systemic sclerosis, a disease in which KD025 has demonstrated potential in preclinical models. The trial will randomize 60 patients to receive KD025 200 mg QD, KD025 200 mg BID or placebo (20 patients per arm) for 24 weeks. The primary endpoint is the change in Combined Response Index for Systemic Sclerosis (CRISS) score, a measure of improvement in systemic sclerosis, at 24 weeks.

     KD025 for the Treatment of Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis 
 Medical Need: Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF)
 IPF is a progressive fibrotic disease of the lungs, with a median survival of three to five years from the time of diagnosis. Approximately 128,000 people in the United States are living with IPF, with 48,000 new cases diagnosed annually. IPF is thought to be caused by repetitive environmental injury to the lining of the lung airways and the resulting abnormal wound-healing responses. 
 KD025 in IPF
 Independent research from academic institutions has demonstrated that ROCK signaling is increased in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis in humans as well as in murine lung samples. In our preclinical research, KD025 reduced fibrosis in multiple preclinical models, including lung fibrosis in a bleomycin mouse model system. These data suggest that ROCK inhibition has therapeutic potential in IPF by blocking key fibrotic processes mediated by ROCK.
 Ongoing Phase 2 Clinical Trial of KD025 in Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (KD025-207)
 We are conducting a randomized, open-label, Phase 2 clinical trial to examine the safety, tolerability and activity of KD025 in IPF patients who have received or been offered pirfenidone and/or nintedanib. The study enrolled 39 patients randomized 2:1 to receive KD025 at 400 mg QD or best supportive care (BSC). The primary efficacy endpoint is a measure of lung function, the forced vital capacity (FVC), at 24 weeks. In initial data announced in 2018, KD025 demonstrated clinical benefit in IPF patients, with a median decline in FVC of 48 mL at week 24, compared to a median decline of 175 mL in patients treated with BSC. KD025 was well tolerated, with no drug-related SAEs.
 In 2018, we expanded the KD025-207 study to enroll approximately 40 additional patients. We expect this data to support the development of KD045, Kadmon’s ROCK inhibitor, for the treatment of fibrotic diseases, including IPF. 
 KD045 

Kadmon is developing next-generation ROCK inhibitors for the treatment of fibrotic diseases. A key challenge in the development of ROCK inhibitors is to develop potent, selective oral therapies. Earlier-generation ROCK inhibitors target the majority of the AGC kinase family and lack specificity or potency to effectively target ROCK. Using innovative medicinal chemistry, computational and structure-based design approaches, we have identified and developed proprietary, next-generation inhibitors with enhanced potency and AGC-kinase selectivity to specifically target ROCK. We have selected our lead candidate from this effort, KD045, for clinical development. 

KD045 inhibited key fibrotic processes in multiple in vivo pharmacology models, including in models of bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis, renal fibrosis and liver fibrosis. KD045 has been shown to selectively target ROCK, exhibiting a favorable safety profile compared to earlier-generation ROCK inhibitors. We plan to complete an IND submission and initiate a clinical trial of KD045 in the second half of 2019.
 KD033 
 We have an in-house novel phage display library able to generate fully human monoclonal antibodies against many protein targets. This platform is run by an experienced group of scientists with an outstanding antibody development track record. Prior to joining Kadmon, this team was involved in the development of multiple commercially successful antibodies including Erbitux (cetuximab) and Cyramza (ramucirumab). Our scientists are developing monoclonal antibodies as well as fusion proteins and bispecific antibodies that we believe represent the next generation of cancer immunotherapies.
 Our most advanced candidate from the biologics platform, KD033, is a novel anti PD-L1/IL-15 fusion protein designed to stimulate an immune response directed to the tumor microenvironment. Recombinant IL-15 alone, which stimulates cancer-fighting immune effector cells, is not well tolerated when administered systemically. We have developed KD033 as a novel approach to overcome this challenge by fusing IL-15 to an anti-PD-L1 antibody to direct IL-15 activity specifically to the tumor microenvironment, which is designed to promote efficacy and induce durable responses while potentially increasing tolerability.  
 Preclinical data demonstrated that a single dose of KD033 inhibited tumor growth across multiple in vivo syngeneic tumor models. KD033 induced a strong immune response with a single treatment, resulting in mice that remained tumor-free following several tumor re-challenges. Furthermore, KD033 in combination with anti-PD-1 therapy demonstrated synergistic activity, providing clinical rationale for administering KD033 in combination with other immune checkpoint inhibitors. KD033 has demonstrated significant tumor inhibition in murine models that are resistant to approved immunotherapies (PD-L1, PD-1 or CTLA-4 antibodies), suggesting that KD033 may deliver promising clinical outcomes in cancer patients resistant

     or refractory to immuno-oncology monotherapy. We have presented encouraging preclinical data on KD033 at scientific conferences. We plan to complete an IND submission and initiate a clinical trial of KD033 in the second half of 2019. 
 KD034 Clinical Program
 KD034 represents our formulations of trientine hydrochloride for the treatment of Wilson’s disease.
 Medical Need: Wilson’s disease
 Wilson’s disease is a genetic disorder characterized by an inability to excrete copper, leading to severe hepatic, neurologic, psychiatric and/or ophthalmic abnormalities. Approximately 10,000 people in the United States are diagnosed with Wilson’s disease. 
 Currently approved Wilson’s disease therapies include penicillamine, which has a high rate of serious and sometimes fatal adverse events. Severe adverse effects requiring drug discontinuation of penicillamine occur in approximately 30% of patients. Trientine hydrochloride, currently marketed under the brand name Syprine, is used as therapy for patients intolerant of penicillamine. The currently marketed trientine hydrochloride products require cold storage, potentially impacting patient compliance. Since Wilson’s disease requires lifelong management and as the consequences of discontinuing therapy can be fatal, well-tolerated, effective and convenient therapies are needed. 
 KD034 Development Program for Wilson’s disease
 We are developing a bottled generic 250 mg capsule formulation of trientine hydrochloride that is identical to Syprine. We are also developing a generic 250 mg capsule formulation in a blister packaging that offers room temperature stability, which we believe has the potential to address shortcomings of currently available trientine hydrochloride. 
 We have submitted ANDAs for both formulations of KD034 and are in dialogue with the FDA regarding regulatory approval. We intend to use Kadmon Pharmaceuticals, our specialty‑focused commercial organization, to market these formulations, if approved. 
 Other Clinical Programs 
 KD025 for the Treatment of Moderate to Severe Psoriasis 

Based on clinical data from our completed Phase 2 clinical study of KD025 in psoriasis (KD025-206), in 2016 we initiated a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2 clinical study of KD025 in moderate to severe psoriasis, an autoimmune disease. While enrollment continues in this study, we have prioritized the development of KD025 in the indications of cGVHD and systemic sclerosis.  Tesevatinib for the Treatment of Polycystic Kidney Disease
 Tesevatinib is an oral tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) in development for the treatment of polycystic kidney disease (PKD), a genetic kidney disorder. We are developing tesevatinib to treat autosomal dominant PKD (ADPKD) and autosomal recessive PKD (ARPKD). To date, more than 300 subjects have received at least one dose of tesevatinib for the treatment of ADPKD, cancer or as healthy volunteers in clinical pharmacology studies.
 In 2017, we initiated a randomized, placebo-controlled Phase 2 clinical trial of tesevatinib in ADPKD and a Phase 1 clinical trial of tesevatinib in ARPKD. In 2016, the FDA granted orphan drug designation to tesevatinib for the treatment of patients with ARPKD. These trials are ongoing and continue to enroll patients.

Medical Need: Polycystic Kidney Disease
 PKD is the most prevalent monogenic disease, with approximately 600,000 patients in the United States and 12.5 million patients worldwide, affecting more individuals than all other monogenic diseases combined. There are two forms of the disease: ADPKD, which presents in adulthood, and ARPKD, a rare autosomal recessive form affecting infants. ADPKD and ARPKD demonstrate significant elevation in molecular signaling cascades frequently implicated in cancer cell growth, including EGFR and Src family kinases.

     Our Drug Discovery Platforms  
 Drug Discovery Platforms
 We have two drug discovery platforms that support our pipeline of clinical‑stage product candidates: small molecules and biologics. We are developing novel therapies in the areas of fibrosis, autoimmune disease and immuno-oncology. Research and Development

Research and development expenses consist primarily of costs incurred for the development of our product candidates. For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, we recognized $49.0 million, $40.8 million and $35.8 million, respectively, in research and development expenses. For further detail about our research and development activities, refer to the research and development sections in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Sales and Marketing
 Kadmon Pharmaceuticals is our marketing and sales organization focused on specialty pharmaceuticals. Kadmon Pharmaceuticals markets and distributes products in a variety of therapeutic areas. We do not currently place significant value on our commercial operations from a revenue‑generation standpoint, as revenues from such operations do not currently support our research and development efforts. We leverage our commercial infrastructure to support the development of our clinical-stage product candidates by providing quality assurance, compliance, regulatory and pharmacovigilance among other capabilities. We believe our commercial infrastructure will be most advantageous to us in the future, in connection with the anticipated commercialization of our pipeline product candidates, if approved.
 Kadmon Pharmaceuticals is a fully integrated commercial organization encompassing managed care and specialty pharmacy account directors, experienced regulatory, quality, compliance and CMC teams, marketing experts and sales specialists. Kadmon Pharmaceuticals has long-standing relationships with specialty pharmacies. The specialty pharmacies through which we distribute our products are fully independent of Kadmon. We do not have any ownership interest in or affiliations with any specialty pharmacy, nor do we consolidate the financial results of any specialty pharmacies with our own.
 Investment in MeiraGTx
 On June 12, 2018, MeiraGTx Holdings plc (“MeiraGTx”) completed its initial public offering (the “MeiraGTx IPO”) whereby it sold 5,000,000 shares of common stock at $15.00 per share. Upon completion of the MeiraGTx IPO, we owned approximately 13.0% of MeiraGTx’s issued and outstanding common stock and we no longer have the ability to exert significant influence over MeiraGTx’s operations. We discontinued the equity method of accounting for the investment in MeiraGTx on June 12, 2018 and determined the remaining investment to be an equity security accounted for in accordance with ASC 321. As our investment in MeiraGTx common stock has a readily determinable market value, we recorded an unrealized gain of $40.5 million during the second quarter of 2018 related to the fair value of our ownership of common stock of MeiraGTx. As of December 31, 2018, we owned approximately 12.9% of the issued and outstanding common stock of MeiraGTx, with a fair value of $34.1 million. 
 Strategic Collaborations and License Agreements
 Symphony Evolution, Inc.
 In August 2010, we entered into a license agreement with Symphony Evolution, Inc. (Symphony), under which Symphony granted to us an exclusive, worldwide, royalty‑bearing, sublicensable license under certain Symphony patents, copyrights and technology to develop, make, use, sell, import and export of tesevatinib (formerlyXL647) and the related technology in the field of oncology and non‑oncology.
 We are the licensee of granted patents in Australia, Canada, Europe, Japan and the United States. The patents claim tesevatinib as a composition‑of‑matter, as well as use of tesevatinib to treat certain cancers. A pending U.S. application supports additional composition‑of‑matter claims and methods of synthesis. The last to expire U.S. patent in this family has a term that ends in May 2026 based on a calculated Patent Term Adjustment (PTA) and without regard to any potential Patent Term Extension (PTE), which could further extend the term by an additional five years.
 We are the licensee of a second family of granted patents in China and Europe, as well as applications in Canada, Eurasia, Japan, Taiwan and the United States. These patents and applications disclose the use of tesevatinib to treat PKD. The 

     
9

 
     last to expire U.S. patent in this family would have a term that ends in 2031, though this term could be extended by obtaining a PTA and/or PTE.
 The license agreement includes a series of acquisition and worldwide development milestone payments totaling up to $218.4 million, and $14.1 million of these payments and other fees have been paid as of December 31, 2018. Additionally, the license agreement includes commercial milestone payments totaling up to $175.0 million, none of which have been paid as of December 31, 2018, contingent upon the achievement of various sales milestones, as well as single‑digit sales royalties. The royalty term expires with the last to expire patent.
 Our agreement with Symphony will expire upon the expiration of the last to expire patent within the licensed patents. We may terminate the agreement at any time upon six months written notice to Symphony. Either party may terminate the agreement for any material breach by the other party that is not cured within a specified time period. Symphony may terminate the agreement if we challenge the licensed patents. Either party may terminate the agreement upon the bankruptcy or insolvency of the other party.
 Nano Terra, Inc. 
 In April 2011, in connection with the acquisition of Surface Logix, Inc. (SLx) by Nano Terra, Inc. (Nano Terra), our subsidiary Kadmon Corporation entered into a joint venture with SLx through the formation of NT Life Sciences, LLC (NT Life), whereby Kadmon Corporation contributed $0.9 million at the date of formation in exchange for a 50.0% interest in NT Life. Contemporaneously with our entry into the joint venture, we entered into an exclusive sub-license agreement with NT Life and SLx, under which NT Life granted us rights to certain patents and know-how it licensed from SLx relating to KD025 (formerly SLx-2119). Under this agreement, NT Life granted to us an exclusive, worldwide, royalty-bearing, sublicensable license (under the patents and know how it licensed from SLx) to make, have made, use, sell, offer for sale, import and export certain products, including KD025. NT Life also granted to us a worldwide, non-exclusive, non-transferable, sublicensable license under certain SLx platform technology to make, have made, use, sell, offer for sale, import and export the products.
 The initial purpose of the joint venture with SLx was to develop assets licensed to us from SLx and to define the royalty obligations with respect to certain products not exclusively licensed to us. The joint venture is, however, currently inactive. We expect that the joint venture will become active and develop certain intellectual property in the future.
 Regarding KD025, we are the sublicensee of granted patents in the United States, as well as applications in Australia, Canada, Europe, Japan and the United States, which claim KD025 as a composition‑of‑matter, as well as use of KD025 to treat certain diseases. The last to expire U.S. patent in this family has a term that ends in October 2029 based on a calculated PTA and without regard to any potential PTE, which could further extend the term by an additional five years.
 In consideration for the rights granted to us by NT Life, we agreed to assume certain of Nano Terra’s payment obligations, which are limited to the royalty percentages discussed in this paragraph, under the Agreement and Plan of Merger dated April 8, 2011, by and among Nano Terra, NT Acquisition, Inc., SLx, and Dion Madsen, as the Stockholder Representative of SLx (Merger Agreement). Pursuant to these obligations, we are required to pay to the Stockholder Representative a royalty based on a percentage of net sales of licensed products in the mid‑single digits, subject to specified deductions and adjustments. We are also required to pay to NT Life a 10.0% royalty on the net sales remaining after giving effect to the royalty payment to the Stockholder Representative. Pursuant to the assumption of Nano Terra’s payment obligations, if we further assign or sublicense our rights to any licensed product to certain third parties, we are also required to pay to the Stockholder Representative a portion of any sublicensing revenue relating to such licensed product ranging from the low twenty percents to the low forty percents, subject to specified deductions and adjustments. We are also required to pay to NT Life any remaining sublicensing revenue after giving effect to the foregoing sublicense revenue payment to the Stockholder Representative.
 Unless earlier terminated, our agreement with NT Life will, with respect to a licensed product, end on a country‑by‑country and licensed product‑by‑licensed product basis upon the latest of (a) the expiration or invalidation of the last valid claim of a licensed patent right covering such licensed product in such country and (b) the expiration or termination of payment obligations with respect to such licensed product in such country under the Merger Agreement. The agreement will, with respect to the licensed SLx platform technology, end on a country‑by‑country basis upon the expiration or invalidation of the last valid claim of a licensed patent right covering such SLx platform technology. We may terminate the agreement at any time upon six months’ written notice to NT Life and if we provide such notice, NT Life may accelerate such termination upon thirty days’ prior written notice. Either party may terminate the agreement for any material breach by the other party that is not cured within a specified time period. NT Life may terminate the agreement if we challenge the licensed patents. Either party may terminate the agreement upon the bankruptcy or insolvency of the other party. The agreement shall terminate in the event we are dissolved.

     In addition, the agreement shall terminate on a licensed product‑by‑licensed product basis in the event such licensed product reverts to the Stockholder Representative because of a failure to satisfy the diligence requirements as set forth in the Merger Agreement. More specifically, pursuant to our sub-license agreement with NT Life and SLx, we agreed to assume certain of Nano Terra’s diligence obligations under the Merger Agreement such that we are obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop the licensed products, including KD025. With respect to KD025, our diligence obligations do not expire until the completion of a certain specified Phase 2 clinical trial of KD025 in oncology. If, prior to the expiration of our diligence obligations, we fail to comply with such diligence obligations for any licensed product, including KD025, the Stockholder Representative may require Nano Terra to assign all assets of SLx, including intellectual property, relating to such licensed product to an entity designated by such Stockholder Representative, subject to Nano Terra’s and our rights to contest such assignment. If such an assignment takes place, our sublicense rights to such intellectual property for such licensed product will terminate. 
 If the agreement is terminated, among other things, we will be required to cease all development and commercialization of the licensed products, including KD025, all licenses granted to us will terminate and we are obligated to grant NT Life a perpetual, irrevocable, worldwide, exclusive license under certain intellectual property owned or controlled by us that relate to the licensed products to develop and commercialize such licensed products.
 Dyax Corp. (acquired by Shire Plc in January 2016 and acquired by Takeda Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd in 2018 )
 In July 2011, we entered into a license agreement with Dyax Corp. (“Dyax”) for the rights to use the Dyax Antibody Libraries, Dyax Materials and Dyax Know‑How (collectively “Dyax Property”). The agreement terminated on September 22, 2015, but we had a right to a commercial license of any research target within two years of expiration of the agreement. We exercised this right to a commercial license of two targets in September 2017, resulting in a license fee payable to Shire Plc of $1.5 million, which was recorded to research and development expense for the year end December 31, 2017. The agreement includes the world‑wide, non‑exclusive, royalty‑free, non‑transferable licenses to be used in the research field, without the right to sublicense. Additionally, we have the option to obtain a sublicense for use in the commercial field if any research target is obtained.
 On September 13, 2012 we entered into a separate license agreement with Dyax whereby we obtained from Dyax the exclusive, worldwide license to use research, develop, manufacture and commercialize DX‑2400 in exchange for payment of $0.5 million. All payments associated with this agreement were recorded as research and development expense at the time the agreement was executed. The DX‑2400 license requires the Company to make additional payments contingent on the achievement of certain development milestones (such as receiving certain regulatory approvals and commencing certain clinical trials) and sales targets. None of these targets have been achieved and, as such, no assets or liabilities associated with the milestones have been recorded in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2018. The DX‑2400 license also includes royalty payments commencing on the first commercial sale of any licensed product, which had not occurred as of December 31, 2018 and 2017. On April 2, 2018, we gave notice of our intent to terminate this agreement effective six months from the date of notice and the agreement terminated on October 2, 2018.
 Jinghua Pharmaceutical Group Co., Ltd.
 In November 2015, we entered into a collaboration and license agreement with Jinghua. Under this agreement, we granted to Jinghua an exclusive, royalty‑bearing, sublicensable license under certain of our intellectual property and know‑how to use, develop, manufacture, and commercialize certain monoclonal antibodies in China, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan.
 In partial consideration for the rights granted to Jinghua under the agreement, we received an upfront payment of $10.0 million in the form of an investment in our Class E redeemable convertible membership units. We are eligible to receive from Jinghua a royalty equal to a low double‑digit percentage of net sales of product in the territory. In addition to such payments, we are eligible to receive milestone payments for the achievement of certain development milestones, totaling up to $40.0 million. We earned a $2.0 million milestone payment in March 2016, which was recorded as license and other revenue during the year ended December 31, 2016. We earned a $2.0 million milestone payment in February 2017, which was recorded as license and other revenue during the year ended December 31, 2017. No revenue was recognized for the year ended December 31, 2018. We are also eligible to receive a portion of sublicensing revenue from Jinghua ranging from a percentage in the low double‑digits to the low thirties based on the development stage of a product. No royalty or sublicensing revenue was received from Jinghua during the three years ended December 31, 2018.
 Our agreement with Jinghua will continue on a product‑by‑product and country‑by‑country basis until the later of 10 years after the first commercial sale of the product in such country or the date on which there is no longer a valid claim covering the licensed antibody contained in the product in such country. Either party may terminate the agreement for any 

     
11

 
     material breach by the other party that is not cured within a specified time period or upon the bankruptcy or insolvency of the other party.
 Our Intellectual Property
 The proprietary nature of, and protection for, our product candidates, their methods of use, and our technologies are an important part of our strategy to discover and develop small molecules and biologics that address areas of significant unmet medical needs in inflammatory and fibrotic diseases, genetic diseases, and in the area of immuno‑oncology. We are the owner or exclusive licensee of patents and applications relating to certain of our product candidates, and are pursuing additional patent protection for them and for our other product candidates and technologies. We also rely on trade secrets to protect aspects of our business that are not amenable to, or that we do not consider appropriate for, patent protection. Additionally, we maintain copyrights and trademarks, both registered and unregistered.
 Our success will depend significantly on our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other proprietary protection for commercially important products, product candidates, technologies, inventions and know‑how related to our business and our ability to defend and enforce our patents, preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets and operate without infringing the valid and enforceable patents and proprietary rights of third parties. We also rely on know‑how, continuing technological innovation and in‑licensing opportunities to develop, strengthen and maintain the proprietary position of our development programs. We actively seek to protect our proprietary information, including our trade secrets and proprietary know‑how, by requiring our employees, consultants, advisors and partners to enter into confidentiality agreements and other arrangements upon the commencement of their employment or engagement. The chart below identifies which of our product candidates are covered by patents and patent applications that we own or license, the relevant expiration periods and the major jurisdictions. Additional patent applications have been filed to extend the patent life on some of these products, but there can be no assurance that these will issue as filed.

 Manufacturing and Supply
 We currently do not own or operate manufacturing facilities for the production of our product candidates. We currently outsource to a limited number of external service providers the production of all active pharmaceutical ingredients (API), drug substances and drug products, and we expect to continue to do so to meet the preclinical and clinical requirements of our product candidates. We do not have long‑term agreements with these third parties. We have framework agreements with most of our external service providers, under which they generally provide services to us on a short‑term, 

     
12

 
     project‑by‑project basis. We have long‑term relationships with our manufacturing and supply chain partners for our commercial products.
 Currently, our drug substance or API raw materials for our product candidates can be supplied by multiple source suppliers. Our API drug raw material for our ribavirin portfolio of products is approved to be supplied by a single source, which we believe has the capacity and quality control to meet ongoing demands. We typically order raw materials and services on a purchase order basis and do not enter into long‑term dedicated capacity or minimum supply arrangements.
 Manufacturing is subject to extensive regulations that impose various procedural and documentation requirements, which govern record keeping, manufacturing processes and controls, personnel, quality control and quality assurance, among others. The contract manufacturing organizations that we use to manufacture our product candidates and our ribavirin portfolio are obligated to operate under current Good Manufacturing Practice regulations (cGMP) conditions.
 Competition
 We compete directly with companies that focus on cGVHD, systemic sclerosis, and IPF and companies dedicating their resources to novel forms of therapies for these indications. We also face competition from academic research institutions, governmental agencies and other various public and private research institutions. With the proliferation of new drugs and therapies in these areas, we expect to face increasingly intense competition as new technologies become available. Any product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with existing therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future.
 Many of our competitors have significantly greater financial, manufacturing, marketing, drug development, technical and human resources than we do. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining top qualified scientific and management personnel and establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs.
 The key competitive factors affecting the success of all of our product candidates, if approved, are likely to be their efficacy, safety, dosing convenience, price, the effectiveness of companion diagnostics in guiding the use of related therapeutics, the level of generic competition and the availability of reimbursement from government and other third‑party payors.
 Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer, more effective, less expensive, more convenient or easier to administer, or have fewer or less severe effects than any products that we may develop. Our competitors also may obtain FDA, European Medicines Agency (EMA) or other regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market. Even if our product candidates achieve marketing approval, they may be priced at a significant premium over competitive products if any have been approved by then.
 There are a number of currently marketed therapies and products in late‑stage clinical development to treat cGVHD, systemic sclerosis and IPF, including:
 ﻿

﻿ | | 
-----------------------+-----------------------+----------------------
﻿ | | 
cGVHD | Systemic Sclerosis | IPF

Corticosteroids | Mycophenolate mofetil | 
Calcineurin inhibitors | Cyclosporine | 
Jakafi (Ruxolitinib) | | 

  ﻿
 Certain products in development may provide efficacy, safety, dosing convenience and other benefits that are not provided by currently marketed therapies. As a result, they may provide significant competition for any of our product candidates for which we obtain marketing approval.

     Government Regulation
 Government Regulation and Product Approval
 Government authorities in the United States and in other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture (including manufacturing changes), quality control, approval, labeling, packaging, storage, record‑keeping, promotion, advertising, distribution, marketing, export and import of products such as those we are developing. The processes for obtaining regulatory approvals in the United States and in foreign countries, along with subsequent compliance with applicable statutes and regulations, require the expenditure of substantial resources. U.S. Drug Development Process
 In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (FDCA), and in the case of biologics, also the Public Health Service Act (PHS Act), and various implementing regulations. Most biological products meet the FDCA’s definition of “drug” and are subject to FDA drug requirements, supplemented by biologics requirements.
 Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process, or after approval, may subject an applicant to administrative or judicial sanctions. These sanctions could include the FDA’s refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, a clinical hold, untitled or warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement or civil or criminal penalties. The process required by the FDA before a drug or biologic may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:

· | completion of preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies according to Good Laboratory Practices regulations;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | submission to the FDA of an Investigational New Drug Application (IND), which must become effective before human clinical studies may begin;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | approval by an independent institutional review board (IRB), at each clinical site before each trial may be initiated;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | performance of adequate and well‑controlled human clinical studies according to “good clinical practices” (GCP) regulations, to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug or biologic for its intended use;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | preparation and submission to the FDA of a New Drug Application (NDA) or Biologics License Application (BLA);
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the product, or components thereof, are produced to assess compliance with cGMP to assure that the facilities, methods, and controls are adequate to preserve the drug’s identity, strength, quality, and purity; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | FDA review and approval of the NDA or BLA.
--+-------------------------------------------

  The testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, and we cannot be certain that any approvals for our product candidates will be granted on a timely basis, if at all.
 Once a pharmaceutical or biological product candidate is identified for development, it enters the preclinical testing stage. Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, toxicity, formulation and stability, as well as animal studies. When a sponsor wants to proceed to test the product candidate in humans, it must submit an IND in order to conduct clinical trials.
 An IND sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data and any available clinical data or literature, to the FDA as part of the IND. The sponsor must also include a protocol detailing, among other things, the objectives of the initial clinical study, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated if the initial clinical study lends itself to an efficacy evaluation. Some preclinical testing may continue even after the IND is submitted. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA raises concerns or questions related to a proposed clinical study and places the study on a clinical hold within that 30‑day time period. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical study can begin. Clinical holds also may be imposed by the FDA at any time before or during clinical studies due to safety concerns or non‑compliance, and may be imposed on all product candidates within a certain pharmaceutical class. 

     
14

 
     The FDA also can impose partial clinical holds, for example, prohibiting the initiation of clinical studies of a certain duration or for a certain dose.
 All clinical studies must be conducted under the supervision of one or more qualified investigators in accordance with GCP regulations. These regulations include the requirement that all research subjects provide informed consent in writing before their participation in any clinical study. Further, an IRB must review and approve the plan for any clinical study before it commences at any institution, and the IRB must conduct continuing review and reapprove the study at least annually. An IRB considers, among other things, whether the risks to individuals participating in the clinical study are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB also approves the information regarding the clinical study and the consent form that must be provided to each clinical study subject or his or her legal representative and must monitor the clinical study until completed.
 Each new clinical protocol and any amendments to the protocol must be submitted for FDA review, and to the IRBs for approval. Protocols detail, among other things, the objectives of the clinical study, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria, and the parameters to be used to monitor subject safety.
 Information about certain clinical trials must be submitted within specific timeframes to the National Institutes of Health (NIH), for public dissemination on their ClinicalTrials.gov website.
 Human clinical studies are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined:

· | Phase 1. The product is initially introduced into a small number of healthy human subjects or patients and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution and excretion and, if possible, to gain early evidence on effectiveness. In the case of some products for severe or life‑threatening diseases, especially when the product is suspected or known to be unavoidably toxic, the initial human testing may be conducted in patients. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Phase 2. Involves clinical studies in a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage and schedule. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Phase 3. Clinical studies are undertaken to further evaluate dosage, clinical efficacy and safety in an expanded patient population at geographically dispersed clinical study sites. These clinical studies are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit relationship of the product and provide an adequate basis for product labeling. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical studies must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and safety reports must be submitted to the FDA and the investigators for serious and unexpected suspected adverse events. Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 testing may not be completed successfully within any specified period, if at all. The FDA or the sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical study at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical study at its institution if the clinical study is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients.
 Concurrent with clinical studies, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the product and finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, the manufacturer must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
 United States Review and Approval Processes
 Assuming successful completion of the required clinical testing, the results of product development, preclinical studies and clinical studies, along with descriptions of the manufacturing process, analytical tests conducted on the drug, proposed labeling and other relevant information, are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA for a new drug, or a BLA for a biological drug product, requesting approval to market the product.
 The submission of an NDA or BLA is subject to the payment of a substantial application user fee although a waiver of such fee may be obtained under certain limited circumstances. For example, the agency will waive the application fee for the first human drug application that a small business or its affiliate submits for review. The sponsor of an approved NDA or BLA is also subject to annual product and establishment user fees. For FDA fiscal year 2018 the application fee for an 

     
15

 
     application with clinical data was $2,421,495. Sponsors are also subject to a prescription drug program fee. For fiscal 2018, the prescription drug program fee was $304,162.
 In addition, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act of 2003 (PREA), an NDA or BLA applications (or supplements to applications) for a new active ingredient, new indication, new dosage form, new dosing regimen, or new route of administration must contain data that are adequate to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations, and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective, unless the applicant has obtained a waiver or deferral.
 In 2012, the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act (FDASIA) amended the FDCA to require that a sponsor who is planning to submit a marketing application for a drug or biological product that includes a new active ingredient, new indication, new dosage form, new dosing regimen or new route of administration submit an initial Pediatric Study Plan (PSP), within sixty days of an End‑of‑Phase 2 meeting or as may be agreed between the sponsor and the FDA. The initial PSP must include an outline of the pediatric study or studies that the sponsor plans to conduct, including study objectives and design, age groups, relevant endpoints and statistical approach, or a justification for not including such detailed information, and any request for a deferral of pediatric assessments or a full or partial waiver of the requirement to provide data from pediatric studies along with supporting information. The FDA may, on its own initiative or at the request of the applicant, grant deferrals for submission of data or full or partial waivers. The FDA and the sponsor must reach agreement on the PSP. A sponsor can submit amendments to an agreed‑upon initial PSP at any time if changes to the pediatric plan need to be considered based on data collected from preclinical studies, early phase clinical studies, and/or other clinical development programs.
 The FDA also may require submission of a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) to mitigate any identified or suspected serious risks. The REMS could include medication guides, physician communication plans, assessment plans, and elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries, or other risk minimization tools.
 The FDA reviews all NDAs and BLAs submitted to ensure that they are sufficiently complete for substantive review before it accepts them for filing. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept an application for filing. In this event, the application must be re‑submitted with the additional information. The re‑submitted application also is subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in‑depth substantive review.
 The FDA reviews an NDA to determine, among other things, whether a product is safe and effective for its intended use and whether its manufacturing is cGMP‑compliant. For biologics, the applicant must demonstrate that the product is safe, pure, and potent (interpreted to include effectiveness), and that the facilities designed for its production meet standards to ensure the product will consistently be safe, pure, and potent.
 The FDA may approve an NDA or BLA only if the methods used in, and the facilities and controls used for, the manufacture processing, packing, and testing of the product are adequate to ensure and preserve its identity, strength, quality, and purity. Drug cGMPs are established in 21 C.F.R. Parts 210 and 211, and biologic drug products must meet the drug standards as well as the supplemental requirements in 21 C.F.R. Part 600 et seq.
 Before approving an NDA or BLA, the FDA often will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is or will be manufactured.
 The FDA may refer the NDA or BLA to an advisory committee for review, evaluation and recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. An advisory committee is a panel of experts, including clinicians and other scientific experts, who provide advice and recommendations when requested by the FDA. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations when making decisions.
 Additionally, before approving an NDA or BLA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to ensure that clinical data supporting the submission were developed in compliance with GCP.
 The approval process is lengthy and difficult and the FDA may refuse to approve an NDA or BLA if the applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied, or may require additional clinical data or other data and information. Even if such data and information are submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the NDA or BLA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. Data obtained from clinical studies are not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret data differently than an applicant interprets the same data.


     
16

 
     After the FDA’s evaluation of an application, the FDA may issue an approval letter, or, in some cases, a complete response letter to indicate that the review cycle is complete and that the application is not ready for approval. A complete response letter generally contains a statement of specific conditions that must be met to secure final approval of the application and may require additional clinical or preclinical testing for the FDA to reconsider the application. The deficiencies identified may be minor, for example, requiring labeling changes, or major, for example, requiring additional clinical studies. Additionally, the complete response letter may include recommended actions that the applicant might take to place the application in a condition for approval. If a complete response letter is issued, the applicant may either resubmit the application, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, or withdraw the application or request an opportunity for a hearing.
 Even with submission of additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval. If and when those conditions have been met to the FDA’s satisfaction, the FDA will typically issue an approval letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications.
 If a product receives regulatory approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific diseases and dosages or the indications for use may otherwise be limited, which could restrict the commercial value of the product. Further, the FDA may require that certain contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling. In addition, the FDA may require post‑approval studies, including Phase 4 clinical studies, to further assess safety and effectiveness after approval and may require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products that have been commercialized. After approval, some types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes, and additional labeling claims, are subject to further testing requirements and FDA review and approval.
 ANDAs and Section 505(b)(2) New Drug Applications
 Most drug products obtain FDA marketing approval pursuant to an NDA or BLA (described above) for innovator products, or an ANDA for generic products. Relevant to ANDAs, the Hatch‑Waxman amendments to the FDCA established a statutory procedure for submission and FDA review and approval of ANDAs for generic versions of branded drugs previously approved by the FDA (such previously approved drugs are also referred to as listed drugs). Because the safety and efficacy of listed drugs have already been established by the brand company (sometimes referred to as the innovator), the FDA does not require a demonstration of safety and efficacy of generic products. However, a generic manufacturer is typically required to conduct bioequivalence studies of its test product against the listed drug. The bioequivalence studies for orally administered, systemically available drug products assess the rate and extent to which the API is absorbed into the bloodstream from the drug product and becomes available at the site of action. Bioequivalence is established when there is an absence of a significant difference in the rate and extent for absorption of the generic product and the listed drug. For some drugs (e.g., locally acting drugs like topical anti‑fungals), other means of demonstrating bioequivalence may be required by the FDA, especially where rate and/or extent of absorption are difficult or impossible to measure. In addition to the bioequivalence data, an ANDA must contain patent certifications and chemistry, manufacturing, labeling and stability data.
 The third alternative is a special type of NDA, commonly referred to as a Section 505(b)(2) NDA, which enables the applicant to rely, in part, on the FDA’s findings of safety and efficacy of an existing product, or published literature, in support of its application. Section 505(b)(2) NDAs often provide an alternate path to FDA approval for new or improved formulations or new uses of previously approved products. Section 505(b)(2) permits the filing of an NDA where at least some of the information required for approval comes from studies not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference. The applicant may rely upon the FDA’s findings with respect to certain preclinical or clinical studies conducted for an approved product. The FDA may also require companies to perform additional studies or measurements to support the change from the approved product. The FDA may then approve the new product candidate for all or some of the label indications for which the referenced product has been approved, as well as for any new indication sought by the Section 505(b)(2) applicant.
 In seeking approval for a drug through an NDA, including a 505(b)(2) NDA, applicants are required to list with the FDA certain patents of the applicant or that are held by third parties whose claims cover the applicant’s product. Upon approval of an NDA, each of the patents listed in the application for the drug is then published in the Orange Book. Any subsequent applicant who files an ANDA seeking approval of a generic equivalent version of a drug listed in the Orange Book or a 505(b)(2) NDA referencing a drug listed in the Orange Book must make one of the following certifications to the FDA concerning patents: (1) the patent information concerning the reference listed drug product has not been submitted to the FDA; (2) any such patent that was filed has expired; (3) the date on which such patent will expire; or (4) such patent is invalid or will not be infringed upon by the manufacture, use or sale of the drug product for which the application is submitted. This last certification is known as a paragraph IV certification. A notice of the paragraph IV certification must be provided to each owner of the patent that is the subject of the certification and to the holder of the approved NDA to which the ANDA or 505(b)(2) application refers. The applicant may also elect to submit a “section viii” statement certifying that its 

     
17

 
     proposed label does not contain (or carves out) any language regarding the patented method‑of‑use rather than certify to a listed method‑of‑use patent.
 If the reference NDA holder or patent owners assert a patent challenge directed to one of the Orange Book listed patents within 45 days of the receipt of the paragraph IV certification notice, the FDA is prohibited from approving the application until the earlier of 30 months from the receipt of the paragraph IV certification expiration of the patent, settlement of the lawsuit or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the applicant. The ANDA or 505(b)(2) application also will not be approved until any applicable non‑patent exclusivity listed in the Orange Book for the branded reference drug has expired as described in further detail below. Thus approval of a Section 505(b)(2) NDA or ANDA can be stalled until all the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired, until any non‑patent exclusivity, such as exclusivity for obtaining approval of a new chemical entity, listed in the Orange Book for the referenced product has expired, and, in the case of a Paragraph IV certification and subsequent patent infringement suit, until the earlier of 30 months, settlement of the lawsuit or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the ANDA or Section 505(b)(2) applicant.
 Expedited Programs
 Fast Track Designation
 The FDA has a Fast Track program that is intended to expedite or facilitate the process for reviewing new drugs that meet certain criteria. Specifically, new drugs (including biological drug products) are eligible for Fast Track designation if they are intended to treat a serious or life‑threatening disease or condition for which there is no effective treatment and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the condition. Fast Track designation applies to the combination of the product and the specific indication for which it is being studied. The sponsor of a new drug or biologic may request the FDA to designate the drug or biologic as a Fast Track product concurrently with, or at any time after, submission of an IND, and the FDA must determine if the product candidate qualifies for Fast Track designation within 60 days of receipt of the sponsor’s request.
 The FDA may initiate review of sections of a Fast Track drug’s NDA or BLA before the application is complete. This rolling review is available if the applicant provides, and the FDA approves, a schedule for the submission of each portion of the NDA or BLA and the applicant pays applicable user fees. However, the FDA’s time period goal for reviewing an application does not begin until the last section of the application is submitted. Additionally, the Fast Track designation may be withdrawn by the FDA if the FDA believes that the designation is no longer supported by data emerging in the clinical study process.
 Accelerated Approval
 Under the FDA’s accelerated approval regulations, the FDA may approve a drug or biologic for a serious or life‑threatening illness that fills an unmet medical need, providing a meaningful therapeutic benefit to patients over existing treatments, based upon a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. In clinical studies, a surrogate endpoint is a marker, such as a measurement of laboratory or clinical signs of a disease or condition that is thought to predict clinical benefit, but is not itself a measure of clinical benefit. Surrogate endpoints can often be measured more easily or more rapidly than clinical endpoints. A product candidate approved on this basis is subject to rigorous post‑marketing compliance requirements, including the completion of post‑approval clinical studies sometimes referred to as Phase 4 studies to confirm the effect on the clinical endpoint. Failure to conduct required post‑approval studies, or to confirm a clinical benefit during post‑marketing studies, will allow the FDA to withdraw the product from the market on an expedited basis. All promotional materials for product candidates approved under accelerated approval regulations are subject to prior review by the FDA. Breakthrough Designation
 The FDASIA amended the FDCA to require the FDA to expedite the development and review of a breakthrough therapy. A drug or biologic product can be designated as a breakthrough therapy if it is intended to treat a serious or life‑threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that it may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints. A sponsor may request that a drug or biologic product be designated as a breakthrough therapy concurrently with, or at any time after, the submission of an IND, and the FDA must determine if the product candidate qualifies for breakthrough therapy designation within 60 days of receipt of the sponsor’s request. If so designated, the FDA shall act to expedite the development and review of the product’s marketing application, including by meeting with the sponsor throughout the product’s development, providing timely advice to the sponsor to ensure that the development program to gather preclinical and clinical data is as efficient as practicable, involving senior managers and experienced review staff in a cross‑disciplinary review, assigning a cross‑disciplinary project

     lead for the FDA review team to facilitate an efficient review of the development program and to serve as a scientific liaison between the review team and the sponsor, and taking steps to ensure that the design of the clinical studies is as efficient as practicable.
 Priority Review
 Priority review is granted where there is evidence that the proposed product would be a significant improvement in the safety or effectiveness of the treatment, diagnosis, or prevention of a serious condition. If criteria are not met for priority review, the application is subject to the standard FDA review period of 10 months after the FDA accepts the application for filing. Priority review designation does not change the scientific/medical standard for approval or the quality of evidence necessary to support approval.
 Post‑Approval Requirements
 Drugs and biologics manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to extensive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to recordkeeping (including certain electronic record and signature requirements), periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, advertising and promotion and reporting of certain adverse experiences, deviations, and other problems with the product. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims are subject to prior FDA review and approval. There also are continuing, annual user fee requirements for any marketed products and the establishments at which such products are manufactured, as well as new application fees for supplemental applications with clinical data.
 The FDA strictly regulates labeling, advertising, promotion and other types of information on products that are placed on the market. Products may be promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. Further, manufacturers must continue to comply with cGMP requirements, which are extensive and require considerable time, resources and ongoing investment to ensure compliance. In addition, changes to the manufacturing process generally require prior FDA approval before being implemented and other types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications and additional labeling claims, are also subject to further FDA review and approval.
 Manufacturers and certain other entities involved in the manufacturing and distribution of approved products are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP and other laws. The cGMP requirements apply to all stages of the manufacturing process, including the production, processing, sterilization, packaging, labeling, storage and shipment of the product. Manufacturers must establish validated systems to ensure that products meet specifications and regulatory standards, and test each product batch or lot prior to its release.
 Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated and often require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon the sponsor and any third‑party manufacturers that the sponsor may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance.
 The FDA may impose a number of post‑approval requirements as a condition of approval of an application. For example, the FDA may require post‑marketing testing, including Phase 4 clinical trials, and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product’s safety and effectiveness after commercialization.
 The FDA may withdraw a product approval if compliance with regulatory requirements is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, problems with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in restrictions on the product or even complete withdrawal of the product from the market.
 Potential implications include required revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post‑market studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things:

· | restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | warning letters or holds on post‑approval clinical trials;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------


· | refusal of the FDA to approve pending NDAs/BLAs or supplements to approved NDAs/BLAs, or suspension or revocation of product license approvals;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

· | product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; or
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------

  The FDA strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of products that are placed on the market. Drugs and biologics may be promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off‑label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off‑label uses may be subject to significant liability.
 In addition, the distribution of prescription drugs and biologics is subject to the Prescription Drug Marketing Act (PDMA), which regulates the distribution of the products and product samples at the federal level, and sets minimum standards for the registration and regulation of distributors by the states. Both the PDMA and state laws limit the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical product samples and impose requirements to ensure accountability in distribution.
 From time to time, legislation is drafted, introduced and passed in Congress that could significantly change the statutory provisions governing the approval, manufacturing and marketing of products regulated by the FDA. In addition to new legislation, FDA regulations, guidances and policies are often revised or reinterpreted by the agency in ways that may significantly affect our business and our product candidates. It is impossible to predict whether further legislative or FDA regulation or policy changes will be enacted or implemented and what the impact of such changes, if any, may be.
 Patent Term Restoration
 Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of FDA approval of the use of our product candidates, some of our U.S. patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, commonly referred to as the Hatch‑Waxman Act. The Hatch‑Waxman Act permits a patent restoration term of up to five years as compensation for patent term effectively lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review process. However, patent term restoration cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date. The patent term restoration period is generally one‑half the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of an NDA plus the time between the submission date of an NDA/BLA and the approval of that application, except that the review period is reduced by any time during which the applicant failed to exercise due diligence. Only one patent applicable to an approved drug is eligible for the extension. Extensions are not granted as a matter of right and the extension must be applied for prior to expiration of the patent and within a 60-day period from the date the product is first approved for commercial marketing. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration. In the future, we may apply for Patent Term Extensions, defined as the length of the regulatory review of products covered by our granted patents, for some of our currently owned or licensed applications and patents to add patent life beyond their current expiration dates. Such extensions will depend on the length of the regulatory review; however, there can be no assurance that any such extension will be granted to us. Marketing Exclusivity
 Market exclusivity provisions under the FDCA can also delay the submission or the approval of certain applications. The specific scope varies, but fundamentally the FDCA provides a five‑year period of non‑patent marketing exclusivity within the United States to the first applicant to gain approval of an NDA for a new chemical entity. A drug is a new chemical entity if the FDA has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the action of the drug substance. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not accept for review an ANDA or a 505(b)(2) NDA submitted by another company for another version of such drug where the applicant does not own or have a legal right of reference to all the data required for approval. However, an application may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non‑infringement. The FDCA also provides three years of marketing exclusivity for an NDA, 505(b)(2) NDA or supplement to an existing NDA if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application, for example, for new indications, dosages or strengths of an existing drug. This three‑year exclusivity covers only the conditions of use associated with the new clinical investigations and does not prohibit the FDA from approving applications for drugs containing the original active agent. Five‑year and three‑year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a full NDA. However, an applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to all of the preclinical studies and adequate and well‑controlled clinical studies necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness.
 Pediatric exclusivity is another type of exclusivity in the United States. Pediatric exclusivity, if granted, provides an additional six months to the term of any existing regulatory exclusivity, including the non‑patent exclusivity periods described above. This six‑month exclusivity may be granted based on the voluntary completion of a pediatric clinical study in accordance with an FDA‑issued “Written Request” for such a clinical study.

     With respect to biologics, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Healthcare and Education Reconciliation Act (collectively, the PPACA) signed into law on March 23, 2010, includes a subtitle called the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 (BPCIA), which created an abbreviated licensure pathway for biological products that are biosimilar to or interchangeable with an FDA‑licensed reference biological product. To date, only one biosimilar has been licensed under the BPCIA in the United States (in September 2015), with many more well into the process for approval. Numerous biosimilars have already been approved in Europe. The FDA has issued several guidance documents outlining an approach to review and approval of biosimilars, although there has been significant litigation and questions over interpretation of such guidelines.
 Biosimilarity, which requires that the product be “highly similar” and there be no clinically significant differences between the biological product and the reference product in terms of safety, purity, and potency, can be shown through analytical studies, animal studies, and a clinical study or studies. Interchangeability requires that a product is biosimilar to the reference product and the product must demonstrate that it can be expected to produce the same clinical results as the reference product in any given patient and, for products that are administered multiple times to an individual, the biologic and the reference biologic may be alternated or switched after one has been previously administered without increasing safety risks or risks of diminished efficacy relative to exclusive use of the reference biologic. However, complexities associated with the larger, and often more complex, structures of biological products, as well as the processes by which such products are manufactured, pose significant hurdles to implementation of the abbreviated approval pathway that are still being worked out by the FDA.
 Under the BPCIA, an application for a biosimilar product may not be submitted to the FDA until four years following the date that the reference product was first licensed by the FDA. In addition, the approval of a biosimilar product may not be made effective by the FDA until 12 years from the date on which the reference product was first licensed. During this 12‑year period of exclusivity, another company may still market a competing version of the reference product if the FDA approves a full BLA for the competing product containing the sponsor’s own preclinical data and data from adequate and well‑controlled clinical trials to demonstrate the safety, purity and potency of their product. The BPCIA also created certain exclusivity periods for biosimilars approved as interchangeable products. At this juncture, it is unclear whether products deemed “interchangeable” by the FDA will, in fact, be readily substituted by pharmacies, which are governed by state pharmacy law.
 The BPCIA is complex and only beginning to be interpreted and implemented by the FDA. In addition, recent government proposals have sought to reduce the 12‑year reference product exclusivity period. Other aspects of the BPCIA, some of which may impact the BPCIA exclusivity provisions, have also been the subject of recent litigation. As a result, the ultimate impact, implementation, and meaning of the BPCIA is subject to significant uncertainty.
 Orphan Designation and Exclusivity
 Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan drug designation to drugs (including biological drug products) intended to treat a rare disease or condition—generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States or that affects more than 200,000 individuals in the United States and for which there is no reasonable expectation that costs of research and development of the drug for the indication can be recovered by sales of the drug in the United States. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an NDA or BLA.
 After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the generic identity of the drug and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process. The first applicant to receive FDA approval for a particular active ingredient to treat a particular disease or condition with FDA orphan drug designation is entitled to a seven‑year exclusive marketing period in the United States for that product, for that indication. Among the other benefits of orphan drug designation are tax credits for certain research and a waiver of the NDA/BLA application user fee.
 During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same disease or condition, except in limited circumstances, such as if the second applicant demonstrates the clinical superiority of its product to the product with orphan drug exclusivity through a demonstration of superior safety, superior efficacy, or a major contribution to patient care, or if the manufacturer of the product with orphan exclusivity is not able to assure sufficient quantities of the product. “Same drug” means a drug that contains the same identity of the active moiety if it is a drug composed of small molecules, or of the principal molecular structural features if it is composed of macromolecules and is intended for the same use as a previously approved drug, except that if the subsequent drug can be shown to be clinically superior to the first drug, it will not be considered to be the same drug. Drug exclusivity does not prevent the FDA from approving a different drug for the same disease or condition, or the same drug for a different disease or condition.

     Pharmaceutical Coverage, Pricing and Reimbursement
 In the United States, sales of Ribasphere RibaPak and any products for which we may receive regulatory approval for commercial sale will depend in part on the availability of coverage and reimbursement from third‑party payors. Third‑party payors include government authorities, managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations.
 Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any products for which we may obtain regulatory approval. The process for determining whether a payor will provide coverage for a biologic or drug may be separate from the process for setting the reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the product. Some of the additional requirements and restrictions on coverage and reimbursement levels imposed by third‑party payors influence the purchase of healthcare services and products. Third‑party payors may limit coverage to specific biologics and drugs on an approved list, or formulary, which might not include all of the FDA‑approved biologics or drugs for a particular indication, or place biologics and drugs at certain formulary levels that result in lower reimbursement levels and higher cost‑sharing obligation imposed on patients. Moreover, a payor’s decision to provide coverage for a drug product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Adequate third‑party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development. Further, one payor’s determination to provide coverage does not assure that other payors will also provide coverage and reimbursement for the product, and the level of coverage and reimbursement may differ significantly from payor to payor.
 Third‑party payors are increasingly challenging the price and examining the medical necessity and cost‑effectiveness of medical products and services, in addition to their safety and efficacy. In order to obtain and maintain coverage and reimbursement for any product that might be approved for sale, we may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost‑effectiveness of any products, in addition to the costs required to obtain regulatory approvals. Our product candidates may not be considered medically necessary or cost‑effective. If third‑party payors do not consider a product to be cost‑effective compared to other available therapies, they may not cover the product after approval as a benefit under their plans or, if they do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow a company to sell its products at a profit.
 The U.S. government and state legislatures have shown significant interest in implementing cost containment programs to limit the growth of government‑paid healthcare costs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and coverage and requirements for substitution of generic products for branded prescription drugs. Adoption of government controls and measures, and tightening of restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could exclude or limit our drugs and product candidates from coverage and limit payments for pharmaceuticals.
 In addition, we expect that the increased emphasis on managed care and cost containment measures in the United States by third‑party payors and government authorities to continue and will place pressure on pharmaceutical pricing and coverage. Coverage policies and third‑party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which we receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.

     Other Healthcare Laws and Compliance Requirements
 Healthcare providers, physicians, and third‑party payors often play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of any currently marketed products and product candidates for which we may obtain marketing approval. Our current and future arrangements with healthcare providers, physicians, third‑party payors and customers, and our sales, marketing and educational activities, may expose us to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations (at the federal and state level) that may constrain our business or financial arrangements and relationships through which we market, sell and distribute our products for which we obtain marketing approval.
 In addition, we may be subject to patient privacy regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. The laws that govern certain of our operations include the following, but are not limited to:

a) | federal and state laws relating to the Medicare and Medicaid programs and any other federal healthcare program;
---+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


b) | federal and state laws relating to healthcare fraud and abuse, including, without limitation, the federal Anti-Kickback Statute (42 U.S.C. § 1320a-7b(b)), the federal False Claims Act (31 U.S.C. §§ 3729 et seq.), the False Statements Statute, (42 U.S.C. § 1320a-7b(a)), the Exclusion Laws (42 U.S.C. § 1320a-7), the federal Physician Payment Sunshine Act (42 U.S.C. § 1320a-7h), the Drug Supply Chain Security Act (21 U.S.C. § 351 et seq.), the Anti-Inducement Statute (42 U.S.C. § 1320a-7a(a)(5)), the Civil Monetary Penalties Law (42 U.S.C. § 1320a-7a) and criminal laws relating to healthcare fraud and abuse, including but not limited to 18 U.S.C. §§ 286, 287 and 1001, and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, (Pub.L. 104-191);
---+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


c) | state laws relating to Medicaid or any other state healthcare or health insurance programs;
---+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


d) | federal or state laws relating to billing or claims for reimbursement submitted to any third party payor, employer or similar entity, or patient;
---+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


e) | any other federal or state laws relating to fraudulent, abusive or unlawful practices connected in any way with the provision or marketing of healthcare items or services, including laws relating to the billing or submitting of claims for reimbursement for any items or services reimbursable under any state, federal or other governmental healthcare or health insurance program or any private payor; and
---+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


f) | federal and state laws relating to health information privacy and security, including HIPAA, and any rules or regulations promulgated thereunder, and the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, enacted as part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 and any regulations promulgated thereunder.
---+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the health regulatory laws described above or any other laws that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including criminal and significant civil monetary penalties, damages, fines, imprisonment, exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs, injunctions, recall or seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production, denial or withdrawal of pre‑marketing product approvals, private qui tam actions brought by individual whistleblowers in the name of the government or refusal to allow us to enter into supply contracts, including government contracts and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations.
 Foreign Regulation of Drugs and Biologics
 In order to market any product outside of the United States, we will need to comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other countries and jurisdictions regarding development, approval, commercial sales and distribution of our products, and governing, among other things, clinical trials, marketing authorization, commercial sales and distribution of our products, if approved. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain the necessary approvals by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries before we can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. The approval process varies between countries and jurisdictions and can involve additional product testing and additional administrative review periods. The time required to obtain approval in other countries and jurisdictions might differ from and be longer than that required to obtain FDA approval. Regulatory approval in one country or jurisdiction does not ensure regulatory approval in another, but a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country or jurisdiction may negatively impact the regulatory process in others. Employees
 As of December 31, 2018, we employed 116 people, including 66 in research and development, 15 in commercial operations and 35 in a general and administrative capacity, including executive officers. We also engage a number of

     temporary employees and consultants. None of our employees is represented by a labor union with respect to his or her employment with us. We have not experienced any work stoppages, and we consider our relations with our employees to be good.
 Facilities
 Our corporate headquarters are located in New York, New York, and consist of approximately 35,771 square feet of space under a lease that expires in October, 2025. In addition, we also have locations in Warrendale, Pennsylvania; Cambridge, Massachusetts and Monmouth Junction, New Jersey. We believe that our facilities are adequate for our current needs and for the foreseeable future. Corporate Information
