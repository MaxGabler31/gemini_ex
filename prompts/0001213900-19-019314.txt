Item 1. Business
GENERAL BUSINESS OVERVIEW
 
Our business address is 1291-B NW 65th Place, Fort Lauderdale, FL 33309. Our Internet website address is www.imds.com. The information contained in, or that can be accessed through, our website is not part of this Form 10-K annual report.
 
Imaging Diagnostic Systems, Inc. (“IDSI”) is a late development stage medical technology company that has developed a new, non-invasive CT scanner (“CTLM®”) that uses a laser beam in place of ionizing X-ray for breast imaging. This technology is called Diffuse Optical Tomography. The CTLM® will provide an adjunctive imaging modality to other methods of imaging the breast such as X-ray mammography, MRI and ultrasound.
 
Since inception in December 1993 as a Florida corporation and subsequently its reverse merger with Alkan Corp., a New Jersey Corporation on April 14, 1994, we continued operations and changed our state of incorporation from New Jersey to Florida, effective July 1, 1995. On July 14, 1995, we filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) a Form 10 SB for registration of our securities as a small business issuer. The Form 10 SB was declared effective in September 1995 and our stock began trading on the OTC Bulletin Board (OTC:BB) on September 20, 1995 under the symbol IMDS. We became a fully reporting company under Commission File Number 0-26028 and traded on the OTC:BB and then on the OTC:QB and ultimately on the OTC PINK until September 25, 2014, at which time our registration was revoked by the SEC for failure to timely file our required periodic reports. Our latest quarterly report on Form 10-Q that was filed prior to our filing of our Form 10 registration statement on August 28, 2018, was filed on May 15, 2013, for the quarter ended March 31, 2013. Our last annual report on Form 10-K was filed on October 15, 2012, for the year ended June 30, 2012. Copies of our SEC reports through the date of revocation (the “Prior Reports”) are available at www.sec.gov.
 
On August 28, 2018, we filed a Form 10 registration statement to register issued and outstanding shares held by our shareholders and to become a fully reporting company under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”). The Form 10 was amended in response to SEC comments on October 5, 2018 and November 14, 2018. On February 7, 2019, the SEC confirmed that it had no further comments on the Form 10. Under the Exchange Act, our registration became effective on October 29, 2018, i.e. 60 days after filing the Form 10. The Form 10 was further amended on September 26, 2019 to correct the classification of the Series L Convertible Preferred Stock from a current liability to temporary equity.
 
As of the date of this annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2019, we have had no substantial revenues from our operations and have incurred net losses applicable to common shareholders since inception through June 30, 2019 of $133,062,606 after discounts and dividends on preferred stock. We incurred net losses applicable to common shareholders of $1,677,662 for the year ended June 30, 2019 and $2,203,400 for the year ended June 30, 2018. The Company received marking clearance for the CTLM® from the Chinese FDA (“CFDA”) effective November 16, 2018 to November 15, 2023 as disclosed in the Company’s 8-K report filed December 11, 2018; however we anticipate that substantial losses from operations will continue until we begin to generate revenues through the sales of CTLM® systems in China. We believe that we face substantial delays before receiving marketing clearance through the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”). These losses will be primarily due to an anticipated increase in marketing, manufacturing and operational expenses associated with the international commercialization of the CTLM®, expenses associated with international commercialization of the CTLM®, expenses associated with FDA approval processes, and the costs associated with advanced product development activities. We have implemented a new business strategy which includes a licensing agreement on June 20, 2017 with Xi’an IDI Laser Imaging Co. Ltd (Xi’an IDI), a related party, to shift manufacturing of the CTLM® for the China and Asian markets to China.
 
The Company’s next regulatory focus, after having obtained CFDA approval in China, is on obtaining marketing clearance of its CTLM® Breast Imaging System through the FDA. The premarket approval (“PMA”) process for U.S. marketing clearance is expected to take longer than the Chinese process, and we intend to resume this effort after successful marketing and sales of CTLM® systems in China. Sales revenues in China are not expected until the second or third quarter of fiscal 2020. No sales in other countries are expected in the near future, as we do not intend to pursue sales in other countries until after obtaining FDA marketing clearance.
 
In analyzing the regulatory path forward, timeline, and costs associated with the level of effort required to upgrade our Quality Management System, we have decided not to renew our CE mark (required for sales in the European Union) for this year and to consider reapplying in 2 to 3 years to avoid substantial regulatory fees. We will maintain our ISO 13485:2016 certification which will allow us to pursue FDA marketing clearance and the CE Mark in the future.

SALE OF UNREGISTERED SECURITIES RESULTING IN A CHANGE OF CONTROL
 
IDSI’s financial condition steadily deteriorated following the 2008 financial crisis and during the subsequent recession and weak economic recovery and by 2013 we found it impossible to raise the capital needed to continue operations, so our focus turned to finding an acquirer with the substantial financial resources and technical understanding required to complete the regulatory approval processes and bring the CTLM® to market domestically and internationally. Given our dire financial condition, we were fortunate to be introduced in February 2014 to Viable International Investments LLC (“Viable”), a subsidiary of Sanya Wanbo (Viable) Investments, Ltd. Co (“Viable China”), registered in Sanya, Hainan, China. Viable China had been approved by the Ministry of Commerce of the People’s Republic of China (Certificate # 4600201400025) to invest in senior housing projects, medical equipment projects, etc. in the U.S.
 
On August 4, 2014, pursuant to a Securities Purchase Agreement (the “SPA”) dated as of June 27, 2014, among IDSI, Viable and certain affiliates of IDSI, Viable agreed to purchase 600 shares of the Company’s Series M convertible preferred stock (the “Preferred Stock”) for an aggregate purchase price of $6,000,000 ($10,000 per share) of which $100,000 was paid pursuant to a non-refundable deposit on June 27, 2014. The first closing as to 250 shares of Preferred Stock ($2,500,000) occurred on August 4, 2014.
 
Pursuant to the SPA, Viable agreed to purchase an additional 350 shares of Preferred Stock in tranches of 200 shares ($2,000,000) on July 31, 2015, and 150 shares ($1,500,000) within 14 days after IDSI’s receipt of FDA marketing clearance. Based on the conversion price of the Preferred Stock, purchase of all of the Preferred Stock would provide Viable with beneficial ownership of 90% of our common stock based on the number of shares outstanding as of the date of the SPA. IDSI and Viable agreed to modify the timing of the second and third tranches of Viable’s investments so that the purchase of 200 shares of Preferred Stock ($2,000,000) closed on August 31, 2015, and the purchase of 150 shares of Preferred Stock ($1,500,000) closed on April 22, 2016, as Viable waived the condition of FDA marketing clearance.
 
Since 2016, we have financed our operations through loans by Viable and its affiliates and the private placement of common stock to Viable affiliates and independent Chinese investors. We do not have any formal financing arrangements with Viable and its affiliates; however, Viable has stated its intention to continue to provide financing of our operations consistent with past practice. While we believe that Viable and its affiliates will provide on commercially reasonable terms the funding we need until we achieve a positive cash flow from operations. there can be no assurance that we will receive such funding or that we will ever achieve profitability. If Viable fails to provide the anticipated funding, we would be materially adversely affected and may have to cease operations due to a lack of funding.
 
HISTORICAL OVERVIEW
 
Since inception, we have been engaged in the development and testing of a laser breast imaging system that uses computed tomography and laser techniques designed to detect breast abnormalities. Our CTLM® has been initially commercialized on a limited basis in certain international markets where regulatory approvals have been obtained; however, it is not yet approved for sale in the U.S. market. The CTLM® system must obtain marketing clearance through the FDA before commercialization can begin in the U.S. market.
 
We have sold 26 CTLM® systems since inception. Since the Viable Acquisition in August 2014, we have ceased our international marketing effort and have focused on upgrading the CTLM® with the latest technology and obtaining marketing clearance in the U.S. and China. CTLM® version 2.0 was completed in 2016, and we are developing a CTLM® 3.0 prototype, which we believe will be ready for verification and validation testing in the first or second quarter of 2020.

The Company received CTLM® CFDA approval effective November 16, 2018 to November 15, 2023 as disclosed in the Company’s 8-K report filed on December 11, 2018. However, there can be no assurance that we will obtain FDA marketing or other new international marketing clearances, that the CTLM® will achieve market acceptance or that sufficient revenues will be generated from sales of the CTLM® to allow us to operate profitably.
 
Sales in China are not expected until late 2019 or early 2020. No sales in other countries are expected in the foreseeable future. The Company’s next focus, after having obtained CFDA approval in China, is on obtaining U.S. marketing clearance of its CTLM® Breast Imaging System through the FDA. The PMA process for U.S. marketing clearance is expected to take considerably longer than the Chinese process.
 
In analyzing the regulatory path forward, timeline, and costs associated with the level of effort required to upgrade the Company’s Quality Management System, we have decided not to renew our CE mark (required for sales in the European Union) for this year and to consider reapplying in 2 to 3 years to avoid these regulatory fees. We will maintain our ISO 13485:2016 certification which will allow us to pursue FDA marketing clearance and the CE Mark in the future.
 
Our financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern. Our auditors, in their report for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019 stated that we have incurred recurring operating losses and will have to obtain additional capital to sustain operations. These conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Management’s plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 2 “Going Concern and Management’s Plans”, in the Notes to the Financial Statements. The accompanying financial statements for the Fiscal Year ended June 30, 2019 do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that may result from the outcome of this uncertainty.
 
BREAST CANCER
 
Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women worldwide. According to the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) and World Health Organization (WHO). It is estimated that more than 1.68 million new cases of breast cancer occurred among women worldwide in 2012, (using the most recent data available at time of submission) or up to 12% of all cancers. Breast cancer incidence rates around the world vary a great deal. In general, developed countries (such as the U.S., England and Australia) have higher rates than developing countries (such as Cambodia, Nepal and Rwanda).
 
According to information provided by www.breastcancer.org, about one in eight U.S. women will develop invasive breast cancer over the course of her lifetime. In 2019, an estimated 268,600 new cases of invasive breast cancer are expected to be diagnosed in women in the U.S., along with 62,930 new cases of non-invasive (in situ) breast cancer. About 41,760 women in the U.S. are expected to die in 2019 from breast cancer, though death rates have been decreasing since 1989. Women under 50 have experienced larger decreases. These decreases are thought to be the result of treatment advances, earlier detection through screening, and increased awareness.
 
There is widespread agreement that screening for breast cancer, when combined with appropriate follow-up, will reduce mortality from the disease. How we measure response to treatment is called the 5-year survival rate, or the percentage of people who live 5 years after being diagnosed with cancer. According to information provided by National Cancer Institute, Cancer stage at diagnosis, which refers to extent of a cancer in the body, determines treatment options and has a strong influence on the length of survival. In general, if the cancer is found only in the part of the body where it started it is localized (sometimes referred to as stage 1). If it has spread to a different part of the body, the stage is regional or distant. The earlier female breast cancer is caught, the better chance a person has of surviving five years after being diagnosed. For female breast cancer, 62.5% are diagnosed at the local stage. The 5-year survival for localized female breast cancer is 98.8%. It decreases from 98.8% to 85.5% after the cancer has spread to the lymph nodes (stage 2), and to 27.4% (stage 4) after it has spread to other organs such as the lung, liver or brain. A major problem with current detection methods is that studies have shown that mammography does not detect 10%-20% of breast cancers that are detected by physical exam alone, which may be attributed to a falsely negative mammogram.
 
Breast cancer screening is generally recommended as a routine part of preventive healthcare for women over the age of 20 (approximately 90 million in the United States). Besides skin cancer, breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer among U.S. women. For these women, the American Cancer Society (ACS) has published guidelines for breast cancer screening including: (i) monthly breast self-examinations for all women over the age of 20; (ii) a clinical breast exam (CBE) every three years for women in their 20s and 30s; (iii) a baseline mammogram for women by the age of 40; and (iv) an annual mammogram for women age 40 or older (according to the American College of Radiology). Unfortunately, the U.S. Preventive Task Force Guidelines have stirred confusion by recommending biennial screening mammography for women ages 50-74.

Each year, approximately eight million women in the United States require diagnostic testing for breast cancer due to a physical symptom, such as a palpable lesion, pain or nipple discharge, discovered through self or physical examination (approximately seven million) or a non-palpable lesion detected by screening x-ray mammography (approximately one million). Once a physician has identified a suspicious lesion in a woman’s breast, the physician may recommend further diagnostic procedures, including a diagnostic x-ray mammography, an ultrasound study, a magnetic resonance imaging procedure, or a minimally invasive procedure such as fine needle aspiration or large core needle biopsy. In each case, the potential benefits of additional diagnostic testing must be balanced against the costs, risks and discomfort to the patient associated with undergoing the additional procedures.
 
Breast cancer can be lumped into Non-invasive (or in-situ) or Invasive: In-situ tissue types include ductal carcinoma in-situ (DCIS) or lobular carcinoma in-situ (LCIS). 20% of breast cancers are in-situ. 80% of breast cancers are invasive or infiltrating beyond their glandular or ductal origins. Breast cancers are subdivided by molecular surface markers or hormonal receptor types that determines aggressiveness, and selection for therapeutic options. To be brief, these subtypes are: 1. Luminal A (HR+/HER2-); 2. Triple Negative (HR-/HER2-); 3. Luminal B (HR+/HER2+); and 4. HER 2 Enriched (HR-/HER2+).
 
The strongest risk factor for breast cancer is a women’s age. A woman’s breast cancer risk increases with age. The risk of breast cancer, however, is not the same for all women in a given age group. Research has shown that women with mammographically dense breasts have a higher risk of developing breast cancer. Connective and glandular tissue of the breast are mammographically dense and appear white on a mammogram, compared to fatty tissue of the breasts which appears dark or black because it is not mammographically dense. Women who have a high percentage of breast tissue that appears dense on a mammogram have a higher risk of breast cancer compared to women of similar age who have a smaller percentage or no dense breast tissue by as much as 1.5 X higher risk than the average woman. In general, younger women have dense breasts more often than older women. As a woman ages, the amount of glandular tissue naturally decreases and the amount of fatty tissue increases. Abnormalities - such as tumors in dense breasts - can be more difficult to detect on a mammogram because tumors often also appear white, which blends with dense breast stroma. According to the National Cancer Institute and American College of Radiology, approximately 50% of women in the U.S. are classified as having dense breasts (or BI-RADS type 3 or type 4 - defined as heterogeneously dense or extremely dense).
 
Due in part to the limitations in the ability of the currently available modalities to identify malignant lesions, a large number of patients with suspicious lesions proceed to surgical biopsy, an invasive and expensive procedure. Approximately 1.6 million surgical biopsies are performed each year in the United States, and about 20% of the tests find cancer. The average cost of a surgical biopsy ranges from approximately $1,000 – 5,000 per procedure. Thus, biopsies of benign breast tissue may cost the U.S. healthcare system approximately $5.28 billion annually, using $3,303 per biopsy which is what a patient’s insurance company would pay according to HealthCareBlueBook.com. Fair Prices for a breast biopsy depend on one’s zip code in the U.S. and are rated based upon being a bedside, open, MRI-guided, Stereotactic-guided, or Ultrasound-guided biopsy. In addition, biopsies result in pain, scarring, potential for infection and sometimes undue anxiety to patients. Patients who are referred to biopsy usually are required to schedule the procedure in advance and generally must wait up to 72 hours for their biopsy results.
 
Race and ethnicity play into the incidence and the mortality from breast cancer. According to the American Cancer Society, incidence and death rates for breast cancer are higher among non-Hispanic Whites and non-Hispanic Blacks rather than other racial/ethnic groups. Asians and Pacific Islander women have the lowest incidence and death rates from breast cancer.
 
Since the CTLM® has received CFDA marketing clearance in China, we believe the CLTM® will achieve significant market penetration in China. Consequently, it is important to discuss the demographics of breast cancer in China. Breast cancer is the most common cancer among women in China, according to the latest data from China’s national cancer registry. An analysis of the data reveals that the incidence of breast cancer in China has increased at a rate of around 3.5% a year from 2000 to 2013, compared with a drop of 0.4% a year over the same period in the US. The analysis also reveals that breast cancer rates are higher in urban areas of China than in rural areas. And the higher the population density, the higher the rate. For small cities (population below 500,000), the incidence of breast cancer is 30 per 100,000. For medium-sized cities (population between 500,000 to 1,000,000), it is 40 in 100,000. And for large cities (population above 1m), the incidence rate is 60 per 100,000 women.

There are many theories as to why China is seeing a marked rise in breast cancer rates. These include:
 
a. With the rapid development of China’s economy, more and more people have moved from rural areas and towns to large cities. As a result, many “megacities” have sprung up. By 2014, China had six megacities with populations above 10m. It is very likely that urbanization is having a big impact on breast cancer incidence in China.
 
b. Having more than one child lowers breast-cancer risk. With the one-child policy in place since 1979, most women – especially if they worked in the city – had to strictly follow the policy in order to avoid being fined. Although the one-child policy rule was replaced in 2015 with a two-child policy rule, the possible benefit on breast cancer incidence will probably take 15 to 20 years to show
 
c. Women are also less likely to breastfeed than previous generations, which may be another contributing factor. Research has shown that both pregnancy and breastfeeding reduce a woman’s risk of developing cancer, because they reduce the lifetime number of menstrual cycles. As a result, women are exposed to less estrogen. (estrogen can stimulate breast cancer cells to grow.) It has also been hypothesized that breast cells need to mature in order to produce milk and mature cells are more resistant to becoming cancer cells.
 
d. In modern China, women are generally less physically active than they were in previous generations. A study published in the International Journal of Behavioral Nutrition and Physical Activity, shows that levels of physical activity for adults in China fell by nearly half between 1991 and 2011, and they declined more rapidly for women than for men.
 
e. Aging is the biggest risk factor for breast cancer. Women are living longer in China, which is a key factor related to the increased incidence of breast cancer in the country. As people get older, there is more genetic damage and less ability to repair the damage.
 
With increasing incidence and mortality, cancer is the leading cause of death in China and is a major public health problem. Because of China’s massive population (1.37 billion), previous national incidence and mortality estimates have been limited to small samples of the population using data from the 1990s or based on a specific year. With high-quality data from an additional number of population-based registries now available through the National Central Cancer Registry of China, the authors analyzed data from 72 local, population-based cancer registries (2009-2011), representing 6.5% of the population, to estimate the number of new cases and cancer deaths for 2015. Data from 22 registries were used for trend analyses (2000-2011). The results indicated that an estimated 4,292,000 new cancer cases and 2,814,000 cancer deaths would occur in China in 2015, with lung cancer being the most common incident cancer and the leading cause of cancer death. Exact details on breast cancer incidence and rates can be found in the journals Thoracic Cancer 8; 2017, pages 214-218 and the Journal of Gynecological Oncology 2018, Jan; 29 (1).
 
Because of China’s large population, even with a small percentage improvement on cancer prevention, a sizeable number of women’s lives could be saved. There are many risk factors that can be reduced by raising cancer awareness and having better education on diet, exercise, stress reduction as well as improving breast cancer screening. Public health authorities in China can play a crucial role in developing well-defined strategies to tackle the issue and reduce the breast cancer burden in China.
 
SCREENING AND DIAGNOSTIC MODALITIES
 
Mammography is an x-ray imaging modality commonly used for both routine breast cancer screening and as a diagnostic tool. A mammogram produces either film-screen (analog) or electronic digital images of the internal structure of the breast, nipple, axilla and surrounding tissues. In a screening mammogram, physicians seek to detect unknown or asymptomatic lesions, while a diagnostic mammogram seeks to characterize suspicious or palpable lesions.
 
In the United States, a certified technologist performs the x-ray procedure under the Congressional Mammography Quality Standards Act (MQSA). MQSA was enacted to improve x-ray breast cancer detection studies by regulating machine specifications, quality control procedures, technologist training and certification, and Radiologist training, certification, and triennial continuing medical education. Still, mammography is viewed as an ‘imperfect’ breast cancer detection tool and is often supplemented with follow-up studies including additional mammographic views at later dates, closer physical examination of the patient, adjunctive ultrasound exams, and, when available, breast MRI, scintimammography, and/or biopsy.

Because x-ray mammography exposes the patient to radiation, the American Cancer Society recommends that mammograms be limited to once per year. X-ray mammography is documented to be less effective for women with dense breasts. X-ray mammography machines use mechanical means to squeeze, flatten, or compress the breast and reduce the volume so that x-rays may penetrate more uniform tissue. These techniques are technically necessary but are sometimes painful and often uncomfortable to patients. Most mammography exams include 2 views of each breast which equates to 4 compressions per session or up to 8 compressions in women with bilateral breasts prostheses. For diagnostic purposes, some centers are using contrast-enhanced mammography as a way to assess for tumors that take up iodinated contrast, increasing sensitivity.
 
For an uninsured patient, the average U.S. cost for a mammogram is $102. The Medicare billing of a diagnostic mammogram is approximately $118 to $138 per procedure and requires the use of x-ray equipment ranging in cost from $75,000 to $225,000 for film screen. Aggregate cost of mammography screening in the U.S. is recently estimated at $7.8 billion per year.
 
Digital Mammography
 
Digital mammography, also referred to as “full-field digital” mammography, is the latest form of breast x-ray examination. These systems eliminate the use of x-ray film and record images directly on electronic panels. The digital images can then be manipulated, examined on an electronic viewing station, and subjected to computed added detection or CAD. However, the limitations of conventional mammography still exist in digital mammography. Digital mammograms can be acquired as 2D or 3D, using breast tomosynthesis. Although 3D mammograms are better at detecting more abnormalities (especially in denser breasted women), they do results in higher recall rates, twice the breast radiation dose, take longer for the Radiologist to read, and cost the patient and system more money. The “miss rate” from using 3D mammograms has yet to be established. Many U.S. insurance companies still will not cover a 3D digital mammogram. Digital mammography units sell at around $300,000 for 2D digital units and up to $500,000 for 3D digital units and Medicare billing for these tests range from $170 to $200.
Magnetic Resonance Imaging
 
Magnetic resonance imaging (“MRI”) produces images using a magnetic field and radiofrequency (RF) gradients under computer control to produce multiplanar and multi-sequenced images that are sensitive to detecting a variety of pathologic processes. MRI has proven effective in imaging breasts with prosthetic implants, characterizing benign breast processes, detecting primary or recurrent cancer, evaluating the response to chemotherapy and serving as an additional imaging option when mammography or ultrasound fails to provide sufficient diagnostic conclusions.
 
MRI offers the advantage over x-ray that not only visualizes fine details in breast tissue but also detects patterns of enhancement, altered blood flow and angiogenesis associated with malignancies, by using a paramagnetic agent called gadolinium (which must be injected into the patient’s veins and sometimes requires screening for renal insufficiency). The disadvantages are that MRI systems are not widely available in the global market and the costs of using conventional MRI scanners for breast exams are sometimes prohibitive. Dedicated breast MRI systems sell for approximately $1,200,000 and total billing is approximately $1,500, depending on whether the service is provided in a free-standing imaging center, hospital, and is billed either self-pay, private insurance or Medicare.
 
Ultrasound
 
Ultrasound imaging is routinely used in breast imaging practices. Ultrasound (U/S) systems can image breast tissue by ‘sonar’ techniques. Sound transducers are placed directly on breast tissue coupled with an acoustic gel substance. Trained sonographers locate suspicious or targeted areas by moving the transducer over the whole breast or over the region of interest. Breast ultrasound can be performed by a trained medical professional or it can also be done in an automated fashion. Sonographers generally acquire images in the United States. In some countries mostly outside the U.S., physicians directly perform the study and interpret the results. Ultrasound images are localized to areas of suspicion generally but not always detected by a previous mammogram. If mammographic results suggest the presence of a lesion, ultrasound may help differentiate a solid from a cystic mass, determine vascularity, concurrent adenopathy, and locate a safe biopsy access site. The global Medicare reimbursement rate for diagnostic bilateral breast ultrasound is approximately $164 per procedure and requires the use of capital equipment ranging in cost from approximately $60,000 to $400,000 depending upon unit hardware configuration, software platforms, and transducer selections.

Optoacoustic Imaging
 
This patented technology uses a combination of anatomic and functional imaging via the use of laser optics and conventional ultrasound. Optoacoustic imaging looks for tumor angiogenesis. The main company in this field - Seno Medical Instruments (“Seno”) - uses proprietary laser techniques to locate oxyhemoglobin and deoxyhemoglobin signatures in breast tumors and these patterns can help clinicians decide which tumors to target for biopsy. This device, which is undergoing Pre-Market Approval and clinical pivotal studies, appears to be close to FDA approval.
Single-Breath Photoacoustic Computed Tomography
 
This new modality called BH-PACT, similar to CTLM® discussed below, features a deep penetration depth (4 cm in vivo) with high spatial and temporal resolutions (255 µm in-plane resolution and a 10 Hz 2D frame rate). By scanning the entire breast within a single breath hold (~15 s), a volumetric image can be acquired and subsequently reconstructed utilizing 3D back-projection with negligible breathing-induced motion artifacts. SBH-PACT clearly reveals tumors by observing higher blood vessel densities associated with tumors at high spatial resolution, showing early promise for high sensitivity in radiographically dense breasts. In addition to blood vessel imaging, the high imaging speed enables dynamic studies, such as photoacoustic elastography, which identifies tumors by showing less compliance. The research group imaged breast cancer patients with breast sizes ranging from B cup to DD cup, and skin pigmentations ranging from light to dark. SBH-PACT identified all the tumors without resorting to ionizing radiation or exogenous contrast, posing no health risks. Diffuse optical tomography has been investigated to provide functional optical contrast. However, the spatial resolution of the current prototypes limits their clinical use. Overall, each modality has notable advantages and limitations. Photoacoustic computed tomography (PACT) is a promising complementary modality that overcomes many of these limitations.
 
By developing this advanced breast imaging modality, they provided a promising tool for future clinical use including not only screening, but also diagnostic studies to determine extent of disease, to assist in surgical treatment planning, and to assess responses to neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Compared to mammography, SBH-PACT utilizes non-ionizing radiation, shows early promise for sensitivity in radiographically dense breasts, and imposes less or no pain by only slightly compressing the breast against the chest wall. Because the average hemoglobin concentration in malignant tumors is generally twice that in benign tumors and using hemoglobin as the contrast, SBH-PACT can potentially monitor breast cancer’s response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy by acquiring information similar to that of contrast-enhanced MRI, yet with finer spatial resolution, higher imaging speed, and only endogenous contrast. This new modality is under development at Caltech Optical Imaging Laboratory at the California Institute of Technology.
 
Breast Elastography
 
This sonographic technology is increasingly being used to better characterize breast lesions, by improving specificity of B-mode ultrasound. Two elastography modes are available: free-hand and sheer-wave. Tissues have different elastic moduli and deform relative to its intrinsic stiffness. Breast Ultrasound Elastography (BUE) has an 87% sensitivity, 90% specificity, and 88% diagnostic accuracy in defining breast lesions as either malignant or benign. BUE is intended to have a high negative predictive value by reducing false positives. There are many quantitative and qualitative scoring systems to characterize lesions by using BUE. Such schemata have been incorporated into the newest ACR Ultrasound BIRADS Lexicon manual. By using these methods to characterize breast lesions, BUE is reported to increase diagnostic confidence, reduce unnecessary short-term follow up and unneeded biopsy of benign breast tumors.
Molecular Breast Imaging
 
This technique of MBI uses a nuclear medicine agent called 99mTc Sestamibi, which is injected into the bloodstream and tends to accumulate in cancer cells within the breast, based on differences in metabolism. Then the breast is imaged on 1 or 2 detectors for up to 40 minutes total or 10 minutes per breast x 2 views. MBI is a functional study and the injected agent emits gamma rays which are identified on a scintillation crystal. By using MBI, there is added radiation dose to the patient equal to 2/3 of the background dose but at the added benefit of detecting 8 more cancers per 1000 women when compared to mammography alone. This is an alternative study in women who have dense breasts and cannot undergo MRI but should not be used in pregnant women.

Positron Emission Mammography
 
Positron emission mammography is a combination anatomic functional study of the breast utilizing a radiation emitting agent called FDG or 18-fluorodeoxyglucose or FDG-18 that is taken up in cancer cells that are utilizing glucose as an energy source. This procedure requires the patient to fast for up to 6 hours, requires 40 minutes total of scan time and is used to determine recurrence of cancer from scar tissue, when women cannot undergo MRI, or response to treatment. Because of the moderately high radiation dose, it is not used for screening but more for problem solving.
CTLM®
 
The CTLM® system is a Diffuse Optical Tomography (DOT) CT-like scanner. Its energy source is a laser beam portion of the electromagnetic spectrum not ionizing radiation such as is used in conventional x-ray mammography or CT scanners. We believe that the advantages of imaging without ionizing radiation are very significant. CTLM® is an emerging imaging modality offering the potential of functional imaging equivalent, which can visualize the process of angiogenesis - that may be used by the radiologist or responsible physician to distinguish between benign and malignant tissue. X-ray mammography is a well-established method of imaging the breast but has limitations especially in dense breast cases. While x-ray mammography and ultrasound generally produce two dimensional images (2D) of the breast, the CTLM® produces 3D images. Ultrasound is often used as an adjunct to mammography to help differentiate tumors from cysts or help to localize a biopsy site. We believe the CTLM® will be used to provide the radiologist with additional information to manage the clinical case via angiogenesis detection; help diagnose breast cancer earlier; reduce diagnostic uncertainty especially in mammographically dense breast cases; and may help decrease the number of biopsies performed for benign lesions. Because breast cancers nearly always develop in the dense glandular tissue of the breast (and very rarely in the fatty tissue), women who have mostly dense tissue on a mammogram are at an increased risk of breast cancer, via failed mammographic detection. Abnormalities in dense breasts can be more difficult to detect on a mammogram.
 
The CTLM® technology is unique and protected by a combination of trade secrets and patents. A CTLM® breast exam is non-invasive and can be performed by a medical technologist. A patient lies face down or prone on a scanning table with one breast suspended naturally into a specially designed scanning chamber. The scanner images the breast in contiguous slices from chest wall to nipple in minutes. One breast is scanned at a time. The CTLM® is a sophisticated electro-mechanical scanner under microprocessor and computer control. Results are available immediately in digital format for comparison to mammography results, consultation, transmission to multimodality reading stations, or archiving.
 
Images and study results present as multiple-slice data sets which can be viewed slice-by-slice or as a 3D volume with image manipulation tools. Images are usually viewed in gray and green color shades, since color displays are common with other molecular imaging modalities such as nuclear medicine, PET, fMRI, and in radiation therapy imaging.
 
Since the Viable Acquisition we have focused on revitalizing the CTLM® technology. We completed the upgrade of the CTLM® to the CTLM® 2.0 in late 2016. We took the following principal steps in this upgrade:
 

● | Collecting and archiving all the documents to build the gantry and the cover of the scanner. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Collecting and archiving all the documents to build the controllers of the scanner. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Collecting and archiving all the software codes that are necessary to maintain the scanner. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Simulating industry standard architecture (ISA) bus using a digital input/output (IO) card on a peripheral component interconnect (PCI) bus in order to be able to use modern computers without modifying any controller of the scanner. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Replacing two racks of obsolete and bulky power supplies with a simple and small medical grade power supply. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Replacing the operator console computer. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Replacing the obsolete Windows 2000 operating system with Windows 8. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We continue to work to further advance the CTLM® technology and the quality and efficiency of our systems.

We believe it is critical to provide physicians with a visualization tool that allows them to find angiogenesis from the CTLM® images with minimal false positives as well as minimal false negatives. Currently, IDSI includes as a CTLM® operating component a software package known as “Physician Console” to enable physicians to read CTLM® images. Limited signal to noise image ratios and a lack of quantitative data are among the drawbacks of this visualization software package.
 
We are developing and plan to release a new software package known as “CTLM® Physician Workstation” to replace the Physician Console and provide with each CTLM® the capability to identify, locate and measure an angiogenesis area. No date has been set for its release.
 
The CTLM® Physician Workstation possesses the key features of the Physician Console and has many additional features not contained in the console, including:
 

● | A volumetric approach to find angiogenesis using vascular regions, MIP, ESSD and TSSD views. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Image measurements to find the CTLM® numbers of a pixel in a CTLM® image and the distance between two points of the breast using a CTLM® image. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Volume measurement of a high absorption area that could be an angiogenesis area. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Image correlation between CTLM® images or between a CTLM® image and another image from a different modality such as mammography. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Commands to manipulate images which are context sensitive, with most having shortcut keys. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Reading DICOM images. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------


● | Online help. 
--+------------------------------------------------------


● | New tools including image segmentation, object collection and volume measurement to monitor neoadjuvant chemotherapy treatment. Physicians will be able to quantify the volume of angiogenesis area as a measure of potential tumor regression or non-response from chemotherapy. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Since 2017, we began working on development of our CTLM® 3.0 scanner. This newly designed scanner will offer a very high throughput, with the scan time potentially being reduced from 20 to 2 minutes for a 100-slice breast scan. We believe that this increased efficiency will be achieved with image quality at least as good as that of the CTLM® 2.0, with diminished stair-step artifact and improved signal to noise ratio.
 
Further, we believe that the CTLM® 3.0 will be substantially easier and less expensive to manufacture, install and service, compared to the 2.0 version.
 
The principal features of the CTLM® 3.0 under development are:
 

● | New helical scanning mode. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------


● | New small footprint of the scanner. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | New gantry.
--+------------


● | Capability to move the scan chamber (in the X and Y axis) to center the breast. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Capability to collect data about 2mm closer to the chest wall compared to the 2.0 version. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | New data acquisition system for faster scanning and improved signal to noise ratio. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | New scan controls. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------


● | Use of wireless technology in scanning operations and visualization. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

● | New database.
--+--------------


● | New graphical user interface (GUI). 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | New software package to scan, reconstruct and visualize. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Compatibility with DICOM 3.0. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We expect to commence testing of our CTLM® 3.0 in the second quarter of 2020 and to launch the CTLM® 3.0 after testing and meeting all regulatory requirements.
 
FLUORESCENCE IMAGING
 
Fluorescence and molecular imaging techniques are of growing importance to the drug development industry and for disease detection. Certain molecules exhibit the phenomenon of emitting light after being illuminated by light of an appropriate wavelength, e.g., from a laser. The light that is emitted is referred to as “fluorescent” light. The compounds that produce fluorescence are commonly referred to as fluorescent dyes. At least one company to our knowledge is developing a fluorescent compound for possible use in breast cancer detection.
 
The CTLM® system laser diodes can stimulate fluorescent light emissions when used in conjunction with such compounds. When an appropriate fluorescent compound has been introduced into the blood, areas with an abundance of blood vessels, i.e., the angiogenesis associated with a tumor, may retain a higher concentration of the fluorescent compound. As the CTLM® scanner illuminates these areas, fluorescent light is emitted and detected. Reconstructed CTLM® images then locate and quantify the fluorescent area within the area of interest.
 
Several CTLM®’s were retrofitted with laser diodes tuned to specific wavelengths of light which matched the compounds. Optical filters limited the spectral responses to selected wavelengths. Experiments were conducted by placing fluorescent compounds inside a breast equivalent phantom and scanning it with CTLM®. To our knowledge we were the first with the ability to excite a fluorescent compound, detect its location within the simulated breast, and create an image. On September 14, 1999, a patent was issued to IDSI titled “Laser Imaging Apparatus Using Biomedical Markers that Bind to Cancer Cells” as Patent No 5,952,664. This patent expired on January 16, 2018.
 
In March 2002, we signed an agreement with Schering AG to evaluate the advantages of new fluorescence compounds for the potential use of detecting breast cancer. We installed three CTLM® systems for Schering AG’s clinical trials: one at Charité’s Robert-Rössle Clinic in Berlin, one at the University of Muenster, and the third at Charité Hospital in Berlin, Germany as part of their Phase 1 clinical studies of fluorescent imaging compounds. In November 2005, we announced that Schering AG had completed the evaluation of fluorescent imaging compound SF64 with three modified CT Laser Mammography systems.
 
In July 2009, we announced the commencement of a breast cancer imaging study at the Charité, Medical University in Berlin, Germany. The study examined the potential role of the CTLM® as an enhanced breast cancer screening tool when used in combination with the fluorescent dye, Indocyanine Green (ICG). The study was conducted at the Campus Virchow-Klinikum and the principal investigator was radiologist Dr. Alexander Poellinger. Pending further investigation, technical refinement and funding, IDSI has postponed its efforts to research and develop fluorescence imaging techniques.
 
GOVERNMENT REGULATION AND APPROVALS
 
United States Regulation
 
The CTLM® is a medical device and it is subject to the relevant provisions of the United States Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act”) and its implementing regulations. Pursuant to the FD&C Act, the FDA regulates, among other things, the manufacturing, labeling, distribution, and promotion of the CTLM® in the United States. The Act requires that a medical device must (unless exempted by regulation) be cleared or approved by the FDA before being commercially distributed in the United States. The FD&C Act also requires that manufacturers of medical devices, among other things, comply with specific labeling requirements and manufacture devices in accordance with Current Good Manufacturing Practices, which require that companies manufacture their products and maintain related documentation in a conformed manner with respect to manufacturing, testing, and quality control activities. The FDA inspects medical device manufacturers and distributors, and has broad authority to order recalls of medical devices, to seize non-complying medical devices, to enjoin and/or impose civil penalties, and to criminally prosecute violators.
 
10

 

The FDA classifies medical devices intended for human use into three classes: Class I; Class II; and Class III. The CTLM® is a Class III device. A PMA is the FDA process of scientific and regulatory review to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of Class III medical devices. Class III devices are those that support or sustain human life, are of substantial importance in preventing impairment of human health, or which present a potentially unreasonable risk of illness or injury. Due to the level of risk associated with Class III devices, the FDA has determined that general and special controls alone are insufficient to assure the safety and effectiveness of Class III devices. Therefore, these devices require a PMA application in order to obtain marketing clearance.
 
The FDA automatically classifies new technologies in Class III when limited safety information is available and no predicate device is available. It allows for multiple clinical studies to be pursued to gather the necessary data to obtain safety and clinical information to be used for future FDA submissions. At the time that we were developing the CTLM® system and considering our options for obtaining marketing clearance there was not enough data on laser based technologies nor were there approved other new medical devices dedicated to breast imaging other than the traditional x-ray technology. As a result, the FDA in an August 2011 letter recommended that we seek a PMA application, and we decided to proceed accordingly.
 
Progress toward submitting a PMA application during 2012-13 was significantly delayed and then eventually halted due to lack of funding, which required us to lay off key employees and terminate our clinical activities and prevented us from hiring the necessary FDA consultants required to assist in the process.
 
Following the Viable Acquisition, our new management conducted a detailed analysis of our pre-acquisition FDA approval process and formulated a new plan for obtaining the approval, backed by Viable’s commitment to provide the necessary funding. We hired a new specialized regulatory consulting firm and legal counsel with expertise in the FDA Approval process. We determined that, unfortunately, our pre-acquisition clinical data could not be used due to non-conformance with FDA requirements. Consequently, we decided to conduct new clinical studies in order to collect the patient data required for our new PMA application. In December 2015, we and our consultants met with the FDA examiners responsible for our approval process, and we presented our proposed approach for data collection, patient selection and data analysis. After receiving the FDA examiners’ input (critiques and suggestions), we began working on a revised PMA protocol and also re-evaluating our PMA strategy.
 
After our December 2015 informational meeting with the FDA, we drafted a revised clinical investigation plan (“CIP”) for purposes of the PMA process; however, we have not yet submitted the CIP to the FDA as we have been focusing since 2016 on our initial goal of obtaining CFDA marketing clearance and launching operations in China. We are awaiting more clinical data from China in order to formulate our PMA pathway and strategy. All of the data and trials we have assembled and conducted to date are for internal evaluation purposes and not for submission to the FDA. Once we have developed a clear PMA strategy in conjunction with our FDA consultants, all of our clinical trials going forward will be designed to meet the FDA’s requirements for the PMA process.
 
Based on our current CIP, the intended use of the CTLM® is an adjunct to mammography for breast cancer screening in asymptomatic women who have dense (heterogeneously or extremely) breasts per ACR categories. We may also pursue application of our technology in the neoadjuvant therapy areas. We will rely on our FDA consultants to determine estimated costs and milestones for the PMA process which will resume when we have adequate funding from operations and/or from Viable and its affiliates; however, there can be no assurance that we will secure this funding. There can be no assurance that we will be able to timely submit our PMA application or that, if submitted, we will ultimately receive approval of the application by the FDA. If we are unable to timely obtain marketing clearance for the CTLM® in the United States, our business and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.
 
We will be able to submit our PMA application only after successful completion and analysis of the relevant clinical trials, the plans for which have yet to be determined.
 
Submission of a PMA application is followed by a four-step review process consisting of:
 

● | Administrative and limited scientific review by FDA staff to determine completeness (acceptance and filing reviews); 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
11

 


● | In-depth scientific, regulatory, and quality system review by appropriate FDA personnel (substantive review); 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Review and recommendation by the appropriate advisory committee (panel review); and 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Final deliberations, documentation and notification of the FDA decision. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
FDA regulations provide 180 days to review a PMA application and make a determination. In reality, the review time is normally longer. Before approving or denying a PMA application, the appropriate FDA advisory committee may review the application at a public meeting and provide the FDA with the committee’s recommendation on whether the FDA should approve the submission. After the FDA notifies the applicant that the application has been approved or denied, a notice is published on the Internet (1) announcing the data on which the decision is based, and (2) providing interested persons an opportunity to petition the FDA within 30 days for reconsideration of the decision.
 
The third-party manufacturers upon which we will depend to manufacture our products are required to adhere to applicable FDA regulations regarding quality systems regulations commonly referred to as QSRs, which include testing, control and documentation requirements. Failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, including marketing and promoting products for unapproved use, could result in warning letters, fines, injunctions, civil penalties, recall or seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production, refusal of the government to grant pre-market clearance or approval for devices, withdrawal of approvals and criminal prosecution. Changes in existing regulations or adoption of new government regulations or policies could prevent or delay regulatory approval of our products. Material changes to medical devices also are subject to FDA review and clearance or approval.
 
Any products manufactured or distributed by us pursuant to FDA marketing clearance will be subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA. Labeling, advertising and promotional activities are subject to scrutiny by the FDA and, in certain instances, by the Federal Trade Commission. In addition, the marketing and use of our products may be regulated by various state agencies. The export of medical devices is also subject to regulation in certain instances. Both the FDA and the individual states may inspect the manufacturers of our products on a routine basis for compliance with current QSR regulations and other requirements.
 
In addition to the foregoing, we are subject to numerous federal, state, and local laws relating to such matters as safe working conditions, manufacturing practices, environmental protection, and fire hazard control. There can be no assurance that we will not be required to incur significant costs to comply with such laws and regulations and that such compliance will not have a material adverse effect upon our ability to conduct business. See Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Cautionary Statements – Extensive Government Regulation, No Assurance of Regulatory Approvals”.
 
International Regulatory Overview
 
IDSI has upgraded its quality system for manufacturing from ISO 13485:2003 to ISO 13485:2016 in June 2018 by successfully passing our certification audit conducted by Underwriters Laboratory (“UL”). Our quality management certificate was renewed through July 26, 2022. We also obtained a TUV Certificate for the CTLM® in November 2017
Europe
 
Based on our initial UL certification, in 2001 we obtained the CE Mark, which is required for us to sell the CTLM® in the European Union (“EU”). Even though our CE Mark is effective through July 2021, we have decided not to renew it for this year and to consider reapplying in 2 to 3 years to avoid substantial regulatory fees. We will maintain our ISO 13485:2016 certification which will allow us to pursue FDA marketing clearance and the CE Mark in the future.
China
 
We received CTLM® CFDA approval effective November 16, 2018 to November 15, 2023 as disclosed in our Form 8-K report filed on December 11, 2018.

Australia, Brazil, Canada, Japan and the United States
 
IDSI is currently upgrading its QMS to meet the requirements of the Medical Device Single Audit Program (MDSAP) in 2019 which will satisfy the audit and QMS requirements for these countries. This sets the stage for IDSI to register the CTLM® in each of these countries so that it can eventually be marketed, subject to satisfaction of other relevant regulations in each country.
DOMESTIC SALES AND MARKETING
 
The CTLM® will be positioned as an adjunct to x-ray mammography and may be especially useful in studies of dense breasts. Consequently, CTLM® will be marketed to centers performing x-ray mammography. There are approximately 8,600 Mammography Quality Standards Act (MQSA) centers certified in the United States. Marketing and sales in the U.S. cannot occur unless and until we receive pre-market approval from the FDA. IDSI will begin marketing to the centers following FDA approval.
 
Since Diffuse Optical Tomography for laser breast imaging is a new imaging modality the rate at which the CTLM® achieves market acceptance and penetration will depend on many variables. These include, but are not limited to, the establishment and demonstration in the medical community of the clinical safety, efficacy, and cost-effectiveness of the CTLM®, and the advantage of the CTLM® when used as an adjunct to existing technology and cancer detection methods.
 
The medical community and U.S. government have recognized the need to address health concerns for women with dense breasts. As per https://densebreast-info.org/ 38 states and the District of Columbia have enacted mandatory breast density legislation. These laws require physicians to inform women who have undergone mammography regarding and about their breast density or about dense breast in general. Why the worry? Because
 
1. BREAST DENSITY CAN OBSCURE CANCERS. Breast density increases the likelihood that cancer will be missed by mammography; as breast density increases, mammographic sensitivity decreases.
 
2. BREAST DENSITY IS AN INDEPENDENT RISK FACTOR FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF BREAST CANCER. Women with the densest breasts are 4 to 6-fold more likely to develop breast cancer than women with the least dense breasts.
 
3. IDENTIFY THE HIGH-RISK PATIENT WHO NEEDS INCREASED SURVEILLANCE. Annual supplemental MRI screening is recommended in high-risk women beginning at age 25.
 
4. UNDERSTAND SCREENING OPTIONS FOR WOMEN WITH DENSE BREASTS. If a woman has dense breasts, should she consider supplemental screening beyond mammography alone?
 
5. THERE ARE RISKS OF FALSE POSITIVES WITH ANY SCREENING STRATEGY. Tomosynthesis (3D mammography) can reduce false positives and improve cancer detection, but is it available for your patients, and is it warranted?
 
If the classification of dense breasts is made for a patient, then she may want to discuss other screening options shown by guiding flow charts. These laws were put in place to help women get the necessary information to decide on further action if they were notified that they have dense breast tissue. In conjunction with these laws, the 114th U.S. Congress has introduced a National Standard for Density Reporting. According to the American College of Radiology approximately 50% of women are considered to have dense breasts. Failure of our products to gain market acceptance would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. There can be no assurance that physicians or the medical community in general will accept and/or utilize the CTLM®.
 
In order to effectively market any products we may develop, we will have to develop a marketing and distribution channel with technical expertise and distribution capability. There can be no assurance that we will be able to establish sales and distribution capabilities or that we will be successful in gaining market acceptance for the CTLM® or any other products we may develop.

INTERNATIONAL SALES AND MARKETING
 
The only regulatory clearance we have now is CFDA marketing clearance in China, and we rely on our affiliate Xi’an IDI for all sales and marketing efforts in China. If and when we renew our CE Mark and obtain regulatory marketing clearances in other foreign countries, we plan to rely on strategic relationships with key international distributors for sales and service of the CTLM®. Financial and logistical considerations make a direct sales model unfeasible. Costs associated with maintaining direct relationships with specific contacts and customers, hiring appropriately trained sales, marketing and service personnel or ensuring compliance with local product registration requirements all lead us to utilize a distributor sales model.
 
Sales of CTLM® systems outside of the United States are subject to foreign regulatory requirements that vary widely from country to country. The time required to obtain approval for sale in foreign countries may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA clearance or approval, and the requirements may differ. The laws of certain European and Asian countries permit us to market the CTLM® in those countries before marketing would be permitted in the United States. As a result, we sold 26 CTLM® systems before the Viable Acquisition. In order to export the CTLM® to other countries we must obtain and maintain the FDA Certificate of Exportability for the CTLM®. This certificate is required for the export of Class III medical devices which have not received U.S. marketing clearance. The Certificate of Exportability must be renewed every two years. IDSI current certificate is valid through August 20, 2020.
 
Prior to the Viable Acquisition, IDSI had obtained China marketing clearance through SFDA approval no. 20043241646 in August 2004. This approval expired in August 2008. We obtained a second SFDA approval no. 20093242463 in October 2009. These approvals allowed limited government reimbursement for the CTLM®. Four CTLM® systems were sold to China Far East International Trading Corp. in 2004, and in 2007 a CTLM® was placed at Tianjin Cancer Hospital where a clinical study was conducted by Jin Qi, MD, who wrote a clinical paper at the conclusion of her study. The paper was published in the March-April 2013 issue of Clinical Imaging which can be found at www.clinicalimaging.org. We were forced to terminate our marketing efforts in China due to the loss of SFDA certification when SFDA changed from SFDA to CFDA in March 2013. Due to our lack of financial resources, IDSI was not able to pursue CFDA approval until after the Viable Acquisition.
 
Since the Viable Acquisition, we have decided to refocus on the Chinese market as it is by far the largest international market for the CTLM®, our management and Viable are very familiar with that market, and China’s more efficient regulatory procedures provide the opportunity to obtain marketing clearance well before U.S. marketing clearance is likely to be obtained.
 
In June 2017, we entered into a Technology Licensing Agreement (the “Xi’an Agreement”) with Xi’an IDI Laser Image Co. Ltd. (“Xi’an IDI”), of Xi’an, Shaanxi Province, China. Xi’an IDI is an affiliate of Viable. Pursuant to the Xi’an Agreement, Xi’an IDI has the exclusive right to manufacture the CTLM® in China and sell the CTLM® in China, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan. Xi’an IDI must pay to IDSI on a quarterly basis a royalty of 25% of the gross revenues from the sale of the CTLM® and related parts and accessories. We expect to sell the CTLM® in China for a price of approximately $300,000.
 
The Company received CTLM® CFDA approval effective November 16, 2018 to November 15, 2023 as disclosed in the Company’s 8-K filing on December 11, 2018. However, there can be no assurance that we will obtain FDA marketing or other new international marketing clearances, that the CTLM® will achieve market acceptance or that sufficient revenues will be generated from sales of the CTLM® to allow us to operate profitably.
 
We have previously obtained the CE Mark and were permitted to sell the CTLM® in the 28 countries that are members of the European Union (EU); however, our lack of FDA marketing clearance is a practical impediment to our marketing the CTLM® in the EU and certain other countries as un-approved U.S. medical devices are perceived as inferior in those countries. In analyzing the regulatory path forward, timeline, and costs associated with the level of effort required to upgrade the Company’s Quality Management System, we have decided not to renew our CE mark (required for sales in the European Union) for this year and to consider reapplying in 2 to 3 years to avoid substantial regulatory fees. We will maintain our ISO 13485:2016 certification which will allow us to pursue U.S. marketing clearance and the CE Mark in the future. We intend to defer marketing efforts in the EU until we believe we are close to receiving U.S. marketing clearance.
 
We will be subject to the substantial risks associated with international sales, including economic and political instability, shipping delays, fluctuation of foreign currency exchange rates, foreign regulatory requirements and various tariffs and trade restrictions, all of which could have a significant impact on our ability to deliver products on a timely basis. Future imposition of, or significant increases in the level of tariffs, export quotas or other trade restrictions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The regulation of medical devices continues to develop and there can be no assurance that new laws or regulations will not have an adverse effect on us.

THIRD-PARTY REIMBURSEMENT; HEALTH CARE REFORM
 
In the United States, suppliers of health care products and services are greatly affected by Medicare, Medicaid, and the Affordable Care Act (“ACA” or the “Act”), as well as by private insurance reimbursement programs. Third-party payers (Medicare, Medicaid, private health insurance companies and other organizations) may affect the pricing or relative attractiveness of our products by regulating the level of reimbursement provided by such payers to the physicians and clinics utilizing the CTLM® or by refusing reimbursement. There can be no assurance that third-party payers will provide reimbursement for use of our products. In international markets, reimbursement by private third-party medical insurance providers, including governmental insurers and independent providers, varies from country to country. In certain countries, our ability to achieve significant market penetration may depend upon the availability of third-party governmental reimbursement.
 
The U.S. President and Congress have enacted a comprehensive reform of the U.S. healthcare system through the passage of the ACA, most of whose provisions took effect in 2013-14. The ultimate effect of this new Act to reform health care is uncertain, and there can be no assurance that the changes made to the U.S. healthcare system will not materially adversely affect us. Some of the provisions in the Act may limit and further reduce and control spending on healthcare products and services, limit coverage for new technology and limit or control the price health care providers and drug and device manufacturers may charge for their services and products, respectively. These reforms could cause U.S. healthcare providers to limit use of or not use the CTLM® systems, in which case we would be materially adversely affected.
 
PRODUCT LIABILITY
 
Our business exposes us to potential product liability risks, which are inherent in the testing, manufacturing and marketing of cancer detection products. While the CTLM® is being developed as an adjunct to other diagnostic techniques, there can be no assurance that we will not be subjected to substantial claims and potential liability. Before the Viable Acquisition we carried $3,000,000 in product liability insurance to cover both clinical sites and sales. As part of our cost savings initiatives, we cancelled the policy as we had not had any adverse experiences after conducting more than 25,000 patient scans worldwide; however, if an end user such as a hospital or imaging center requires us to provide specific product liability insurance, we intend to ensure that our insurance meets any reasonable requirements.
COMPETITION
 
The medical device industry generally, and the diagnostic imaging segments in particular, are characterized by rapidly evolving technology and intense competition. The IDSI approach of employing continuous wave laser optical technology in a CT-like device to produce 3D images for breast cancer detection is unique, and the concept of imaging angiogenesis in the breast to differentiate between benign and malignant tissue is well accepted.
 
Although the CTLM® system is a CT-like scanner, its energy source for imaging is a laser beam and not ionizing radiation such as is found in conventional x-ray mammography or CT scanners. The advantage of imaging without ionizing radiation may be significant in our markets. X-ray mammography is a well-established method of imaging the structures within the breast. Ultrasound is often used as an adjunct to help differentiate tumors and cysts. The CTLM® is being marketed as an adjunct to mammography and will not compete directly with X-ray mammography. CTLM® is, however, a method of molecular functional imaging, which can visualize the process of angiogenesis which may be used to distinguish between benign and malignant tissue. Unlike X-ray or ultrasound, optical molecular imaging is a revolutionary functional imaging modality. In this respect, CTLM® may compete with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in breast imaging because both CTLM® and MRI have the capacity to visualize function at the molecular level.
 
To our knowledge, several companies have targeted the breast optical imaging market. Advanced Research Technologies, Inc. (ART) (TSX:ARA) developed a non-3D imager which does not utilize our proprietary continuous wave technology and in which the breast must be immersed in a gel to be scanned. As far as we know, ART has not received a PMA and no information on the company or its product, SoftScan, is available since 2008. On February 18, 2013, ART Advanced Research Technologies Inc. filed an assignment and KPMG Inc. was appointed as trustee of the estate of the bankrupt by the official receiver, subject to affirmation by the creditors of the trustee’s appointment or substitution of another trustee by the creditors.

We expect, as patents on devices using lasers as an energy source for optical imaging expire, to see medical device companies take an interest in laser imaging. IDSI has been a pioneer in Diffuse Optical Tomography and has sold CTLM® systems for commercial purposes.
 
Several medical imaging companies such as Seno Medical Instruments are developing devices that are multi-modality combining ultrasound with laser and could be viewed as competitive, however, we are unaware of the launch of any such devices.
 
We believe that we will face strong competition in the coming years. Nonetheless, since new technologies and devices generally require substantial time for development and market acceptance, we believe that we have a significant advantage due to our CFDA approval and launch of sales of our CTLM® in the Chinese market. In order to maintain our competitive advantages, we plan to increase our research and development efforts in order to enhance our existing device and potentially develop new devices. We believe that ongoing innovation is a key to our success.
 
PATENTS AND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
 
The rapid technological advancements that characterize the medical device industry have led us to rely on a combination of patents, trade secrets, copyrights, trademarks, and confidentiality procedures and processes to protect our CTLM® and other technologies that we have developed. Due to the rising maintenance costs and limited usefulness of patents, we have shifted our policy for protection of our intellectual property to focus principally on trade secrets and confidential procedures and processes; however, we intend to file for new patents in circumstances where we believe the additional protection is cost-effective. We believe that this approach will adequately protect our intellectual property and competitive position in China and our other main potential markets; however, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in our efforts to protect our intellectual property.
Patent Licensing Agreement
 
IDSI was formed in December 1993 for the sole purpose of developing and commercializing Mr. Richard Grable’s invention, a CT laser breast-imaging device (the “Mammoscan™”). In June 1998, IDSI signed an exclusive patent license agreement with Richard Grable, which covered his patent for some of the CTLM® technology. The term of the license was for the life of the patent (17 years) and any renewals of the patent, subject to termination under specific conditions. The patent license agreement expired in June 2015, when the underlying patent expired. No royalties were paid under the agreement because royalties were payable only following FDA marketing clearance, which did not occur before expiration and still has not occurred.
Intellectual Property
 
We hold the following patents:

We intend to file for patents where we believe the cost of obtaining a patent is economically reasonable in relation to the expected protection obtained. In particular, we intend to seek patents covering the key technology underlying the CTLM® 3.0. There can be no assurances that any patent that we apply for will be issued, or that any patents issued will protect our technology. If the patents we license or obtain are infringed upon, or if we are required to defend any patent infringement cases brought against us that will require substantial capital, the expenditure of which we might not be able to afford, we could be materially adversely affected.
 
Except as to the CTLM® 3.0, we do not believe that we need additional patents in order to adequately protect our existing intellectual property in China, the United States and other key potential markets for the CTLM®; however, we will continually evaluate this position in light of changing circumstances.
 
MANUFACTURING
 
We intend to have the CTLM® manufactured by medical device contract manufacturers; however, we may develop the capability for limited manufacturing at our headquarters facility if the circumstances so warrant. Strategically, IDSI has developed certain in-house capabilities to protect trade secrets. Our ability to utilize contract manufacturers to manufacture our products on a timely and cost-competitive basis may be compromised due to high medical standards and FDA manufacturing requirements applicable to our product. We may be hindered by the lack of options for additional or replacement parts for product specific components or materials. In the event that we are unable to obtain sufficient raw materials or components on financially reasonable terms or in a timely manner, we may be faced with material adverse effects on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
 
In June 2017, we entered into a licensing agreement with Xi’an IDI to manufacture and sell the CTLM® and related parts and accessories in China, Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan. While manufacturing capacity has been shifted to Xi’an IDI, we have identified Sparton Corp., Strongsville, Ohio (NYSE:SPA) as a potential contract manufacturer to manufacture the CTLM® and certain components in the U.S.
 
EMPLOYEES
 
Currently, we have 4 full-time employees, not including our CFO, who has been retained as a consultant. Two of our employees are employed in the areas of scientific, clinical and product research and development. Our ability to develop our products and provide our services is dependent upon our recruiting, hiring and retaining qualified technical personnel. To date, we have been able to recruit and retain sufficient qualified personnel. None of our employees are represented by a labor union. We have not experienced any work stoppages and consider our relations with our employees to be good.
 
Due to the specialized scientific nature of our business, we are highly dependent upon our ability to attract and retain qualified scientific, technical and managerial personnel. The loss of the services of existing personnel as well as the failure to recruit key scientific, technical and managerial personnel in a timely manner would be detrimental to our research and development programs and to our business. Our anticipated growth and expansion into areas and activities requiring additional expertise, such as marketing, will require the addition of new management personnel. Competition for qualified personnel is intense and there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to attract and retain qualified personnel necessary for the development of our business.
