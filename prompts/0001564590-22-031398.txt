Item 1. Business. 
Overview 
 Intapp is a leading provider of industry-specific, cloud-based software solutions for the global professional and financial services industry. We empower the world’s premier private capital, investment banking, legal, accounting, and consulting firms with the technology they need to meet rapidly changing client, investor, and regulatory requirements, deliver timely insights to the right professionals, and operate more competitively. 
 Our Intapp Platform is purpose-built to modernize these firms. The platform facilitates greater team collaboration, digitizes complex workflows to optimize deal and engagement execution, and leverages proprietary AI to help nurture relationships and originate new business. By better connecting their most important assets—people, processes, and data—our platform helps firms increase client fees and investment returns, operate more efficiently, and better manage risk and compliance. 
 The professional and financial services industry is one of the largest sectors in the global economy. Firms in this industry operate in a highly connected ecosystem, providing valuable expertise, insight, and advice to a broad range of companies across multiple transactions and engagements. The industry is competitive and uniquely structured around highly experienced partners and professionals who leverage knowledge, intellectual capital, and relationships to succeed, as opposed to providing physical goods. Firms must manage an intricate web of complex, non-linear relationships spread across various functions, processes, and personnel while also navigating an ever-changing regulatory environment. 
 Historically, firms in the professional and financial services industry have either relied on internally built technology solutions and legacy on-premises software or attempted to use horizontal software providers for their industry-specific technology needs. Internally built or legacy solutions tend to be outdated, expensive, and cumbersome to maintain, while horizontal solutions do not align well with how these firms operate and require heavy customization. As a result, we believe these firms are increasingly embracing industry-specific software and AI technology to achieve improved levels of growth, investment, returns, productivity, risk management, and a differentiated experience for their clients, teams, and investors. 
 Our deep understanding of the professional and financial services industry has enabled us to develop a suite of solutions on the Intapp Platform tailored to address these challenges faced by firms. We have two brands with which we go to market: 
 DealCloud is our deal and relationship management solution for financial services firms. The solution manages firms’ market relationships, prospective clients and investments, current engagements and deal processes, and operations and compliance activities, allowing investors and advisors to react faster, make better decisions, and execute the best deals. For investment banks and advisory firms, this helps enhance their coverage models, achieve greater win rates, and drive higher success fees. For investors, this helps increase origination volume, support investment selection, and drive greater returns. 
 OnePlace is our solution to manage all aspects of a professional services firm’s client and engagement lifecycle. The solution improves client strategy and targeting, business development and origination, and work delivery, increasing financial performance and regulatory compliance. Professionals make better decisions faster by leveraging more institutional knowledge from across the firm. 
 We believe our solutions provide us with a competitive advantage, driven by our deep domain expertise gained over 20 years of serving professional and financial services firms. We have cultivated difficult-to-replicate, privileged access to these firms to develop thorough expertise in how they work and what they need. Clients value our scalable platform’s differentiated domain expertise, purpose-built capabilities, comprehensive end-to-end offering, data-driven AI insights, and industry brand. Our client base represents many of the world’s premier professional and financial services firms, including 96 of the Am Law 100 law firms, 7 of the Top 8 accounting firms, and over 1,250 private capital and investment banking firms.

We sell our software on a subscription basis through a direct enterprise sales model. As of June 30, 2022, we had over 2,100 clients. Our business has historically grown through a combination of expanding within our existing client base—including additional users and capabilities—and selling to new clients. We have had success in driving clients to further adoption, and currently have 41 clients with contracts greater than $1 million of annual recurring revenues (“ARR”). With our scalable, modular cloud-based platform, we believe we are well positioned to continue our growth.

Our Technology Platform 
 Our solutions are built on a single cloud platform, taking advantage of capabilities tailor-made for the unique requirements of the industries we serve. Key features include:
 Modern, cloud-based architecture 
 Intapp’s modern cloud-based architecture is purpose-built to meet the specialized needs of the industry. Key capabilities of our cloud architecture include: 
  
• | Multi-tenant architecture. Our multi-tenant architecture enables scalability, elasticity, high availability, and security, and provides operational cost efficiencies. Additionally, our internal operations and analytics instrumentation aggregates and leverages client instance and tenant experience captured within our solutions to track uptime and provide clients with real-time cloud status and trust information.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Single unified codebase. We develop and release new versions of our solutions to cloud tenants on a common release schedule, with quarterly major releases and monthly maintenance releases. We deploy upgrades rapidly to all of our clients. With this approach, all cloud tenants are always on the latest versions of the software and have immediate access to critical new features, bug fixes, and innovations without the lead time and delays common with traditional on-premises upgrade cycles.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Enterprise-grade security. In response to the strict security requirements of professional and financial services firms, Intapp’s SaaS solutions provide tenants with enterprise-grade security, data protection, and control. In Intapp’s SaaS solutions, strict identity and access controls are employed and data is encrypted in transit and at rest. Intapp’s cloud services comply with numerous internationally recognized standards, such as ISO 27001, ISO 27017, ISO 27018, SOC 2, and CSA STAR.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Open ecosystem and APIs. Intapp’s platform supports an open ecosystem by creating a centralized data lake and messaging service that integrates with disparate internal data sources and third-party applications and data services. By leveraging Intapp’s open (REST) APIs, client IT departments, other software providers, firm consultants, and partners in Intapp’s ecosystem, can extend the benefits of Intapp’s platform to a broader range of business applications.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Low-code configurability and personalized UX 
 Our configurable UX capabilities allow technical and non-technical users to rapidly tailor our applications to meet their specific needs. These capabilities enable our clients to make meaningful changes to their user experience, processes, or business rules with drag-and-drop configuration features and functionality without having to perform custom coding. The flexibility of this framework enables firms to maximize their agility, easily adapting the software to match the frequent changes in their business.
 We leverage our deep domain expertise in professional and financial services to create and provide our clients access to pre-built industry-relevant configuration templates that are designed precisely for how these firms and their professionals operate. By mapping the user interface, data model, and workflows of our platform to firms’ unique industry and organizational requirements, we can deliver smart, personalized experiences by practice area, asset class, investment strategy, sector, industry, and geography.
 Applied artificial intelligence 
 Industry-specific AI is embedded throughout our platform and solutions to help professional and financial services firms use their vast amounts of data to optimize critical processes and make better, faster decisions. The applications of AI span a wide range across firm operations, from strategy and business development through to risk and compliance and work execution. Examples include:
  
• | Automatically analyzing all past engagements by shared characteristics, to derive data-validated intelligence that can be used to improve pricing strategies and optimize staffing levels.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Enhancing conflicts review on matters with large number of parties, for example, bankruptcies or restructuring, to accelerate conflicts clearance and help firms open matters faster with fewer errors.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Capturing billable activities to find missing time and automatically fill out timesheets to reduce revenue leakage, minimize write-offs, and accelerate cash and collections.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Industry-specific data architecture 
 Our platform includes several key data management capabilities that help firms more effectively capture and leverage their critical data using a system of record that reflects the unique operating model of professional and financial services. These capabilities include:
  
• | Specialized industry graph data model. Our specialized industry data model is purpose-built to capture the complex relationships as well as the specialized knowledge and experience unique to professional and financial services. The platform creates many-to-many data linkages that connect professionals with prospective clients, investors and target portfolio companies and assets. Our solutions leverage these linkages to provide personalized analysis and insights for each professional that reflects his or her unique area of specialty, including client industry, asset class, investment strategy, geography, transaction type, and others.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Low-code integration platform. Intapp Integration Service is a core capability of our platform that provides cloud-native and easy-to-use, enterprise class integration to connect applications and data without requiring any code. The solution helps firms overcome data silos and easily move information between systems, including within our platform. Intapp Integration Service includes more than 100 industry-specific connectors, as well as extensive built-in workflow and automation capabilities tailored to the unique needs of professional and financial services firms.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Market intelligence in one place. Our platform combines proprietary and third-party market data, transforming it into institutional knowledge that gives dealmakers and other professionals a competitive advantage through better market intelligence. Professionals can run complex reports, analyze industry trends, and evaluate potential synergies in the same place where they originate new business and manage relationships. With better real-time, actionable market data, investors can source and close deals that best match their investment thesis and strategy, advisory professionals can quickly develop proprietary relationships and coverage strategies with companies that match previous transactions, and lawyers can more accurately identify white space opportunities with global clients to grow their relationships.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Key Benefits of Our Solution 
 Our platform solutions help professional and financial services firms to:
  
• | Increase revenues and investment returns.

Our solutions provide firms with a single source of truth and 360 degrees views of key clients, related investments, potential new clients and investments, and prospective deals, giving partners, professionals, and dealmakers a competitive advantage in the market.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Operate more efficiently and profitably. Our solutions help clients increase efficiency and profitability by streamlining and automating the many functions required to originate deals and deliver work. Using Intapp’s workflow, analytics, and AI capabilities, firms can connect and operationalize their formerly disjointed engagement and deal lifecycle, eliminating manual processes, reducing duplicative data entry, and scaling to support growing businesses with less overhead. This focus includes critical processes such as investor relations, business development, conflicts clearance and business acceptance, engagement planning and resourcing, and billing and collections. Our cloud-based delivery model also reduces firms’ operating costs by eliminating their need to own, upgrade, and support the solutions or associated hardware infrastructure.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Manage risk and compliance more effectively. Our solutions help firms reduce regulatory, financial, and reputational risk through workflow and automation, AI, predictive analytics, and rules-based risk scoring. Using Intapp, risk and compliance teams can work seamlessly together with front office professionals, all within the Intapp Platform, to quickly assess new business opportunities, clear and manage conflicts and independence issues, easily establish ethical walls, prepare for regulatory or client audits, and dynamically respond to rapidly changing regulatory landscapes and the firm’s overall risk posture.

• | Leverage collective knowledge for competitive advantage. Our solutions provide a competitive advantage to firms by helping leverage their immense, but often under-utilized, collective knowledge. With integrated and connected information about investors, economic sectors, deals, clients, engagements, and relationships, combined with relevant third-party data, firm professionals are armed to make better, faster decisions, with better market insights and the knowledge with which to develop stronger relationships and increased business from clients, potential new clients, investors, and potential new investors.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our Growth Strategies 
 The key components of our growth strategy are: 
  
• | Capitalize on a generational shift to the cloud. Mission-critical applications are increasingly being delivered more reliably, securely and cost-effectively via the cloud, which can more readily enable real-time collaboration and provide access to valuable data from anywhere, anytime, on any device. As more professionals embrace cloud technologies, they drive the accelerated adoption of additional cloud capabilities across their firms. We believe we are now in the early stages of a strong adoption cycle of cloud-based solutions by professional and financial services firms, driven in part by the needs of the next generation of professionals for purpose-built technology and software solutions.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Expand within our existing client base. We have a deep, longstanding, and trust-based relationship with our clients. Our land-and-expand model generates multi-year growth within our client base, with client lifetimes often spanning more than a decade. Clients typically adopt our modular solution to address a specific use case, and then expand their use by adopting more modules, adding more users, and deploying to other parts of their organization over time.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Grow our client base. We believe we are addressing a large, underserved market of firms with high demand for the capabilities we offer, and that we have a significant opportunity to continue to grow our client base. We will continue to invest in our sales and marketing force to target new client opportunities and grow our client base.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Add new solutions to our platform. We plan to continue investing in our research and development team to enhance the functionality and breadth of our current solutions, as well as to develop and launch new solutions to address the evolving needs of our clients. In particular, we are continuing to invest resources in extending our AI and data science capabilities to better connect people, processes, and data.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Broaden our geographical reach. We believe there is a significant need for our solutions on a global basis and, accordingly, opportunity for us to grow our business through further international expansion. We will continue to broaden our global footprint and intend to establish a presence in additional international markets.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Selectively pursue strategic transactions. We have acquired and successfully integrated several complementary businesses that allowed us to enhance our platform, add new technology capabilities, and address new client segments. For example, we acquired DealCloud in 2018 to better target private capital and investment banking clients with cloud-based deal management, pipeline management and CRM functionalities. We will continue to evaluate acquisition opportunities that will help us extend our market leadership and client reach.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our Clients

No single client represented more than 10% of total revenues in fiscal year 2022.
Sales and Marketing 
 We currently focus on marketing and selling our solutions to professional and financial services firms in North America, Europe, the Middle East, and Asia Pacific. We seek to drive market demand by developing and delivering specific, market-focused solutions to professional and financial service firms. 
 5

We primarily generate sales through a direct enterprise sales model. All sales personnel focus on attracting new clients as well as expanding usage within our existing client base. Our sales team is supported by technical sales professionals and subject-matter experts who facilitate the sales process through developing and presenting demonstrations of our solutions after assessing requirements, addressing security and technical questions, and matching client needs with the appropriate solutions. We also have a team of experts who help advise on best practices and methodologies, strategize with respect to operations processes and management structure, and assess value creation and ROI from our solutions.
 We also have a growing partner ecosystem that includes a range of technology and implementation partners.  Together with these partners, we generate increased value for our clients and broaden our reach.  Partners range from specialized implementation or data partners up through some of the largest technology players in the world, like Microsoft and KPMG.
 Our marketing efforts are focused on generating awareness of our solutions, creating sales leads, establishing and promoting our brand, showcasing our thought leadership, and cultivating a community of loyal clients and users. We utilize both online and offline marketing initiatives, including events and industry trade shows, online advertising, webinars, blogs, corporate communications, white papers, and case studies. We cultivate a community of our executive level buyers and influencers though our Advisory Board system.
 Client Services and Client Success 
 After a client contracts to purchase our solutions, we, either directly or together with partners, provide implementation services to assist the client in the deployment of those solutions. We utilize best practices developed over our history in implementing our solutions for each client, including providing templates and industry-relevant templates to accelerate adoption and delivering a purpose-built configuration that best suits a client’s specific needs. Implementation engagements typically range in duration from three to nine months, depending on scope.
 We support our clients with access to engineers, other technical support personnel, release management, and managed services. To help our clients achieve success with the Intapp Platform, we offer in-depth change management workshops, classroom and virtual end user and administrator training, consultative adoption services, and best practices. We view our clients’ success as a cornerstone of our business model and philosophy, and are organized to measure, monitor, and deliver high levels of client satisfaction.
 We have also developed relationships with a number of implementation partners. These partners provide implementation services and other professional services related to our platform. We anticipate that we will continue to develop partnerships with a select number of third parties to help grow our business and deliver our solutions. In those markets where we have established such partnerships, we consider these important to our and our clients’ success.
 Research and Development 
 Our ability to compete depends in large part on our continuous commitment to research and development and our ability to rapidly introduce new technologies, features, and functionality. Our research and development team is responsible for the design, architecture, testing, and quality of our solutions. We focus our efforts on enhancing our existing solutions and developing new solutions for our clients.
 Our research and development teams are primarily located in Palo Alto, California, Charlotte, North Carolina, Jersey City, New Jersey, Manchester, England and Belfast, Northern Ireland. We also utilize a substantial number of independent contractors and consultants working in research and development throughout the world. Prior to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, a majority of our research and development had been conducted through our facilities based in Ukraine and our contractors’ facilities located in Belarus, Ukraine, and Russia.  Beginning in March 2022, in response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, we have transitioned and relocated all of our development and services functions previously located in Russia and Belarus to facilities and resources outside of the conflict zone in the European Union, U.K. and Americas.

Our Employees and Human Capital
We have built our culture around the success of our clients, our partners, our employees, and our investors. We have carefully recruited, selected, and developed employees who are highly focused on delivering success for our clients in the professional and financial services industry. This strategy is a crucial element of our hiring and evaluation processes throughout all departments. We believe this approach produces high levels of both client success and employee engagement.
 We believe we provide employees a unique opportunity to develop and sell world-class solutions within a specific industry. The Intapp Platform offers our developers an opportunity to build important solutions that can become the standard in the professional and financial services industry, while enabling sales personnel to sell a growing portfolio of solutions to a focused, deep set of professional and financial services firms. We believe that this unique opportunity will allow us to continue to attract top talent for our product development and sales efforts.
 As of June 30, 2022, we had 946 full-time employees.
 Our employees are primarily located in the United States, the United Kingdom, Europe, Australia and Singapore. We also utilize independent contractors, brokers, and consultants, including a substantial number of developers working in research and development. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or are a party to a collective bargaining agreement and we consider our relationship with our employees to be strong.
 Competition 
 The professional and financial services industry is highly competitive and subject to change from the introduction of new products and technologies and other activities of industry participants. We believe our success in growing our business will depend on our ability to demonstrate to our clients in the professional and financial services industry that our solutions provide superior business outcomes to other competitive solutions, including, but not limited to legacy applications, manual processes, horizontal platforms, and point solutions.
 We believe that the principal competitive factors in our industry include the following:
  
• | Deep domain experience and a long-term, trusted relationship;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------


• | Product innovation, quality, functionality and design;
--+-------------------------------------------------------


• | Solutions that are purpose built for this industry;
--+----------------------------------------------------


• | Platform solutions that are complete end-to-end solutions across the relationship lifecycle;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Solutions that enable connectedness of key data and processes through the use of AI;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | A track record of, delivering value consistently over time;
--+------------------------------------------------------------


• | A strong commitment to security and privacy; and
--+-------------------------------------------------


• | Brand reputation and name recognition in the industry.
--+-------------------------------------------------------

 Some of our competitors and potential competitors are large and have greater brand name recognition, longer operating histories, larger marketing budgets and established marketing relationships, access to larger client bases and significantly greater resources for the development of their offerings. Moreover, because our market is highly competitive and subject to rapid change, it is possible that new entrants, especially those with substantial resources, more efficient operating models, more rapid technology and content development cycles, or lower marketing costs, could introduce new solutions that disrupt our market and better address the needs of our clients and potential clients.
 Further, certain of our competitors may challenge our intellectual property, may develop additional competing or superior technologies and processes and compete more aggressively and sustain that competition over a longer period of time than we could. Our solutions may be rendered obsolete or uneconomical by technological advances or entirely different approaches developed by one or more of our competitors. As more companies develop new intellectual property in our market, there is the possibility of a competitor acquiring patents or other rights that may limit our ability to update our technologies and products which may impact demand for our products. See the section titled “Risk Factors—Assertions against us, by third parties alleging infringement or other violation of their intellectual property rights, could result in significant costs and substantially harm our business and results of operations” for additional information.
 7

Intellectual Property 
 We rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws, and confidentiality and invention assignment agreements to protect our intellectual property rights. Our patents cover various aspects of the Intapp Platform. The term of individual patents depends on the legal term for patents in the countries in which they are granted. There is no active patent litigation involving any of our patents and we have not received any notices claiming that our activities infringe a third-party’s patent.
 We cannot guarantee that patents will be issued from any of our pending applications or that, if patents are issued, they will be of sufficient scope or strength to provide meaningful protection for our technology. Notwithstanding the scope of the patent protection available to us, a competitor could develop methods or devices that are not covered by our patents. Furthermore, numerous United States and foreign-issued patents and patent applications owned by third parties exist in the fields in which we are developing solutions. Because patent applications can take many years to publish, there may be applications unknown to us, which may later result in issued patents that our existing or future solutions or technologies may be alleged to infringe.
 In the future, we may need to engage in litigation to enforce patents issued or licensed to us, to protect our trade secrets or know-how, to defend against claims of infringement of the rights of others or to determine the scope and validity of the proprietary rights of others. Litigation could be costly and could divert our attention from other functions and responsibilities. Furthermore, even if our patents are found to be valid and infringed, a court may refuse to grant injunctive relief against the infringer and instead grant us monetary damages or ongoing royalties. Such monetary compensation may be insufficient to adequately offset the damage to our business caused by the infringer’s competition in the market. Adverse determinations in litigation could subject us to significant liabilities to third parties, require us to seek licenses from third parties or could prevent us from selling or using the solution accused of infringement, any of which could severely harm our business. See “Risk Factors –Assertions against us, by third parties alleging infringement or other violation of their intellectual property rights, could result in significant costs and substantially harm our business and results of operations.” and “–Failure to protect our intellectual property could substantially harm our business and results of operations.” for additional information.
 We also rely upon trademarks to build and maintain the integrity of our brand and, in part, upon trade secrets, know-how and continuing technological innovation, and licensing arrangements, to develop and maintain our competitive position. We protect our proprietary rights through a variety of methods, including confidentiality and assignment agreements with suppliers, employees, consultants, and others who may have access to our proprietary information.
 Regulations 
 We are subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the United States and abroad that involve matters central to our business. Some of these laws and regulations are still evolving and being tested in courts and could be interpreted in ways that could harm our business. These may involve privacy, data protection, content, intellectual property, data collection and processing, data security, and data retention and deletion. In particular, we are subject to federal, state, and foreign laws regarding data protection and privacy. Foreign data protection and privacy laws and regulations can impose different obligations that may be more restrictive than those in the United States. Some United States federal and state and foreign laws and regulations in some cases may be enforced by private parties in addition to government entities. These laws and regulations are constantly evolving and may be subject to significant change. As a result, the application, interpretation, and enforcement of these laws and regulations are often uncertain, particularly in the evolving industry in which we operate. This may result in laws and regulations being interpreted and applied inconsistently from country to country and also inconsistently with our current policies and practices. For example, the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) has resulted and will continue to result in significantly greater compliance burdens and costs for companies with users and operations in the European Union. Under GDPR, fines of up to 20 million Euros or up to 4% of the annual global revenues of the infringer, whichever is greater, can be imposed for violations. In addition, California adopted the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”), which went into effect on January 1, 2020, and limits how we may collect and use certain data. The impact of this law on us and others in our industry is and will remain unclear until additional regulations are issued. The effects of the CCPA are potentially far-reaching, however, and may require us to modify our data processing practices and policies and incur substantial compliance-related costs and expenses. Additionally, California approved the California Privacy Rights Act (“CPRA”), which goes into effect on January 1, 2023, and changes privacy rights under the CCPA, including with respect to business-to-business transactions. Non-compliance with these laws could result in penalties 
 8

or significant legal liability. We have invested, and continue to invest, human and technology resources into our GDPR compliance efforts and our data privacy compliance efforts generally.
 Seasonality
 We generally experience seasonality in billings with our clients, and we typically record a higher percentage of billings in our fourth quarter than in the other quarters.

We make available on or through our website certain reports and amendments to those reports that we file with or furnish to the SEC in accordance with the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (“Exchange Act”). These include our annual reports on Form 10-K, our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, and our current reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, and our Proxy Statement for our annual meeting of stockholders. We make available on our website at www.intapp.com, free of charge, copies of these reports and other information as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file such material with, or furnish it to, the SEC. Further corporate governance information, including our corporate governance guidelines, code of business conduct and ethics, and committee charters, is also available on our investor relations website under the heading “Corporate Governance.”
