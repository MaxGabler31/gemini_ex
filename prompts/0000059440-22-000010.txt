The cash flows and comprehensive income related to Douglas Elliman have not been segregated and are included in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows and Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income, respectively, for all periods presented. Unless otherwise indicated, the information in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements refer only to Vector Group’s continuing operations and do not include discussion of balances or activity of Douglas Elliman.
Spin-off of and Relationship with Douglas Elliman
On December 29, 2021, at 11:59 p.m., New York City time, we completed the distribution to our stockholders (including Vector Group common stock underlying outstanding stock options and restricted stock awards) of the common stock of Douglas Elliman. Each holder of our common stock (including common stock underlying outstanding stock option awards and restricted stock awards) received one share of Douglas Elliman’s common stock for every two shares of our common stock (including Vector Group common stock underlying outstanding stock option awards and restricted stock awards) held of record as of the close of business, New York City time, on December 20, 2021. An aggregate of 77,720,159 shares of Douglas Elliman’s common stock were issued and distributed, with fractional shares converted to cash and paid to applicable Vector Group stockholders.
Following the spin-off, Douglas Elliman is a separate public company listed on the New York Stock Exchange and trades under the symbol “DOUG”, and owns the real estate services and property technology investment business formerly owned by Vector Group through Vector Group’s subsidiary New Valley LLC, a Delaware limited liability company. Vector Group and Douglas Elliman entered into a Distribution Agreement and several ancillary agreements for the purpose of accomplishing the distribution of Douglas Elliman common stock to Vector Group’s stockholders. These agreements also govern our relationship with Douglas Elliman after the spin-off and provide for the allocation of employee benefits, tax and additional liabilities and obligations attributable to periods before and after the distribution. These agreements also include a Transition Services Agreement with respect to transition services and a number of ongoing commercial relationships. The Distribution Agreement includes an agreement that Vector Group and Douglas Elliman will provide each other with appropriate indemnities with respect to liabilities arising out of the business transferred to Douglas Elliman by Vector Group. Douglas Elliman is party to other arrangements with Vector Group and its subsidiaries. We also entered into a Tax Disaffiliation Agreement with Douglas Elliman that governs each of our respective rights, responsibilities and obligations with respect to taxes and tax benefits, the filing of tax returns, the control of audits and other tax matters. 
In addition, Douglas Elliman has been engaged by developers as the sole broker or the co-broker for several real estate development projects that New Valley owns an interest in through its real estate venture investments. 
Following the spin-off, there is an overlap between certain officers of Vector Group and Douglas Elliman. Howard M. Lorber serves as the President and Chief Executive Officer of Vector Group and of Douglas Elliman. Richard J. Lampen serves as the Chief Operating Officer of Vector Group and of Douglas Elliman, J. Bryant Kirkland III serves as the Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer of Vector Group and of Douglas Elliman, Marc N. Bell serves as the General Counsel and Secretary of Vector Group and of Douglas Elliman, and J. David Ballard serves as Senior Vice President, Enterprise Efficiency and Chief Technology Officer of Vector Group and of Douglas Elliman. Furthermore, immediately following the spin-off, three of the members of our Board of Directors, Messrs. Lorber and Lampen as well as Wilson L. White, will also serve as directors of Douglas Elliman.
Overview
Vector Group is a holding company and is engaged principally in two business segments:
•Tobacco: the manufacture and sale of cigarettes in the United States through our Liggett Group LLC and Vector Tobacco LLC subsidiaries, and 
•Real Estate: the real estate investment business through our subsidiary New Valley LLC, which (i) has interests in numerous real estate projects across the United States and (ii) is seeking to acquire or invest in additional real estate properties or projects. 
Strategy
Our strategy is to maximize stockholder value by increasing the profitability of our subsidiaries in the following ways:
Liggett and Vector Tobacco
•Continue to offer an excellent value proposition in the U.S. cigarette industry by consistently delivering high quality products within the discount segment;
•Capitalize on our tobacco subsidiaries’ cost advantage in the United States cigarette market due to the favorable treatment that they receive under the Master Settlement Agreement (“MSA”);
•Focus marketing and selling efforts on the discount segment, continue to build volume and margin in focus discount brands (Eagle 20’s, Pyramid, and Montego) and utilize core brand equity to selectively build distribution;
•Selectively expand the portfolio of partner brands and private label brands utilizing a pricing strategy that offers long-term price stability for customers;
•Increase operational efficiency by developing and adopting an organizational structure to maximize profit potential; and
•Identify, develop and launch relevant new tobacco products to the market in the future.
New Valley
•Continue to leverage our expertise as direct investors by actively pursuing real estate investments; and
•Invest our excess funds opportunistically in real estate situations that we believe can maximize stockholder value.
Tobacco Operations
General.  Our Tobacco segment operates through our two subsidiaries, Liggett and Vector Tobacco. Liggett is the operating successor to Liggett & Myers Tobacco Company, which was founded in 1873. Vector Tobacco is a discount cigarette manufacturer selling product in the deep discount category. In this report, certain references to “Liggett” refer to our tobacco operations, including the business of Liggett and Vector Tobacco, unless otherwise specified.
For the year ended December 31, 2021, Liggett was the fourth-largest manufacturer of cigarettes in the United States in terms of unit sales. Liggett’s manufacturing facilities are located in Mebane, North Carolina where it manufactures most of Vector Tobacco’s cigarettes pursuant to a contract manufacturing agreement. At present, Liggett and Vector Tobacco have no foreign operations.
The U.S. cigarette market consists of premium cigarettes, which are generally marketed under well-recognized brand names at higher retail prices to adult smokers with a strong preference for branded products, and discount cigarettes, which are marketed at lower retail prices to adult smokers who are more value conscious. In recent years, however, the discounting of premium cigarettes has become far more significant in the marketplace. Since 2004, Liggett has only produced discount cigarettes and all of Liggett’s units sold in 2021, 2020 and 2019 were in the discount segment. 
According to data from Management Science Associates, Inc., the discount segment represented 28.3% of the total U.S. cigarette market in 2021 compared to 28.6% in 2020 and 28.3% in 2019. Liggett’s domestic shipments of approximately 8.6 billion cigarettes during 2021 accounted for 4.1% of the total cigarettes shipped in the United States during such year. Liggett’s market share was 4.1% in 2021, 4.1% in 2020 and 4.0% in 2019. According to Management Science Associates, Liggett held a share of approximately 14.4% of the overall discount market segment for 2021 compared to 14.2% for 2020 and 14.3% for 2019.
Liggett produces cigarettes in approximately 100 combinations of length, style and packaging. Liggett’s current brand portfolio includes:
•Eagle 20’s — a brand positioned in the deep discount segment for long-term growth re-launched as a national brand in 2013; Eagle 20’s represented 57.0% of Liggett’s unit volume in 2021, 62.0% in 2020 and 59.9% in 2019. Eagle 20’s is the largest seller in Liggett’s family of brands,
•Pyramid — the industry’s first deep discount product with a brand identity re-launched in the second quarter of 2009; Pyramid represented 19.5% of Liggett’s unit volume in 2021, 23.2% in 2020 and 26.5% in 2019,
•Montego — From August 2020 to December 2021, Liggett expanded the distribution of its Montego deep discount brand into a total of 35 states. Montego was Liggett’s third-largest brand for the year ended December 31, 2021. Prior to August 2020, Montego was sold in select targeted markets in four states. Montego’s volume represented 
approximately 15.9% of Liggett’s unit volume for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to approximately 6.0% for the year ended December 31, 2020.
•Grand Prix, Liggett Select, Eve, USA and various partner brands and private label brands.
Under the MSA reached in November 1998 with 46 states and various territories, cigarette manufacturers selling product in the U.S. must make settlement payments to the states and territories based on how many cigarettes they sell annually. Liggett, however, is not required to make any payments unless its market share exceeds its grandfathered market share established under the MSA of approximately 1.65% of the U.S. cigarette market. Additionally, Vector Tobacco has no payment obligation unless its market share exceeds approximately 0.28% of the U.S. cigarette market. We believe our tobacco subsidiaries have gained a sustainable cost advantage over their competitors as a result of the settlement.
Liggett’s and Vector Tobacco’s payments under the MSA are based on each respective company’s incremental market share above the grandfathered market share applicable to each respective company. Thus, if Liggett’s total market share is 3%, its MSA payment is based on 1.35%, which is the difference between Liggett’s total market share of 3% and its approximate applicable grandfathered market share of 1.65%. We anticipate that both Liggett’s and Vector Tobacco’s payment exemptions will be fully utilized for the foreseeable future.
The source of industry data in this report is Management Science Associates, Inc., an independent third-party data management organization that collects wholesale and retail shipment data from various cigarette manufacturers and distributors and provides analysis of market share unit sales volume for individual companies and the industry as a whole. Management Science Associates, Inc.’s information relating to unit sales volume and market share of certain smaller, primarily deep discount, cigarette manufacturers is based on estimates developed by Management Science Associates, Inc.
Sales, Marketing and Distribution.  Liggett’s products are distributed from a central distribution center in Mebane, North Carolina to 15 public warehouses located throughout the United States by third-party trucking companies. These warehouses serve as local distribution centers for Liggett’s customers. 
Liggett’s customers are primarily wholesalers and distributors of tobacco and convenience products as well as large grocery, drug and convenience store chains. Two customers accounted for 14% and 12% of Liggett’s revenues in 2021, 18% and 12% of Liggett’s revenues in 2020, and 17% and 12% of Liggett’s revenues in 2019. Concentrations of credit risk with respect to trade receivables are generally limited due to Liggett’s large number of customers. Liggett’s two largest customers, represented approximately 0% and 2%, respectively, of net accounts receivable at December 31, 2021, 5% and 4%, respectively, at December 31, 2020, and 2% and 4%, respectively, at December 31, 2019. Ongoing credit evaluations of customers’ financial condition are performed and, generally, no security is required. Liggett maintains appropriate reserves for potential credit losses and such losses, in the aggregate, have not exceeded management’s expectations.
Trademarks.  All of the major trademarks used by Liggett are federally registered or are in the process of being registered in the United States and other markets. Trademark registrations typically have a duration of ten years and can be renewed at Liggett’s option prior to their expiration date.
In view of the significance of cigarette brand awareness among consumers, management believes that the protection afforded by these trademarks is material to the conduct of its business. These trademarks are pledged as collateral for certain of our senior secured debt.
Manufacturing.  Liggett purchases and maintains leaf tobacco inventory to support its cigarette manufacturing requirements. Liggett believes that there is a sufficient worldwide supply of tobacco to satisfy its current production requirements. Liggett stores its leaf tobacco inventory in warehouses in North Carolina and Virginia. There are several different types of leaf tobacco, including flue-cured, burley, Maryland, oriental, cut stems and reconstituted sheet. Leaf components of American-style cigarettes are generally the flue-cured and burley tobaccos. While premium and discount brands use many of the same tobacco products, input ratios of these products may vary between premium and discount products. Liggett purchases its tobacco requirements from both domestic and foreign leaf dealers, much of it under long-term purchase commitments. As of December 31, 2021, the majority of Liggett’s commitments were for the purchase of foreign tobacco. 
Liggett’s cigarette manufacturing facility was designed for the execution of short production runs in a cost-effective manner, which enables Liggett to manufacture and market approximately 100 different cigarette brand styles. Liggett’s facility produced approximately 8.5 billion cigarettes in 2021, but maintains the capacity to produce approximately 17.6 billion cigarettes per year. Vector Tobacco has contracted with Liggett to produce most of its cigarettes at Liggett’s manufacturing facility in Mebane. 
Competition.  Liggett’s competition is divided into two segments. The first segment consists of the three largest manufacturers of cigarettes in the United States: Philip Morris USA Inc., which is owned by Altria Group, Inc., RJ Reynolds Tobacco Company, which is owned by British American Tobacco Plc, and ITG Brands LLC, which is owned by Imperial Brands Plc. These three manufacturers, while primarily premium cigarette-based companies, also produce and sell discount 
cigarettes. The second segment of competition is comprised of a group of smaller manufacturers and importers, most of which sell deep discount cigarettes. 
Historically, there have been substantial barriers to entry into the cigarette business, including extensive distribution organizations, large capital outlays for sophisticated production equipment, substantial inventory investment, costly promotional spending, regulated advertising and, for premium brands, strong brand loyalty. However, after the MSA was signed, some smaller manufacturers and importers that are not parties to the MSA (“Non-Participating Manufacturers”) were able to overcome these competitive barriers due to an unintended cost advantage resulting from the MSA. These Non-Participating Manufacturers were subsequently impacted by the state statutes enacted pursuant to the MSA; however, these companies still have significant market share in the aggregate through competitive discounting in this segment.
In the cigarette business, Liggett competes on dual fronts. Philip Morris and RJ Reynolds, the two largest cigarette manufacturers, compete among themselves for premium brand market share based on advertising, promotional activities, trade rebates and incentives. They compete with Liggett and others for discount market share, primarily on the basis of price and in store merchandising. These competitors have substantially greater financial resources than Liggett, and most of their brands have greater sales and consumer recognition than Liggett’s products. Liggett’s discount brands must also compete in the marketplace with the smaller manufacturers’ and importers’ deep discount brands.
According to Management Science Associates Inc.’s data, the unit sales of Philip Morris and RJ Reynolds accounted in the aggregate for 73.8% of the domestic cigarette market in 2021. Liggett’s domestic shipments of approximately 8.6 billion cigarettes during 2021 accounted for 4.1% of the approximately 212 billion cigarettes shipped in the United States, compared to 9.2 billion cigarettes in 2020 (4.1%) and 9.0 billion cigarettes in 2019 (4.0%).
In 2021 industry wide shipments in the United States decreased by 6.5% (approximately 14.7 billion units) and for the five year period 2016 to 2021, industry-wide shipments of cigarettes in the United States have declined by approximately 3.6% per annum. Liggett’s management believes that industry-wide shipments of cigarettes in the United States will continue to decline as a result of numerous factors. These factors include health considerations, diminishing social acceptance of smoking, and a wide variety of federal, state and local laws limiting smoking in public places, as well as increases in federal and state excise taxes and settlement-related expenses which have contributed to higher cigarette prices in recent years.
Philip Morris and RJ Reynolds domination of the domestic cigarette market makes it more difficult for Liggett to compete for shelf space in retail outlets and could impact price competition in the market, either of which could have a material adverse effect on its sales volume, operating income and cash flows.
Historically, Philip Morris and RJ Reynolds, have been able to determine cigarette prices for the various pricing tiers within the industry. Market pressures have historically caused other cigarette manufacturers to bring their prices in line with the levels established by these two major manufacturers. Off-list price discounting and similar promotional activity by manufacturers, however, has substantially affected the average price differential at retail, which can be significantly less than the manufacturers’ list price gap. In addition, in recent years, the discount segment has experienced increased price competition from smaller manufacturers and this has led to more aggressive price discounting of certain “deep discount” brands when compared to “traditional discount” brands. Consequently, changes in the price gap of products at retail between “deep discount” and “traditional discount” has led to shifts in price segment performance.
Legislation and Regulation
In the United States, tobacco products are subject to substantial and increasing legislation, regulation, taxation, and litigation, which have a negative effect on revenue and profitability. 
The cigarette industry continues to be challenged on numerous fronts. The industry faces increased pressure from anti-smoking groups and continued smoking and health litigation, the effects of which, at this time, we are unable to quantify. Product liability litigation continues to adversely affect the cigarette industry. See Item 1A. “Risk Factors”, Item 3. “Legal Proceedings” and Note 15 to our consolidated financial statements, which contain a description of litigation.
The harmful physical effects of cigarette smoking have been publicized for many years and, in the opinion of Liggett’s management, have had and will continue to have an adverse effect on cigarette sales. Since 1964, the Surgeon General of the United States and the Secretary of Health and Human Services have released a number of reports stating that cigarette smoking is a causative factor with respect to a variety of health hazards, including certain cancers and heart and lung disease and have recommended various government actions to reduce the incidence of smoking. In 1997, Liggett publicly acknowledged that, as the Surgeon General and respected medical researchers have found, smoking causes health problems, including lung cancer, heart and vascular disease, and emphysema.
On June 22, 2009, the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act (the “TCA”) became law. The law grants the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) broad authority over the manufacture, sale, marketing and packaging of 
tobacco products, although FDA is prohibited from banning all cigarettes or all smokeless tobacco products. Among other measures, the law (under various deadlines):
•requires FDA to develop graphic warnings for cigarette packages and grants FDA authority to require new warnings;
•imposes new restrictions on the sale and distribution of tobacco products, including significant new restrictions on tobacco product advertising and promotion, as well as the use of brand and trade names;
•bans the use of “light,” “mild,” “low” or similar descriptors on tobacco products;
•bans the use of “characterizing flavors” in cigarettes other than tobacco or menthol;
•gives FDA the authority to impose tobacco product standards that are appropriate for the protection of the public health (by, for example, requiring reduction or elimination of the use of particular constituents or components, requiring product testing, or addressing other aspects of tobacco product construction, constituents, properties or labeling);
•requires manufacturers to obtain FDA review and authorization for the marketing of certain new or modified tobacco products which could ultimately result in FDA prohibiting Liggett from selling certain of its products;
•requires pre-market approval by FDA for tobacco products represented (through labels, labeling, advertising, or other means) as presenting a lower risk of harm or tobacco-related disease;
•requires manufacturers to report ingredients and harmful constituents and requires FDA to disclose certain constituent information to the public;
•mandates that manufacturers test and report on ingredients and constituents identified by FDA as requiring such testing to protect the public health and allows FDA to require the disclosure of testing results to the public;
•requires manufacturers to submit to FDA certain information regarding the health, toxicological, behavioral or physiological effects of tobacco products;
•requires FDA to establish “good manufacturing practices” to be followed at tobacco manufacturing facilities;
•authorizes FDA to require the reduction of nicotine (although it may not require the reduction of nicotine yields of a tobacco product to zero) and the potential reduction or elimination of other constituents, including menthol;
•imposes (and allows FDA to impose) various recordkeeping and reporting requirements on tobacco product manufacturers; and
•grants FDA broad regulatory authority to impose additional restrictions.
The TCA imposes user fees on certain tobacco product manufacturers in order to fund tobacco-related FDA activities. User fees are allocated among tobacco product classes according to a formula set out in the statute, and then among manufacturers and importers within each class based on market share. FDA user fees for 2021 were $23,832 for Liggett and Vector Tobacco combined and will likely increase in the future.
The law also required establishment of a Tobacco Products Scientific Advisory Committee (“TPSAC”) to provide advice, information and recommendations with respect to safety, dependence and health issues related to tobacco products. 
Menthol and Flavorings
On January 27, 2022, FDA announced that it expects to issue a proposed rule to prohibit menthol as a characterizing flavor in cigarettes by the spring of 2022. For the year ended December 31, 2021, approximately 19% of our cigarette unit sales were menthol flavored. We cannot predict how a tobacco product standard or a restriction on the sale and distribution of tobacco products with menthol, if ultimately issued by FDA, will impact product sales, whether it will have a material adverse effect on Liggett or Vector Tobacco, or whether it will impact Liggett and Vector Tobacco to a greater degree than other companies in the industry. In addition to FDA, certain states, including California and Massachusetts, have, or are considering, a ban on the sale of menthol cigarettes.
Advertising and Warnings on Packaging
The TCA imposes significant new restrictions on the advertising and promotion of tobacco products. As written, these regulations significantly limit the ability of manufacturers, distributors and retailers to advertise and promote tobacco products, by, for example, restricting the use of color and graphics in advertising, limiting the use of outdoor advertising, restricting the 
sale and distribution of non-tobacco items and services, gifts, and sponsorship of events, and imposing restrictions on the use for cigarette or smokeless tobacco products of trade or brand names that are used for non-tobacco products.
On March 18, 2020, FDA issued a final rule to require new health warnings on cigarette packages and in cigarette advertisements. This rule requires each cigarette package and advertisement to bear one of eleven textual warning statements accompanied by a corresponding graphic image covering 50% of the area of the front and rear panels of cigarette packages and at least 20% of the area at the top of cigarette advertisements. The rule establishes marketing requirements that include the random and equal display and distribution of the required warnings for cigarette packages and quarterly rotation of the required warnings for cigarette advertisements. The final rule provided for an effective date of June 18, 2021, 15 months after issuance of the final rule. On April 3, 2020, Liggett, along with other tobacco companies, commenced an action against the FDA in the United States District Court, District of Texas (Tyler Division) challenging the legality of the graphic warning final rule. On February 10, 2022, the court granted a motion to postpone the effective date of the final rule to April 9, 2023. The inclusion of new warnings and rotation requirements pursuant to the final rule would likely increase Liggett’s production costs.
Product Review
The TCA requires premarket review of “new tobacco products.” A “new tobacco product” is one that was not commercially marketed in the United States as of February 15, 2007 or that was modified after that date. In general, before a company may commercially market a “new tobacco product,” it must either (a) submit an application and obtain an order from FDA permitting the product to be marketed; or (b) submit an application and receive an FDA order finding the product to be “substantially equivalent” to a “predicate” tobacco product that was commercially marketed in the U.S. as of February 15, 2007. A “substantially equivalent” tobacco product is one that has the “same characteristics” as the predicate or one that has “different characteristics” but does not raise “different questions of public health.”
Manufacturers of products first introduced after February 15, 2007 and before March 22, 2011 who submitted a substantial equivalence application to FDA prior to March 23, 2011 may continue to market the tobacco product unless FDA issues an order that the product is not substantially equivalent (“NSE”). Failure to timely submit the application, or FDA’s conclusion that such a “new tobacco product” is not substantially equivalent, will cause the product to be deemed misbranded and/or adulterated. After March 22, 2011, a “new tobacco product” may not be marketed without an FDA substantial equivalence determination. Prior to the deadline, Liggett and Vector Tobacco submitted substantial equivalence applications to FDA for each of their respective cigarette brand styles.
To date, Liggett has received NSE orders relating to 20 cigarette brand styles. Liggett has elected to pursue administrative appeals with FDA for 14 of the 20 cigarette brand styles and discontinued six brand styles. Sales of these 14 cigarette brand styles accounted for approximately 0.6% of the tobacco segment’s annual revenue in 2021. Liggett is continuing to sell the affected cigarette brand styles during the administrative appeal process. Vector Tobacco received NSE orders relating to three cigarette brand styles in November 2017. Sales of these three cigarette brand styles accounted for approximately 0.4% of the tobacco segment’s annual revenue in 2021. Vector Tobacco elected to pursue administrative appeals with FDA and is continuing to sell the affected cigarette brand styles during the administrative appeal process. 
On April 5, 2018, FDA announced a change in its process for reviewing “provisional” substantial equivalence applications. Both Liggett and Vector Tobacco submitted provisional substantial equivalence applications for all of their respective cigarette brand styles. FDA announced that it will continue to review the approximately 1,000 pending provisional applications that were determined to have the greatest potential to raise different questions of public health and will remove from review the approximately 1,500 provisional applications that were determined less likely to do so. 
As a result, Vector Tobacco received a letter from FDA in April 2018, advising that FDA does not intend to conduct further review of Vector Tobacco’s remaining substantial equivalence applications that have not yet received a substantial equivalence determination unless one of the following occurs: (i) the new tobacco product that is the subject of the provisional application is also the subject of another pending application submitted by the same manufacturer; (ii) FDA receives new information (e.g., from inspectional findings) suggesting that the new tobacco product that is the subject of a provisional application is more likely to have the potential to raise different questions of public health than previously determined; or (iii) FDA has reason to believe that the new tobacco product was not introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce for commercial distribution in the United States after February 15, 2007, and prior to March 22, 2011 ((i), (ii) and (iii) are collectively, the “Conditions”).
On May 21, 2018, FDA sent a letter to Liggett stating that the products identified in the letter would be removed from review unless one of the Conditions occurs. 
We cannot predict whether FDA will deem Liggett’s and Vector Tobacco’s outstanding applications to be sufficient to support determinations of substantial equivalence for the products covered by these substantial equivalence reports. It is possible that FDA could determine that some, or all, of these products are “not substantially equivalent” to a preexisting 
tobacco product, as the agency has already done for 20 of Liggett’s applications. NSE orders for other cigarette styles may require us to stop the sale of the applicable cigarettes and other cigarette styles and could have a material adverse effect on us.
Nicotine
Under the TCA, FDA may adopt a tobacco product standard for nicotine if the agency concludes that such a standard is appropriate for the protection of the public health. FDA may refer the proposed regulation to the TPSAC for a report and recommendation. FDA may consider a wide range of issues prior to the promulgation of a final rule, including the technical achievability of compliance with the proposed product standard. The rulemaking process could take many months or years and once a final rule is published it ordinarily would not be expected to take effect until at least one year after the date of publication. We cannot predict how a tobacco product standard, if ultimately issued by FDA, will impact product sales, whether it will have a material adverse effect on Liggett or Vector Tobacco, or whether it will impact Liggett and Vector Tobacco to a greater degree than other companies in the industry.
State Minimum Price Legislation
In 2020, voters in the State of Colorado approved Proposition EE, increasing taxes on cigarettes, tobacco and nicotine products. In addition to raising the Colorado state excise tax on cigarettes, Proposition EE included a provision that fixed the minimum retail price of cigarettes in Colorado at $7.00 per pack as of January 1, 2021, and thus reduced the competitive advantage of our Company’s discount priced cigarettes in the Colorado marketplace. We have commenced litigation against Colorado challenging the legality of the minimum price provision contained in Proposition EE, the outcome of which cannot be predicted. Although no other state has adopted a fixed minimum retail price law for cigarettes, other states may attempt to do so if the minimum price provision in Proposition EE is determined by the courts to be legal. In the event that litigation challenging the minimum price legislation is not successful or other states pass similar legislation that withstands judicial scrutiny, the result could have a material adverse effect on our future financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
The MSA and Other State Settlement Agreements
In March 1996, March 1997, and March 1998, Liggett entered into settlements of tobacco-related litigation with 45 states and territories. The settlements released Liggett from all tobacco-related claims within those states and territories, including claims for health care cost reimbursement and claims concerning sales of cigarettes to minors.
In November 1998, Philip Morris, R.J. Reynolds and two other companies (the “Original Participating Manufacturers” or “OPMs”) and Liggett (together with any other tobacco product manufacturer that becomes a signatory, the “Subsequent Participating Manufacturers” or “SPMs”), (the OPMs and SPMs are hereinafter referred to jointly as the “Participating Manufacturers”) entered into the MSA with 46 states and various territories (collectively, the “Settling States”) to settle the asserted and unasserted healthcare cost recovery and certain other claims of those Settling States. The MSA received final judicial approval in each Settling State.
As a result of the MSA, the Settling States released Liggett and Vector Tobacco from:
•all claims of the Settling States and their respective political subdivisions and other recipients of state health care funds, relating to: (i) past conduct arising out of the use, sale, distribution, manufacture, development, advertising and marketing of tobacco products; and (ii) the health effects of, the exposure to, or research, statements or warnings about, tobacco products; and
•all monetary claims of the Settling States and their respective subdivisions and other recipients of state health care funds, relating to future conduct arising out of the use of, or exposure to, tobacco products that have been manufactured in the ordinary course of business.
The MSA restricts tobacco product advertising and marketing within the Settling States and otherwise restricts the activities of Participating Manufacturers. Among other things, the MSA prohibits the targeting of youth in the advertising, promotion or marketing of tobacco products; bans the use of cartoon characters in all tobacco advertising and promotion; limits each Participating Manufacturer to one tobacco brand name sponsorship during any 12-month period; bans all outdoor advertising, with certain limited exceptions; prohibits payments for tobacco product placement in various media; bans gift offers based on the purchase of tobacco products without sufficient proof that the intended recipient is an adult; prohibits Participating Manufacturers from licensing third parties to advertise tobacco brand names in any manner prohibited under the MSA; and prohibits Participating Manufacturers from using as a tobacco product brand name any nationally recognized non-tobacco brand or trade name or the names of sports teams, entertainment groups or individual celebrities.
The MSA also requires Participating Manufacturers to affirm corporate principles to comply with the MSA and to reduce underage usage of tobacco products and imposes restrictions on lobbying activities conducted on behalf of Participating 
Manufacturers. In addition, the MSA provides for the appointment of an independent auditor to calculate and determine the amounts of payments owed pursuant to the MSA.
Under the payment provisions of the MSA, the Participating Manufacturers are required to make annual payments of $9.0 billion (subject to applicable adjustments, offsets and reductions). These annual payments are allocated based on unit volume of domestic cigarette shipments. The payment obligations under the MSA are the several, and not joint, obligations of each Participating Manufacturer and are not the responsibility of any parent or affiliate of a Participating Manufacturer. 
Liggett has no payment obligations under the MSA except to the extent its market share exceeds a market share exemption of approximately 1.65% of total cigarettes sold in the United States. Vector Tobacco has no payment obligations under the MSA except to the extent its market share exceeds a market share exemption of approximately 0.28% of total cigarettes sold in the United States. Liggett and Vector Tobacco’s domestic shipments accounted for 4.1% of the total cigarettes sold in the United States in 2021. If Liggett’s or Vector Tobacco’s market share exceeds their respective market share exemption in a given year, then on April 15 of the following year, Liggett and/or Vector Tobacco, as the case may be, must pay on each excess unit an amount equal (on a per-unit basis) to that due from the OPMs for that year. 
Liggett may have additional payment obligations under the MSA and its other settlement agreements with the states. See Item 1A. “Risk Factors” and Note 15 to our consolidated financial statements.

In our real estate investment business, we seek to acquire investment interests in domestic and international real estate projects through debt and equity investments. We and our partners seek to enhance the cash flows and returns from our investments by using varying levels of leverage. In addition, we and our partners may earn incentives on certain investments if the investments achieve rates of return that exceed targeted thresholds. Our real estate investments are located in the United States and Bermuda and we may pursue growth in other markets where we identify attractive opportunities to invest in or acquire assets and to achieve strong risk-adjusted returns. We strive to invest at attractive valuations, capitalize on distressed situations where possible, create opportunities for superior valuation gains and cash flow returns and monetize assets at appropriate times to realize value. As of December 31, 2021, our real estate investment business held interests in joint ventures recorded on our financial statements at approximately $105.1 million and approximately $9.1 million in consolidated real estate investments.
For additional information concerning these investments, see Note 10 to our consolidated financial statements and “Summary of Real Estate Investments” located in Item 7. - “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”
Human Capital
We have long believed that the diversity and talent of our people provide a competitive advantage to Vector Group and its subsidiaries. As of December 31, 2021, we employed approximately 500 employees, of which approximately 475 were employed by Liggett, and approximately 25 were employed at Vector Group’s corporate headquarters.
Approximately 31% of the Liggett workforce has been employed by the Company for more than 15 years. Liggett has maintained long relationships with its employees due to its philosophy of listening to their comments and concerns and regularly engaging them to enhance its human capital management objectives. 
Historically, this has occurred with frequent communication across all levels of Liggett and in-person events with senior management. We believe this philosophy served Liggett well during the COVID-19 pandemic. 
The health and safety of our employees is foundational to achieving our human capital objectives. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, Liggett’s management proactively took the step of closing its cigarette factory for two weeks, beginning March 15, 2020, for scheduled maintenance and to plan for the necessary COVID-19 manufacturing protocols. Liggett’s management implemented and continues to use an extensive set of additional protocols and procedures to ensure the safety of its workforce. Among other things, Liggett introduced mandatory mask-wearing, physical distancing and reconfigured certain workspaces in its cigarette factory and the headquarters of Liggett Vector Brands. 
Beginning in March 2020, management provided employees with periodic updates on Liggett’s business, including its response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Liggett believes that these initiatives were key in the successful execution of its manufacturing and sales operations throughout the COVID-19 pandemic.
Liggett offers comprehensive benefit programs to its employees which provide them with, among other things, medical, dental, and vision healthcare; 401(k) matching contributions; paid maternity leave; tuition assistance; and paid vacation time. 
Of the approximately 475 employees at Liggett as of December 31, 2021, approximately 280 were employed at Liggett’s Mebane factory, 140 were employed throughout the United States in sales positions and the remaining 55 were employed in administrative functions supporting and coordinating sales and marketing efforts. 
Of the employees at Liggett’s factory, approximately 200 were hourly employees who are represented by four unions affiliated with either the AFL-CIO or the Teamsters. Liggett has not experienced any significant work stoppages since 1977.
We will continue to listen, while engaging and connecting with employees at Liggett to further our human capital management objectives by continuing the initiatives we first began during the COVID-19 pandemic.
