Overview
 
H-CYTE, Inc (“the Company”) is a hybrid-biopharmaceutical company dedicated to developing and delivering new treatments for patients with chronic respiratory and pulmonary disorders. During the last three years, the Company has evolved into two separate divisions with its entrance into the biologics and device development space (“Biotech Division”). This division is complementary to the Company’s current Lung Health Institute (LHI) autologous infusion therapy business (“Infusion Division”) and is focused on underserved disease states. On September 8, 2021, the Company announced that its Lung Health Institute facilities changed their names to Centers for Respiratory Health as the clinics continue to deliver treatments for patients with chronic respiratory and pulmonary disorders. The Company continues its efforts related to the development and commercialization of the DenerveX device outside of the U.S. As of and for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, there has been no material activity.
 
The consolidated results for H-CYTE include the following wholly-owned subsidiaries: H-CYTE Management, LLC, Medovex Corp, Cognitive Health Institute, LLC, and Lung Institute Tampa, LLC and the results include Lung Institute Dallas, PLLC (“LI Dallas”), Lung Institute Nashville, PLLC (“LI Nashville”), Lung Institute Pittsburgh, PLLC (“LI Pittsburgh”), and Lung Institute Scottsdale, LLC (“LI Scottsdale”), as Variable Interest Entities (“VIEs”). Additionally, H-CYTE Management, LLC is the operator and manager of the various Lung Health Institute (LHI) clinics: LI Dallas, LI Nashville, LI Pittsburgh, and LI Scottsdale. The LI Dallas and LI Pittsburgh clinics did not reopen in 2020 after the temporary closure of all LI clinics due to COVID-19. These two clinics will remain permanently closed. During the first quarter of 2022, the Company decided to close the LI Tampa and LI Nashville clinics, the LI Scottsdale clinic will remain open.
 
On September 11, 2020, with the closing of the Rights Offering, FWHC, LLC, FWHC Bridge, LLC, and FWHC Bridge Friends, LLC (collectively known as “FWHC”) gained control of the Company by subsequently owning approximately 61% of the fully diluted shares of the Company (for further discussion, see Notes 8 and 9-“Equity Transactions” to the consolidated financial statements in the Company’s 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K).
 
Impact of COVID-19
 
The coronavirus outbreak (“COVID-19”) has adversely affected the Company’s financial condition and results of operations. The impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on businesses and the economy in the United States is expected to continue to be significant. The extent to which the COVID-19 outbreak will continue to impact businesses and the economy is highly uncertain. Accordingly, the Company cannot predict the extent to which its financial condition and results of operation will be affected.


On January 30, 2020, the World Health Organization (“WHO”) announced a global health emergency caused by a new strain of the coronavirus and advised of the risks to the international community as the virus spread globally. In March 2020, the WHO classified the COVID-19 outbreak as a pandemic based on the rapid increase in exposure globally. The spread of COVID-19 coronavirus has caused public health officials to recommend precautions to mitigate the spread of the virus, especially as to travel and congregating in large numbers. In addition, certain states and municipalities have enacted quarantining regulations which severely limit the ability of people to move and travel.
 
In addition, the Company is uncertain of the full effect the pandemic will have on it for the longer term since the scope and duration of the pandemic is unknown, and evolving factors such as the level and timing of the distribution of efficacious vaccines across the world and the extent of any resurgences of the virus or emergence of new variants of the virus, such as the Delta variant and the Omicron variant, will impact the stability of economic recovery and growth. The Company may experience long-term disruptions to its operations resulting from changes in government policy or guidance; quarantines of employees, customers and suppliers in areas affected by the pandemic; and closures of businesses or manufacturing facilities critical to its business.

Autologous Infusion Therapy (“Infusion Division”)
 
The Company’s Infusion Division develops and implements innovative treatment options in autologous cellular therapy (PRP-PBMC) to treat chronic lung disorders. Committed to an individualized patient-centric approach, this division consistently provides oversight and management of the highest quality care to the LHI clinics located in Tampa, Nashville, and Scottsdale, while producing positive medical outcomes following the strictest CDC guidelines. During the first quarter of 2022, the Company decided to close the clinics in Tampa and Nashville, the Scottsdale clinic will remain open.
Biotech Development (“Biotech Division”)
 
During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company completed a review of the R&D status regarding the exclusive product supply and services agreements with Rion, LLC (“Rion”) to develop and distribute (post U.S. Food & Drug Administration, the “FDA”, approval) a biologic combining its PRP-PBMC (“PRP”) technology with Rion’s exosomes (“EV”) technology for the treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (“COPD”). The Company has decided to progress alternate technologies and has determined a single entity biologic from an alternative commercial source will be a more viable solution. To that end the Company is progressing alternate biologics and therapeutic devices to meet the needs of the business.
Competition
 
Developing and commercializing new FDA approved drugs and therapies is highly competitive. The market is characterized by extensive research and clinical efforts and rapid technological change. The Company faces intense competition worldwide from pharmaceutical, biomedical technology, medical therapy, and combination products companies, including major pharmaceutical companies. The Company may be unable to respond to technological advances through the development and introduction of new products. Most of the Company’s existing and potential competitors have substantially greater financial, sales and marketing, manufacturing and distribution, and technological resources. These competitors may also be in the process of seeking FDA (or other regulatory approvals) and patent protection for new products. The Company’s biologics and device product lines also face competition from numerous existing products and procedures, which currently are considered part of the standard of care. The Company believes that the principal competitive factors in its markets are:

● | determining and progressing suitable biological therapies for specific disease states and the quality of outcomes for medical conditions; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | acceptance by physicians and the medical community; 
● | ease of use and reliability; 
● | technical leadership and superiority; 
● | effective marketing and distribution; 
● | speed to market; and 
● | price and qualification for insurance coverage and reimbursement.

The Company will also compete in the marketplace to recruit qualified scientific, management and sales personnel, as well as in acquiring technologies and licenses which it believes will be complementary to its products or advantageous to its business.
 
The Company is aware that several of its competitors are developing technologies in its current and future products areas. There are numerous autologous cellular therapy providers who make unsubstantiated claims that they are able to treat chronic lung disease. Most of these competitors are small clinics with little brand recognition. The landscape is changing as pharma and biologics companies, as well as academia, begin to develop therapies for multiple diseases using regenerative medicine through the more stringent regulatory pathway of a Biologics License Application (BLA).
 
Customers
 
The Company’s customer base consists of individuals who are suffering from chronic lung disease that are searching for alternative or adjunct forms of treatment outside of traditional pharmaceutical care which has not been successful for them in the past.
Government Regulations
 
Governmental authorities in the U.S. (at the federal, state, and local levels) and abroad extensively regulate, among other things, the research and development, testing, manufacture, quality control, clinical research, approval, labeling, packaging, storage, record-keeping, promotion, advertising, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, marketing, and export and import of products such as those we are developing.
 
FDA Regulation
 
The Infusion Vertical’s current cellular therapy for chronic lung disease does not require FDA approval due to it being an autologous therapy which is not intended to suggest diagnosis, treatment, cure, or prevention of any disorder. The Company operates in compliance with CFR Title 21 Part 1271.15 (b) Regulation.
 
In the U.S., the FDA subjects pharmaceutical and biologic products to rigorous review. If the Company does not comply with applicable requirements, it may be fined, the government may refuse to approve its marketing applications or to allow it to manufacture or market its products, and the Company may be criminally prosecuted. Failure to comply with the law could result in, among other things, warning letters, civil penalties, delays in approving or refusal to approve a product, product recall, product seizure, interruption of production, operating restrictions, suspension or withdrawal of product approval, injunctions, or criminal prosecution.

Good Manufacturing Practices (“GMP”)
 
United States Anti-Kickback and False Claims Laws
 
In the U. S., there are Federal and State anti-kickback laws that prohibit the payment or receipt of kickbacks, bribes or other remuneration intended to induce the purchase or recommendation of healthcare products and services. Violations of these laws can lead to civil and criminal penalties, including exclusion from participation in Federal healthcare programs. These laws are potentially applicable to manufacturers of products regulated by the FDA as pharmaceuticals, biologics, medical devices, and hospitals, physicians and other potential purchasers of such products. Other provisions of Federal and State laws provide civil and criminal penalties for presenting, or causing to be presented, to third-party payers for reimbursement, claims that are false or fraudulent, or which are for items or services that were not provided as claimed. In addition, certain states have implemented regulations requiring medical device and pharmaceutical companies to report all gifts and payments of over $50 to medical practitioners. This does not apply to instances involving clinical trials.
 
Although the Company intends to structure its future business relationships with clinical investigators and purchasers of its products to comply with these and other applicable laws, it is possible that some of the Company’s business practices in the future could be subject to scrutiny and challenged by Federal or State enforcement officials under these laws.
 
Research and Development Expense
 
Research and development costs and expenses consist primarily of fees paid to external service providers, laboratory testing, supplies, costs for facilities and equipment, and other costs for research and development activities. Research and development expenses are recorded in operating expenses in the period in which they are incurred.
Employees
 
As of February 25, 2022, the Company had eight full-time employees. None of its employees are represented by a union.
