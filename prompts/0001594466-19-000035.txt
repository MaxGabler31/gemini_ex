ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
Parsley Energy, Inc. (either individually or together with its subsidiaries, as the context requires, “we,” “us,” “our” or the “Company”) is an independent oil and natural gas company focused on the acquisition, development, exploration and production of unconventional oil and natural gas properties in the Permian Basin. The Permian Basin is located in west Texas and southeastern New Mexico and is characterized by high oil and liquids-rich natural gas content, multiple vertical and horizontal target horizons, extensive production histories, long-lived reserves and historically high drilling success rates. Our properties are located in two sub areas of the Permian Basin, the Midland and Delaware Basins, where, given the associated returns, we focus predominantly on horizontal development drilling.
As of December 31, 2018, we had an interest in 571 gross (442.7 net) productive horizontal wells, of which 467 gross (357.5 net) wells are in the Midland Basin and 104 gross (85.2 net) wells are in the Delaware Basin. As of December 31, 2018, we operated 453 gross (425.3 net) of these horizontal wells and had the rights to develop 267,143 gross (198,946 net) acres in the Permian Basin, with approximately 218,525 gross (154,107 net) acres located in the Midland Basin and 48,618 gross (44,839 net) acres located in the Delaware Basin. We intend to grow our reserves and production through the drilling and development of our multi-year inventory of identified drilling locations. 
At December 31, 2018, our estimated proved oil, natural gas and NGLs reserves were 521.7 MMBoe based on an internal reserve report prepared by our internal staff of petroleum engineers and audited by Netherland, Sewell & Associates, Inc. (“NSAI”), our independent third-party petroleum consulting firm. Of these reserves, approximately 60% are classified as proved developed producing. Based on this report, at December 31, 2018, our proved developed reserves were approximately 55% oil, 19% natural gas and 26% NGLs. These calculated percentages include proved developed non-producing reserves. 
Our 2019 budget for capital development expenditures is approximately 1,350.0 million to $1,550.0 million, approximately 85% of which is expected to be used for drilling and completions and approximately 15% of which is expected to be used for infrastructure and other expenditures. We expect approximately 30% to 35% of the total budget to be associated with drilling and completions for proved undeveloped reserves as of December 31, 2018. Our capital budget excludes any amounts that may be paid for acquisitions. For the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, our aggregate drilling and completion expenditures were $1,510.1 million and $1,049.6 million, respectively, and our infrastructure and other expenditures were $252.1 million and $157.8 million, respectively, for totals of $1,762.2 million and $1,207.4 million, respectively. Of these totals, $308.1 million and $65.1 million were associated with drilling, completions and facility buildout for proved undeveloped reserves for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The amount and timing of 2019 capital expenditures is largely discretionary and within our control. We could choose to defer a portion of these planned 2019 capital expenditures depending on a variety of factors, including, but not limited to, the success of our drilling activities, prevailing and anticipated prices for oil and natural gas, the availability of necessary equipment, infrastructure and capital, the receipt and timing of required regulatory permits and approvals, seasonal conditions, drilling and acquisition costs and the level of participation by other working interest owners.
Our Business Strategy
Our business strategy is to increase stockholder value through the following:

• | Achieve free cash flow generation through capital efficient development activity. We intend to selectively develop our acreage base and grow production with a strong commitment to capital discipline. By pursuing drilling opportunities offering competitive returns and prioritizing project level rate of return, which is enabled by our deep, high-quality inventory and resource potential, we expect to improve our capital and operational efficiency. In line with these priorities, our 2019 budget contemplates a significant reduction in our outspend, under any commodity price environment, as compared to our 2018 outspend. We believe this balanced and disciplined approach to development will enable sustainable free cash flow generation and favorable returns on invested capital, while, at the same time, increasing our reserves and production.


• | Enhance returns through continued improvement in operational and cost efficiencies. We currently operate approximately 96% of our 2018 daily horizontal production and intend to maintain operational control of substantially all of our producing properties. We believe that retaining control of our production will enable us to more efficiently manage the pace and costs of drilling and completion activities, increase recovery rates, lower

6

well costs, improve drilling performance and increase ultimate hydrocarbon recovery through optimization of our drilling and completion techniques. Our management team regularly evaluates our operating results against those of other operators in the area in an effort to improve our performance and implement best practices. 

• | Optimizing and high-grading our leasehold position. We regularly evaluate and complete acquisitions, divestitures and exchanges of undeveloped leasehold and producing properties that meet our strategic and financial objectives in the ordinary course of our business. We expect these strategic transactions will help us consolidate our core acreage, drill wells with longer lateral lengths, leverage existing infrastructure, maintain adequate inventory life and achieve economies of scale, while divesting of non-core properties that are less economically competitive within our portfolio. We have a proven history of optimizing our leasehold position in the Permian Basin by concentrating our ownership in operated properties with substantial oil-weighted resource potential, and we believe we can continue to economically and efficiently optimize our acreage position to further enhance project returns.


• | Maintain financial flexibility. We intend to maintain a conservative financial position to allow us to develop our exploration, drilling and production activities and maximize the present value of our oil-weighted resource potential. Until we achieve self-funded growth through sustainable free cash flow generation, we anticipate funding our growth with a combination of cash on hand, cash flow from operations, borrowings under our revolving credit agreement (“Revolving Credit Agreement”), and strategic divestitures of non-core properties. In limited circumstances, we may also access the capital markets. As of December 31, 2018, we had approximately $1,154.5 million of liquidity, including $163.2 million of cash and cash equivalents. The borrowing base under our Revolving Credit Agreement currently stands at $2.3 billion, with a commitment level of $1.0 billion. As of December 31, 2018, there were no borrowings outstanding and $8.7 million in letters of credit outstanding under our Revolving Credit Agreement as of December 31, 2018, resulting in availability of $991.3 million. Consistent with our disciplined approach to financial management, we have an active commodity hedging program through which we seek to hedge a meaningful portion of our expected oil production, reducing our exposure to downside commodity price fluctuations and enabling us to protect cash flows and maintain liquidity to fund our capital program and investment opportunities.

Our Strengths
We believe that the following strengths will help us achieve our business goals:

• | Extensive set of reinvestment opportunities. We believe that the majority of our acreage offers stacked pay potential to develop oil and natural gas from several prospective target zones, including, depending on the area, the Spraberry, Wolfcamp, and Bone Spring, and further, that some of these target zones may be characterized by sufficient thickness and resource potential to accommodate more than one pay interval per zone. Through December 31, 2018, we had placed on production 357 gross (326.6 net) horizontal wells in the Midland Basin and 70 gross (67.7 net) horizontal wells in the Delaware Basin. We believe this historical development activity only represents a fraction of our future development potential, providing an extensive inventory of reinvestment opportunities.


• | Established resource base and acreage position in the core of the Permian Basin. Our production is exclusively from the Permian Basin in west Texas, an area that has supported oil and gas production since the 1940s. The Permian Basin has well established infrastructure from historical operations, and we believe it also benefits from a relatively stable regulatory environment that has been established over time. As of December 31, 2018, our estimated total proved reserves were composed of approximately 57% oil and 18% natural gas, and 25% NGLs.


• | Incentivized management team with substantial technical and operational expertise. Our management team has a proven track record of executing on multi-rig development drilling programs and has extensive experience in the Spraberry and Wolfberry Trends of the Permian Basin. Our management team has an average of 21 years of experience. We have also assembled a robust technical team of petroleum engineers and geologists with an average of 12 years of experience, which we believe will be of strategic importance as we continue to expand our future exploration and development plans. As of December 31, 2018, our executive officers held voting power over approximately 12.4% of our outstanding equity interests. We believe the existence of this significant management ownership position provides meaningful incentive to increase the value of our business for the benefit of all stockholders.

• | Operating control over substantially all our horizontal production. As of December 31, 2018, we operated approximately 96% of our 2018 daily horizontal production. We believe that maintaining control of our production enables us to dictate the pace of development and better manage the cost, type and timing of exploration and development activities.


• | Conservative balance sheet. We expect to maintain financial flexibility that will allow us to continue our development activities while pursuing selective acquisitions, divestitures and exchanges. As of December 31, 2018, we had $991.3 million of available borrowing capacity under our Revolving Credit Agreement, with no borrowings currently outstanding thereunder. We believe this borrowing capacity, along with cash on hand and cash flow from operations will provide us with sufficient liquidity to execute our current capital program.

Organizational Structure
We are a holding company that was incorporated as a Delaware corporation on December 11, 2013 for the purpose of facilitating our initial public offering (the “IPO”) and to become the sole managing member of Parsley Energy, LLC (“Parsley LLC”). As of December 31, 2018, our sole material asset consists of 280,205,293 PE Units and, as sole managing member, we hold a controlling equity interest in Parsley LLC.
Prior to the completion of the IPO, the limited liability company agreement of Parsley LLC (as subsequently amended, the “Parsley LLC Agreement”) was amended and restated to modify its capital structure by replacing the different classes of interests previously held by Parsley LLC owners with a single new class of units called “PE Units.” In addition, each holder of PE Units (“PE Unit Holder”) received one share of our Class B common stock, par value $0.01 per share (“Class B common stock”). Pursuant to the Parsley LLC Agreement, the PE Unit Holders generally have the right to exchange (the “Exchange Right”) their PE Units (and a corresponding number of shares of Class B common stock) for shares of our Class A common stock, par value $0.01 per share (“Class A common stock”) at an exchange ratio of one share of Class A common stock for each PE Unit (and a corresponding number of shares of Class B common stock) exchanged (subject to conversion rate adjustments for stock splits, stock dividends and reclassifications), or, if either we or Parsley LLC so elects, cash (the “Cash Option”). In addition, in connection with the IPO, on May 29, 2014, we entered into a Tax Receivable Agreement (the “TRA”) with Parsley LLC and the initial PE Unit Holders and certain other holders of equity in us (each such person, a “TRA Holder”). This agreement generally provides for the payment by us to a TRA Holder of 85% of the net cash savings, if any, in U.S. federal, state or local income tax that we actually realize (or are deemed to realize in certain circumstances) in periods after our IPO as a result of (i) any tax basis increases resulting from the contribution in connection with our IPO by such TRA Holder of all or a portion of its PE Units to us in exchange for shares of Class A common stock, (ii) the tax basis increases resulting from the exchange by such TRA Holder of PE Units for shares of Class A common stock pursuant to the Exchange Right (or resulting from an exchange of PE Units for cash pursuant to the Cash Option) and (iii) imputed interest deemed to be paid by us as a result of, and additional tax basis arising from, any payments we make under the TRA. We will retain the benefit of the remaining 15% of these cash savings.
As a result of the IPO and the related reorganization transactions, we became the sole managing member of and have a controlling equity interest in Parsley LLC. As the sole managing member of Parsley LLC, we operate and control all of the business and affairs of Parsley LLC and, through Parsley LLC and its subsidiaries, conduct our business. We consolidate the financial and operating results of Parsley LLC and its subsidiaries and record noncontrolling interests for the economic interest in Parsley LLC held by the PE Unit Holders.

(1) | Natural gas and NGLs sales and associated production volumes for the year ended December 31, 2018 reflect adjustments associated with our adoption of ASC 606, effective January 1, 2018, as discussed in “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Factors Affecting the Comparability of Our Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Impact of ASC Topic 606 Adoption.”

Productive Wells
As of December 31, 2018, we had an interest in 571 gross (442.7 net) productive horizontal wells and 1,244 gross (779.7 net) productive vertical wells. Productive wells consist of producing wells and wells mechanically capable of production, including oil wells awaiting connection to production facilities. Gross wells are the total number of producing wells in which we have a working interest and net wells are the sum of our fractional working interests owned in gross wells. As of December 31, 2018, we owned an immaterial number of productive wells related to the production of natural gas.
Well Operations
As of December 31, 2018, we operated 453 gross (425.3 net) of our horizontal wells and 919 gross (735.7 net) of our vertical wells. As the operator, we design and manage the development of our wells and supervise operation and maintenance activities on a day-to-day basis. Independent contractors engaged by us provide all the equipment and personnel associated with these activities. We employ petroleum engineers, geologists and land professionals who work to improve production rates, increase reserves and lower the cost of operating our oil and natural gas properties.
Marketing and Customers
We market the majority of the production from the properties we operate, both for our account and for the accounts of third-party working, royalty and overriding royalty interest owners in these properties. We sell our production at market prices to a relatively small number of purchasers, as is customary in the exploration, development and production business. For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, the following customers accounted for more than 10% of our revenue:
 | Year Ended December 31,
 | 2018 | 2017 | 2016
Shell Trading (US) Company | 53% | 62% | 44% 
Lion Oil, Inc. | 22% | 3% | —% 
Targa Pipeline Mid-Continent, LLC | 11% | 13% | 13% 
BML, Inc. | 1% | 2% | 13% 

If a major customer decides to stop purchasing oil or natural gas from us, our revenue could decline and our operating results and financial condition could be harmed. However, we believe that the loss of any one or all of our major purchasers would not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations, as crude oil and natural gas are fungible products with well-established markets and numerous purchasers. Please see Note 2—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies—Significant Customers to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for additional information.

Transportation and Delivery Commitments 
During the initial development of our fields, we consider all gathering and delivery infrastructure in the areas of our production. Our oil is transported from the wellhead to our tank batteries by our gathering systems. The purchaser then transports the oil by truck or pipeline to a tank farm, another pipeline or a refinery. Our natural gas is transported from the wellhead to the purchaser’s meter and pipeline interconnection point through our gathering systems. In addition, we move the majority of our produced water by pipeline connected to our operated salt water disposal wells rather than by truck. However, due to the inaccessibility of certain of our wells, some produced water will likely always be required to be transported by truck.
We sell oil and natural gas under a variety of contractual agreements, some of which specify the delivery of fixed and determinable quantities. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we entered into the following contracts related to the transportation and/or sale of crude oil:

• | An amendment to an existing contract providing firm transportation from one of the pipeline systems through which we transport or sell crude oil. Under this amended contract, we have committed to deliver a minimum average volume of 45,000 Bbls/day from January 1, 2019 to June 30, 2025. If a new third party pipeline system commences operations (the “pipeline commencement date”) between January 1, 2019 and June 30, 2020, our commitment will increase to a minimum average volume of 60,000 Bbls/day from the pipeline commencement date through June 30, 2020. If the pipeline commencement date occurs before July 1, 2020, our commitment will increase to a minimum average volume of 75,000 Bbls/day from July 1, 2020 through June 30, 2025, and if the pipeline commencement date occurs between July 1, 2020 and June 30, 2025, our commitment will increase to a minimum average volume of 75,000 Bbls/day from the pipeline commencement date through June 30, 2025. In addition, if the pipeline commencement date occurs after June 30, 2025, we will be required to deliver a minimum average volume of 30,000 Bbls/day for five years following the pipeline commencement date; however, if the pipeline commencement date occurs prior to June 30, 2025, such five-year period will be reduced by the period of time from the pipeline commencement date through June 30, 2025.


• | A contract for the transportation and/or sale of crude oil, pursuant to which we have committed to deliver approximately 2.7 MMBbl of oil during the period from September 1, 2018 to December 31, 2019. If we fail to deliver the required volumes, we may elect to extend the performance period by three months.


• | A contract for the transportation and/or sale of crude oil that is subject to the commencement of operations of a third-party terminal and pipeline system. Upon the commencement of operations, we will be required to deliver a minimum average volume of 5,000 Bbls/day during the first month, which will increase by 5,000 Bbls/day each month until we are required to deliver a minimum average volume of 35,000 Bbls/day during the seventh month. We will then be required to deliver 35,000 Bbls/day until three years following the commencement of operations of the third-party terminal and pipeline system. At the completion of the initial three year period, our counterparty will have the option to extend the contract for up to four additional years, but if such option is not exercised, we will be have the option to extend the contract for up to two additional years.

We have no fixed delivery commitments other than those described above. We expect to fulfill these delivery commitments for the next one to three years with production from our existing proved developed and proved undeveloped reserves, which we regularly monitor to ensure sufficient availability. In addition, we monitor our current production, our anticipated future production and our future development plans, in each case factoring in production attributable to third-party working, royalty and overriding royalty interest owners, in order to meet our delivery commitments. If production volumes are not sufficient to meet these contractual delivery commitments, we may be subject to deficiency fees unless we purchase commodities in the market to satisfy such commitments.
Competition
The oil and natural gas industry is intensely competitive, and we compete with other companies that have greater resources. Many of these companies not only explore for and produce oil and natural gas, but also carry on midstream and refining operations and market petroleum and other products on a regional, national or worldwide basis. These companies may be able to pay more for productive oil and natural gas properties and exploratory prospects or to evaluate, bid for and purchase a greater number of properties and prospects than our financial or human resources permit. In addition, these companies may have a greater ability to continue exploration activities during periods of low oil and natural gas market prices. Our ability to acquire additional properties and to discover reserves in the future will be dependent upon our ability to evaluate and select suitable properties and to consummate transactions in a highly competitive environment. In addition, because we have fewer financial and human resources than many companies in our industry, we may not be able to compete successfully in the future 
11

in acquiring prospective reserves, developing reserves, marketing hydrocarbons and raising additional capital, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.
There is also competition between oil and natural gas producers and other industries producing energy and fuel. Furthermore, competitive conditions may be substantially affected by various forms of energy legislation and/or regulation considered from time to time by the governments of the United States and the jurisdictions in which we operate. It is not possible to predict the nature of any such legislation or regulation which may ultimately be adopted or its effects upon our future operations. Such laws and regulations may substantially increase the costs of exploring for, developing or producing oil and natural gas and may prevent or delay the commencement or continuation of a given operation. Our larger competitors may be able to absorb the burden of existing, and any changes to, federal, state and local laws and regulations more easily than we can, which would adversely affect our competitive position.
Segment Information and Geographic Area
Operating segments are defined under GAAP as components of an enterprise that engage in activities from which it may earn revenues and incur expenses and for which separate operational financial information is available and regularly evaluated by the chief operating decision maker for the purpose of allocating resources and assessing performance. 
Based on our organization and management, we have only one reportable operating segment, which is oil and natural gas exploration and production. Other services that we engage in are ancillary to our oil and natural gas exploration and producing activities and manage these services to support such activities. All of our operations are conducted in one geographic area of the United States. For additional information, see our consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report beginning on page F-1.
Seasonality of Business
Weather conditions affect the demand for and prices of, oil and natural gas. Demand for oil and natural gas is typically higher in the first and fourth quarters, resulting in higher prices. Due to these seasonal fluctuations, results of operations for individual quarterly periods may not be indicative of the results that may be realized on an annual basis.
Oil and Natural Gas Leases
Typically the oil and natural gas lease agreements covering our properties provide for the payment of royalties to the mineral owner for all oil and natural gas produced from any wells drilled on the leased premises. The lessor royalties and other leasehold burdens on our properties generally range from 20% to 25%, resulting in a net revenue interest to us generally ranging from 75% to 80%. Where we own minerals underlying properties that we operate, our net revenue interest will be higher.
Markets for Sale of Production
Our ability to market oil and natural gas found and produced depends on numerous factors beyond our control, the effects of which cannot be accurately predicted or anticipated. Some of these factors include, without limitation, the availability of other domestic and foreign production, the marketing of competitive fuels, the proximity and capacity of pipelines, fluctuations in supply and demand, the availability of a ready market, the effect of United States federal and state regulation of production, refining, transportation and sales and general national and worldwide economic conditions. Additionally, we may experience delays in marketing natural gas production and fluctuations in natural gas prices and our marketing professionals may experience short-term delays in marketing oil due to trucking and refining constraints. There is no assurance that we will be able to market any oil or natural gas produced, or, if such oil or natural gas is marketed, that favorable prices can be obtained.
The United States natural gas market has undergone several significant changes over the past few decades. The majority of federal price ceilings were removed in 1985 and the remainder were lifted by the Natural Gas Wellhead Decontrol Act of 1989. Thus, currently, the price of natural gas in the United States is determined by market forces rather than by regulations. At the same time, the domestic natural gas industry has also seen a dramatic change in the manner in which gas is bought, sold and transported. In most cases, natural gas is no longer sold to pipeline companies. Instead, pipeline companies primarily serve the role of transporter and gas producers are free to sell their product to marketers, local distribution companies, end users or a combination thereof.
12

In recent years, oil, natural gas and NGLs prices have been under considerable pressure due to oversupply and other market conditions. Specifically, increased foreign production and increased efficiencies in horizontal drilling, combined with the exploration of newly developed shale fields in North America, have dramatically increased global oil and natural gas production, which has led to lower market prices for these commodities. Given the many uncertainties affecting the supply and demand for oil, natural gas and NGLs, we are unable to accurately predict future oil, natural gas and NGLs prices or the overall effect, if any, that the oversupply of such products and other market conditions will have on our financial condition or results of operations.
Regulation of the Oil and Natural Gas Industry
Our operations are substantially affected by federal, state and local laws and regulations. Failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations can result in substantial penalties. The regulatory burden on the industry increases the cost of doing business and affects profitability. Although we believe we are in substantial compliance with all applicable laws and regulations, such laws and regulations are frequently amended or reinterpreted. Therefore, we are unable to predict the future costs or impact of compliance. Additional proposals and proceedings that affect the oil and natural gas industry are regularly considered by the United States Congress (“Congress”), state governments, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (the “FERC”) and other federal and state regulatory agencies and federal, state and local courts. We cannot predict when or whether any such proposals may become effective. We do not believe that such action or proposal would have a material disproportionate effect on us as compared to similarly situated competitors.
Regulation Affecting Production
As described above, natural gas production and related operations are, or have been, subject to price controls, taxes and numerous other laws and regulations. In addition, all of the jurisdictions in which we own or operate producing oil and natural gas properties have statutory provisions regulating the exploration for and production of oil and natural gas, including provisions related to permits for the drilling of wells, bonding requirements to drill or operate wells, the location of wells, the method of drilling and casing wells, the surface use and restoration of properties upon which wells are drilled, sourcing and disposal of water used in the drilling and completion process and the abandonment of wells. Our operations are also subject to various conservation laws and regulations. These include the regulation of the size of drilling and spacing units or proration units, the number of wells that may be drilled in an area and the unitization or pooling of crude oil or natural gas wells, as well as regulations that generally prohibit the venting or flaring of natural gas and impose certain requirements regarding the ratability or fair apportionment of production from fields and individual wells. These laws and regulations may limit the number of oil and natural gas wells we can drill. Moreover, each state generally imposes a production or severance tax with respect to the production and sale of oil, natural gas and NGLs within its jurisdiction. States do not regulate wellhead prices or engage in other similar direct regulation, but there can be no assurance that they will not do so in the future. The effect of such future regulations may be to limit the amounts of oil and natural gas that may be produced from our wells, negatively affect the economics of production from these wells or limit the number of locations we can drill.
The failure to comply with the rules and regulations of oil and natural gas production and related operations can result in substantial penalties. Our competitors in the oil and natural gas industry are subject to the same regulatory requirements and restrictions that affect our operations.
Regulation Affecting Sales and Transportation of Commodities
Sales prices for oil, natural gas and NGLs are not currently regulated and therefore are dictated by the prevailing market prices. Although prices of these energy commodities are currently unregulated, Congress historically has been active in their regulation. We cannot predict whether new legislation to regulate oil and natural gas, or the prices charged for these commodities, might be proposed, what proposals, if any, might actually be enacted by Congress or the various state legislatures and what effect, if any, the proposals might have on our operations. Sales of oil and natural gas may be subject to certain state and federal reporting requirements.
The price and terms of service of transportation of the commodities, including access to pipeline transportation capacity, are subject to extensive federal and state regulation. Such regulation may affect the marketing of oil and natural gas produced, as well as the revenues received for sales of such production. Gathering systems may be subject to state ratable take statutes and common purchaser statutes. Ratable take statutes generally require gatherers to take, without undue discrimination, oil and natural gas production that may be tendered to the gatherer for handling. Similarly, common purchaser statutes generally require gatherers to purchase, or accept for gathering, without undue discrimination as to source of supply or producer. These statutes are designed to prohibit discrimination in favor of one producer over another producer or one source of supply over another source of supply. These statutes may affect whether and to what extent gathering capacity is available for oil and 
13

natural gas production, if any, of the drilling program and the cost of such capacity. Further, state laws and regulations govern rates and terms of access to intrastate pipeline systems, which may similarly affect market access and cost.
The FERC regulates interstate natural gas pipeline transportation rates and service conditions. The FERC regularly proposes and implements new rules and regulations affecting interstate transportation. The stated purpose of many of these regulatory changes is to promote competition among the various sectors of the natural gas industry and to promote market transparency. We do not believe that such FERC action would have a material disproportionate effect on our drilling program as compared to other similarly situated natural gas producers.
Gathering services, which occur upstream of FERC jurisdictional transmission services, and which are performed onshore and in state-controlled waters are regulated by state governments. Although the FERC has set forth a general test for determining whether facilities perform a non-jurisdictional gathering function or a jurisdictional transmission function, the FERC’s determinations as to the classification of facilities is conducted on a case-by-case basis. State regulation of natural gas gathering facilities generally includes various safety, environmental and, in some circumstances, nondiscriminatory take requirements. Although such regulation has not generally been affirmatively applied by state agencies, natural gas gathering may receive greater regulatory scrutiny in the future.
In addition to the regulation of natural gas pipeline transportation, the FERC has jurisdiction over the purchase or sale of gas or the purchase or sale of transportation services subject to the FERC’s jurisdiction pursuant to the Energy Policy Act of 2005. Under this law, it is unlawful for “any entity,” including a producer such as us, that is otherwise not subject to the FERC’s jurisdiction under the Natural Gas Act of 1938 to use any deceptive or manipulative device or contrivance in connection with the purchase or sale of gas, or the purchase or sale of transportation services subject to regulation by the FERC, in contravention of rules prescribed by the FERC. The FERC’s rules implementing this provision make it unlawful, in connection with the purchase or sale of gas subject to the jurisdiction of the FERC, or the purchase or sale of transportation services subject to the jurisdiction of the FERC, for any entity, directly or indirectly, to use or employ any device, scheme or artifice to defraud, to make any untrue statement of material fact or omit to make any such statement necessary to make the statements made not misleading, or to engage in any act or practice that operates as a fraud or deceit upon any person. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 also gives the FERC authority to impose civil penalties for violations of the Natural Gas Act of 1938 and the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978 up to $1,269,500 per day per violation (adjusted annually based on inflation) and disgorge profits associated with any violation. The anti-manipulation rule applies to activities of otherwise non-jurisdictional entities to the extent the activities are conducted “in connection with” gas sales, purchases or transportation subject to FERC jurisdiction, which includes the annual reporting requirements under Order 704 (defined below).
In December 2007, the FERC issued a final rule on the annual natural gas transaction reporting requirements, as amended by subsequent orders on rehearing (“Order 704”). Under Order 704, any market participant, including a producer such as us, that engages in wholesale sales or purchases of gas that equal or exceed 2.2 million MMBtus of physical natural gas in the previous calendar year, must annually report such sales and purchases to the FERC on Form No. 552 on May 1 of each year. Form No. 552 contains aggregate volumes of natural gas purchased or sold at wholesale in the prior calendar year to the extent such transactions utilize or contribute to the formation of price indices. It is the responsibility of the reporting entity to determine which individual transactions should be reported based on the guidance of Order 704. Order 704 is intended to increase the transparency of the wholesale gas markets and to assist the FERC in monitoring those markets and in detecting market manipulation.
The FERC also regulates rates and service conditions for the interstate transportation of liquids, including oil and NGLs, under the Interstate Commerce Act (the “ICA”). Prices received from the sale of liquids may be affected by the cost of transporting those products to market. The ICA requires that pipelines maintain a tariff on file with the FERC. The tariff sets forth the established rates as well as the rules and regulations governing the service. The ICA requires, among other things, that rates and terms and conditions of service on interstate common carrier pipelines be “just and reasonable.” Such pipelines must also provide jurisdictional service in a manner that is not unduly discriminatory or unduly preferential. Shippers have the power to challenge new and existing rates and terms and conditions of service before the FERC.
Rates of interstate liquids pipelines are currently regulated by the FERC primarily through an annual indexing methodology, under which pipelines increase or decrease their rates in accordance with an index adjustment specified by the FERC. For the five-year period beginning on July 1, 2016, the FERC established an annual index adjustment equal to the change in the producer price index for finished goods plus 1.23%. This adjustment is subject to review every five years. Under the FERC’s regulations, a liquids pipeline can request the authority to charge market-based rates for transportation service if it satisfies certain criteria, and also can request a rate increase that exceeds the rate obtained through application of the indexing methodology by using a cost-of-service approach, but only after the pipeline establishes that a substantial divergence exists 
14

between the actual costs experienced by the pipeline and the rates resulting from application of the indexing methodology. Increases in liquids transportation rates may result in lower revenue and cash flows.
In addition, due to common carrier regulatory obligations of liquids pipelines, capacity must be prorated among shippers in an equitable manner in the event there are nominations in excess of capacity. Therefore, requests for service by new shippers or increased volume by existing shippers may reduce the capacity available to us. Any prolonged interruption in the operation or curtailment of available capacity of the pipelines that we rely upon for liquids transportation could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. However, we believe that access to liquids pipeline transportation services generally will be available to us to the same extent as to our similarly situated competitors.
Intrastate liquids pipeline transportation rates are subject to regulation by state regulatory commissions. The basis for intrastate liquids pipeline regulation, and the degree of regulatory oversight and scrutiny given to intrastate liquids pipeline rates, varies from state to state. We believe that the regulation of liquids pipeline transportation rates will not affect our operations in any way that is materially different from the effects on our similarly situated competitors.
In addition to the FERC’s regulations, we are required to observe anti-market manipulation laws with regard to our physical sales of energy commodities. In November 2009, the Federal Trade Commission (the “FTC”) issued regulations pursuant to the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 intended to prohibit market manipulation in the petroleum industry. Violators of the regulations face civil penalties of up to $1,180,566 per violation per day (adjusted annually based on inflation). In July 2010, Congress passed the Dodd-Frank Act, which incorporated an expansion of the authority of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (the “CFTC”) to prohibit market manipulation in the markets regulated by the CFTC. This authority, with respect to crude oil swaps and futures contracts, is similar to the anti-manipulation authority granted to the FTC with respect to crude oil purchases and sales. In July 2011, the CFTC issued final rules to implement its new anti-manipulation authority. The rules subject violators to a civil penalty of up to the greater of $1,191,842 (adjusted annually based on inflation) or triple the monetary gain to the person for each violation.
Regulation of Environmental and Occupational Safety and Health Matters
Our operations are subject to stringent and complex federal, state and local laws and regulations governing environmental protection as well as the discharge of materials into the environment and occupational health and safety. These laws and regulations may, among other things: (i) require the acquisition of permits to conduct exploration, drilling and production operations; (ii) restrict the types, quantities and concentration of various substances that can be released into the environment or injected into formations in connection with oil and natural gas drilling and production activities; (iii) limit or prohibit drilling activities on certain lands lying within wilderness, wetlands and other protected areas; (iv) require remedial measures to mitigate pollution from former and ongoing operations, such as requirements to close pits and plug abandoned wells; and (v) impose substantial liabilities for pollution resulting from drilling and production operations. Any failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative, civil and criminal penalties, the imposition of corrective or remedial obligations and the issuance of orders enjoining performance of some or all of our operations.
These laws and regulations may also restrict the rate of oil and natural gas production below the rate that would otherwise be possible. The regulatory burden on the oil and natural gas industry increases the cost of doing business in the industry and consequently affects profitability. Additionally, Congress and federal and state agencies frequently revise environmental laws and regulations and any changes that result in more stringent and costly waste handling, disposal and cleanup requirements for the oil and natural gas industry could have a significant impact on our operating costs.
The clear trend in environmental regulation has been to place more restrictions and limitations on activities that may affect the environment and thus any changes in environmental laws and regulations or re-interpretation of enforcement policies that result in more stringent and costly waste handling, storage, transportation, disposal, or remediation requirements could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations. We may be unable to pass on such increased compliance costs to our purchasers. Moreover, accidental releases or spills may occur in the course of our operations and we cannot assure you that we will not incur significant costs and liabilities as a result of such releases or spills, including any third-party claims for damage to property, natural resources or persons. While compliance with existing environmental laws and regulations has not had a material adverse effect on our operations to date, we can provide no assurance that this will continue in the future.
The following is a summary of the more significant existing and proposed environmental, occupational health and safety laws and regulations to which our business operations are or may be subject to and for which compliance may have a material adverse impact on our capital expenditures, results of operations or financial position.

The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act
The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (“RCRA”), and comparable state statutes, regulate the generation, transportation, treatment, storage, disposal and cleanup of hazardous and non-hazardous wastes. Pursuant to rules issued by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (the “EPA”), individual state governments administer some or all of the provisions of RCRA, sometimes in conjunction with their own, more stringent requirements. Drilling fluids, produced waters and most of the other wastes associated with the exploration, development and production of crude oil or natural gas are currently regulated under RCRA’s non-hazardous waste provisions. However, it is possible that certain oil and natural gas drilling and production wastes now classified as non-hazardous could be classified as hazardous wastes in the future. For example, in December 2016, the EPA and environmental groups entered into a consent decree to address the EPA’s alleged failure to timely assess its RCRA Subtitle D criteria regulations exempting certain exploration and production related oil and natural gas wastes from regulation as hazardous wastes under RCRA. The consent decree requires the EPA to propose a rulemaking no later than March 15, 2019 for revision of certain Subtitle D criteria regulations pertaining to oil and natural gas wastes or to sign a determination that revision of the regulations is not necessary. EPA action in response to the consent decree remains pending. Removal of RCRA’s exemption for exploration and production wastes has the potential to significantly increase our waste disposal costs to manage, which in turn will result in increased operating costs and could adversely impact our results of operations and financial position. Also, in the course of our operations, we generate some amounts of ordinary industrial wastes, such as paint wastes, waste solvents and waste oils that may be regulated as hazardous wastes if such wastes have hazardous characteristics.
Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act
The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (“CERCLA”), also known as the Superfund law, imposes joint and several liability, without regard to fault or legality of conduct, on classes of persons who are considered to be responsible for the release of a hazardous substance into the environment. These persons include the current and former owners and operators of the site where the release occurred and anyone who disposed or arranged for the disposal of a hazardous substance released at the site. Under CERCLA, such persons may be subject to joint and several liability for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances that have been released into the environment, for damages to natural resources and for the costs of certain health studies. In addition, it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third-parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the hazardous substances released into the environment.
We generate materials in the course of our operations that may be regulated as hazardous substances. Despite the “petroleum exclusion” of CERCLA, which currently encompasses natural gas, we may nonetheless handle hazardous substances within the meaning of CERCLA, or similar state statutes, in the course of our ordinary operations and, as a result, may be jointly and severally liable under CERCLA for all or part of the costs required to clean up sites at which these hazardous substances have been released into the environment. In addition, we currently own, lease, or operate numerous properties that have been used for oil and natural gas exploration, production and processing for many years. Although we believe that we have utilized operating and waste disposal practices that were standard in the industry at the time, hazardous substances, wastes, or hydrocarbons may have been released on, under or from the properties owned or leased by us, or on, under or from other locations, including off-site locations, where such substances have been taken for disposal. In addition, some of our properties have been operated by third parties or by previous owners or operators whose treatment and disposal of hazardous substances, wastes, or hydrocarbons was not under our control. These properties and the substances disposed or released on, under or from them may be subject to CERCLA, RCRA and analogous state and local laws. Under such laws, we could be required to undertake investigatory, response, or corrective measures, which could include soil and groundwater sampling, the removal of previously disposed substances and wastes, the cleanup of contaminated property, or remedial plugging or pit closure operations to prevent future contamination, the costs of which could be substantial.
Water Discharges
The Federal Water Pollution Control Act, or the Clean Water Act (the “CWA”), and analogous state laws impose restrictions and strict controls with respect to the discharge of pollutants, including spills and leaks of oil and other substances, into waters of the United States. The discharge of pollutants into regulated waters, including wetland areas, is prohibited, except in accordance with the terms of a permit issued by the EPA, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (the “USACE”) or an analogous state agency. In September 2015, the EPA and the USACE issued a final rule redefining the scope of the EPA’s and the USACE’s jurisdiction under the CWA with respect to certain types of waterbodies and classifying these waterbodies as regulated wetlands (the “WOTUS” rule). Several legal challenges to the rule followed, along with attempts to stay implementation of the WOTUS rule following the change in U.S. presidential administrations. Currently, the WOTUS rule is active in 22 states and enjoined in 28 states. However, in December 2018, the EPA and the USACE proposed changes to regulations under the CWA that would provide discrete categories of jurisdictional waters and tests for determining whether a 
16

particular waterbody meets any of those classifications. Several groups have already announced their intent to challenge the proposed WOTUS replacement rule. Therefore, the scope of jurisdiction under the CWA is uncertain at this time. To the extent the original WOTUS rule or any replacement rule expands the scope of the CWA’s jurisdiction, we could face increased costs and delays with respect to obtaining permits for dredge and fill activities in wetland areas. In addition, federal and state regulatory agencies can impose administrative, civil and criminal penalties for non-compliance with discharge permits or other requirements of the CWA and analogous state laws and regulations. We do not expect the costs to comply with the requirements of the CWA to have a material adverse effect on our operations.
The Oil Pollution Act of 1990 amends the CWA and establishes strict liability for owners and operators of facilities that cause a release of oil into waters of the United States. In addition, this law requires owners and operators of facilities that store oil above specified threshold amounts to develop and implement spill prevention, control and countermeasures plans.
Safe Drinking Water Act and Saltwater Disposal Wells
In the course of our operations, we produce water in addition to oil and natural gas. Water that is not recycled or otherwise disposed of on the lease may be sent to saltwater disposal wells for injection into subsurface formations. Underground injection operations are regulated under the federal Safe Drinking Water Act and permitting and enforcement authority may be delegated to state governments. In Texas, the Texas Railroad Commission (“RRC”) regulates the disposal of produced water by injection well. The RRC requires operators to obtain a permit from the agency for the operation of saltwater disposal wells and establishes minimum standards for injection well operations. In response to recent seismic events near underground injection wells used for the disposal of oil and natural gas-related waste waters, federal and some state agencies have begun investigating whether such wells have caused increased seismic activity, and some states have shut down or placed volumetric injection limits on existing wells or imposed moratoria on the use of such injection wells. In response to concerns related to induced seismicity, regulators in some states have already adopted or are considering additional requirements related to seismic safety. For example, the RRC has adopted rules for injection wells to address these seismic activity concerns in Texas. Among other things, the rules require companies seeking permits for disposal wells to provide seismic activity data in permit applications, provide for more frequent monitoring and reporting for certain wells and allow the RRC to modify, suspend, or terminate permits on grounds that a disposal well is likely to be, or determined to be, causing seismic activity. More stringent regulation of injection wells could lead to reduced construction or the capacity of such wells, which could in turn impact the availability of injection wells for disposal of wastewater from our operations. Increased costs associated with the transportation and disposal of produced water, including the cost of complying with regulations concerning produced water disposal, may reduce our profitability. The costs associated with the disposal of proposed water are commonly incurred by all oil and natural gas producers, however, and we do not believe that these costs will have a material adverse effect on our operations.
Air Emissions
The federal Clean Air Act and comparable state laws restrict the emission of air pollutants from many sources, such as tank batteries and compressor stations, through air emissions standards, construction and operating permitting programs and the imposition of other compliance requirements. These laws and regulations may require us to obtain pre-approval for the construction or modification of certain projects or facilities expected to produce or significantly increase air emissions, obtain and strictly comply with stringent air permit requirements or utilize specific equipment or technologies to control emissions of certain pollutants. Over the next several years, we may be required to incur certain capital expenditures for air pollution control equipment or other air emissions related issues. For example, in October 2015, the EPA lowered the National Ambient Air Quality Standard for ozone from 75 to 70 parts per billion. The EPA approved final attainment/nonattainment designations with the new ozone standards in July 2018 and currently all of the areas in which we operate are in attainment with such standards. However, state implementation of these revised air quality standards or a change in the attainment status of the areas in which we operate could result in stricter permitting requirements, delay or prohibit our ability to obtain such permits and result in increased expenditures for pollution control equipment, the costs of which could be significant. Separately, in June 2016, the EPA finalized a rule regarding criteria for aggregating multiple small surface sites into a single source for air-quality permitting purposes applicable to the oil and natural gas industry. This rule could cause small facilities, on an aggregate basis, to be deemed a major source, thereby triggering more stringent air permitting requirements, which in turn could result in operational delays or require us to install costly pollution control equipment. The EPA has also adopted new rules under the Clean Air Act that require the reduction of volatile organic compound emissions from certain fractured and refractured natural gas wells for which well completion operations are conducted and further require that most wells use reduced emission completions, also known as “green completions.” These regulations also establish specific new requirements regarding emissions from production‑related wet seal and reciprocating compressors and from pneumatic controllers and storage vessels. The EPA expanded on its emission standards for volatile organic compounds in June 2016 with the issuance of first-time standards, known as Subpart OOOOa, to address emissions of methane from equipment and processes across the oil and natural gas 
17

source category, including hydraulically fractured oil and natural gas well completions. Following the change in presidential administration, there have been attempts to modify these regulations, and litigation concerning the regulations is ongoing. As a result of these developments, substantial uncertainty exists with respect to implementation of the EPA’s 2016 methane rule. However, given the long-term trend toward increasing regulation, future federal methane regulation of the oil and gas industry remains a possibility, and several states have separately imposed their own regulations on methane emissions from oil and gas production activities. These and other air pollution control and permitting requirements have the potential to delay the development of oil and natural gas projects and increase our costs of development and production, which costs could be significant. We do not believe that compliance with such requirements, however, will have a material adverse effect on our operations.
Regulation of Greenhouse Gas Emissions
In response to findings that emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and other greenhouse gases (“GHGs”) endanger public health and the environment, the EPA has adopted regulations under existing provisions of the Clean Air Act that, among other things, establish Prevention of Significant Deterioration (“PSD”), construction and Title V operating permit reviews for certain large stationary sources. Facilities required to obtain PSD permits for their GHG emissions also will be required to meet “best available control technology” standards for these emissions. EPA rulemakings related to GHG emissions could adversely affect our operations and restrict or delay our ability to obtain air permits for new or modified sources. In addition, the EPA has adopted rules requiring the annual reporting of GHG emissions from certain petroleum and natural gas system sources in the U.S., including, among others, onshore and offshore production facilities, which include certain of our operations. Also, as noted above, the EPA has promulgated a New Source Performance Standard related to methane emissions from the oil and natural gas source category.
While Congress has considered legislation related to the reduction of GHG emissions in the past, no significant legislation to reduce GHG emissions has been adopted at the federal level. In the absence of Congressional action, a number of state and regional GHG restrictions have emerged. At the international level, the United States joined the international community at the 21st Conference of the Parties of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in Paris, France. The Paris Agreement entered into force in November 2016. Although this agreement does not create any binding obligations for nations to limit their GHG emissions, it does include pledges from participating nations to voluntarily limit or reduce future emissions. In June 2017, President Trump stated that the United States would withdraw from the Paris Agreement, but may enter into a future international agreement related to GHGs. The Paris Agreement provides for a four-year exit process beginning when it took effect in November 2016, which would result in an effective exit date of November 2020. The United States’ adherence to the exit process is uncertain, and the terms on which the United States may reenter the Paris Agreement or a separately negotiated agreement are unclear at this time. Although it is not possible at this time to predict how legislation or new regulations that may be adopted to address GHG emissions would impact our business, any such future laws and regulations imposing reporting obligations on, or limiting emissions of GHGs from, our equipment and operations could require us to incur costs to reduce emissions of GHGs associated with our operations.
Substantial limitations on GHG emissions could adversely affect demand for the oil and natural gas we produce and lower the value of our reserves. Notwithstanding potential risks related to climate change, the International Energy Agency estimates that global energy demand will continue to represent a major share of global energy use through 2040, and other private sector studies project continued growth in demand for the next two decades. However, recent activism directed at shifting funding away from companies with energy-related assets could result in limitations or restrictions on certain sources of funding for the energy sector. Finally, it should also be noted that many scientists have concluded that increasing concentrations of GHGs in the Earth’s atmosphere may produce climate changes that have significant physical effects, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, floods, droughts and other climatic events; if any such effects were to occur, they could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
Hydraulic Fracturing Activities
Hydraulic fracturing is an important and common practice that is used to stimulate production of natural gas and/or oil from dense subsurface rock formations. Hydraulic fracturing involves the injection of water, sand or alternative proppant and chemicals under pressure into target geological formations to fracture the surrounding rock and stimulate production. We regularly use hydraulic fracturing as part of our operations. Recently, there has been increased public concern regarding an alleged potential for hydraulic fracturing to adversely affect drinking water supplies, resulting in new legislative and regulatory initiatives that seek to increase the regulatory burden imposed on hydraulic fracturing.
At the federal level, the EPA has asserted federal regulatory authority pursuant to the Safe Drinking Water Act over certain hydraulic fracturing activities involving the use of diesel fuels and published permitting guidance in February 2014 
18

addressing the performance of such activities. Further, the EPA finalized regulations under the CWA in June 2016 that prohibit wastewater discharges from hydraulic fracturing and certain other natural gas operations to publicly owned wastewater treatment plants. Also, in December 2016, the EPA released its final report on the potential impacts of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water resources. The final report concluded that “water cycle” activities associated with hydraulic fracturing may impact drinking water resources under certain limited circumstances.
At the state level, several states have adopted or are considering legal requirements that could impose more stringent permitting, disclosure and well construction requirements on hydraulic fracturing activities. For example in May 2013, the RRC adopted new rules governing well casing, cementing and other standards for ensuring that hydraulic fracturing operations do not contaminate nearby water resources. Local governments also may seek to adopt ordinances within their jurisdictions regulating the time, place and manner of, or prohibiting, drilling or hydraulic fracturing activities. We believe that we follow applicable standard industry practices and legal requirements for groundwater protection in our hydraulic fracturing activities. Nonetheless, if new or more stringent federal, state, or local legal restrictions relating to the hydraulic fracturing process are adopted in areas where we operate, we may be required to incur significant added costs to comply with such requirements, experience delays or curtailment in the pursuit of exploration, development or production activities and perhaps even be precluded from drilling wells.
If new federal, state or local laws or regulations that significantly restrict hydraulic fracturing are adopted, such legal requirements could result in delays, eliminate certain drilling and injection activities and make it more difficult or costly to perform fracturing. Any such regulations limiting or prohibiting hydraulic fracturing could reduce oil and natural gas exploration and production activities and, therefore, adversely affect our business. Such laws or regulations could also materially increase our costs of compliance and doing business by more strictly regulating how hydraulic fracturing wastes are handled or disposed.
Endangered Species Act and Migratory Birds
The federal Endangered Species Act (“ESA”) and (in some cases) comparable state laws were established to protect endangered and threatened species. Pursuant to the ESA, if a species is listed as threatened or endangered, restrictions may be imposed on activities adversely affecting that species’ habitat. We may conduct operations on oil and natural gas leases in areas where certain species that are listed as threatened or endangered are known to exist and where other species, such as the sage grouse, that potentially could be listed as threatened or endangered under the ESA may exist. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (the “FWS”) may designate critical habitat and suitable habitat areas that it believes are necessary for the survival of a threatened or endangered species. A critical habitat or suitable habitat designation could result in further material restrictions to federal land use and may materially delay or prohibit land access for oil and natural gas development. Moreover, as a result of a 2011 settlement agreement, the FWS was required to make a determination on listing of more than 250 species as endangered or threatened under the FSA by no later than completion of the agency’s 2017 fiscal year. The FWS missed the deadline but reportedly continues to review new species for protected status under the ESA pursuant to the settlement agreement. Similar protections are offered to migratory birds under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act. Recently, there have been renewed calls to review protections currently in place for the dunes sagebrush lizard, whose habitat includes portions of the Permian Basin, and to reconsider listing the species under the ESA. The designation as threatened or endangered of previously unprotected species in areas where we operate could cause us to incur increased costs arising from species protection measures or could result in limitations on our development and production activities that could have a material adverse impact on our ability to develop and produce our reserves. If we were to have a portion of our leases designated as critical or suitable habitat, it could adversely impact the value of our leases.
OSHA
We are subject to the requirements of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (“OSHA”) and comparable state statutes whose purpose is to protect the health and safety of workers. In addition, the OSHA hazard communication standard, the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act and comparable state statutes and any implementing regulations require that we organize and/or disclose information about hazardous materials used or produced in our operations and that this information be provided to employees, state and local governmental authorities and citizens. 
Related Permits and Authorizations
Many environmental laws require us to obtain permits or other authorizations from state and/or federal agencies before initiating certain drilling, construction, production, operation, or other oil and natural gas activities and to maintain these permits and compliance with their requirements for on-going operations. These permits are generally subject to protest, appeal, 
19

or litigation, which, in certain cases, can delay or halt projects and cease production or operation of wells, pipelines and other operations.
Related Insurance
We maintain insurance against some risks associated with above or underground contamination that may occur as a result of our exploration and production activities. However, this insurance is limited to activities at the well site, and there can be no assurance that this insurance will continue to be commercially available or that this insurance will be available at premium levels that justify its purchase by us. The occurrence of a significant event that is not fully insured or indemnified against could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operations.
Although we have not experienced any material adverse effect from compliance with environmental requirements, there is no assurance that this will continue. We did not have any material capital or other non-recurring expenditures in connection with complying with environmental laws or environmental remediation matters in 2018, nor do we anticipate that such expenditures will be material in 2019.
Employees
As of December 31, 2018, we employed 527 people. We consider our relations with employees to be satisfactory. Our future success will depend in part on our ability to attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel. We are not a party to any collective bargaining agreements and have not experienced any strikes or work stoppages. We regularly utilize the services of independent contractors to perform various field and other services.
