Item 1.    Business
Overview 
We are a leading global provider of life sciences sample exploration and management solutions for the life sciences market. We entered the life sciences market in 2011, leveraging our in-house capabilities of precision automation and cryogenics capabilities that we were then applying in the semiconductor market. These led us to provide solutions for automated ultra-cold storage. Since then, we have expanded our life sciences offerings both organically and through a series of acquisitions. We now support our customers from research to clinical development with our sample management, automated storage, and genomic services expertise to help our customers bring impactful therapies to market faster. We understand the importance of sample integrity and offer a broad portfolio of products and services supporting customers at every stage of the life cycle of samples, including procurement and sourcing, automated storage systems, genomic services and a multitude of sample consumables, informatics and data software, and sample repository solutions. Our expertise, global footprint, and leadership positions enable us to be a trusted global partner to pharmaceutical, biotechnology, and life sciences research institutions. In total, we employ approximately 3,200 full-time employees, part-time employees, and contingent workers worldwide and have sales in more than 100 countries. We are headquartered in Chelmsford, Massachusetts and have operations in North America, Asia, and Europe. 
Our Company was founded in 1978 and became a leading automation provider and partner to the global semiconductor manufacturing industry. In the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2021, we entered into a definitive agreement

to sell our semiconductor automation business, to Thomas H. Lee Partners, L.P., or THL, and completed the sale on February 1, 2022 for $2.9 billion in cash. The semiconductor automation results are classified as discontinued operations, and, unless otherwise noted, the description of our business in this Form 10-K relates solely to our continuing operations. 
In connection with the planned divesture of the semiconductor automation business and our continued focus on our life sciences businesses, we changed our corporate name from “Brooks Automation, Inc.” to “Azenta, Inc.” and our common stock started to trade on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol “AZTA” on December 1, 2021.
Our portfolio includes products and services offerings developed by us internally as well as many offerings we have added through multiple acquisitions designed to bring together a comprehensive capability to serve our customers’ needs in the sample-based services arena. We continue to develop new products and services offerings and enhance existing and acquired offerings through the expertise of our research and development resources. We believe our acquisition, investment, and integration approach has allowed us to accelerate internal development and significantly accelerate time to market.

Life Sciences Market
Our businesses serve a broad range of end markets within the life sciences industry in the pursuit of a growing list of scientific possibilities for advancing the development of therapies to improve people’s lives and cure diseases. With the advent of biologics and personalized medicine, biological samples have become critical assets to the success of drug and therapy pipelines, and the proper management and protection of these samples has gained increased importance to our customers. We believe this trend has created a sizable market opportunity for Azenta to provide comprehensive sample management and genomic solutions.
Since the successful mapping of the full human genome at the turn of this century, the market for genomic services has grown in support of research in biologic drug development, personalized medicine and cell/gene therapy. Top pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies can use their in-house laboratory resources to sequence the millions of genes needed as part of their research workflow. Still, many companies look to outsource their gene sequencing to independent laboratories that provide expedited results and expert consultative services. Other companies and institutions have fewer or no in-house options and make use of outsourced capabilities as their primary solution. We participate in this market as a value-added laboratory services provider, offering high quality genetic testing services with fast turnaround times. 
We have more than 12,000 customers globally and believe we are well positioned to expand our customer base. We serve top pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, the most advanced research hospitals performing clinical research and therapy development, as well as some of the newest and leading-edge start-ups in the biotech space. In addition, we also serve academic and government institutions. We believe that the sample-based services and products businesses will continue to demonstrate a growth trajectory and we do not observe cyclical demand for these offerings.
Segments
Our business is comprised of two reportable segments: Life Sciences Products and Life Sciences Services.
