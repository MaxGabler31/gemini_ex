Item 1. | Business
--------+---------


4Front Ventures Corp. (“4Front” or the “Company”) is a multi-state cannabis operator and retailer, with a market advantage in mass-produced, low-cost quality branded cannabis products. The Company manufactures and distributes a portfolio of over 25 cannabis brands including Marmas, Crystal Clear, Funky Monkey, Pebbles, and the Pure Ratios wellness collection, distributed through retail outlets, as well as the Company’s chain of branded dispensaries. From plant genetics to the cannabis retail experience, 4Front’s team applies expertise across the entire cannabis value chain. 
 Overview 
 The Company exists pursuant to the provisions of the British Columbia Corporations Act. On July 31, 2019, 4Front Holdings LLC (“Holdings”) completed a Reverse Takeover Transaction (“RTO”) with Cannex Capital Holdings, Inc. (“Cannex”) whereby Holdings acquired Cannex and the shareholders of Holdings became the controlling shareholders of the Company. Following the RTO, the Company’s SVS are listed on the Canadian Securities Exchange (“CSE”) under the ticker “FFNT” and are quoted on the OTCQX Best Market under the ticker “FFNTF”. 
 The Company has two primary operating segments: THC Cannabis and CBD Wellness. With regard to its THC Cannabis segment, as of December 31, 2021, the Company operated six dispensaries in Massachusetts, Illinois, and Michigan, primarily under the “MISSION” brand name. Also, as of December 31, 2021, the Company operated two production facilities in Massachusetts and one in Illinois. The Company produces the majority of products that are sold at its Massachusetts and Illinois dispensaries. Also as part of its THC Cannabis segment, the Company sells equipment, supplies and intellectual property to cannabis producers in the state of Washington. The Company also operates age-gated online educational platforms for THC Cannabis patients and customers. 
 The Company’s CBD Wellness segment is focused upon its ownership and operation of its wholly owned subsidiary, Pure Ratios Holdings, Inc. (“Pure Ratios”), a CBD-focused wellness company in California, that sells non-THC products throughout the United States. 
 While marijuana is legal under the laws of several U.S. states (with varying restrictions), the United States Federal Controlled Substances Act classifies all “marijuana” as a Schedule I drug, whether for medical or recreational use. Under U.S. federal law, a Schedule I drug or substance has a high potential for abuse, no accepted medical use in the United States, and a lack of safety data for the use of the drug under medical supervision. 
 Recent Developments 
 Acquisition of New England Cannabis Corporation 
 Please see Note 24 of the financial statements for a full description of the Company’s entrance into the NECC Merger Agreement on October 6, 2021, and related transactions. 
 Interim Chief Financial Officer 
 Effective July 15, 2021, the Company’s board of directors appointed Andrew Thut as the Company’s Interim Chief Financial Officer while the Company continues its search for a permanent Chief Financial Officer. Mr. Thut joined the Company in October 2014 as its Chief Investment Officer and will continue to serve as Chief Investment Officer during his tenure as Interim Chief Financial Officer of the Company. The Company’s search for a permanent Chief Financial Officer was on-going as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
COVID-19 Pandemic 
 In March 2020, the World Health Organization (“WHO”) declared COVID-19 a global pandemic and the United States declared a national emergency with respect to COVID-19. The emergence of COVID-19, an extremely infectious airborne respiratory virus, caused a significant response on the part of many governments to contain it. 
 The full extent of the COVID-19 pandemic impact continues to depend on future developments that remain highly uncertain and cannot be accurately predicted, including new information that may emerge concerning COVID-19, the actions taken to contain it or treat its impact, the identification and spread of COVID-19 variants such as the Delta and the Omicron variants, the distribution of vaccines, the acceptance of vaccines and the implementation of vaccine mandates, and the economic impact on local, regional, national and international markets. Management continues to actively monitor the developments regarding the pandemic and the impact that the pandemic could have on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and importantly the health and safety of our workforce. Given the continued volatility of the COVID-19 pandemic and the global responses to curb its spread, we are not able to estimate the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on our results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity for 2022. Any recovery from negative impacts to our business and related economic impact due to the COVID-19 pandemic may also be slowed or reversed by a number of factors, including the current widespread resurgence in COVID-19 infections attributable to the Omicron variant, combined with the seasonal flu. As such, we are unable to reasonably estimate the duration of the pandemic or fully ascertain its long-term impact to our business.

  Business Segments Reduction 
 As the Company grows and undergoes changes in the nature of operations of its business, it is necessary for management to assess how performance for the segment operations are viewed and measured. 
 In 2020, the Company determined the four operating segments meet the aggregation criteria set out in ASC Topic 280, Segment Reporting, and is presenting segment information in two reportable segments: 
 

• | THC Cannabis – Production and cultivation of THC cannabis, manufacturing and distribution of cannabis products to own dispensaries and third party retail customers, ancillary services supporting wholesale operations, and retail sales direct to end consumers
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | CBD Cannabis – Pure Ratios which encompasses the production and sale of CBD products to third-party customers
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Business 
 As of December 31, 2021, the Company had two business segments: 
 

• | THC Cannabis – Production and cultivation of THC cannabis, manufacturing and distribution of cannabis products to own dispensaries and third party retail customers, ancillary services supporting wholesale operations, and retail sales direct to end consumers
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | CBD Wellness – Pure Ratios which encompasses the production and sale of CBD products to third-party customers
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

THC Cannabis - Retail 
 As part of its THC Cannabis segment, the Company owns and operates three dispensaries in Massachusetts, and two dispensaries in Illinois and one dispensary in Michigan. The Company leases the real estate in connection with the Worcester, Massachusetts property, the Calumet City dispensary and the Om of Medicine LLC (“Om”) dispensary in Michigan and owns the real estate in connection with Mission South Shore and Georgetown Mission facilities. The Company also completed the sale and leaseback of the Company’s cultivation and production facilities in Tumwater, Washington and Georgetown, Massachusetts. 
 The Company’s dispensaries are, with the exception of Om in Michigan, branded under the “MISSION” retail brand. The dispensaries sell products which are either: (1) purchased from licensed cannabis producers in the state in which they operate, if allowed under state law and regulation; or, (2) transferred from the Company’s owned or managed production operations within the relevant state market as in the case of markets where “vertical integration” (i.e. jurisdictions in which the Company can and does own both retail and production cannabis assets such as Illinois or Massachusetts). Product availability varies depending on conditions in the Company’s key retail markets, and the performance of the Company’s own production assets. Product shortages are common during the initial launch of an adult use cannabis regime, such as in Illinois. Interstate commerce of cannabis is illegal under state and federal law and therefore the Company may not transfer inventory between key retail markets currently. 
 The Company is focused on expanding its own production assets in order to provide better product availability for the retail segment, especially focusing on increasing supply of high-quality dried cannabis flower in markets where such product is in relatively short supply, such as in Illinois and Massachusetts. 
 The Company sells cannabis packaged goods in accordance with applicable state law and regulation, generally through retail dispensaries (i.e. in store). However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company has expanded its services in certain markets to accommodate online ordering, curbside pickup and delivery where such activities are permitted by applicable state law and regulation. 
 
7 

  The Company operates age-gated online educational platforms (https://4frontventures.com/ and https://missiondispensaries.com/) for patients and customers of its dispensaries (the “Online Platform”). The content of such websites is not deemed to be incorporated by reference in this report or filed with the SEC. Prior to launching the Online Platform, the Company’s compliance team and internal and external counsel undertook a review of the applicable federal and state privacy, advertising and cannabis laws and launched the Online Platform in a manner intended to ensure compliance with such laws. The Online Platform allows patients and customers to understand the cannabis products that the Company offers and view real-time pricing and product availability at the Company’s dispensaries, and as a repository of miscellaneous corporate and investor information. The Online Platform does not provide any education, information or any other functionalities with respect to any third-party dispensaries. 
 No purchase or sale transactions occur on the Online Platform. A patient or customer may reserve products using the Online Platform, but the patient or customer must be physically present at one of the Company’s dispensaries to consummate the purchase and sale of products. This requirement allows the Company and dispensary staff to ensure that the Company’s standard operating procedures (including its compliance program(s)) are applied to all patients and customers in connection with the purchase and sale of products. 
 In jurisdictions where medical cannabis is legal, upon arrival of the patient at the applicable dispensary, dispensary staff must verify the patient’s identity and accreditation (such as a state-issued medical cannabis card) and confirm the patient’s allotment to ensure the user is not exceeding the state’s allotment limits. Once the foregoing is verified, the patient may pay for the product(s) to complete the purchase. If the customer does not have valid identification and accreditation, the customer will not be able to purchase medical cannabis at the applicable Company dispensary, irrespective of any reservation(s) made on the Online Platform. 
 In jurisdictions where recreational cannabis is legal, upon arrival of the customer at the applicable dispensary, dispensary staff must verify that the customer is at least 21 years of age by verifying the customer’s government-issued identification. Once the identification is verified, the customer may pay for the product(s) to complete the transaction. If the customer does not have valid identification, the customer will not be able to purchase recreational cannabis at the applicable Company dispensary, irrespective of any reservation(s) made on the Online Platform. 
 THC Cannabis - Production 
 Also as part of its THC Cannabis segment, the Company operates two production facilities in Massachusetts, one in Illinois, and one in California. 
 The Company produces dried cannabis flower and trim, extracted cannabis products such as wax and distillate, and cannabis infused edible products in its production facilities. 
 
8 

  The production segment utilizes certain raw materials to produce cannabis flowers and other extracted products. To produce and dry cannabis flower, the Company utilizes growing medium, nutrients, water, electrical power, soil adjuvants, and certain beneficial pests as part of its integrated pest management efforts. There are many sources for such products (except for water and power, which are provided by the local utility), and prices are reflective of commodity pricing worldwide. Some of these raw material inputs are sourced internationally, so changes in import laws or duties are a potential risk. The prices of power and water are generally stable and set through processes that involve governmental approvals over any increases, but the prices of growing medium, nutrients, etc. are all at least somewhat exposed to underlying commodity price volatility. 
 For extract products, an additional input is butane or propane for use as a solvent. These gases are largely a commodity, their pricing is reflective of worldwide conditions, and they are supplied to the Company’s operations by local suppliers of industrial gases and materials in the relevant jurisdictions. Prices for such inputs may be volatile, as with any other commodity. 
 The Company employs certain state registered and unregistered trademarks in association with its cannabis goods, including the dried cannabis flower brands “FUNKY MONKEY” and “LEGENDS,” the edibles brands “LEFT HANDED” and “VERDURE,” and the extracts brands “GOLDEN GOO” and “CRYSTAL CLEAR”. 
 CBD Wellness 
 The Company’s CBD Wellness segment is focused upon its ownership and operation of its wholly owned subsidiary, Pure Ratios. Pure Ratios is a cannabidiol (“CBD”) products company in California that sells a variety of CBD products, both directly to consumer, business to business, and through third party fulfilment vendors. The products include CBD patches, salves, roll-ons, and tablets containing CBD with apoptogenic mushroom ingredients. Pure Ratios produces certain base ingredients, such as the CBD plus proprietary ingredient mixtures which are then injected into the finished patches by contract manufacturers. The Company also sells its Pure Ratios branded products through its CBD e-commerce platform www.pureratios.com. The content of such websites is not deemed to be incorporated by reference in this report or filed with the SEC. 
 The Pure Ratios segment utilizes certain raw materials to produce its CBD source materials, as do its contract manufacturers. These products include CBD source material, and certain herbs and other Ayurvedic ingredients which are part of Pure Ratios’ formulations. These raw materials are generally commodities and their prices are reflective of worldwide commodity prices and volatility. 
 Pure Ratios utilizes reservoir patch technology, trade secrets and other intangible knowhow in the creation and formulation of the proprietary blend of herbs and other ingredients which are combined with CBD in its products. Pure Ratios allows NWCS (as defined below) to use its intellectual property for product sales. 
 Pure Ratios creates certain of its CBD source materials through its proprietary processes and techniques, but creation and assembly of finished goods (e.g. salves, patches, etc.) is contracted to third party contract manufacturers. Additionally, Pure Ratios contracts with an internet sales organization which advertises Pure Ratios products, and then fulfils those products as well. Pure Ratios is therefore economically dependent on such third party manufacturers, and the third party advertising/fulfilment company. 
 
9 

  In 2020, the market experienced a significant decrease in pricing across CBD products as additional suppliers entered the market. However, if federal and state policies change in favor of the industry, and if the FDA begins to test and regulate the quality of related consumer products, the downward trend in pricing could reverse. Please see the “Description of the U.S. Legal Cannabis Industry” section for further information on the regulatory landscape in which the Company operates.

Legal and Regulatory Matters 
 Regulation of Cannabis in the United States 
 Marijuana (cannabis) is illegal under U.S. federal law, and enforcement of relevant laws governing marijuana-related activities is a significant risk for the Company. The U.S. federal government regulates drugs through, among other things, the Controlled Substances Act (“CSA”), 21 U.S.C. § 801 et seq., which places controlled substances, including marijuana, in a schedule. Marijuana is a Schedule I drug. A Schedule I controlled substance is defined as having no currently accepted medical use and a high potential for abuse. With the limited exception of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s (“FDA”) approving Epidiolex (cannabidiol) (CBD) oral solution for the treatment of seizures associated with two rare and severe forms of epilepsy, Lennox-Gastaut syndrome and Dravet syndrome, the FDA has not approved cannabis or any cannabis-derived compound as safe and effective drug for any indication. FDA has approved Marinol and Syndros for therapeutic uses in the U.S., including for the treatment of anorexia associated with weight loss in AIDS patients. Marinol and Syndros include the active ingredient dronabinol, a synthetic delta-9- tetrahydrocannabinol (“THC”). Another FDA-approved drug, Cesamet, contains the active ingredient nabilone, which has a chemical structure similar to THC and is synthetically derived. 
 
16 

  Unlike in Canada, which has federal legislation governing the cultivation, distribution, sale, and possession of medical and adult-use cannabis, cannabis is largely regulated at the state level in the United States. 
 State laws regulating cannabis are in direct conflict with the federal CSA, which makes cannabis use and possession federally illegal. Although certain states and territories of the U.S. authorize medical, and in some cases also adult-use cannabis production and distribution by licensed entities, under U.S. federal law, the possession, use, cultivation, and transfer of cannabis and any related drug paraphernalia is illegal, and any such acts are criminal acts under federal law under any and all circumstances. Although the Company’s activities are compliant with applicable state and local laws, strict compliance with state and local laws with respect to cannabis may neither absolve the Company of liability under United States federal law, nor may it provide a defense to any federal proceeding which may be brought against the Company. 
 Given the illegality of marijuana under U.S. federal law, the Company’s access to capital could be negatively affected by public and/or private capital not being available to support continuing operations. At present, management believes that both private and public capital are available to the Company on terms acceptable to the Company, but management also believes that this capital availability could change without notice, requiring the Company to operate solely on internally generated funds. In the event that the Company has insufficient internally generated funds the Company could fail and you could lose all of your investment. Management is not currently aware of any specific U.S. federal or state initiatives that would lessen the Company’s capital access. 
 On January 4, 2018, then-U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions issued a memorandum to all U.S. Attorneys in which he rescinded previous guidance from the U.S. Department of Justice (“DOJ”) specific to cannabis enforcement in the United States, including the Memorandum drafted by former Deputy Attorney General James Michael Cole in 2013 (the “Cole Memo”). With the Cole Memo rescinded, U.S. federal prosecutors have been given discretion in determining whether to prosecute cannabis related violations of U.S. federal law. If DOJ pursues prosecutions, then the Company could face, among other things: (i) seizure of its cash and other assets used to support or derived from its cannabis subsidiaries; (ii) the arrest of its employees, directors, officers, managers and investors; (iii) charges of ancillary criminal violations of the CSA for aiding and abetting and conspiring to violate the CSA by virtue of providing financial support to cannabis companies that service or provide goods to state-licensed or permitted cultivators, processors, distributors, and/or retailers of cannabis; and/or (iv) barring employees, directors, officers, managers and investors who are not U.S. citizens from entry into the United States for life. On November 7, 2018, Mr. Sessions tendered his resignation as Attorney General at the request of President Donald Trump. Following Mr. Sessions’ resignation, William Barr was sworn in as United States Attorney General. During his confirmation hearing on January 15, 2019, Mr. Barr pledged not to pursue marijuana companies that comply with state law. This pledge was made in writing, when responding to written questions from Senators: “As discussed in my hearing, I do not intend to go after parties who have complied with the state law in reliance on the Cole Memorandum.” During William Barr’s tenure as Attorney General, DOJ did not pursue marijuana companies that comply with state law. On January 6, 2021, then President-elect Joe Biden announced his intention to nominate then-Chief Judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit Merrick Garland to succeed William Barr as Attorney General. On January 20, 2021, President Biden officially nominated Merrick Garland to serve as Attorney General. On March 10, 2021, the U.S. Senate confirmed Merrick Garland by a vote of 70-30. It is unclear what impact Merrick Garland serving as the U.S. Attorney General will have on DOJ’s marijuana-related enforcement. However, during his confirmation hearing on February 22, 2021, then-Chief Judge Garland said, among other things, that “It does not seem to me a useful use of limited resources that we have, to be pursuing prosecutions in states that have legalized and that are regulating the use of marijuana, either medically or otherwise. I don’t think that’s a useful use. I do think we need to be sure there are no end-runs around the state laws that criminal enterprises are doing. So that kind of enforcement should be continued. But I don’t think it’s a good use of our resources, where states have already authorized. That only confuses people, obviously, within the state.” 
 
17 

  Despite uncertainty regarding DOJ’s future treatment of marijuana, there has been limited federal legislative protection for the medical cannabis industry. For fiscal years 2015-2018, Congress adopted budget riders to the Consolidated Appropriations Acts (sometimes referred to as the Rohrabacher-Farr or Rohrabacher-Blumenauer Amendment) to prevent the federal government from using appropriated funds to enforce federal marijuana laws against regulated medical cannabis actors operating in compliance with state and local law. The Rohrabacher-Blumenauer Amendment was included in the fiscal year 2018 budget passed on March 23, 2018. The Rohrabacher-Blumenauer Amendment was included in the consolidated appropriations bill signed into legislation by then-President Trump in February 2019. In signing the Rohrabacher-Blumenauer Amendment, President Trump issued a signing statement noting that the Rohrabacher-Blumenauer Amendment “provides that the Department of Justice may not use any funds to prevent implementation of medical marijuana laws by various States and territories,” and further stating “I will treat this provision consistent with the President’s constitutional responsibility to faithfully execute the laws of the United States.” On June 20, 2019, the House approved a broader amendment that, in addition to protecting state medical cannabis programs, would also protect state adult use programs. On September 26, 2019, the Senate Appropriations Committee declined to take up the broader amendment but did approve the Rohrabacher-Blumenauer Amendment for the fiscal year 2020 spending bill. 
 On September 27, 2019, the Rohrabacher-Blumenauer Amendment was renewed as part of a stopgap spending bill, in effect through November 21, 2019. On July 30, 2020, the House passed an amendment, included in a Commerce, Justice, Science (CJS) Appropriations bill, that protects state-legal cannabis businesses from federal intervention by barring the Department of Justice from using taxpayer funds to enforce federal anti-cannabis laws in U.S. states that have legalized medical and/or adult-use cannabis. On December 27, 2020, the Rohrabacher-Blumenauer Amendment was approved as part of the omnibus spending bill for fiscal year 2021, effective through September 30, 2021. Congress has since been renewed the amendment several times, on September 30, 2021, December 3, 2021, February 18, 2022, and March 11, 2022. As a result, the amendment is effective through September 30, 2022. 
 Additionally, the Rohrabacher-Blumenauer Amendment may or may not be renewed in future bills in order to prevent the federal government from using congressionally appropriated funds to enforce federal cannabis laws against regulated medical cannabis actors operating in compliance with state and local law. If the Rohrabacher-Blumenauer Amendment is not renewed in the future, potential proceedings could involve significant restrictions being imposed upon the Company or third parties and divert our attention. Such proceedings could also have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, revenue, results of operation and financial condition, as well as our reputation, even if such proceedings were concluded successfully in our favor. 
 In spite of the limited federal legislative protection for the medical cannabis industry, there remains inconsistency between federal and state laws, U.S. federal enforcement practices going forward and the inconsistency between U.S. federal and state laws and regulations present major risks for us.

  Regulation of Industrial Hemp in the United States Federally 
 On December 20, 2018, the Agricultural Improvement Act of 2018 (commonly known as the “2018 Farm Bill”) was signed into law. The 2018 Farm Bill, among other things, removes industrial hemp and its derivatives, including cannabidiol (“CBD”), from the CSA and amends the Agricultural Marketing Act of 1946 to allow for industrial hemp production and sale in the United States. Under the Farm Bill, industrial hemp is defined as “the plant Cannabis sativa L. and any part of that plant, including the seeds thereof and all derivatives, extracts, cannabinoids, isomers, acids, salts, and salts of isomers, whether growing or not, with a delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol concentration of not more than 0.3 percent on a dry weight basis.” 
 The 2018 Farm Bill did not legalize CBD derived from “marijuana” (as such term is defined in the CSA), which is and remains a Schedule I controlled substance under the CSA. The U.S. Department of Agriculture (“USDA”) is responsible for promulgating regulations under the 2018 Farm Bill. Pursuant to the 2018 Farm Bill, U.S. territories and tribal governments may adopt their own regulatory plans for hemp production even if more restrictive than federal regulations so long as they meet minimum federal standards approved by the USDA. Those territories or tribal governments which choose not to adopt their own hemp production regulations will be governed by USDA regulations. 
 On October 31, 2019, the USDA issued an interim final ruling governing domestic production of hemp under the 2018 Farm Bill which establishes the U.S. Domestic Hemp Production Program and opened a 60-day public comment period. On January 15, 2021, USDA issued its final hemp production program rule. The rule outlines various USDA requirements for state and tribal hemp programs and provide for a process of state/tribal hemp production plan submission and USDA approval/rejection within 60 days of such submission. There can be no assurances regarding any plan’s acceptance, and the final rulemaking may potentially be delayed. 
 The 2018 Farm Bill also preserved the FDA’s authority related to the introduction of hemp and hemp-derived compounds, such as CBD, in foods, beverages, cosmetics, and dietary supplements. FDA’s current view is that it is unlawful under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (“FD&C Act”) to introduce food containing added CBD or THC into interstate commerce, or to market CBD or THC products as, or in, dietary supplements. When a substance is excluded from the dietary supplement definition in the FD&C Act, like CBD is, FDA could issue a regulation, after notice and comment, finding that CBD would be lawful under the FD&C Act. To date, FDA has issued no such regulation regarding CBD and there can be no assurances that FDA will issue such a regulation. With regard to topical CBD products (i.e., cosmetics), FDA has said that CBD is not a prohibited cosmetic ingredient (i.e., that CBD topicals are permissible) as long as the product is not intended to affect the structure or function of the body, or to diagnose, cure, mitigate, treat or prevent disease. Despite FDA’s position on ingestible CBD products, to date, FDA has not taken enforcement action against producers of such products absent therapeutic claims being made about use of such products. More specifically, FDA has only issued Warning Letters to producers of ingestible CBD products for making therapeutic claims – with a focus on more aggressive claims – involving the treatment of conditions such as COVID-19, AIDS, diabetes, post-traumatic stress disorder, Alzheimer’s disease, cancer, neuropathy, chronic pain, and anxiety. So far, selling an ingestible CBD product, but not making treatment claims about the same, has not resulted in FDA enforcement action. Accordingly, even though ingestible CBD products violate the FD&C Act, FDA does not seem interested in pursuing enforcement action against such products unless they bear therapeutic claims. There can be no assurances regarding FDA continuing this approach to CBD enforcement. FDA has also issued Warning Letters to producers of topical CBD products that bear pain relief claims, for falsely claiming that products are FDA registered, for falsely claiming that products are over-the-counter (“OTC”) drugs, for including OTC drug ingredients in a CBD product without approval to do so, and/or for violating current good manufacturing practices (“cGMPs”). 
 Nature of the Business Model 
 Since the cultivation, processing, production, distribution, and sale of cannabis for any purpose, medical, adult use or otherwise, remain illegal under U.S. federal law, it is possible that the Company may be forced to cease activities. The United States federal government, through, among others, the DOJ, its sub agency the Drug Enforcement Administration (“DEA”), and the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”), has the right to actively investigate, audit and shut down cannabis growing facilities, processors and retailers. 
 
19 

  U.S. State Regulatory Uncertainty 
 There is no assurance that state laws authorizing and regulating the sale and use of cannabis will not be repealed, amended or overturned, or that local governmental authorities will not limit the applicability of state laws within their respective jurisdictions. If the U.S. federal government begins to enforce U.S. federal laws relating to cannabis in states where the sale and use of cannabis is currently legal, or if existing state laws are repealed or curtailed, the Company’s business or operations in those states or under those laws would be materially and adversely affected. Federal actions against any individual or entity engaged in the cannabis industry or a substantial repeal of cannabis related legislation could adversely affect the Company, its business and its assets or investments. 
 Certain U.S. states where medical and/or adult use cannabis is authorized have or are considering special taxes or fees on the cannabis industry. It is uncertain at this time whether other states are in the process of reviewing such additional taxes and fees. 
 The Company is Subject to Applicable Anti-Money Laundering Laws and Regulations 
 The Company is subject to a variety of laws and regulations domestically in the U.S. that involve money laundering, financial record-keeping and proceeds of crime, including the U.S. Currency and Foreign Transactions Reporting Act of 1970 (commonly known as the “Bank Secrecy Act”), as amended by Title III of the Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001 (the “USA Patriot Act”), and the rules and regulations thereunder, and any related or similar rules, regulations or guidelines, issued, administered or enforced by governmental authorities in the U.S.. The Company is also subject to similar laws and regulations in Canada, including the Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) and Terrorist Financing Act (Canada), as amended. Further, under U.S. federal law, banks or other financial institutions that provide a cannabis business with a checking account, debit or credit card, small business loan, or any other service could be found guilty of money laundering, aiding and abetting, or conspiracy. 
 Despite these laws, the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (“FinCEN”) issued a memorandum on February 14, 2014 (the “FinCEN Memorandum”) outlining the pathways for financial institutions to bank state-sanctioned cannabis businesses in compliance with federal enforcement priorities. The FinCEN Memorandum echoed the enforcement priorities of the Cole Memorandum. Under these guidelines, financial institutions must submit a Suspicious Activity Report (“SAR”) in connection with all cannabis-related banking activities by any client of such financial institution, in accordance with federal money laundering laws. These cannabis-related SARs are divided into three categories - cannabis limited, cannabis priority, and cannabis terminated - based on the financial institution’s belief that the business in question follows state law, is operating outside of compliance with state law, or where the banking relationship has been terminated, respectively. 
 The FinCEN Memorandum states that in some circumstances, it is permissible for banks to provide services to cannabis-related businesses without risking prosecution for violation of federal money laundering laws. It refers to supplementary guidance included in the Cole Memorandum. 
 The rescission of the Cole Memorandum has not yet affected the status of the FinCEN Memorandum, nor has the Department of the Treasury given any indication that it intends to rescind the FinCEN Memorandum itself. 
 
20 

  Although the FinCEN Memorandum remains intact, it is unclear whether the current administration will continue to follow the guidelines of the FinCEN Memorandum. The DOJ continues to have the right and power to prosecute crimes committed by banks and financial institutions, such as money laundering and violations of the Bank Secrecy Act, that occur in any state including states that have in some form legalized the sale of cannabis. Further, the conduct of the DOJ’s enforcement priorities could change for any number of reasons. A change in the DOJ’s priorities could result in the DOJ’s prosecuting banks and financial institutions for crimes that were not previously prosecuted. 
 Restricted Access to Banking 
 In February 2014, FinCEN issued the FinCEN Memorandum (which is not law) which provides guidance with respect to financial institutions providing banking services to cannabis business, including burdensome due diligence expectations and reporting requirements. This guidance does not provide any safe harbors or legal defenses from examination or regulatory or criminal enforcement actions by the DOJ, FinCEN or other federal regulators. Thus, most banks and other financial institutions in the United States do not appear to be comfortable providing banking services to cannabis-related businesses, or relying on this guidance, which can be amended or revoked at any time by the executive branch. In addition to the foregoing, banks may refuse to process debit card payments and credit card companies generally refuse to process credit card payments for cannabis-related businesses. As a result, the Company may have limited or no access to banking or other financial services in the United States. In addition, federal money laundering statutes and Bank Secrecy Act regulations discourage financial institutions from working with any organization that sells a controlled substance, regardless of whether the state it resides in permits cannabis sales. While the United States House of Representatives has passed the SAFE Banking Act multiple times, which would permit commercial banks to offer services to cannabis companies that are in compliance with state law, it has not yet been passed by the U.S. Senate, and if Congress fails to pass the SAFE Banking Act, the Company’s inability, or limitations on the Company’s ability, to open or maintain bank accounts, obtain other banking services and/or accept credit card and debit card payments may make it difficult for the Company to operate and conduct its business as planned or to operate efficiently. 
Lack of Access to U.S. Bankruptcy Protections; Other Bankruptcy Risks 
 Because cannabis remains illegal under U.S. federal law, many courts have denied cannabis businesses bankruptcy protections, thus making it very difficult for lenders to recoup their investments in the cannabis industry in the event of a bankruptcy. If the Company were to experience a bankruptcy, there is no guarantee that U.S. federal bankruptcy protections would be available, which would have a material adverse effect. In addition, bankruptcy or other similar proceedings are often a complex and lengthy process, the outcome of which may be uncertain and could result in a material adverse effect on the Company. 
Heightened Scrutiny by Canadian Authorities 
 Because cannabis is illegal under U.S. federal law, the business, operations and investments of the Company in the U.S., and any future businesses, operations and investments, may become the subject of heightened scrutiny by securities regulators, stock exchanges and other authorities in Canada. As a result, the Company may be subject to significant direct and indirect interaction with Canadian public officials. There can be no assurance that this heightened scrutiny will not in turn lead to the imposition of certain restrictions on the Company’s ability to invest or hold interests in other entities in the U.S. or any other jurisdiction, or have consequences for its stock exchange listing or Canadian reporting obligations, in addition to those described herein. See “The Company’s Business Activities are Illegal under U.S. Federal Law”. 
 
21 

  On February 8, 2018, the Canadian Securities Administrators published Staff Notice 51-352 - Issuers with U.S. Marijuana-Related Activities (“Staff Notice 51-352”) describing the Canadian Securities Administrators’ disclosure expectations for specific risks facing issuers with cannabis-related activities in the U.S. Staff Notice 51-352 confirms that a disclosure-based approach remains appropriate for issuers with U.S. cannabis-related activities. Staff Notice 51-352 includes additional disclosure expectations that apply to all issuers with U.S. cannabis-related activities, including those with direct and indirect involvement in the cultivation and distribution of cannabis, as well as issuers that provide goods and services to third parties involved in the U.S. cannabis industry. 
 CDS Clearing and Depository Services Inc. (“CDS”) is Canada’s central securities depository, clearing and settling trades in the Canadian equity, fixed income and money markets. On February 8, 2018, following discussions with the Canadian Securities Administrators and recognized Canadian securities exchanges, the TMX Group, which is the owner and operator of CDS, announced the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding (“MOU”) with Aequitas NEO Exchange Inc., the CSE and the Toronto Stock Exchange confirming that it relies on such exchanges to review the conduct of listed issuers. The MOU notes that securities regulation requires that the rules of each of the exchanges must not be contrary to the public interest and that the rules of each of the exchanges have been approved by the securities regulators. Pursuant to the MOU, CDS will not ban accepting deposits of or transactions for clearing and settlement of securities of issuers with cannabis-related activities in the U.S. Even though the MOU indicated that there are no plans of banning the settlement of securities of issuers with U.S. cannabis related activities through CDS, there can be no guarantee that the settlement of securities will continue in the future. 
 Constraints on Marketing Products 
 The development of the Company’s business and operating results may be hindered by applicable restrictions on sales and marketing activities imposed by government regulatory bodies for products containing cannabis or ingredients derived from cannabis, including but not limited, to the FDA, USDA, the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”), and state regulatory agencies that may institute new regulatory requirements. The regulatory environment in the United States limits the Company’s ability to compete for market share in a manner similar to other industries. If the Company is unable to effectively market its products and compete for market share, or if the costs of compliance with government legislation and regulation cannot be absorbed through increased selling prices for its products, the Company’s sales and operating results could be adversely affected. 
Reliance on Management or Consulting Services Agreements with Subsidiaries and Affiliates 
 The Company’s subsidiaries and other affiliates provide assistance and advice regarding the medicinal cannabis business in certain cases through management services agreements entered into with state-licensed entities. Under such agreements, the subsidiaries and affiliates perform certain management and operational services. In exchange for providing these services, the subsidiaries and affiliates receive management fees which are a key source of revenue for the Company. Payment of such fees is dependent on the continuing validity and enforceability of the relevant management services agreements. If such agreements are found to be invalid or unenforceable by regulators, whether on the basis that they relate to activities that are illegal under U.S. federal law or otherwise, or are terminated by the counter-party, this could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, prospects, financial condition, and operating results. 
 
22 

  Tax Risks Related to Controlled Substances 
 Limits on U.S. deductibility of certain expenses may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Section 280E (“Section 280E”) of the Internal Revenue Code (the “Code”) prohibits businesses from deducting certain expenses associated with the trafficking of controlled substances (within the meaning of Schedule I and II of the CSA). IRS has applied Section 280E in tax audits against various cannabis businesses in the U.S. that are permitted under applicable state laws. Although the IRS issued a clarification allowing the deduction of certain expenses, the scope of such items is interpreted very narrowly, and the bulk of operating costs and general administrative costs are not permitted to be deducted. While there are currently several pending cases before various administrative and federal courts challenging these restrictions, there is no guarantee that these courts will issue an interpretation of Section 280E that is favorable to cannabis businesses. 
Limited Trademark Protection 
 We will not be able to register any U.S. federal trademarks in classes covering their cannabis-related products or services under the current state of federal law. Because producing, manufacturing, processing, possessing, distributing, and selling cannabis is illegal under the CSA, the United States Patent and Trademark Office (“USPTO”) will not permit the registration of any trademark that does not comply with the CSA. As a result, the Company will unlikely be able to protect its cannabis product trademarks beyond the geographic areas in which its subsidiaries conduct business pursuant to the relevant state’s law. 
Civil Asset Forfeiture 
 Because the cannabis industry remains illegal under U.S. federal law, any real or personal property owned by participants in the cannabis industry, such as the Company, which is used in the course of conducting such business, or any property or monies deemed to be proceeds of an illegal cannabis business, could be subject to seizure by law enforcement and subsequent civil asset forfeiture, even in the absence of a criminal charge or conviction. 
 FDA Regulation 
 Cannabis containing more than 0.3% THC (tetrahydrocannabinol) remains a Schedule I controlled substance under U.S. federal law. If the federal government reclassifies cannabis to a Schedule II controlled substance, it is possible that the FDA would regulate it under the FD&C Act, or under the Public Health Service Act. Additionally, the FDA may issue rules, regulations or guidance including good manufacturing practices, related to the growth, cultivation, harvesting and processing of medical cannabis. If regulated by the FDA as a drug, clinical trials would be needed to demonstrate efficacy and safety. It is also possible that the FDA would require that facilities where medical-use cannabis is grown register with the FDA and comply with certain federally prescribed regulations. 
 In addition, while the FDA has not yet pursued enforcement actions against the cannabis industry, it has sent numerous warning letters to sellers of CBD products making health claims. The FDA could turn its attention to the cannabis industry especially relating to claims of concern. In the event that some or all of these regulations or enforcement actions are imposed, what the impact this would have on the cannabis industry is unknown, including what costs, requirements and possible prohibitions may be enforced.

  Laws and Regulations Affecting the Industry in which the Company Operates are Constantly Changing 
 The constant evolution of laws and regulations affecting the cannabis industry could detrimentally affect the Company. The current and proposed operations of the Company and its subsidiaries are subject to a variety of local, state and federal medical cannabis laws and regulations relating to the manufacture, management, transportation, storage and disposal of cannabis, as well as laws and regulations relating to consumable products health and safety, the conduct of operations and the protection of the environment. These laws and regulations are broad in scope and subject to evolving interpretations, which could require the Company to incur substantial costs associated with compliance or alter certain aspects of their business plans. In addition, violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could disrupt certain aspects of the business plans of the Company and result in a material adverse effect on certain aspects of their planned operations. These laws and regulations are rapidly evolving and subject to change with minimal notice. Regulatory changes may adversely affect the Company’s profitability or cause it to cease operations entirely. The cannabis industry may come under scrutiny or further scrutiny by, the FDA, USDA, DEA, IRS, SEC, the DOJ, the Financial Industry Regulatory Advisory or other federal or applicable state or nongovernmental regulatory authorities or self-regulatory organizations that supervise or regulate the production, distribution, sale or use of cannabis for medical or adult use purposes in the United States. It is impossible to determine the extent of the impact of any new laws, regulations or initiatives that may be proposed, or whether any proposals will become law. The regulatory uncertainty surrounding the industry may adversely affect the business and operations of the Company, including without limitation, the costs to remain compliant with applicable laws and the impairment of its business or the ability to raise additional capital. In addition, the Company will not be able to predict the nature of any future laws, regulations, interpretations or applications, and it is possible that regulations may be enacted in the future that will be directly applicable to its business. For example, see the “Risk Factors - Heightened Scrutiny by Canadian Authorities” related to CDS above. 
 Limitation on Ownership of Licenses 
 In certain states, the cannabis laws and regulations limit not only the number of cannabis licenses issued, but also the number of cannabis licenses that one person or entity may own. For example, in Massachusetts, no person may have an ownership interest, or control over, more than three license holders in any category - cultivation, processing or dispensing. The Company believes that, where such restrictions apply, it may still capture significant share of revenue in the market through wholesale sales, exclusive marketing relations, provision of management or consulting services, franchising and similar arrangement with other operators. Nevertheless, such limitations on the acquisition of ownership of additional licenses within certain states may limit the Company’s ability to grow organically or to increase its market share in such states. 
 The Regulatory Landscape on a U.S. State Level 
 Illinois 
 Legislative History 
 In January 2014, the Compassionate Use of Medical Cannabis Pilot Program Act, which allows individuals diagnosed with certain debilitating or “qualified” medical conditions to access medical marijuana, became effective. In January 2019, the Illinois Department of Health launched the Opioid Alternative Pilot Program, that allows individuals who have/ could receive a prescription for opioids to access to medical marijuana. In June 2019, Illinois legalized adult use marijuana pursuant to the Cannabis Regulation and Tax Act (the “IL Act”). Effective January 1, 2020, Illinois residents 21 years of age and older may possess up to 30 grams of marijuana (non- residents may possess up to 15 grams). The IL Act authorizes the IDFPR to issue up to 75 Conditional Adult Use Dispensing Organization licenses before May 1, 2020 and an additional 110 conditional licenses during 2021 (no person may hold a financial interest in more than 10 Dispensing Organizations). Existing medical dispensaries were able to apply for an “Early Approval Adult Use Dispensing Organization License” to serve adult users at an existing medical dispensary or at a secondary site. The IDFPR has granted approximately 48 Early Approval Adult Use Dispensing Organization licenses to date. The IDFPR also held an application period for Conditional Adult Use Cannabis Dispensary Licenses from December 10, 2019 through January 2, 2020. Licenses from this round of applications have not yet been awarded, and the anticipated award date has been delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic and challenges to the application process. 
 
24 

  The Illinois Department of Agriculture (the “IL Ag. Department”) is authorized to make up to 30 cultivation center licenses available between the state’s medical and adult-use programs. Existing cultivation centers were able to apply for an “Early Approval Adult Use Cultivation Center License” and approximately 21 have been issued to date. No person can hold a financial interest in more than three cultivation centers, and the centers are limited to 210,000 square feet of canopy space. Cultivation center are also prohibited from discriminating in price when selling to dispensaries, craft growers, or infuser organizations. The IL Ag. Department recently closed an application period for craft growers, infusers, and cannabis transporters. 
 The IL Act imposes several operational requirements on adult-use licensees. Licensees must establish methods for identifying, recording, and reporting diversion, theft, or loss, correcting inventory errors, and complying with product recalls. Licensees also must comply with detailed inventory, storage, and security requirements. Cultivation licenses are subject to similar operational requirements, such as complying with detailed security and storage requirements, and must also establish plans to address energy, water, and waste-management needs. Dispensary licenses will be renewed bi-annually, and cultivation licenses, craft grower licenses, infuser organization licenses, and transporter licenses will be renewed annually. 
 Licenses and Regulation 
 Oversight and implementation of the IL Act and CRTA are divided among three Illinois state departments: the Department of Public Health (the “IL DPH”), the Department of Agriculture (the “IL DOA”), and the Department of Financial and Professional Regulation (the “IDFPR”). The IL DPH oversees the following IL Act mandates: (a) establish and maintain a confidential registry of caregivers and qualifying patients authorized to engage in the medical use of cannabis, (b) distribute educational materials about the health risks associated with the abuse of cannabis and prescription medications, (c) adopt rules to administer the patient and caregiver registration program, and (d) adopt rules establishing food handling requirements for cannabis-infused products that are prepared for human consumption. It is the responsibility of the IL DOA to administer and enforce provisions of the IL Act and the CRTA Act relating to the oversight and registration of cultivation centers, craft growers, infusers, transporters, and agents, including the issuance of identification cards and establishing limits on potency or serving size for cannabis or cannabis products. The IDFPR enforces the provisions of the CRTA & IL Act relating to the registration and oversight of dispensing organizations. 
 Under the IL Act, dispensary, grower, and production licenses are valid for one year. After the initial term, licensees are required to submit renewal applications. Pursuant to the IL Act, registration renewal applications must be received 45 days prior to expiration and may be denied if the licensee has a history of non-compliance and penalties. 
 
25 

  Under the CRTA, all cannabis business licenses, and agent cards must be renewed annually. Similar to the IL Act, after the initial term, licensees are required to submit renewal applications. Registration renewal applications must be received 45 days prior to expiration and may be denied if the licensee has a history of non-compliance and penalties. 
 Under the CRTA, cultivation centers may grow cannabis, extract cannabis concentrates and infuse cannabis into products. All cannabis plants in a cultivation center must be grown in an enclosed place with restricted access. 
 All products grown and made in cultivation centers will be sold solely to dispensing organizations, craft growers, or infusers. If there is a shortage of cannabis supply, priority must be given to medical patient supplies. When it comes to pricing, the same price should apply for all buyers, the cultivation centers are prohibited from discrimination. 
 Storage and Security 
 Mission dispensaries must store inventory on-site in a secured and restricted-access area and enter information into the State’s tracking system in accordance with applicable law. Dispensing facilities are also required to implement security measures designed to deter and prevent unauthorized entry into the facility (and restricted-access areas) and theft, loss or diversion of cannabis or cannabis products including a commercial grade alarm and surveillance system. 
Reporting Requirements 
 The state of Illinois uses BioTrack THC as its inventory tracking system. All dispensing organization licensees are required to use a real-time, web-based inventory tracking/point-of-sale system that is accessible to IDFPR at any time, and at a minimum, tracks date of sale, amount, price, and currency. Mission uses LeafLogix for both inventory management and as a point-of-sale system, which directly reports sales and inventory data to the state’s BioTrack system. Licensees are also required to track each sales transaction at the time of the sale, daily beginning and ending inventory, acquisitions (including information about the supplier and the product) and disposal. 
Transportation Requirements 
 Currently, licensed cultivation centers may transport cannabis and cannabis products in accordance with certain guidelines including with respect to manifest records and sealed packaging; however, cultivation centers will be prohibited from transporting adult-use cannabis without obtaining a separate transporting organization license. 
Massachusetts 
 Legislative History 
 The Massachusetts Medical Use of Cannabis Program (the “MA Program”) was established pursuant to the Act for the Humanitarian Medical Use of Cannabis (the “MA ACT”). The MA Program allows registered persons to purchase medical cannabis and applies to any patient, personal caregiver, Registered Cannabis Dispensary (each, a “RMD”), and RMD agent under the MA Program. To qualify, patients must suffer from one of 14 debilitating conditions as defined by the MA Program. The Cannabis Control Commission (the “MA CCC”) is responsible for the administration of the MA Program. Massachusetts enacted An Act to Ensure Safe Access to Cannabis, and established the MA CCC in 2017. The MA CCC reviews applications and issues licenses for adult-use Cannabis Establishments (ME’s) and Medical Cannabis Treatment Centers (MTC’s), formerly known as Registered Cannabis Dispensaries (RMD’s). 
 
26 

  The Legalization of adult recreational sales of cannabis in Massachusetts went into effect in July 2018. As of April 14, 2022, there were approximately 83 cultivation centers, 7 delivery couriers, 11 independent testing labs, 2 marijuana transporters with other existing marijuana establishment licenses, 5 microbusinesses, 1 microbusiness with a delivery endorsement, 63 product manufacturers, 215 retailers, and 4 third-party transporters that had been authorized to commence operations in Massachusetts. 
 Licenses 
 An MTC is an entity licensed under the medical regulations. An MTC cultivates, processes, acquires, transports, distributes and dispenses, products containing cannabis or cannabis, related supplies, or educational materials to registered qualifying patients or their personal caregivers for medical use. MTCs may deliver cannabis and cannabis products directly to patients and caregivers after receiving MA CCC approval. 
 A Cannabis Cultivator may cultivate, process, and package cannabis, to transfer cannabis to other MEs, but not to consumers. Cultivators must select what tier they will be in by determining the total canopy they will cultivate. 
 A Cannabis Retailer is an entity authorized to purchase and transport cannabis and cannabis products from other MEs, and to sell or otherwise transfer cannabis and cannabis products to other MEs and to consumers. A Cannabis Retailer provides a retail location which may be accessed by consumers 21 years of age or older or, if the retailer is co-located with an MTC, by individuals who are also registered qualifying patients or personal caregivers. 
 Each license type is valid for one year and must be renewed no later than 60 calendar days prior to expiration. As in other states where cannabis is legal, the MA CCC can deny or revoke licenses and renewals for multiple reasons, including (a) submission of materially inaccurate, incomplete, or fraudulent information, (b) failure to comply with any applicable law or regulation, (c) failure to submit or implement a plan of correction, (d) attempting to assign registration to another entity, (e) insufficient financial resources, (f) committing, permitting, aiding, or abetting of any illegal practices in the operation of all cannabis businesses, (g) failure to cooperate or give information to relevant law enforcement related to a licensed cannabis business, and (h) lack of responsible operations. License holders must ensure that no cannabis is sold, delivered, or distributed by a producer from or to a location outside of this state. 
 Record-keeping/Reporting 
 Records of a cannabis business establishment must be available for inspection by the Commission, on request including financial records, operating procedures, inventory records, seed-to-sale tracking records for all cannabis and cannabis infused products, personnel records, business records and waste disposal records. 
 Massachusetts uses METRC as the T&T system. Individual licensees, whether directly or through a third-party application programming interface, are required to push data to the state to meet all reporting requirements. 
 Inventory/Storage 
 Through the T&T system, licensed cannabis businesses are required to record all actions related to each individual cannabis plant from seed and cultivation, through growth, harvest and preparation of cannabis infused products, if any, to final sale of finished products. This system must chronicle every step, ingredient, activity, transaction, and dispensary agent, registered qualifying patient, or personal caregiver who handles, obtains, or possesses the product. Licensed businesses must also establish and abide by inventory controls and procedures for conducting inventory reviews and comprehensive inventories of cultivating, finished, and stored cannabis products. 
 
27 

  Licensees are required to ensure that all cannabis and cannabis infused products be securely stored and all safes, vaults, and other equipment or areas used for the production, cultivation, harvesting, processing, or storage of cannabis and cannabis infused products are securely locked and protected against unauthorized entry with restricted access. 
 Security 
 Adequate commercial grade security systems that prevent and detect diversion, theft, or loss of cannabis are required of each cannabis business under the regulations including perimeter alarms, notification systems for surveillance system failures, surveillance cameras and duress alarm, panic alarm, or holdup alarm connected to local public safety or law enforcement authorities. 
Transportation 
 The MA Program regulates the means and methods by which cannabis is transported including with respect to security, segregation, manifest maintenance, alarm systems and randomized routes. Cannabis and cannabis infused products may not be transported outside Massachusetts. 
Advertising 
 The regulations also govern advertising, promotional items, marketing restrictions, misleading statements and use of cannabis images. Cannabis may be displayed within the establishment, and price lists may be printed and displayed in the establishment and on the establishment’s website. 
Michigan 
 Legislative History 
 In 2008, the Michigan Compassionate Care Initiative established a medical cannabis program for serious and terminally ill patients. The Michigan Medical Cannabis Act (“MMM Act”) came into force in December 2008. 
 In 2016, the Michigan legislature passed two new acts and also amended the original MMM Act. The first act, the Medical Marihuana Facilities Licensing Act (“MMFLA”) establishes a licensing and regulation framework for medical cannabis growers, processors, secure transporters, provisioning centers, and safety compliance facilities. The second act, the Marihuana Tracking Act (“MTA”) establishes a “seed-to-sale” system to track cannabis that is grown, processed, transferred, stored, or disposed of under the Medical Cannabis Facilities Licensing Act. 
 The Bureau of Medical Cannabis Regulation is responsible for the oversight of medical cannabis in Michigan and consists of the Medical Cannabis Facility Licensing Division and the Michigan Medical Cannabis Program Division. The MMM Act provides access to state residents to cannabis and cannabis related products under several debilitating conditions.

  In November of 2018, Michigan voters approved the Michigan Regulation and Taxations of Marihuana Act (“MRTMA”), which established a licensing and regulatory framework for adult-use growers, processors, secure transporters, retailers, microbusinesses, event organizers, designated consumption establishments, and safety compliance facilities. Recreational cannabis was legalized by ballot initiative, Proposition 1, in November 2018. The initiative mandates that the Michigan Department of Licensing and Regulatory Affairs (“LARA”) also known as the Marijuana Regulatory Agency (“MRA”), began accepting applications for retail stores December 2019. The initial application period is limited to existing medical cannabis license holders. 
 Proposition 1 allows adults 21 years of age and older to use cannabis recreationally and grow up to 12 plants, sets a 10-ounce limit for cannabis stored in residences (quantities over 2.5 ounces must be kept in a locked container), and establishes a state licensing system for cannabis businesses. A 10 percent tax is imposed on all cannabis sales, which are directed towards education, transportation infrastructure, and local governments. It also changes violations from crimes to civil infractions. 
 The Emergency Rules for Adult-Use Marijuana Establishments promulgated on July 3, 2019 allow a person to obtain equivalent licenses and – when those equivalent licenses have common ownership – to operate those equivalent licenses at the same location. On April 8, 2020, MRA issued an advisory bulletin regarding transfer of marijuana between equivalent licenses. Per the bulletin, beginning on December 1, 2019, MRA restricted certain transfers from/to growers, processors, and provisioning centers. 
 The MRA and State of Michigan attempted to combine the medical and adult-use markets during the 2019-2020 legislative session, but the proposed bill did not receive a vote in both legislative bodies. However, while the MMFLA and MRTMA remain separate and distinct laws, the MRA adopted topic-based Administrative Rules in June 2020 which address both medical facilities and adult-use establishments. 
 On September 27, 2021, the MRA held a public hearing to receive comments on updated Administrative Rules that are intended to provide clarity and consistency to licensees in both the medical and adult-use markets. Final drafts of the amended Administrative Rules were published in January 2022. There is no official date at this time for the updated Administrative Rules to become effective. 
 Under both the MMFLA and MRTMA Michigan municipalities can choose if they will allow cannabis establishments or facilities, and the type and number of establishments or facilities within their jurisdiction. This includes licensing and zoning ordinances for many municipalities. Because each municipality is able to devise a unique set of rules for cannabis licenses, each facility or establishment in a different Michigan municipality may be subject to a different set of local ordinances. 
 Licensing 
 Any combination of a (a) grower, (b) processor, or (c) dispensary (“provisioning center”) may operate as separate cannabis facilities at the same location. Each license will be required to have separate entrances and exits, inventory, record keeping, and point of sale operations, if applicable. A cannabis facility operating at a same location under this rule with multiple state operating licenses may transfer cannabis product or money between facilities authorized to operate at the same location as long as certain conditions are met, including with regard to common ownership, an employee at each facility monitoring and executing transfers, manifests in the statewide monitoring system being created, and receipt of transfer being recorded in the statewide system. 
 The Department and the Board cannot limit the number of licenses issued. The number of licenses issued will be based on the local municipality which may limit the type and number of facilities authorized within its boundaries. 
 Inventory 
 METRC is Michigan’s state-wide seed-to-sale cannabis tracking system that uses serialized tags attached to every plant and labels attached to wholesale packages to track cannabis inventory. 
 The following tests must be completed prior to product be sold: (a) Moisture content, (b) Potency analysis, (c) THC level, (d) THCa level, (e) CBD and CBDa levels, (f) Foreign matter inspection, (g) Microbial and mycotoxin screening, (h) Pesticides, (i) Chemical residue, (j) Fungicides, (k) Insecticides, (l) Heavy metals screening, (m) Residual solvents levels, (n) Terpene analysis, & (o) Water content. 
 Prior to a cannabis product being sold or transferred to or by a dispensary, the product must be labelled with the following information: name & license number of the producer and processor, unique identification number, date of harvest, name of strain, net weight, concentration of THC or CBD, activation time expressed in words or through a pictogram, name of testing facility, universal warning symbol, and all required warning language. 
 
29 

  Recordkeeping 
 MRA requires mandatory electronic record retention, financial and business record retention, method of retention documentation, and a mandatory backup. Required records include, but are not limited to: books, ledgers, documents, writings, photocopies, correspondence, electronic records, videotapes, surveillance footage, electronic stage media, electronically stored records, money receptacles, equipment in which records are stored, including data or information in the state monitoring system, or any other document that is used for recording information. All licensees’ records must be maintained and made available to the agency upon request. 
 All cannabis products sold or transferred between facilities must have the tracking identification number that is assigned by the statewide monitoring system affixed, tagged, or labelled and recorded. To ensure access to safe sources of cannabis products, the department may recall any cannabis products, issue safety warnings, and require a cannabis facility to provide informational material or notifications. 
 Security 
 Licensees must maintain adequate lighting, physical security, video, backup power and alarm systems at the facility in accordance with applicable law. All inventory of cannabis products must be stored at a cannabis facility in a secured limited access area or restricted access area that requires identification for access. Inventory and access to restricted areas must be tracked consistently with the statewide monitoring system. 
 A provisioning center must store all cannabis products for transfer or sale behind a counter or other barrier separated from stock rooms. A monthly physical inventory reconciliation must be performed. 
 Transportation 
 Secure Transporters are licensed to obtain cannabis from cannabis establishments in order to transport cannabis between establishments. 
 Advertising 
 Generally, licenses cannot engage in advertising that is false or misleading and must not be marketed or advertised to individuals under 21 years of age. Licensees cannot advertise cannabis products where the advertisement is visible to the public from any street, sidewalk, park, or other public place. Cannabis facilities must comply with municipal ordinances, state law, and these rules regulating signs and advertising. 
Washington 
 Brightleaf Development LLC (“Brightleaf”) and Ag-Grow are landlords, packaging and equipment suppliers, and consultants to multiple Washington licensees. The Company does not have an ownership interest in any Washington licensees. 
 
30 

  Legislative History 
 Washington has authorized the cultivation (sometimes referred to as production), possession, processing, wholesaling, retail sale, and transportation of both medical and adult-use cannabis by certain licensed Washington businesses. The original medical marijuana law, passed by voters in 1998, allows physicians to authorize cannabis for an inclusive set of qualifying conditions including chronic pain and created a patient/caregiver system without explicitly permitting businesses. When Initiative 502 legalized marijuana for adults 21 years of age and older in 2012, it regulated adult-use marijuana businesses and left the unregulated medical marijuana establishments in a precarious situation. In 2015, the Governor of Washington signed Senate Bill 5052, which forced the closure of existing unregulated medical dispensaries and allows existing adult-use retail marijuana stores to apply for a “medical marijuana endorsement” to sell medical marijuana tax free to registered qualifying patients and their designated caregivers. The Washington State Liquor and Cannabis Board (“WSLCB”) regulates Washington’s cannabis regulatory program. Brightleaf is advised by legal counsel and/or other advisors in connection with Washington’s cannabis regulatory program. Brightleaf only engages in transactions with Washington cannabis businesses that hold WSLCB licenses and are in compliance with Washington’s cannabis regulatory program. To the extent required by Washington’s cannabis regulatory program, Brightleaf has fully disclosed and/or registered its and/or its subsidiaries relationships with Washington cannabis businesses. Brightleaf and Brightleaf’s subsidiaries, REP, FHD and Ag-Grow and the business licensees contracting with such subsidiaries are in compliance with Washington’s cannabis regulatory program. 
Licenses 
 Every individual with an ownership or equity interest, with a right to receive a percentage of gross or net profits, or who exercises control over a licensed cannabis operator must apply for licensing with the WSLCB and be approved. Each applicant must be over 21 years of age and a Washington resident. Applicants must provide the WSLCB with specified financial information about the applicant and sources of funds and any financiers along with personal and criminal history. Any change in the initial ownership of a cannabis entity must receive prior approval through the WSLCB and undergoes a review of the same rigor and breadth as an initial application. 
Operations 
 An applicant must provide an operational plan that includes a detailed description of all applicable areas of: security; traceability; employee qualifications and training; transportation of product including packaging for transportation; destruction of waste product; description of growing operation including growing media, size of grow space allocated for plant production, space allocated for any other business activity, description of all equipment used in the production process, and a list of soil amendments, fertilizers, other crop production aids, or pesticides, utilized in the production process; description of the types of products to be processed with a complete description of all equipment including all cannabis-infused edible processing facility equipment and solvents, gases, chemicals and other compounds used to create extracts and for processing of cannabis-infused products; testing procedures and protocols; employee compensation and benefits data; description of packaging and labeling of products; and the array of products to be sold and how are the products are to be displayed to consumers. 
 Any significant change in the operational plan (e.g. adding volatiles, processing capabilities, expanding the floorplan of the cannabis business, etc.) of a licensed cannabis entity must receive prior approval through the WSLCB, and undergoes a review of the same rigor and breadth as an initial application. 
 Inspections 
 The WSLCB sends an enforcement officer to inspect each proposed cannabis facility prior to granting approval to be authorized to begin cultivation, processing, or dispensing. Licensed operators must permit WSLCB enforcement officers to inspect the premises, vehicles, records, and cannabis products at any time, and random inspections are conducted frequently by enforcement officers. 
 
31 

  In 2019, after significant debate about inconsistent WSLCB cannabis enforcement, the legislature passed SB5318. It directed the WSLCB to adopt a voluntary compliance education program (VCP) allowing licensees to request on-site enforcement visits designed to identify potential violations and corrective actions without risk of an Administrative Violation Notice AVN. As codified in RCW 69.50.342, it states: The board must adopt rules to perfect and expand existing programs for compliance education for licensed cannabis businesses and their employees. The rules must include a voluntary compliance program created in consultation with licensed cannabis businesses and their employees. Currently, the WSLCB is in the process of developing and refining the VCP rules and forms with stakeholder and enforcement feedback. 
 Security 
 The WSLCB requires all licensed operators, employees, and non-employee visitors other than retail customers to display an identification badge at all times on the premises. Each licensed operator must keep a log of all visitors other than retail customers to the premises. 
 All premises must have a security alarm system on all perimeter entry points and perimeter windows along with a complete video surveillance system that meets specified requirements. 
 Record-keeping/Reporting 
 Washington requires use of a seed-to-sale tracking system. Licensed operators must use an inventory control system that identifies and tracks the plant from the time it reaches a height of eight inches through harvest, processing, packaging, wholesale, and retail sale. Vehicles transporting cannabis must have: (i) a vehicle security system, including separate, secure, locking compartment to store any cannabis product; and (ii) a transportation manifest reported through the seed-to-sale tracking system with specified information. Licensed operators must retain traceability records for three years and make records available upon request for inspection by the WSLCB or other law enforcement. 
 On February 1, 2018, the WSLCB launched the Leaf Data Systems state reporting program. All licensed operators are now required to provide all traceability records to the WSLCB directly through the Leaf Data System or via an Application Programming Interface (API) through a third-party software integrator. 
 Pricing and Prohibited Practices 
 Cannabis products must be sold at a price indicative of true value. Licensed retailers may not sell cannabis products below the wholesale acquisition price of the product. Licensed cannabis producers and processors are prohibited from offering conditional sales, discounts, loans, rebates, free products, or any agreement that causes undue influence over another licensed operator. Licensed producers and processers are allowed to provide licensed retailers certain promotional items of nominal value such as hats, mugs, etc. which can then be handed out only to retail employees. 
Testing 
 The WSLCB requires quality assurance testing for of each lot of final cannabis product be conducted by an independent, state certified, third-party testing laboratory. The quality assurance tests required for cannabis flowers and infused products currently include moisture content, potency analysis, foreign matter inspection, microbiological screening, and residual solvent levels. 
 
32 

  The results of the inspection and testing are submitted to the WSLCB through the traceability system. In conjunction with the Washington State Department of Agriculture, the WSLCB conducts random screening for pesticide residues. All test results are required to be provided to retailers and/or end consumers upon request. 
 Packaging and Labelling 
 Each package containing cannabis or a cannabis product must have affixed a label including required warnings for all cannabis products and for the specific product type. The label must also include identifying information for the producer and retailer of the cannabis product. Each edible cannabis- infused product must be packaged in child-safe packaging and contain under 10 mg of active THC per serving. 
Advertising 
 The WSLCB restricts advertising by licensee cannabis operators. Advertising in any form is prohibited within 1,000 feet of school grounds, playgrounds, recreation centers or facilities, childcare centers, public parks, libraries, or game arcades with unrestricted admission. Advertising is also prohibited on public transit vehicles or transit shelters, and on any publicly owned or operated property. Advertising visible from a public roadway may only contain the name, location, and nature of the business. No advertising may target youth or use objects likely to be appealing to youth. All advertising, including digital advertising, must include required warnings prescribed by regulation. 
California 
 The Company owns Pure Ratios Holdings, Inc., which is indirectly involved in the California licensed cannabis industry because of its occasional engagement of licensed cannabis entities to contract manufacture certain products which contain THC. The Company also owns a subsidiary in California which possesses a local marijuana business permit from the City of Commerce, California, a provisional license from the California Bureau of Cannabis Control, and an annual license from the California Department of Public Health, Manufactured Cannabis Safety Branch, allowing adult-use and medicinal commercial cannabis manufacturing (volatile extraction) and distribution. 
Legislative History 
 In 1996, California voters passed Proposition 215, the Compassionate Use Act allowing physicians to legally recommend medical cannabis for patients who would benefit from cannabis. The Compassionate Use Act legalized the use, possession and cultivation of medical cannabis for a set of qualifying conditions. In September 2015, the California legislature passed three bills, collectively known as the “Medical Cannabis Regulation and Safety Act”. The Medical Cannabis Regulation and Safety Act established a licensing and regulatory framework for the medical cannabis businesses in California. Multiple agencies oversee different aspects of the program and require businesses obtain a state license and local approval to operate. 
 In November 2016, voters in California passed Proposition 64, the Adult Use of Cannabis Act (“AUMA”) creating an adult-use cannabis program for individuals 21 years of age or older. In June 2017, the California State Legislature passed Senate Bill No. 94, known as the Medicinal and Adult-Use Cannabis Regulation and Safety Act (“MAUCRSA”), which combined the Medical Cannabis Regulation and Safety Act and AUMA to provide a set of regulations to govern medical and adult-use licensing regime for cannabis businesses. The three agencies that regulate cannabis at the state level are: (a) the California Department of Food and Agriculture, via CalCannabis, which issues licenses to cannabis cultivators, (b) the California Department of Public Health, via the Manufactured Cannabis Safety Branch, which issues licenses to cannabis manufacturers and (c) the California Department of Consumer Affairs, via the Bureau of Cannabis Control, which issues licenses to cannabis distributors, testing laboratories, retailers, and micro-businesses.

  To legally operate a medical or adult-use cannabis business in California, the operator must have both local approval and a state license. This requires license holders to operate in localities with cannabis licensing and approval programs. Municipalities in California are authorized to determine the number of licenses they will issue to cannabis operators, or can choose to outright ban the cultivation, manufacturing or the retail sale of cannabis. 
 On June 6, 2018, a proposal by the California Department of Consumer Affairs, the California Department of Public Health and the California Department of Food and Agriculture to re-adopt their emergency cannabis regulations went into effect. Among the changes, applicants may now complete one license application, allowing for both medical and adult use cannabis activity. On January 16, 2019, the California Department of Consumer Affairs, the California Department of Public Health and the California Department of Food and Agriculture approved the state regulations for cannabis businesses across the supply chain. These new regulations became effective immediately and superseded the emergency cannabis regulations that California had previously enacted. 
 Local authorization is a prerequisite to obtaining a state license, and local governments are permitted to prohibit or otherwise regulate the types and number of cannabis businesses allowed in their locality. All three state regulatory agencies require confirmation from the applicable locality that the operator is operating in compliance with local requirements and was granted authorization to continue or commence commercial cannabis operations within the locality’s jurisdiction. Applicants are required to comply with all local zoning and land use requirements and provide written authorization from the property owner where the commercial cannabis operations are proposed to take place, which must dictate that the applicant has the property owner’s authorization to engage in the specific state-sanctioned commercial cannabis activities proposed to occur on the premises. The State has not set a limit on the number of state licenses an entity may hold, unlike other states that have restricted how many cannabis licenses an entity may hold in total or for various types of cannabis activity. Although vertical integration across multiple license types is allowed under MAUCRSA, testing laboratory licensees may not hold any other licenses aside from a laboratory license. There are also no residency requirements for ownership of a state license under MAUCRSA. 
 California state licenses, and some local licenses, are renewed annually. Each year, licensees are required to submit a state renewal application to the relevant regulatory authority, and all applicable local renewal applications to the applicable local regulatory body (for local licenses) such as the Department of Cannabis Regulation in the City of Los Angeles. 
 On July 12, 2021, Governor Gavin Newsom signed AB-141 into law, triggering the consolidation of CalCannabis, the MCSB, and the BCC into the newly created Department of Cannabis Control (the “DCC”). The DCC was created in an effort to centralize regulatory authority and facilitate a more easily navigable regulatory regime. All licenses obtained under the previous regulatory authorities automatically transferred to the DCC, which will be responsible for issuing and renewing all cannabis licenses moving forward. In September 2021 the DCC issued emergency regulations, which were approved and went into effect the same month. The emergency regulations, among other things, include revised definitions clarifying who are considered to be owners or holders of a financial stake in cannabis businesses, and provisions allowing for the sale of branded products between businesses. 
 Licenses (Pipeline) 
 There are five principal license categories in California: (1) cultivation, (2) manufacturing, (3) distribution, (4) retailer, and (5) testing. License holders are held to strict license renewal application requirements. 
 Cultivation licenses permit commercial cannabis cultivation activity involving the planting, growing, harvesting, drying, curing, grading or trimming of cannabis. Such licenses further permit the production, labeling and packaging of a limited number of non-manufactured cannabis products and permit the licensee to sell cannabis to certain licensed entities (both medical and adult use licensees) within the State of California for resale or manufacturing purposes. 
 Manufacturing licenses authorize manufacturers to process marijuana biomass into certain value-added products with the use of volatile or non-volatile solvents, depending on the license type. 
 Distribution licenses authorize distributors to obtain cannabis and cannabis products from licensed cultivators and manufacturers and to transport and provide the cannabis and cannabis products to licensed cannabis retailers. 
 Retailer licenses permit the sale of cannabis and cannabis products to both medical patients and adult use customers. Only certified physicians may provide medicinal marijuana recommendations. An adult-use retailer license permits the sale of cannabis and cannabis products to any adult 21 years of age or older. It does not require the individual to possess a physician’s recommendation. Under the terms of such licenses, the holder is permitted to sell adult use cannabis and cannabis products to any person, provided the local jurisdiction permits the sale of adult use cannabis and the person is 21 years of age or older. 
 Testing laboratory licenses authorize laboratories, facilities, or other entities in California to conduct required tests of cannabis and cannabis products from licensed cultivators and manufacturers (e.g., cannabinoids, microbials, residual solvents, residual pesticides, and the like).

  Record-keeping/Reporting 
 California has selected METRC as the T&T system used to track commercial cannabis activity. As of January 2nd, 2020, all California cannabis businesses must be using METRC to track all inventory. 
 Licensees are required to maintain records for at least seven years from the date a record is created. These records include: (a) a cultivation plan, (b) all supporting documentation for data or information input into the T&T system, (c) all unique identifiers (“UID”) assigned to product in inventory and all unassigned UIDs, (d) financial records related to the licensed commercial cannabis activity, including bank statements, tax records, sales invoices and receipts, and records of transport and transfer to other licensed facilities, (e) records related to employee training for the T&T system, and (f) permits, licenses, and other local authorizations to conduct the licensee’s commercial cannabis activity. 
 Inventory/Storage 
 Each licensee is required to assign an account manager to oversee the T&T system. The account manager is fully trained on the system and is accountable to record all commercial cannabis activities accurately and completely. The licensee is expected to correct any data that is entered into the T&T system in error within three (3) business days of discovery of the error. 
 The licensee is required to report information in the T&T system for each transfer of cannabis or non-manufactured cannabis products to, or cannabis or non-manufactured cannabis products received from, other licensed operators. Licensees must use the T&T system for all inventory tracking activities at a licensed premise, including, but not limited to, reconciling all on premise and in-transit cannabis or non-manufactured cannabis product inventories at least once every 14 business days. The licensee must store cannabis and cannabis products in a secure place with locked doors. 
 Security 
 A licensee is required to maintain an alarm system in accordance with specified requirements and ensure a professionally qualified alarm company operator or one of its registered alarm agents installs, maintains, monitors, and responds to the alarm system. The manufacturing and cultivation of cannabis must use a digital video surveillance system that satisfy specified requirements. 
Transportation 
 Transporting cannabis goods between licensees and a licensed facility may only be performed by persons holding a distributor license. The vehicle or trailer used must not contain any markings or features on the exterior which may indicate or identify the contents or purpose. All cannabis products must be locked in a box, container, or cage that is secured to the inside of the vehicle or trailer. When left unattended, vehicles must be locked and secured. At a minimum, the vehicle must be equipped with an alarm system. Motion detectors, pressure switches, duress, panic, and hold-up alarms may also be used.

  COMPLIANCE 
 Under the direction of the Company’s internal compliance team and outside legal counsel, the Company oversees, maintains, and implements a compliance program in conjunction with its operations in each jurisdiction. In addition, the Company has local regulatory/compliance counsel engaged in every jurisdiction (state and local) in which it operates. The Company, together with onsite management in each jurisdiction, is responsible for ensuring operations and that employees strictly comply with applicable laws, regulations, and licensing conditions and ensure that operations do not endanger the health, safety or welfare of the community. The Company designates a duly qualified and experienced manager at each location who is responsible to coordinate with operational units within each facility (to extent applicable) to ensure that the operation and all employees are following and complying with the Company’s written security procedures and all regulatory compliance standards. 
 In conjunction with the Company’s human resources and operations departments, the compliance and quality control departments help oversee and implement training for all employees, including on compliance with state and local laws, compliance with state and local laws, cultivation/manufacturing/dispensing/transport procedures (as applicable), security and safety policies and procedures, inventory control, T&T, seed-to-sale, and point of sale systems training (as applicable); and quality control. 
 The Company’s compliance program emphasizes security and inventory control to ensure strict monitoring of cannabis (including living plants and harvested plant material) and cannabis product inventory. Only authorized, properly trained employees in accordance with local and state regulations are allowed to access the Company’s inventory management systems. 
 The Company and local outside counsel, monitor all compliance notifications from the regulators and inspectors in each market, timely resolving any issues identified. The team maintains records of all compliance notifications received from the state regulators or inspectors and how and when the issue was resolved. The Company has created comprehensive standard operating procedures that include detailed descriptions and instructions for receiving shipments of inventory, inventory tracking, recordkeeping and record retention practices related to inventory, as well as procedures for performing inventory reconciliation and ensuring the accuracy of inventory tracking and recordkeeping. The Company maintains accurate records of its inventory at all licensed facilities. Adherence to the Company’s standard operating procedures is mandatory and ensures that the Company’s operations are compliant with the rules set forth by the applicable state and local laws, regulations, ordinances, licenses and other requirements. Training on these standard operating procedures is mandatory by all employees and defined by function and role. 
 The Company has developed and continues to refine a robust compliance program designed to ensure operational and regulatory requirements continue to be satisfied and has worked closely with experts and outside counsel to develop compliance procedures intended to assist the Company in monitoring compliance with U.S. state law on an ongoing basis. The Company will continue to work closely with outside counsel and other compliance experts to further develop, enhance and improve its compliance and risk management and mitigation processes and procedures in furtherance of continued compliance with the complex regulatory frameworks of the states where the Company operates. The internal compliance program currently in place includes continued monitoring by the Company’s management team, outside counsel, and the Company’s subsidiaries to ensure that all operations conform to and comply with required laws, rules, regulations and standard operating procedures. The Company further requires its operating subsidiaries to report and disclose all instances of non-compliance, regulatory, administrative, or legal proceedings that may be initiated against them to the appropriate point of contact as set forth in the Company’s standard operating procedures. 
 
36 

  Notwithstanding the foregoing, from time to time, as with all businesses and all rules, it is anticipated that the Company, through its subsidiaries and establishments to which the Company provides operational support, may experience incidences of non-compliance with applicable rules and regulations, which may include minor matters such as: 
 

• | improper illumination of external signage;
--+-------------------------------------------


• | missing fields entries in a visitor log;
--+-----------------------------------------


• | total or partial obstruction of camera views;
--+----------------------------------------------


• | supplemental use of onsite surveillance room (i.e., storage);
--+--------------------------------------------------------------


• | minor inventory discrepancies with regulatory reporting software;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------


• | uptime issues regarding regulatory reporting software;
--+-------------------------------------------------------


• | missing fields in regulatory reports;
--+--------------------------------------


• | cleaning schedules not available on display;
--+---------------------------------------------


• | inability to strictly adhere to curbside purchase protocols as written;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | updated staffing plan not immediately available on site; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------


• | marijuana infused product utensils improperly stored.
--+------------------------------------------------------


In addition, either on an inspection basis or in response to complaints, such as from neighbors, customers or former employees, State or local regulators may, among other things, issue investigatory- or demand-type letters, give warnings to or cite businesses which the Company operates or for which the Company provides operational support for violations, including those listed above. Such regulatory actions could lead to a requirement or directive to submit and thereafter comply with (for example) a plan of correction. Depending on the jurisdiction, it is also possible regulators may assess penalties and/or amendments, suspensions or revocations of licenses or otherwise take action that may impact the Company’s licenses, business activities, operational support activities or operations. 
 To address such potential notices of non-compliance, the Company has implemented ongoing compliance reviews to ensure its subsidiaries and establishments to which it provides operational support are operating in conformance with applicable State and local cannabis rules and regulations. In the event non-compliance is discovered, during a compliance review or via internal audit, the Company will promptly remedy the same, including by self-reporting to applicable State and local cannabis regulators as and when required by law and will make all requisite and appropriate public disclosures of non-compliance, citations, notices of violation and the like which may have an impact on its licenses, business activities, operational support activities or operations. 
 
37 

  The Company is in compliance with the laws of each of the states of Illinois, Massachusetts, Michigan, Washington and California and the related cannabis licensing framework. Other than as disclosed in this 10-K, there are no current incidences of non-compliance, citations or notices of violation outstanding which may have an impact on the Company’s licenses, business activities or operations in these states. Notwithstanding the foregoing, like all businesses the Company may from time to time experience incidences of non-compliance with applicable rules and regulations in the states in which the Company operates and such non-compliance may have an impact on the Company’s licenses, business activities or operations in the applicable state. However, the Company takes steps to minimize, disclose and remedy all incidences of non-compliance which may have an impact on the Company’s activities or operations in all states in which the Company operates. 
 Strict compliance with state and local laws with respect to cannabis may neither absolve the Company of liability under U.S. federal law, nor may it provide a defense to any federal proceeding which may be brought against the Company. 
 Industry Overview 
 The legal marijuana industry is comprised of several sub-sectors and is legal under different guidelines in many U.S. states though it remains illegal federally in the U.S. Notwithstanding, the overall sector is generally recognized to be one of the fastest growing in the U.S. Independent projections and publicized reports from sources such as New Frontier Data, expect combined medical and adult-use cannabis revenue of US$35 billion or more in 2025, both as the sector gains in credibility and acceptance, and as more and more states legalize either medical use or adult recreational use; or both. As of the date hereof, 37 states, the District of Columbia, and four U.S. territories have authorized cannabis for medical use. In addition, 18 states, the District of Columbia, and two U.S. territories have authorized cannabis for adult use. 
Product Research and Development 
 Our branded products portfolio includes stock keeping units (“SKUs”) across a range of product categories, including flower, pre-rolls, concentrates, vape, capsules, tinctures, edibles, topicals and other cannabis-related products. Furthermore, we engage in research and development activities focused on developing new extracted or infused cannabis consumer packaged products. 
Customers and Revenue 
 Customers of our consumer packaged goods business include legal state-licensed cannabis dispensaries within each U.S. state in which we operate, as well as national retail channels, including department stores and specialty boutiques. The majority of our branded consumer packaged goods are distributed to unrelated third-party licensed retail cannabis stores. We are not dependent upon a single customer, or a few customers, the loss of any one or more of which would not have a material adverse effect on the business. No customer accounted for 10% or more of our consolidated net revenue during fiscal 2021 or 2020. 
Sales, Marketing and Brand Development 
 The Company employs full-time, in-house marketing, retail, and product development functions. These functions engage in a range of brand-building activities and strategies, including market research, consumer insights research, new brand development, product innovation, copy & content production, design, packaging, retail operations and sales, to support business performance and growth at the local and national levels. 
 
38 

  The Company sells its developed, acquired, and licensed branded products in five states, with plans to significantly increase distribution and expend form factors in 2022. The Company’s portfolio of product brands includes the following: 
 

• | Edibles: Chewee’s, Ka’Kau, KOKO Gemz, Hi-Burst, Left-Handed Brand, Mari’s Mints, Marmas, Pebbles, Verdure
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Wellness and Pain Relief: Pure Ratios (CBD), Verdure
--+-----------------------------------------------------


• | Concentrates: Crystal Clear, Terp Stix, Golden Goo, Evergreen, EZ Vape, Melo Premium Vape
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Flower: Funky Monkey, Private Reserve, Legends, Mini Budz
--+----------------------------------------------------------

Competition 
 The cannabis industry is highly competitive. We compete on quality, price, brand recognition, and distribution strength. Our cannabis products compete with other products for consumer purchases, as well as shelf space in retail dispensaries and wholesaler attention. We compete with thousands of cannabis producing companies from small “mom and pop” operations to multi-billion-dollar market cap multi-state operators. Our principal multi-state operator competitors include but are not limited to Curaleaf Holdings, Inc., Harvest Health & Recreation, Inc., iAnthus Capital Holdings, Inc., Green Thumb Industries Inc. and Cresco Labs Inc. 
Sources and Availability of Production Materials 
 The principal components in the production of our cannabis consumer packaged goods include cannabis grown internally or acquired through wholesale channels, other agricultural products, and packaging materials (including glass, plastic and cardboard). Due to the U.S. federal prohibition on cannabis, we must source cannabis within each individual state in which it operates. While there are opportunities for centralized sourcing of some packaging materials, given each state’s unique regulatory requirements, multi-state operators do not currently have access to nationwide packaging solutions. 
 To produce and dry cannabis flower, the Company utilizes growing medium, nutrients, water, electrical power, soil adjuvants, and certain beneficial pests as part of its integrated pest management efforts. There are many sources for such products (except for water and power, which are provided by the local utility), and prices are reflective of commodity pricing worldwide. Some of these raw material inputs are sourced internationally, so changes in import laws or duties are a potential risk. The prices of power and water are generally stable and set through processes that involve governmental approvals over any increases, but the prices of growing medium, nutrients, etc. are all at least somewhat exposed to underlying commodity price volatility. 
 For our extract products, an additional input is butane or propane for use as a solvent. These gases are largely a commodity, their pricing is reflective of worldwide conditions, and they are supplied to the Company’s operations by local suppliers of industrial gases and materials in the relevant jurisdictions. Prices for such inputs may be volatile, as with any other commodity.

  Our CBD products segment utilizes certain raw materials such as CBD source material, and certain herbs and other Ayurvedic ingredients which are part of Pure Ratios’ formulations. These raw materials are generally commodities and their prices are reflective of worldwide commodity prices and volatility. 
 Seasonality 
 In certain regions, especially on the West Coast, the cannabis industry can be subject to seasonality in some states that allow home grow. Because homegrown plants are typically harvested in the late summer or early fall, there can be some deceleration in retail and wholesale sales trends during these months as these private supplies are consumed.

Implications of Being an Emerging Growth Company 
 We are an “emerging growth company” as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the “JOBS Act”). For as long as we are an emerging growth company, unlike public companies that are not emerging growth companies under the JOBS Act, we will not be required to: 

• | provide an auditor’s attestation report on management’s assessment of the effectiveness of our system of internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the “Sarbanes Oxley Act”);
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | provide more than two years of audited financial statements and related management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | comply with any new requirements adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (the “PCAOB”) requiring mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor’s report in which the auditor would be required to provide additional information about the audit and the financial statements of the issuer;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | provide certain disclosure regarding executive compensation required of larger public companies or hold stockholder advisory votes on the executive compensation required by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the “Dodd-Frank Act”); or
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | obtain stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


We will cease to be an emerging growth company upon the earliest of the: 
 

• | last day of the fiscal year in which we have $1.07 billion or more in total annual gross revenues;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | date on which we become a “large accelerated filer” (the fiscal year-end on which the total market value of our common equity securities held by non-affiliates is $700,000 or more as of June 30);
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | date on which we issue more than $1.0 billion of non-convertible debt over a three-year period; or
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | last day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of our initial public offering.

  We have elected to take advantage of certain of the reduced disclosure obligations in this report, and may elect to take advantage of other reduced reporting requirements in future filings. As a result, the information that we provide to our stockholders may be different than you might receive from other public reporting companies in which you hold equity interests. 
 In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an “emerging growth company” can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an “emerging growth company” can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies.
