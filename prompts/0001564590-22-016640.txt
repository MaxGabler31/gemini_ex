ITEM 1. | BUSINESS.
--------+----------

Overview
 We are a global contemporary group, consisting of three brands: Vince, Rebecca Taylor, and Parker. We serve our customers through wholesale and direct-to-consumer channels that reinforce our brand images.
 We have a select number of wholesale partners who account for a significant portion of our net sales. In fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020, sales to one wholesale partner, Nordstrom Inc., accounted for more than ten percent of the Company’s net sales. These sales represented 20% of fiscal 2021 and 21% of fiscal 2020 net sales, respectively. 
 We design our products in the U.S. and source the vast majority of our products from contract manufacturers outside the U.S., primarily in Asia.
 The Company operates on a fiscal calendar widely used by the retail industry that results in a given fiscal year consisting of a 52 or 53-week period ending on the Saturday closest to January 31.

 Our principal executive office is located at 500 5th Avenue, 20th Floor, New York, New York 10110, and our telephone number is (212) 944-2600. Our corporate website address is www.vince.com.
 COVID-19
 The spread of COVID-19, which was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization in March 2020, remains highly volatile, particularly in light of ongoing vaccination efforts and emerging strains of the virus. In response, we implemented various measures to effectively manage our business as well as the impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic, including (i) serving our customers through our online e-commerce websites during the periods in which we were forced to shut down retail locations or operate with reduced shopping hours, alongside other retailers, including our wholesale partners, in accordance with state and local regulations related to the COVID-19 pandemic; (ii) engaging with our lenders to provide additional liquidity and increased operational flexibility; (iii) temporarily reducing retained employee salaries and suspending board retainer fees; (iv) engaging with our landlords to address the current operating environment, including amending existing lease terms; and (v) streamlining our expense structure and carefully managing operational initiatives to align with the business environment and sales opportunities.
 The unpredictable nature of the COVID-19 pandemic could negatively affect the outcome of the measures intended to address its impact and/or our current expectations of our future business performance. See Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors — “Risks Related to Our Business and Industry — The COVID-19 pandemic has adversely affected, and may continue to adversely affect, our business, financial condition, cash flow, liquidity and results of operations” for additional discussion regarding risks to our business associated with the COVID-19 pandemic.
 Our Brands 
 Vince
 Vince, established in 2002, is a leading global luxury apparel and accessories brand best known for creating elevated yet understated pieces for every day effortless style. Known for its range of luxury products, Vince offers women’s and men’s ready-to-wear, footwear and accessories through 50 full-price retail stores, 18 outlet stores, its e-commerce site, vince.com, and through its subscription service Vince Unfold, vinceunfold.com, as well as through premium wholesale channels globally.
 Our wholesale business is comprised of sales to major department stores and specialty stores in the U.S. and in select international markets. We have distribution arrangements with a small number of wholesale partners for non-licensed product which has improved profitability in the wholesale business and enables us to focus on other areas of growth for the brand, particularly in the direct-to-consumer business. We continue to collaborate with our wholesale partners in various areas, including merchandising and logistics to build a more profitable and focused wholesale business.
 Our wholesale business also includes our licensing business related to our licensing arrangement for our women’s and men’s footwear. The licensed products are sold in our own stores and by our licensee to select wholesale partners. We earn a royalty based on net sales to the wholesale partners.

Parker
 Parker, founded in 2008 in New York City, is a contemporary women’s fashion brand that is trend focused. While we continue to believe that the Parker brand complements our portfolio, during the first half of fiscal 2020 the Company decided to pause the creation of new products to focus resources on the operations of the Vince and Rebecca Taylor brands. 
 The Parker collection was previously available through major department stores and specialty stores worldwide as well as through its e-commerce website.
 Business Segments
 We serve our customers through a variety of channels that reinforce our brand images. Our diversified channel strategy allows us to introduce our products to customers through multiple distribution points that are presented in three reportable segments: Vince Wholesale, Vince Direct-to-consumer, and Rebecca Taylor and Parker.

 Unallocated corporate expenses are related to the Vince brand and are comprised of selling, general and administrative expenses attributable to corporate and administrative activities (such as marketing, design, finance, information technology, legal and human resource departments), and other charges that are not directly attributable to the Company’s Vince Wholesale and Vince Direct-to-consumer reportable segments.
 Products
 We believe that our differentiated design aesthetic and strong attention to detail and fit allow us to maintain premium pricing, and that the combination of quality and value positions us as everyday luxury brands that encourage repeat purchases among our customers. We also believe that we can expand our product assortments and distribute these expanded product assortments through our branded retail locations and our branded e-commerce platforms, as well as through our premier wholesale partners in the U.S. and select international markets.
 The Vince women’s collection includes seasonal collections of luxurious cashmere sweaters and silk blouses, leather and suede leggings and jackets, dresses, skirts, denim, pants, t-shirts, footwear, outerwear, and accessories. The Vince men’s collection includes t-shirts, knit and woven tops, sweaters, denim, pants, blazers, footwear, and outerwear. 
 The Rebecca Taylor collection includes seasonal collections of occasion-forward dresses, suiting, silk blouses, leather and tweed jackets, outerwear, jumpsuits, cotton dresses and blouses, denim, sweaters, pants, skirts and knit and woven tops. The Rebecca Taylor collections are grounded in artful prints, dimensional textures, and feminine silhouettes.
 The Parker collection, prior to the pause in the creation of new products as discussed above, previously included seasonal collections of occasion-forward dresses, cotton dresses, jumpsuits, silk blouses, knit and woven tops, leather jackets, sweaters, pants, and skirts.
 We continue to evaluate other brand extension opportunities through both in-house development activities as well as through potential partnerships or licensing arrangements with third parties.
 Design and Merchandising
 Our creative teams are focused on developing and implementing the design direction for the Vince and Rebecca Taylor brands. We have dedicated design and merchandising teams for our brands in an effort to ensure that we focus on the unique positioning of each brand. Our design efforts are supported by well-established product development and production teams. We believe continued collaboration between design and merchandising will ensure we respond to consumer preferences and market trends with new innovative product offerings while maintaining our core fashion foundation.
Marketing, Advertising and Public Relations
 We use marketing, advertising and public relations as critical tools to deliver a consistent and compelling brand message to consumers. The message and marketing strategies of our brands are cultivated by dedicated creative, design, marketing, visual merchandising, and public relations teams. These teams work closely together to develop and execute campaigns that appeal to both our core and aspirational customers.
 To execute our marketing strategies, we engage in a wide range of campaign tactics that include traditional media (such as direct mail, print advertising, cooperative advertising with wholesale partners and outdoor advertising), digital media (such as email, search social, and display) and experiential campaigns (such as events) to drive traffic, brand awareness, conversion and ultimately sales across all channels. Our marketing strategies also include the implementation of a customer data platform from which we will be able to achieve improved segmentation and personalization for an enhanced customer experience. In addition, we use social platforms such as Instagram and Facebook as we further invest in leveraging micro and macro influencer networks to increase brand awareness, engage customers and create excitement about loyalty towards our brands. The visits to vince.com and rebeccataylor.com also provide an opportunity to grow our customer base and communicate directly with our customers.
 See Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors — “Risks Related to Our Business and Industry — We may be unable to effectively execute our customer strategy.”
 Our public relations team conducts a wide variety of press activities to reinforce our brand images and create excitement around the brands. Our apparel has appeared in the pages of major fashion magazines such as Vogue, Harper’s Bazaar, Elle, InStyle, GQ, Esquire and WSJ. Well-known trend setters in entertainment and fashion are also regularly seen wearing our brands.

Sourcing and Manufacturing
 We do not own or operate any manufacturing facilities. We contract for the purchase of finished goods with manufacturers who are responsible for the entire manufacturing process, including the purchase of piece goods and trim. Although we do not have long-term written contracts with manufacturers, we have long-standing relationships with a diverse base of vendors which we believe to be mutually satisfactory. We work with more than 40 manufacturers across 10 countries, with 85% of our products produced in China in fiscal 2021. For cost and control purposes, we contract with select third-party vendors in the U.S. to produce a small portion of our merchandise. 
 All of our garments are produced according to our specifications, and we require that all of our manufacturers adhere to strict regulatory compliance and standards of conduct. Our vendors’ factories are monitored by our production team to ensure quality control, and they are monitored by independent third-party inspectors we employ for compliance with local manufacturing standards and regulations on an annual basis. We also monitor our vendors’ manufacturing facilities regularly, providing technical assistance and performing in-line and final audits to ensure the highest possible quality.
 Distribution Facilities
 As of January 29, 2022, we operated out of six distribution centers, two located in the U.S., two in Hong Kong, one in the United Kingdom and one in Belgium. 
 Our two warehouses in the U.S., located in California, are operated by third-party logistics providers and include dedicated space to fulfilling orders to support our wholesale partners, retail locations and e-commerce business and utilize warehouse management systems that are fully customer and vendor compliant. 
 Our two warehouses in Hong Kong are operated by third-party logistics providers and support our wholesale orders for international customers located primarily in Asia. 
 Our warehouse in the United Kingdom is operated by a third-party logistics provider and supports our Rebecca Taylor wholesale orders for international customers located primarily in Europe.
 Our warehouse in Belgium is operated by a third-party logistics provider and supports our Vince wholesale orders for international customers located primarily in Europe and our Vince UK store.
 We believe we have sufficient capacity in our domestic and international distribution facilities to support our current and projected business.
 Information Systems
 During fiscal 2020 we completed the migration of the Rebecca Taylor and Parker brands to Vince’s enterprise resources planning (“ERP”) system. During fiscal 2021, we completed the rollout of a new point of sale (“POS”) system for the Vince brand to expand our omni-channel capabilities to promote direct-to-consumer growth and enhance customer engagement and shopping experience. Our continued strategy includes investing in customer facing technologies to further expand our omni-channel capabilities and to further consolidate systems across our brands over time to create operational efficiencies and to achieve a common platform across the Company. This continued strategy includes the implementation of a customer data platform, the front-end re-platforming of our e-commerce websites and continuing the rollout of the POS system to the Rebecca Taylor brand, among other items.
 See Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors — “Risks Related to Our Information Technology and Security — We are continuing to adopt, optimize and improve our information technology systems, processes and functions. If these systems, processes, and functions do not operate successfully, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially harmed” and Part II, Item 9A. “Controls and Procedures.” 
 Seasonality
 The apparel and fashion industry in which we operate is cyclical and, consequently, our revenues are affected by general economic conditions and the seasonal trends characteristic to the apparel and fashion industry. Purchases of apparel are sensitive to a number of factors that influence the level of consumer spending, including economic conditions and the level of disposable consumer income, consumer debt, interest rates and consumer confidence as well as the impact of adverse weather conditions. In addition, fluctuations in the amount of sales in any fiscal quarter are affected by the timing of seasonal wholesale shipments and other events affecting direct-to-consumer sales. As such, the financial results for any particular quarter may not be indicative of results for the fiscal year. We expect such seasonality to continue.

Competition
 We face strong competition in each of the product categories and markets in which we compete on the basis of style, quality, price, and brand recognition. Some of our competitors have achieved significant recognition for their brand names or have substantially greater financial, marketing, distribution and other resources compared to us. However, we believe that we have established a sustainable and distinct position in the current marketplace, driven by a product assortment that combines classic and fashion-forward styling, and a pricing strategy that offers customers accessible luxury. 
Human Capital
 As of January 29, 2022, we had 697 employees, of which 424 were employed in our company-operated retail stores. Except for nine employees in France, who are covered by collective bargaining agreements pursuant to French law, none of our employees are currently covered by a collective bargaining agreement and we believe our employee relations are good.
 Our key human capital measures include associate turnover, pay equity, professional development as well as safety, particularly in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. We have programs in place to provide associates with feedback on performance and professional development, including our formal annual performance review process. We frequently benchmark our compensation and benefits practices against comparable peers and assess them, so we continue to attract and retain talent throughout our organization.
 We strive to maintain an inclusive environment free from discrimination of any kind. Associates have multiple ways to report inappropriate behavior, including through a confidential hotline. All reports of inappropriate behavior are promptly investigated with appropriate action taken to stop such behavior.
 Trademarks and Licensing
 We own the Vince, Rebecca Taylor and Parker trademarks for the production, marketing, and distribution of our products in the U.S. and internationally. We have registered the trademarks domestically and have registrations on file or pending in a number of foreign jurisdictions. We intend to continue to strategically register, both domestically and internationally, trademarks that we use today and those we develop in the future. We license the domain name for our website, vince.com, pursuant to a license agreement. Under this license agreement, we have an exclusive, irrevocable license to use the vince.com domain name without restriction at a nominal annual cost. While we may terminate such license agreement at our discretion, the agreement does not provide for termination by the licensor. We also own unregistered copyright rights in our design marks.
