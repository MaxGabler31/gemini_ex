Overview
We are a pleasure and leisure company. We provide consumers around the world with products, content and experiences that help them lead happier, healthier and more fulfilling lives. Our flagship consumer brand, Playboy, is one of the most recognizable brands in the world, driving billions of dollars annually in global consumer spending with products and content available in approximately 180 countries.
Our mission — to create a culture where all people can pursue pleasure — builds upon almost seven decades of creating groundbreaking media and hospitality experiences and fighting for cultural progress rooted in the core values of equality, freedom of expression and the idea that pleasure is a fundamental human right.
Driven by our cause of “Pleasure for All,” our goal is to build the leading pleasure and leisure lifestyle platform for all people around the world.
For the fiscal years ended December 31, 2020 and 2021, our consolidated revenue was $147.7 million and $246.6 million, respectively, consolidated net loss was $5.3 million and $77.7 million, respectively.
Our Products
Our products and content connect consumers to a lifestyle of pleasure and leisure. Our offerings help consumers around the world look good, feel good, and enjoy their lives. Our offerings are focused on areas where nearly 70 years of building consumer trust give us a unique position to lead:
•Sexual Wellness is a category that encompasses products, content and experiences that enable a state of physical, emotional, mental, and social sexual health and fulfillment. Offerings include products that enhance sexual experience, lingerie, bedroom accessories and intimacy products, as well as offerings that improve sexual health. Our offerings today—including lingerie, intimates and adult content—comprise the Company’s largest driver of revenue.
•Style and Apparel includes a variety of apparel and accessories products for men and women globally, including one of the leading men’s apparel brands in China, and collaborations with fashion and streetwear brands such as Missguided, PacSun, and Supreme available to consumers in the US and UK. Our style and apparel offerings build on seven decades of standing for free expression and today represent the second-largest consumer category in our business.
•Gaming and Lifestyle is a category that encompasses all the ways we stand for sophisticated, fun and leisure-filled living. Our gaming offerings today include digital casino and social games in partnership with such industry leaders as Scientific Games and Microgaming, and other home and hospitality offerings. These offerings are primarily delivered by our strategic licensing partners, and some products are offered for resale on Playboy.com.
•Beauty and Grooming builds on our long role serving as a platform for beauty and the brand’s commercial success in the fragrance category. Today, we approach this category through the lens of confidence, providing our consumers with products and content that inspire body positivity and creative expression. With strong adjacency to Sexual Wellness, Beauty and Grooming offerings include men's and women’s skincare, haircare, bath and body, grooming, cosmetics and fragrance. These offerings are primarily delivered by our strategic licensing partners, and some products are offered for resale on Playboy.com.
Each of the foregoing categories represent very large and growing markets, providing us with significant opportunities for growth from the increased sales of our current products, as well as through the introduction of new products within these categories.
Our Business Segments
We generate revenue through the sales of our products to consumers around the world. We employ multiple business models, including brand licensing, direct-to-consumer and third-party retail sales, and digital sales and subscriptions, to help maximize the value of our assets and promote long-term revenue and profitability growth. We report on our business operations in three segments:
•Licensing, including licensing our brand to third parties for products, services, venues and events.
•Direct-to-Consumer, including sales of third-party products through our owned-and-operated e-commerce platforms; and sales of our proprietary products through our platforms and/or third-party retailers; and
•Digital Subscriptions and Content, including revenues generated from the sales of creator offerings to consumers on centerfold.com, our creator-led platform launched in December 2021, trademark licensing for online gaming products, the sale of subscriptions to Playboy programming and the sales of tokenized digital art and collectibles.
Licensing
We license the Playboy name, Rabbit Head Design, and other trademarks and related properties to partners around the world. Our licensing agreements permit licensees the right to use certain Playboy trademarks for certain categories of products in certain territories for a fee, which is typically a royalty calculated as a percentage of net revenue from wholesale and/or retail sales of such products, subject to an annual, bi-annual or quarterly minimum royalty payment. Our top five license agreements range from three to nine years in length and generated approximately $49.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. As of December 31, 2021, our licensing contracts included future royalty guarantee payments of approximately $325 million through 2031, assuming no renewals of such contracts.
Our partner CAA-GBG LLP, an agency with significant global reach and infrastructure, acts as our exclusive licensing agent for the Playboy brand trademarks and intellectual property for consumer products in a broad range of categories in most of the world.
During the year ended December 31, 2021, our Licensing segment contributed $64.0 million in revenue and $47.5 million in operating income.
Direct-to-Consumer
Our owned digital commerce retail platforms include Playboy.com, HoneyBirdette.com and Honey Birdette retail stores (as of August 9, 2021), Yandy.com, and LoversStores.com and Lovers retail stores (as of March 1, 2021). We manage the inventory and shipping for our owned digital and retail commerce channels through a combination of our own warehouse and fulfillment centers and through third-party logistics centers, providing a flexible and scalable base from which to continue the expansion of our direct-to-consumer sales platform model. In addition to our owned channels, we have actively expanded the third-party sales of our proprietary products across major retailers in Western markets.
During the year ended December 31, 2021, our Direct-to-Consumer segment contributed $147.8 million in revenue and $2.8 million in operating loss.
Digital Subscriptions and Content
Our Digital Subscriptions and Content today comprise centerfold.com, our creator-led platform launched in December 2021, non-fungible token (“NFTs”) art and collectibles offerings, and Playboy’s adult content offerings, including playboyplus.com and playboy.tv.
Playboy-branded digital content offerings reach more than 150,000 subscribers and users across Playboy-managed digital platforms. In addition, The Playboy Channel is offered through leading MSOs (multiple-system operators) around the globe, including AT&T, Cablevision, Charter, Comcast, Cox, DirecTV, Dish, Time Warner and Verizon. Pursuant to its agreements with the MSOs, Playboy programs the Playboy Channel and typically receives a royalty based on the numbers of subscribers to the Channel.
During the year ended December 31, 2021, our Digital Subscriptions and Content segment contributed $33.8 million in revenue and $7.9 million of operating income.
Our Strategy
We aim to build the leading pleasure and leisure lifestyle platform for all people around the world. Our commercial strategy is to capture high consumer lifetime value while maintaining low consumer acquisition costs. We do this by building direct relationships with our customers through our owned-and-operated digital commerce and digital offerings and by utilizing our significant organic reach for marketing efficiency. 
We are focused on three key growth pillars: first, accelerating our direct-to-consumer commerce business, where we target an 18-34-year-old consumer base with Sexual Wellness and Apparel offerings. Second, strategically expanding our licensing business in key categories and territories with a focus on China, India and gaming. In addition, we use our licensing business as a marketing tool and brand builder for us, in particular through our high-end designer collaborations and our large-scale partnerships with partners such as PacSun. Third, investing in new emerging growth opportunities, with a focus on scalable digital products and services, that deliver recurring or long tail revenue and allow us to generate significant returns over a three-to-five-year time horizon.
centerfold.com, our new creator-led platform dedicated to creative freedom, artistic expression and sex positivity, is the cornerstone of our digital strategy in 2022. Creators can set up their own subscription or membership services, directly message with their fans and interact with consumers in other ways. As we expand, we plan to offer creators services that only Playboy can, including the ability to tap into our merchandise design, production and distribution capabilities, artist collaborations, merchandise collaborations with Playboy and Honey Birdette, and access NFTs and blockchain tools. 
Lastly, building on our acquisitions of Yandy in December 2019, TLA Acquisition Corp., the owner of the Lovers brand, in March 2021, Honey Birdette (Aust) Pty Limited, owner of the luxury lingerie brand Honey Birdette, in August 2021, and GlowUp Digital Inc., owner of the Dream web platform which has become our centerfold.com content-creator platform, in October 2021, we will continue to identify and assess potentially advantageous merger, acquisition and investment opportunities. Utilizing the flexibility of our operating cash flow, and management expertise, we may pursue additional acquisitions or other strategic opportunities to complement and accelerate our organic growth.
Our Competition
We operate in the consumer goods space across a variety of different industries and face competition from broad direct-to-consumer platforms such as Amazon, as well as brands and retailers that are more targeted to particular markets. In the men’s apparel space in China, we compete with other leading men’s apparel brands such as Uniqlo, Semir, Levi’s, Nautica and Lacoste on the breadth and quality of our products, and in Western markets, our apparel collaborations and owned and operated e-commerce business compete with retailers and brands more focused on lingerie, costumes, accessories and streetwear. In the sexual wellness industry, we compete with lingerie brands and e-commerce businesses such as La Perla, Fleur du Mal, Victoria’s Secret and AdoreMe, and other suppliers of products in this fragmented and rapidly growing space, as well as with Sexual Wellness e-commerce platforms and brick and mortar retail chains, such as Lovehoney, Fashion Nova and Adam & Eve. Our digital products and services compete with social content and creator-led platforms and providers of digital art, collectibles and paid and free adult content, and our digital games compete with other real-money and social casino-style games available in the iOS and Android app stores. We compete with much larger companies, including the brands referenced above, that have significantly greater financial and operational resources and pose meaningful competitive challenges. However, we believe we have successfully competed, and will continue to do so, with such companies because of our strong brands with extensive consumer followings, high quality products and relationships with creators and influencers that we have developed.
Our Corporate History
Playboy was founded in 1953 as a men’s lifestyle magazine. Over the following decades, Playboy grew into a leader and pioneer in the entertainment, hospitality, and licensing businesses.
From 1973 to 2011, Playboy's stock was publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange. Playboy’s current corporate entity, Playboy Enterprises, Inc., was incorporated in the State of Delaware in April 1998. On March 4, 2011, Icon Merger Sub, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Icon Acquisition Holdings, L.P. (“Icon”), an affiliate of Rizvi Traverse Management, LLC, successfully completed its offer to purchase all of the issued and outstanding shares of Playboy, which was further reorganized effective August 14, 2018. As part of the restructuring, Icon was dissolved and liquidated its equity interest in Playboy to its members, consisting of RT-ICON Holdings LLC (with its affiliates, "RT") and the Hugh M. Hefner 1991 Trust (the “Trust”), resulting in RT holding 3,034,192 shares of common stock in Playboy and the Trust holding 1,868,910 shares of common stock in Playboy. The Trust then sold to Playboy, and Playboy redeemed, all of the common stock in Playboy held by the Trust for a total of $35 million. 
On February 10, 2021, we consummated the transactions contemplated by that certain Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of September 30, 2020 (the “Merger Agreement”), by and among Mountain Crest Acquisition Corp (“MCAC”), MCAC Merger Sub Inc. (“Merger Sub”), and Playboy, and Suying Liu. Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, Playboy merged with and into Merger Sub, with Playboy surviving the merger as a wholly-owned subsidiary of MCAC, and MCAC changed its name to “PLBY Group, Inc.” upon consummation of the Business Combination.
Over the past several years, we have undertaken a process of transforming and streamlining our business model to transition Playboy’s primary business from a print and digital media entity, generating advertising and sponsorship revenues, to our primarily commerce business which markets consumer products and digital content. As part of that transformation, revenue generation has shifted away from being driven largely through third parties and toward direct-to-consumer sales.
These transformational changes include: reorganizing and streamlining our Playboy TV operation by reducing headcount, content costs and marketing spend, and renegotiating certain agreements with service providers; reorganizing and streamlining our digital subscription business by reducing headcount and content spend, and outsourcing certain functions that can be more efficiently performed by third parties; eliminating our advertising sales force; and consolidating our marketing, website development and creative services into a single group within our commerce-focused division, allowing us to reduce headcount and capture scale economies. We also ceased publication of our legacy Playboy magazine after the Spring 2020 issue, allowing us to reduce staff and eliminate costs associated with the print publication, such as printing, shipping, newsstand distribution and customer list management, and concurrently shifted our Playboy.com website from a content and media centric site to a largely e-commerce site in support of our direct-to-consumer business.
With these changes, we are able to better focus our workforce, capital and other resources on the products, consumer categories and revenue models that we believe best position us for growth and success in the future.
In December 2019, we acquired the assets of Yandy.com, a leading online retailer of lingerie, dresses, costumes and accessories, as part of the expansion of our proprietary sales platform. In March 2021, we acquired TLA Acquisition Corp., the parent company of the Lovers family of stores (“Lovers”), a leading omni-channel online and brick-and-mortar sexual wellness chain, with 40 stores in five states. In August 2021, we acquired Honey Birdette (Aust) Pty Limited, owner of the luxury lingerie brand Honey Birdette (“Honey Birdette”), with 58 stores across three continents (59 stores as of December 31, 2021). In October 2021, we acquired GlowUp Digital Inc., owner of the Dream platform that was redeveloped as the technology foundation for our curated and creator-led site, centerfold.com, which launched in December 2021.
Our Team
We seek to recruit, retain, and incentivize highly talented existing and future employees. We believe that creating a respectful and inclusive environment where team members can be themselves and be supported is critical to attracting, developing and retaining talent. A set of fundamental values guide our thinking and actions both inside the company and as we pursue our mission through our interaction with our consumers and our partners around the world. We created these values with the goal of holding ourselves accountable, of preserving what is special, and to inspire and guide ourselves moving forward as we grow and take on new challenges. We believe staying true to these values will drive the long-term value we create in consumers’ lives.
Our Employees
As of December 31, 2021, we had 781 full-time and full-time-equivalent employees and 232 part-time employees. None of the employees are represented by a labor union. Our team values support our employee relations, which we believe to be positive and productive. We promote the well-being of our employees through programs and benefits that support physical health, financial security and good morale. 
Our Values
Do You (But Do No Harm). We’re authentic to who we are. We say what we mean, and we mean what we say. We create a safe and encouraging environment for others to do the same, bringing their authentic selves forward. We welcome and value varying perspectives and opinions, and we assume best intentions. We celebrate and bring out the best in each other. We pay attention to others discomfort. We respect boundaries. And we fiercely believe that our diversity positions us for greater success and impact in the world.
Embrace the Next Challenge. We have a growth mindset. We don’t let ourselves get too comfortable. We are constantly questioning our existing knowledge and recognize that our blind spots are bigger than we think. We actively seek out opportunities to learn. We come from a place of curiosity. The next challenge may be in a place we’ve never thought to look, and we leverage a vast diversity of perspectives to find it. We know we can always do better, and good enough is not enough. We believe in questioning taboos. We are bold and thoughtful in challenging the status quo and finding fault in the default, even when it seems we are alone. We are okay with uncertainty, and we aim to adapt quickly and be resourceful in an ever-changing environment.
Debate, Then Commit. We take the time to make sure we are informed. We provide a platform and make space for the different voices in the room, ask thoughtful questions, and consider all angles before coming to a conclusion. We question everything. We engage in self-reflection, and we recognize and share openly when we are wrong. We are solutions oriented. We take an active approach to solving problems and coming to decisions rather than fixating on them. We passionately discuss ideas but respect when a decision is reached and abide by the process to execute it. We communicate decisions thoroughly and thoughtfully.
Be a Leader. We develop and exercise inclusive leadership. So, everyone knows they belong, and equitable treatment is our standard. We recognize that trust, respect, and responsibility go hand-in-hand and must be heard. With that, it is up to each of us to earn that responsibility every day. We listen first, ask questions, speak up and are accountable for our work (and our mistakes). We help others feel confident and comfortable doing the same. We take initiative. We don’t wait for things to happen to us or wait to be told. We are willing to wear many hats and roll our sleeves up when others need help, even if it means working outside our job description. We lead by example.
Stay Playful. We are a fun team and though we often deal with heavy subject matter, we recognize the importance of a playful spirit and a positive outlook. We realize that we are a work in progress, and that we won’t always get it right the first time. We pride ourselves in being able to pick ourselves up, be positive about our mistakes (while learning from them) and move forward. We celebrate creativity and the importance of trying new things out. We know you to have a good time and we understand boundaries. We celebrate each other. We value our time both in and out of work.
