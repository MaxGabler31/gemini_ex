Overview
 
Momentous is a modern craft beverage company, founded in 2015, that is based in London, United Kingdom. We design, produce, market and sell handcrafted, award-winning alcohol beverage products with a portfolio consisting of gin, vodka, bitter aperitif and ready-to-drink cocktails (“RTD”).
 
Our strategy is to produce premium products with minimal impact to the environment through the use of modern technology during production. Our methods help us to conserve energy and reduce water waste whilst delivering what we believe is a superior product. We also focus on environmentally friendly and recyclable packaging to reduce our carbon footprint. We are also looking to employ carbon offsetting in order to meet our carbon neutral status target by the end of 2020.
 
We are developing a portable micro distillery concept to enable us to have multiple distilleries in other international markets in order to reduce our carbon footprint and also mitigate potential international trade disputes that may affect our business. The United Kingdom’s (“UK”) planned departure from the European Union (“EU”) (commonly referred to as “Brexit”) along with potential tariffs between United States and the EU and UK could potentially be circumvented through production and sales within each respective territory.
 
To date, our sales strategy has focused on London and the United Kingdom market, leveraging our management expertise and knowledge of the market. Our sales strategy is focused on premium bars and restaurants in London particularly where Millennials frequent. According to the 2017-2018 BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research Survey, Millennials are shifting their alcohol consumption habits away from beer and wine to spirits. The survey stated that 41% of Millennials now prefer liquor and other spirits as their alcoholic beverage of choice, an increase from the year-earlier period when the figure was 36%. In addition, in 2018 according to the Distilled Spirits Council of the United States (DISCUS), sales rose for the eighth consecutive year, driven by Millennials' taste for high-end and super premium spirits.

Corporate History
 
We were incorporated as Momentous Holdings Corp. on May 29, 2015 in the State of Nevada for the purpose of designing, acquiring and developing mobile apps and mobile software for download by end consumers.
 
On December 31, 2018, the Company entered into a Share Exchange Agreement with Andrew Eddy (“Owner”), an individual residing in Great Britain and owner of 100% of the issued and outstanding capital shares of V Beverages Limited (“V Beverages”), a company organized under the laws of the United Kingdom (the “Share Exchange Agreement”). V Beverages in turn owns 100% of the issued and outstanding capital shares of MaxChater Ltd. (“MaxChater”), a company organized under the laws of the United Kingdom, which it acquired on August 1, 2018.
 
Pursuant to the Share Exchange Agreement, the Company acquired 100% of the issued and outstanding capital shares of V Beverages (the “Target Shares”). Upon the closing of the transactions under the Share Exchange Agreement, the Owner transferred the Target Shares to the Company in exchange for 15,750,000 shares of the Company’s common stock, par value $0.001.
 
Following the acquisition of V Beverages, we ceased operations of developing mobile apps, the original business of the Company.
 
The transaction has been accounted for as a reverse merger, whereby V Beverages is considered to be the accounting acquirer and became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. In accordance with the accounting treatment for a “reverse merger” or a “reverse acquisition,” the Company’s historical financial statements prior to the reverse merger were and will be replaced with the historical financial statements of V Beverages prior to the reverse merger and in all future filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”).

Market Opportunity 
 
Large and Growing Global and Domestic Markets 
 
According to the Marketline Global Spirits Report 2018 - The global spirits market had total revenues of $677.4bn in 2017, representing a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 4.0% between 2013 and 2017.
 
The United Kingdom spirits market has shown continued growth with a record 51 million bottles of gin worth almost $1.85 billion sold in 2017, an increase of 27% in volume (the equivalent of over 9.5 million bottles) compared to 2016.
 
The 2017 IWSR report predicts that gin demand in the UK will grow by 37.2% by 2021.
 
According to Distillery Spirits Council of the United States (“DISCUS”), the U.S. spirits market had total revenues of $26.2 billion in 2017, representing more than a 32% increase since 2010. The domestic market share of spirits compared to beer and wine was at a record 36.6% in 2017, representing more than a 3% gain over beer and wine in terms of market share since 2010.
 
The market share of “craft” distillers (defined as any producer that bottles less than 100,000 cases annually) has doubled over the last two years, and is projected to reach 8% by 2020.
 
Key Growth Trends that We Target 
 
Millennials – Are generally defined as individuals born between the early 1980s and the mid 1990s. According to BeverageDaily.com, Millennials value authenticity and experiences and are inspired by travel and like to try new products. Millennials tend to mistrust most advertising, but do pay attention to online marketing, blog recommendation, in-store tastings and food and drink festivals. Millennials tend to drink a broader range of spirit types (vodka, gin, rum, tequila, whiskey) than prior generations, and Millennials consume more expensive spirits than their predecessors. These individuals are often attracted to vintage spirits and cocktails with nostalgic followings, such as the Negroni cocktail.
 
According to the 2017-2018 BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research Survey, Millennials are shifting their alcohol consumption habits away from beer and wine to spirits. The survey stated that 41% of Millennials now prefer liquor and other spirits as their alcoholic beverage of choice, an increase from the year-earlier period when the figure was 36%. In addition, in 2018 according to DISCUS, sales rose for the eighth consecutive year, driven by Millennials' taste for high-end and super premium spirits.
 
Craft – The market share of “craft” distillers (defined as any producer that bottles less than 100,000 cases annually) has more than doubled over the last five years, and is projected to reach 8% by 2020, according to the American Distilling Institute. According to Grand View Research, the global craft spirits market is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 33.4% from 2017 to 2025, owing to growing consumer tastes and preferences towards unconventional and experimental alcoholic beverages.
 
High-End and Super-Premium – The high-end and super-premium spirit products, across most categories, continue to exhibit strong growth trends, up approximately 7% in 2017.

Our Strategy and Its Implementation 
 
Our objective is to build Momentous into a robust, competitive and profitable alcohol beverage producer, by offering a distinctive portfolio of premium and high-end spirit products and brands that have a strong consumer appeal and following.
 
Our overall strategies to accomplish that goal include:
 

● | Product expansion of additional cold distilled eco-friendly alcoholic beverages and Ready-To-Drink cocktails, and alternate recyclable packaging options;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Key appointments to Management and Advisory team; 
● | Redevelopment of our websites with an up-scaled online store, and subsequently opening a tap room or bar. 
● | Development of CBD infused alcoholic products. 
● | Foreign and domestic sales and distribution network expansion. 

Our Strengths 
 
We believe the following competitive strengths will enable the implementation of our growth strategies:
 

● | Award Winning Product Line. We design, produce, market and sell handcrafted, award-winning alcohol beverage products with a portfolio consisting of gin, vodka, bitter aperitif and RTD cocktails. In 2018, we entered our Victory Cold Distilled Gin and Victory Bitter into the International Wine and Spirit Competition “IWSC”. Our Victory Cold Distilled Gin scored a Silver medal, with Victory Bitter scoring a Silver Outstanding medal. According to the IWSR, gin demand in the UK will grow by 37.2% by 2021. In addition, the global craft spirits market is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 33.4% from 2017 to 2025, owing to growing consumer tastes and preferences towards unconventional and experimental alcoholic beverages. We believe our modern production techniques, along with a core of recognized products in this growing market will enable us to establish a presence in new geographic markets and enable us to procure additional distributors for our products.

● | Experienced Distiller. Our distiller, Max Chater, we believe is a well regarded distiller, mixologist and industry professional that has important relationships with leading London bars and restaurants. We believe that these relationships have led to and will lead to collaborations and important and lasting direct on-trade customers that will lead to general increased consumer appeal through increased visibility of our brands. 
● | Eco-friendly. Our strategy is to produce premium products with minimal impact to the environment through the use of modern technology during production. Our methods help us to conserve energy and reduce water waste whilst delivering what we believe is a superior product. We also focus on environmentally friendly and recyclable packaging to reduce our carbon footprint. We are also looking to employ carbon offsetting in order to meet our carbon neutral status target by the end of 2020. 

Our Product Approach
 
Our approach to our craft spirits involves four important aspects:
 

● | Commitment to Quality. We design, produce, market and sell handcrafted, award-winning products targeted at growing markets; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Authentic Yet Scalable. We believe our approach to production allows us to produce our products at scale while keeping flavor profiles consistent; 
● | Unique Talent & Industry Experience. Every product reflects the quality and creativity of our Momentous team with strong industry experience and insight into eco friendly and recyclable market;
● | Core Spirit Portfolio. We believe that we need to focus on our core products in order to attract loyal and enthusiastic customers and major distributors.

Our Products
 
We design, produce, market and sell the products below under the brand “Victory” below:
 

● | Victory Cold Distilled Gin. Made in London, using a unique & modern process that conserves energy and reduces water waste. Our chosen botanicals are infused first in alcohol, then in water, and finally cold distilled separately at low temperature under vacuum. These distillates are blended to create our distinctive yet utilitarian gin. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Victory Bitter. A modern bitter ‘aperitivo’ spirit; British wheat spirit is infused with botanicals and fruits including gentian root, orange peel, apricot, rosemary, sage and fig. The infusion is blended with an organic, biodynamic wine and minimal sugar. The distinctive red color is achieved naturally through the infusion of hibiscus flowers. Best enjoyed with a premium tonic, plentiful ice, and a zest of lemon; or alternatively as the bitter in a classic cocktail, such as a Spritz or Negroni. 
● | Victory Vodka. Made using a previously unexplored botanical - unroasted green-coffee. We’ve partnered with Rob Dunne, Director of Coffee at Old Spike Roastery, and co-founder of Dunnefrankowski Creative Coffee Consultancy. Mr. Dunne ethically sources seasonal, green coffee beans. We cold-distill this highly aromatic and volatile raw ingredient to extract the light, savory, almost vegetal aromatics of this unique botanical. This is something new, an expression of coffee’s most natural essence - yet is not a coffee-flavored product. 
● | Victory Pink. A special edition Gin made in collaboration with Minus 8 vineyard. We believe that this product is the first of its kind. Victory Pink is all natural, delicious by default and pink by consequence. The fruity flavor and rosé color come from 8 Brix Verjus Red by Minus 8, a family-owned vineyard in Canada, where they craft exceptional vinegar and Verjus. Verjus is a zeitgeist ingredient, used by chefs and bartenders alike, to achieve balanced sweetness and acidity. Victory Pink presents flavors of spring cherry, cranberry and green plum from the Verjus and of course a wack of fresh Juniper, Orange and Orris.
● | Victory Negroni - Ready To Drink Cocktail. Made with Victory Cold Distilled Gin, Victory Bitter & Sweet Vermouth - a re-imagining of a timeless classic. Less sugar, completely natural, and hand crafted using award winning ingredients. These 100% recyclable pouches are single serve. Simply pour over ice, give it a quick stir, and garnish with a zest of orange. 

Production and Supply
 
There are several steps in the production and supply process for alcohol beverage products. First, all of our spirits products are distilled. This is a multi-stage process that converts basic grain ingredients into alcohol. The next process is designed to remove all other chemicals, so that the resulting liquid will be odorless and colorless, and have a smooth quality with minimal harshness resulting in a Neutral Grain Spirit (“NGS”). Achieving a high level of purity involves a series of distillations and filtration processes. We currently source our NGS that we further process to add flavor by blending or by adding ingredients (such as fresh botanicals for the Victory Cold Distilled Gin). We bottle in-house using a variety of bottles, eco pouches and KeyKegs.
 
We rely on a single supplier for NGS. We believe that we have consistent and reliable third party source for spirit product and maintain options for an alternate producer should there be a need to change suppliers.
       Intellectual Property
 
Trademarks are an important aspect of our business. We sell our products under the “Victory” trademark, which we own. Our brand is protected by the Intellectual Property Office trademark registration in the UK where we distribute our brand. The trademark is registered in the name of our subsidiary. In the UK, trademark registrations need to be renewed every ten years. We expect to register our trademarks in additional markets as we expand our distribution territories.

Seasonality
 
Our industry is subject to seasonality with peak retail sales generally occurring at the end of the fourth calendar quarter. This is primarily due to seasonal holiday buying.
Competition
 
The beverage alcohol industry is highly competitive. We compete on the basis of quality, price, brand recognition and distribution strength. Our premium brands compete with other alcoholic and nonalcoholic beverages for consumer purchases, retail shelf space, restaurant presence and wholesaler attention. We compete with numerous multinational producers and distributors of beverage alcohol products, many of which have greater resources than us.
 
Over the past ten years, the U.S. wine and spirits industry has undergone dramatic consolidation and realignment of brands and brand ownership. The number of major importers in the U.S. has declined significantly. Today there are eight major companies: Diageo PLC, Pernod Ricard S.A., Bacardi Limited, Brown-Forman Corporation, Beam Suntory Inc., Davide Campari Milano-S.p.A., and Remy Cointreau S.A.
 
Our relative capital position and resources may limit our marketing capabilities, limit our ability to expand into new markets and limit our negotiating ability with our distributors.
 
By focusing on the premium and super-premium segments of the market, which typically have higher margins, we believe we may be able to gain relatively significant attention from distributors for a company of our size. Also, the continued consolidation among the major companies is expected to create an opportunity for small to mid-size wine and spirits companies, such as ourselves, as the major companies contract their portfolios to focus on fewer brands.
 
Government regulation
 
We are subject to the jurisdiction of the Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs (“HMRC”) in the UK. As part of our requirements to produce, market and sell alcohol beverage products in the United Kingdom we hold certain licenses issued by HMRC. We believe that we are in material compliance with applicable UK regulations. However, we operate in a highly regulated industry, which may be subject to more stringent interpretations of existing regulations. Future compliance costs due to regulatory changes could be significant.
 
Employees
 
As of May 31, 2019, we had 2 full-time employees and 2 part-time employees. Our officers and directors will continue to work for us for the foreseeable future. We anticipate hiring appropriate personnel on an as-needed basis, and utilizing the services of independent contractors as needed.
Geographic Information
 
Momentous operates in one business – premium beverage alcohol. Momentous’ product categories are gin, vodka and bitter aperitif. We currently sell our products in the United Kingdom with a focus on London, United Kingdom.
Facilities
 
Our corporate headquarters are currently located in London, United Kingdom. Our corporate address is a professional mail forwarding office where physical office space may be rented on a short-term basis for additional fees.
 
We lease and occupy approximately 300 square feet of industrial space in Tottenham, London in the United Kingdom. We conduct our business operations, including administrative functions, production, marketing and sales of low carbon, eco-friendly beverages from this location.

Legal Proceedings
 
We are not currently subject to any material legal proceedings, however, we could be subject to legal proceedings and claims from time to time in the ordinary course of our business. Regardless of the outcome, litigation can, among other things, be time consuming and expensive to resolve, and divert management resources.
