ITEM 1.   BUSINESS.
Introduction
 We are a leading designer, producer, and marketer of innovative, distinctive, performance-driven, high-quality ammunition products for sale to a variety of consumers, including sport and recreational shooters, hunters, individuals seeking home or personal protection, and law enforcement and military agencies.  To enhance the strength of our brands and drive product demand, we emphasize product innovation and technology to improve the performance, quality, and affordability of our products while providing support to our distribution channel and consumers.  We seek to sell products that perform like high-end, custom, hand-loaded ammunition at competitive prices.  We emphasize an American heritage by using American made components in our products that are produced, inspected, and packaged at our facility in Payson, Arizona.
 Our production processes focus on safety, consistency, precision, and cleanliness.  Each round is developed for a specific purpose with a focus on a proper mix of consistency, velocity, accuracy, and recoil.  Each round is chamber gauged and inspected with redundant seven-slip quality control processes.
 Our Strategy
 Our goal is to enhance our position as a leading designer, producer, and marketer of ammunition products.  Key elements of our strategy to achieve this goal are as follows:
Design, Produce, and Market Innovative, Distinctive, Performance-Driven, High-Quality Ammunition
 We are focused on designing, producing, and marketing innovative, distinctive, performance-driven, high-quality products that appeal to retailers and consumers that will enhance our users' shooting experiences.  Our ongoing research and development activities; our safe, consistent, precision, and clean production processes; and our multi-faceted marketing programs are critical to our success.
Continue to Strengthen Relationships with Channel Partners and Retailers.
 We continue to strive to strengthen our relationships with our current distributors, dealers, and mass market and specialty retailers and to attract additional distributors, dealers, and retailers.  The success of our efforts depends on the innovation, distinctive features, quality, and performance of our products; the attractiveness of our packaging; the effectiveness of our marketing and merchandising programs; and the effectiveness of our customer support.
Emphasis on Customer Satisfaction and Loyalty
 We plan to continue to emphasize customer satisfaction and loyalty by offering innovative, distinctive, high-quality products on a timely and cost-attractive basis and by offering effective customer service, training, and support.  We regard the features, quality, and performance of our products as the most important components of our customer satisfaction and loyalty efforts, but we also rely on customer service and support, such as toll-free, customer support numbers, extensive service policies, and product warranties.
Continuously Improving Operations
 We plan to continue to focus on improving all aspects of our business, including research and development, component sourcing, production processes, marketing programs, and customer support.  We are continuing our efforts to enhance our production productively by increasing daily production quantities, increasing the amount and operational availability of our equipment, reducing equipment down times, and increasing overall efficiency.

Enhance Market Share, Brand Recognition, and Customer Loyalty
 We plan to continue to strive to enhance our market share, brand recognition, and customer loyalty.  Industry sources estimate that 70 million to 80 million people in the United States own more than approximately 300 million firearms, creating a large installed base for our ammunition products.  We are focusing on the premium segment of the market through the quality, distinctiveness, and performance of our products; the effectiveness of our marketing and merchandising efforts; and the attractiveness of our pricing.
Pursue Synergetic Strategic Acquisitions and Relationships
 We intend to pursue strategic acquisitions and develop strategic relationships designed to enable us to expand our technology and knowhow, expand our product offerings, strengthen and expand our supply chain, enhance our production process, expand our marketing and distribution, and attract new customers.
Products
 We design, produce, and sell ammunition in a variety types, sizes, and calibers for use in handgun and long guns.  We ship our ammunition in the form of cartridges, or rounds.  A cartridge consists of four components:  a case made of brass, steel, or copper that holds together all the other components of the cartridge; the primer, which is an explosive chemical compound that ignites the gunpowder when struck by the firing pin; the gun powder, which is a chemical mixture that burns rapidly and creates an expanding gas when ignited and pushes the bullet out the barrel; and the bullet, or projectile, usually containing lead that is fired through the barrel to strike the target.  Some of the bullets we produce for certain applications have a jacket, or outer shell, of brass or copper to improve performance and accuracy.  We typically produce centerfire cartridges in which the primer is in the bottom, or center of the cartridge, rather than rim fire cartridges in which the primer is in the rim of the cartridge.
Streak Visual Ammunition
 Stealth Visual ammunition enables shooters to see the path of the bullets fired by them.  Streak rounds utilize non-flammable phosphor material that produces a glow by the utilization of the light emitted during the round discharge to make streak glow.  The glowing material is applied only to the aft end of the projectile, making it visible only to the shooter and those within a 30-degree viewing window.  As a result, the glow of streak ammunition is not visible to the target unlike conventional tracers, which we believe is important to the military and law enforcement.  Unlike conventional tracer ammunition, streak rounds are not incendiary and do not utilize burning metals to generate light, thereby eliminating heat generation and making them safer for use in various environments and avoid serious fire hazards.  Streak ammunition comes in 380 auto, 9 mm, 40 S&W, 44 magnum, 45 long colt, and 38 special among other calibers.
 We hold the exclusive worldwide rights for the patented technology for streak visual ammunition.
 OPS â€“ One Precise Shot
 OPS ammunition is designed to meet a wide variety of demanding engagement scenarios experienced by law enforcement personnel in the line of duty.  The hollow point lead-free fragile bullet with hard outer casing and transible copper/tungsten case transfers 100% of its energy into the target.  These bullets track penetrate a variety of barriers, such as drywall, plywood, car doors, and auto glass.  Upon entering soft tissue, the jacket and core separate with extensive force of impact, resulting in mass force trauma.  The light weight projectile reduces recoil and enhances accuracy.  OPS ammunition comes in 9 mm, 40 S&W, and 45 auto calibers.
Stealth Subsonic Ammunition
 Stealth Subsonic ammunition is designed specifically for superior performance in suppressed firearms.  Stealth ammunition finds applications in which silence is paramount, such as in tactical training, predator night hunts, and clandestine operations.  The stealth ammunition is produced to be a clean burning total metal jacket round to slow baffle corrosion and reduce lead emissions that collect in the suppressor body.  Stealth pistol ammunition comes in 9mm, 40 S&W, and 45 AC3 and 223 calibers.

Jesse James Ammunition
 Jesse James ammunition is jacketed hollow point projectiles designed for self-defense.  The load specific development is designed to ensure accuracy, velocity, and consistency and a low recoil.  Jesse James ammunition comes in 9mm, 40 S&W, 10mm, 357, 45 auto calibers.
Jeff Rann's American Hunter and Safari Services
 Jeff Rann's ammunition is intended for a complete range of game hunting.  This high-end hunting ammunition has been designed by Jeff Rann, a well-known professional hunter and sports channel host as well as the owner of the well-known 777 Ranch in Texas and three ranches in Africa.
Marketing
 We market our products to consumers through distributors, dealers, mass market and specialty retailers, as well as direct to consumer through e-commerce.  We maintain consumer-focused product marketing and promotional campaigns, which include print and digital advertising campaigns; social and electronic media; product demonstrations; point-of-sales materials; in-store training, and in-store retail merchandising.  Our use of social media includes Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, and You Tube.  We also utilize third-party endorsements, social influencers, and brand ambassadors, such as Jesse James, Jeff Rann, Charissa Littlejohn, and Grady Powell.
Manufacturing
 We conduct our research and development, manufacturing, assembly, inspection, and packaging operations in a 20,000 square foot facility located in Payson, Arizona.  The facility currently produces 36 million rounds of ammunition annually with the capacity to scale to 200 million rounds.  Our in-house testing operation at the facility is intended to enhance the performance and reliability of our products.
Research and Development
 We conduct research and development activities to enhance existing products and develop new products at our facility in Payson, Arizona.  We plan to expand our research and development activities in the future.
Suppliers
 We purchase certain of the raw materials and components for our ammunition products, including brass, steel, or copper casings; ammunition primers to ignite gun powder; gun powder; and projectiles.  We believe we have reliable sources of supply for all our raw material and component needs, but from time to time are subject to shortages and price increases.  Most of our suppliers are U.S.-based and provide us the materials and components at competitive rates.  We plan to broaden our supplier base and secure multiple sources for all of the raw materials and components we require.
Customers
 We sell our products to a wide variety of customers, including sport and recreational shooters, hunters, competitive shooters, individuals desiring home and personal protection, and law enforcement and military agencies.  We sell our products under the names of our four principle ammunition products.  One customer accounted for more than 10 percent of our net sales for the year ended December 31, 2017.
Competition
 The ammunition industry is dominated by a small number of companies, a number of which are divisions of large public companies.  We compete primarily on the quality, reliability, features, performance, brand awareness, and price of our products.  Our primary competitors include Remington Arms, the Winchester Ammunition division of Olin Corporation, and various smaller manufacturers and imposters, including Black-Hills Ammunition, CBC Group, Fiocchi Ammunition, Hornady Manufacturing Company, and PMC.

Employees
 As of March 31, 2018, we had a total of 42 employees, including 10 part-time employees.  Of these employees, 31 were engaged in manufacturing, four in sales and marketing, three in finance and accounting, and five in various executive and administrative functions.  None of our employees are represented by a union in collective bargaining with us.  We believe that our employee relations are good.
Seasonality
 Our business has not exhibited a material degree of seasonality to date.  Our net sales could be moderately higher in our third and fourth fiscal quarters because of the fall hunting and holiday seasons.
Intellectual Property
 We believe our tradenames, trademarks, and service markets are important factors in distinguishing our products.  In addition, we regard our trade secrets, technological resources, knowhow, licensing arrangements, and endorsements as important competitive factors.
 As a result of an acquisition for 600,000 shares of our Common Stock and $200,000, we acquired the exclusive license to produce ammunition using our patented "hybrid luminescence technology" owned by the University of Louisiana at Lafayette.  We use that technology in connection with our Streak Visual ammunition.
 We are a party to a license agreement with Jesse James, a well-known motorcycle designer, and Jesse James Firearms, LLC, a Texas limited liability company, or JJF.  The licensing agreement grants us the exclusive worldwide rights through October 15, 2021 to Mr. James' image rights and all trademarks associated with him in connection with the marketing, promotion, advertising, sale, and commercial exploitation of Jesse James Branded Products.  In addition, Mr. James agreed to make himself available for certain promotional activities and to promote Jesse James Branded Products through his own social media outlets.  We agreed to pay Mr. James royalty fees on the sale of ammunition and non-ammunition Branded Products and to reimburse him for any out-of-pocket expenses and reasonable travel expenses.  We also issued 100,000 shares of our Common Stock upon the execution of the license agreement with the potential issuance of up to 75,000 additional shares of Common stock upon achieving certain gross sales with $15 million in gross sales required to earn the entire 75,000 shares.
 We are a party to a license agreement with Jeff Rann, a well-known wild game hunter and spokesman for the firearm and ammunition industries.  The license agreement grants for us through February 2022 the exclusive worldwide rights to Mr. Rann's image rights and trademarks associated with him in connection with the marketing, promotion, advertising, sale, and commercial exploitation of all Jeff Rann Branded Products.  Mr. Rann agreed to make himself available for certain promotional activities and to promote the Branded Products through his own social media outlets.  We agreed to pay Mr. Rann royalty fees on the sale of ammunition and non-ammunition Branded Products and to reimburse him for any out-of-pocket expenses and reasonable travel expenses.  We also issued 100,000 shares of our Common Stock upon the execution of the license agreement with the potential issuance of 75,000 additional shares of Common Stock upon achieving certain gross sales with $15 million in gross sales required to earn the entire 75,000 shares.
 Backlog
 We did not have a material amount of backlog of orders at the end of our fiscal on December 31, 2017, which was the first year of our current operations.  Backlog consists of orders for which purchase orders have been received and which are generally scheduled for shipment within three months.  We generally allow orders that have not yet been shipped to be cancelled.  Our backlog may not be indicative of future sale.
Environmental Matters
 Our operations are subject to a variety of federal, state, and local laws and regulations relating to environmental protection, including those governing the discharge, treatment, storage, transportation, remediation, and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes; the restoration of damages to the environment; and health and safety matters.  We believe that our operations are in material compliance with these laws and regulations.  We incur expenses in complying with environmental requirements and could incur higher costs in the future as a result of more stringent requirements that may be enacted in the future.

Some environmental laws, such as the U.S. federal Superfund law and similar state laws, can impose liability, without regard to fault, for the entire cost of the cleanup of contaminated sites on current or former site owners and operators or parties who sent wastes to such sites.  Based on currently available information, we do not believe that environmental matters will have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, or financial condition.
 Regulatory Matters
 The manufacture, sale, and purchase of ammunition are subject to extensive federal, state, local, and foreign governmental laws.  We are also subject to the rules and regulations of the ATF and various state and international agencies that control the manufacture, export, import, distribution and sale of firearms, explosives, and ammunition.  Such regulations may adversely affect demand for our products by imposing limitations that increase the costs or limit the availability of our products.
 Our failure to comply with applicable rules and regulations may result in the limitation of our growth or business activities and could result in the revocation of licenses necessary for our business.  Applicable laws and regulations provide for the following:
  
Â· | require the licensing of all persons manufacturing, exporting, importing, or selling ammunition as a business;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Â· | require serialization, labeling, and tracking of the acquisition and disposition of certain types of ammunition;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Â· | regulate the interstate sale of certain ammunition;
--+----------------------------------------------------


Â· | restrict or prohibit the ownership, use, or sale of specified categories of ammunition;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Â· | require registries of so-called "ballistic images" of ammunition fired from new guns;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Â· | govern the sale, export, and distribution of ammunition;
--+---------------------------------------------------------


Â· | regulate the use and storage of gun powder or other energetic materials;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------


Â· | regulate the employment of personnel with certain criminal convictions; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


Â· | restrict access to ammunition manufacturing facilities for certain individuals from other countries or with criminal convictions.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Â· | required compliance iwth ITAR.
--+-------------------------------


The handling of our technical data and the international sale of our products may also regulated by the U.S. Department of State and Department of Commerce.  These agencies can impose civil and criminal penalties, including denying us from exporting our products, for failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations.
 In addition, bills have been introduced in Congress to establish, and to consider the feasibility of establishing a nationwide database recording so-called "ballistic images" of ammunition fired from new guns.  Should such a mandatory database be established, the cost to us, our distributors, and our customers could be significant, depending on the type of firearms and ballistic information included in the database.  Bills have been introduced in Congress in the past several years that would affect the manufacture and sale of ammunition, including bills to regulate the manufacture, importation, and sale.
 We believe that existing federal, state, and local legislation relating to the regulation of firearms and ammunition have not had a material adverse effect on our sales of these products.  However, the regulation of firearms and ammunition may become more restrictive in the future, and any such developments might have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition, and cash flows.  In addition, regulatory proposals, even if never enacted, may affect firearms or ammunition sales as a result of consumer perceptions.

Company History
 We were formed under the name Retrospettiva, Inc. in November 1990 to manufacture and import textile products, including both finished garments and fabrics; but we were inactive until following a series of events in December 2016 and March 2017.  In December 2016, our current largest stockholder acquired control of our company, after which we changed our name to AMMO, Inc., changed our trading symbol, engaged in a 1-for-25 reverse stock split, changed our state of incorporation from California to Delaware, and increased our authorized Common Stock to 100,000,000 shares of Common Stock.  In March 2017, we merged with a company organized by our largest stockholder, recapitalized our capital stock and commence our current business.  Thereafter, a new management team, Board of Directors, and business were instituted.
