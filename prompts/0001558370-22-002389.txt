Item 1. Business.
Overview
Founded in 1965, Stoneridge, Inc. (the “Company”) is a global designer and manufacturer of highly engineered electrical and electronic components, modules and systems for the automotive, commercial, off-highway and agricultural vehicle markets. Our products and systems are critical elements in the management of mechanical and electrical systems to improve overall vehicle performance, convenience and monitoring in areas such as safety and security, intelligence, efficiency and emissions. Our worldwide footprint is primarily comprised of 21 locations in 11 countries and enables us to supply global automotive, commercial, off-highway, agricultural and other vehicle markets.
Our custom-engineered products and systems are used to activate equipment and accessories, monitor and display vehicle performance and control, distribute electrical power and signals and provide vehicle security and convenience. Our product offerings consist of actuators, sensors, switches and connectors, driver information systems, camera-based vision systems, connectivity and compliance products, electronic control units, vehicle tracking devices and monitoring services, vehicle security alarms and convenience accessories, in-vehicle audio and infotainment devices and telematics solutions. We supply the majority of our products, predominantly on a sole-source basis, to many of the world’s leading automotive and commercial vehicle original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”) and select non-vehicle OEMs, as well as certain automotive and commercial vehicle Tier 1 suppliers. Our customers are increasingly utilizing electronic technology to comply with more stringent regulations (particularly emissions and safety) and to meet end-user demand for improved vehicle performance and greater convenience. As a result of this trend, per-vehicle electronic content has been increasing. Our technology and our partnership-oriented approach to product design and development enables us to develop next-generation products and systems for this trend.
Beginning with the divestiture of our wiring business in 2014, we accelerated a shift in our product portfolio towards smart products, or those products which contain embedded electronics or logic. While the wiring business was our largest single business, based on revenues and employees, and the business that the Company was founded on, its products were largely commodities that did not provide a technology platform to drive our expected future growth. In addition to the divestiture of the wiring business, we deployed capital in 2017 to make strategic investments including the acquisition of Orlaco, our partner on the development of MirrorEye, our camera-based vision system, and the acquisition of 100 percent of our Stoneridge Brazil business. In 2019, the Company’s Control Devices segment sold its non-core switches and connectors business (the “Non-core Products”) and in 2020 announced the strategic exit of our PM sensor business to further align with our strategic plan. These activities have acted as a catalyst for the advancement of our smart product portfolio, increasing our smart content from just over 50 percent of our sales in 2014 to almost 75% of our sales in 2021. Our product portfolio shift focuses on the megatrends driving the transportation industry.
In January 2019, the Company committed to a restructuring plan that resulted in the closure of the Canton, Massachusetts facility (“Canton Facility”) as of March 31, 2020 and the consolidation of manufacturing operations at that site into other Company locations (“Canton Restructuring”). The costs for the Canton Restructuring included employee severance and termination costs, contract termination costs, professional fees and other related costs such as moving and set-up costs for equipment and costs to restore the engineering function previously located at the Canton Facility.  We recognized less than $0.1 million of expense as a result of these actions during the year ended December 31, 2021 and recognized $3.0 million and $12.5 million of expense during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. During the third quarter of 2020, we leased the Canton facility to a third party. On June 17, 2021, we sold the Canton facility. See Note 7 and Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for additional details regarding the third-party lease and sale, respectively, of the Canton Facility. The Company does not expect to incur additional costs related to the Canton Restructuring.
On April 1, 2019, the Company entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement and sold product lines and assets related to certain Control Devices Non-core Products. The Non-core Products were manufactured in Juarez, Mexico and Canton, Massachusetts, and include ball switches, ignition switches, rotary switches, courtesy lamps, toggle switches, headlamp switches and other related components. See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statement for additional details regarding the disposal of Non-core Products.

On May 19, 2020, the Company committed to the strategic exit of its Control Devices particulate matter (“PM”) sensor product line (“PM Sensor Exit”). The decision to exit the PM sensor product line was made after the consideration of the decline in the market outlook for diesel passenger vehicles, the current and expected profitability of the product line and the Company’s strategic focus on aligning resources with the greatest opportunities. The estimated costs for the PM Sensor Exit include employee severance and termination costs, professional fees and other related costs such as potential commercial and supplier settlements. Non-cash charges include impairment of fixed assets and accelerated depreciation associated with PM sensor production. See Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for additional details regarding the PM Sensor Exit.
On March 8, 2021, the Company entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement and sold the PM sensor product line and assets. The PM sensor product line and assets were located in Lexington, Ohio and Tallinn, Estonia. See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for additional details regarding the sale of the PM sensor business.
On November 2, 2021, the Company entered into a Share Purchase Agreement (the “SPA”) with Minda Corporation Limited (“Minda”), as the buyer, and Minda Stoneridge Instruments Ltd. (“MSIL”). On December 30, 2021, pursuant to the SPA, the Company closed the sale of MSIL to Minda. See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for additional details regarding the sale of MSIL.
We have positioned each of our segments for continued long-term success. Our Control Devices segment is increasingly well positioned with a focus on continued development and commercialization of actuation and electrified powertrain applications that will drive future growth for the segment. Our Electronics segment is expected to drive strong revenue growth through previously awarded new program launches including our first two launches for our MirrorEye® camera-based vision system in the OEM market, as well as our continued investment in current and future technologies. Our Stoneridge Brazil segment continues to integrate into our global Electronics strategy as we leverage our global engineering footprint and prepare for continued expansion of our local OEM presence. Overall, we will continue to focus our resources on the areas of largest opportunity for the Company and drive long-term value creation for our shareholders.
Segments and Products
We conduct our business in three reportable business segments which are the same as our operating segments: Control Devices, Electronics and Stoneridge Brazil.
Control Devices. Our Control Devices segment designs and manufactures products that monitor, measure or activate specific functions within a vehicle. This segment includes product lines such as actuators, sensors, switches and connectors. Actuator products enable OEMs to deploy power functions in a vehicle and can be designed to integrate switching and control functions including our park lock and shift by wire products. Sensor products are employed in major vehicle systems such as the emissions, safety, powertrain, braking, climate control, steering and suspension systems. Switches and connectors transmit signals that activate specific functions. Our switch and connector technology is principally used in two capacities, user-activated and hidden. User-activated switches are used by a vehicle’s operator or passengers to manually activate in-vehicle accessories. Hidden switches are not typically visible to vehicle operators or passengers and are engaged to activate or deactivate selected functions as part of normal vehicle operations. We sell these products principally to the automotive market. To a lesser extent, we also sell these products to the commercial vehicle and agricultural markets.
Electronics. Our Electronics segment designs and manufactures driver information systems, camera-based vision systems, connectivity and compliance products and electronic control units. Driver information systems and connectivity and compliance products collect, store and display vehicle information such as speed, pressure, maintenance data, trip information, operator performance, temperature, distance traveled, and driver messages related to vehicle performance. Camera-based vision products provide enhanced vehicle visibility and safety to drivers. Electronic control units regulate, coordinate, monitor and direct the operation of the electrical system within a vehicle. These products are sold principally to the commercial vehicle market through both the OEM and aftermarket channels. In addition, camera-based vision systems are sold to the off-highway and commercial vehicle markets.

Stoneridge Brazil. Our Stoneridge Brazil (“SRB”) segment primarily serves the South American market and specializes in the design, manufacture and sale of vehicle tracking devices and monitoring services, vehicle security alarms and convenience accessories, in-vehicle audio and infotainment devices and telematics solutions primarily for the automotive and motorcycle markets. This segment includes product lines such as vehicle monitoring and tracking devices, security alarms, convenience applications such as parking sensors and rearview cameras, audio and infotainment systems and telematics products used for fleet management. These products improve the performance, safety and convenience features of our customers’ vehicles. Stoneridge Brazil sells its products through the aftermarket distribution channel, to factory authorized dealer installers, also referred to as original equipment services, direct to OEMs and through mass merchandisers. In addition, monitoring services and tracking devices are sold directly to corporate and individual customers.
Our products and systems are sold to numerous OEM and Tier 1 customers, as well as aftermarket distributors and mass merchandisers, for use on many different vehicle platforms. We supply multiple parts to many of our principal OEM and Tier 1 customers under requirements contracts for a particular vehicle model. These contracts range in duration from one year to the production life of the model, which commonly extends for three to seven years.
The following table sets forth for the periods indicated, the percentage of net sales derived from our principal end markets:

​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​
---------------------------------------------------------------------+---+------+---+------+---+------+--
Principal End Markets | | 2021 | | 2020 | | 2019 | ​
Automotive | ​ | 41 | % | 45 | % | 41 | %
Commercial vehicle | ​ | 39 | ​ | 36 | ​ | 33 | ​
Off-highway and other | ​ | 12 | ​ | 12 | ​ | 18 | ​
Aftermarket distributors, mass merchandisers and monitoring services | 8 | ​ | 7 | ​ | 8 | ​ 

​
For further information related to our reportable segments and financial information about geographic areas, see Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements.

Production Materials
The principal production materials used in the Company’s manufacturing process are molded plastic components and resins, copper, steel, precious metals and certain electrical components such as printed circuit boards, semiconductors, microprocessors, memory devices, resistors, capacitors, fuses, relays, infotainment devices and cameras. We purchase production materials pursuant to both annual contract and spot purchasing methods. Such materials are available from multiple sources, but we generally establish collaborative relationships with a qualified supplier for each of our key production materials in order to lower costs and enhance service and quality. As global demand for our production materials increases, we may have difficulties obtaining adequate production materials from our suppliers to satisfy our customers. Refer to the Risk Factors for risks related to the current supply chain disruption related to semiconductors and other production materials. Any extended period of time for which we cannot obtain adequate production material or which we experience an increase in the price of production material would materially affect our results of operations and financial condition.

Patents, Trademarks and Intellectual Property
We maintain and have pending various U.S. and foreign patents, trademarks and other rights to intellectual property relating to the reportable segments of our business, which we believe are appropriate to protect the Company’s interests in existing products, new inventions, manufacturing processes and product developments. We do not believe any single patent is material to our business, nor would the expiration or invalidity of any patent have a material adverse effect on our business or ability to compete.
Industry Cyclicality and Seasonality
The markets for products in each of our reportable segments have been cyclical. Because these products are used principally in the production of vehicles for the automotive, commercial, off-highway and agricultural vehicle markets, revenues and therefore results of operations, are significantly dependent on the general state of the economy and other factors, like the impact of environmental regulations on our customers and end market consumers, which affect these markets. A significant decline in automotive, commercial, off-highway and agricultural vehicle production of our principal customers could adversely impact the Company. Our Control Devices and Electronics and segments are moderately seasonal, impacted by mid-year and year-end shutdowns and the ramp-up of new model production at key customers. In addition, the demand for our Stoneridge Brazil segment consumer products is typically higher in the second half of the year.

Customers
We have several customers which account for a significant percentage of our sales. The loss of any significant portion of our sales to these customers, or the loss of a significant customer, would have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. We supply numerous different products to each of our principal customers. Contracts with several of our customers provide for supplying their requirements for a particular model, rather than for manufacturing a specific quantity of products. Such contracts range from one year to the life of the model, which is generally three to seven years. These contracts are subject to potential renegotiation from time to time, which may affect product pricing and generally may be terminated by our customers at any time. Therefore, the loss of a contract for a major model or a significant decrease in demand for certain key models or group of related models sold by any of our major customers would have a material adverse impact on the Company. We may enter into contracts to supply products, the introduction of which may then be delayed or cancelled. We also compete to supply products for successor models, and are therefore subject to the risk that the customer will not select the Company to produce products on any such model, which could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.
Due to the competitive nature of the markets we serve, we face pricing pressures from our customers in the ordinary course of business. In response to these pricing pressures we have been able to effectively manage our production costs by the combination of lowering certain costs and limiting the increase of others, the net impact of which has not been material. However, if we are unable to effectively manage production costs in the future to mitigate future pricing pressures, our results of operations would be adversely affected.

Backlog
The Company typically enters into customer agreements at the beginning of a vehicle life cycle with the intent to fulfill customer-purchasing requirements for the entire vehicle production life cycle. The vehicle life cycle usually includes the two to four year pre-production period and production for a term covering the life of such vehicle model or platform, generally between three to seven years, although there is no guarantee that this will occur. Our customers make no firm commitments regarding volume and may terminate these agreements or orders at any time. The Company’s estimated sourced future sales may also be impacted by various assumptions, including new program vehicle production levels, customer price reductions, foreign currency exchange rates and program launch timing. The Company’s customer agreements may be terminated by customers at any time and, accordingly, estimated sourced future sales information does not represent firm orders or firm commitments. The Company defines backlog as the estimated cumulative awarded sales for the next five years (or “estimated sourced future sales”). The Company’s estimated sourced future sales were $3.4 billion as of December 31, 2021, compared to $3.0 billion as of December 31, 2020. Due to the exit of the Control Devices PM sensor products business, related sales were excluded from our estimated sourced future sales as of December 31, 2020. 
Competition
The markets for our products in our reportable segments are highly competitive. We compete based on technological innovation, price, quality, performance, service and delivery. We compete for new business both at the beginning of the development of new models and upon the redesign of existing models for OEM customers. New model development generally begins two to five years before the marketing of such models to the public. Once a supplier has been selected to provide parts for a new program, an OEM customer will usually continue to purchase those parts from the selected supplier for the life of the program, although not necessarily for any model redesigns. We compete for aftermarket and mass merchandiser sales based on price, product functionality, quality and service.
Our diversity in products creates a wide range of competitors, which vary depending on both market and geographic location. We compete based on strong customer relations and a fast and flexible organization that develops technically effective solutions at or below target price.
Product Development
Our research and development efforts for our reportable segments are largely product design and development oriented and consist primarily of applying known technologies to customer requests. We work closely with our customers to solve customer requests using innovative approaches. The majority of our development expenses are related to customer-sponsored programs where we are involved in designing custom-engineered solutions for specific applications or for next generation technology. To further our vehicle platform penetration, we have also developed collaborative relationships with the design and engineering departments of key customers. These collaborative efforts have resulted in the development of new and complimentary products and the enhancement of existing products.

While our engineering and product development departments are organized by market, our segments interact and collaborate on new products. The product development operations are complimented by technology groups in Barneveld, Netherlands; Campinas, Brazil; Juarez, Mexico; Lexington, Ohio; Novi, Michigan; Stockholm, Sweden and Suzhou, China.
We have invested, and will continue to invest heavily in technology to develop new products for our customers. Product development costs, other than capitalized software development costs, incurred in connection with the development of new products and manufacturing methods, to the extent not recoverable from the customer, are expensed as incurred. 
We will continue to prioritize investment spending toward the design and development of new products over sustaining existing product programs for specific customers, which allows us to sell our products to multiple customers. The typical product development process takes three to seven years to show tangible results. As part of our effort to evaluate our investment spending, we review our current product portfolio and adjust our spending to either accelerate or eliminate our investment in these products based on our position in the market and the potential of the market and product.
Environmental and Other Regulations
Our operations are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations governing, among other things, emissions to air, discharge to water and the generation, handling, storage, transportation, treatment and disposal of waste and other materials. We believe that our business, operations and facilities have been and are being operated in compliance, in all material respects, with applicable environmental and health and safety laws and regulations, many of which provide for substantial fines and criminal sanctions for violations.
Human Capital Management
As of December 31, 2021, Stoneridge employed approximately 5,000 full time and temporary employees in 13 countries, with about 86% located outside of the United States. Although we have no collective bargaining agreements covering U.S. employees, a significant number of employees located in Brazil, China, Estonia, Mexico, Netherlands, Sweden and the United Kingdom either (i) are represented by a union and are covered by a collective bargaining agreement, or (ii) are covered by a works council or other employment arrangements required by law. We work to ensure positive relations with our employees.
We strive to create a work environment that enhances employee engagement, fosters productivity, and is aligned with our values of Integrity, Accountability, Teamwork, Adaptability, Customer Orientation, and Social Responsibility. We know that our success is dependent on our employees’ engagement, performance, skills, and development. To that end, we have established talent management programs at Stoneridge, which include but are not limited to the following:

● | Periodic global employee engagement surveys and subsequent action planning
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Regular talent reviews for employee development and succession planning
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------

When we hire new employees, we focus not just on the skills required for current positions, but the ever-changing complex skills and competencies that will be required as we move forward on our path to being the mobility industry’s integrated technology partner. We seek diverse sources for candidates and we offer wages and benefits that are competitive in the markets where employees are located.
We believe a diverse workforce and an inclusive work environment is required for us to achieve our full potential as an organization. We further recognize the importance of having a strong Diversity, Equity & Inclusion (“DEI”) strategy. We have recently embarked on an initiative to reassess our DEI strategy, identify gaps between our ideal and current states, and develop goals and actions to realize measurable improvement. We look forward to continuing this important work in 2022.

It is always a top priority, but the COVID-19 global pandemic has brought even greater focus on employee health and safety. We instituted a global Safe Workplace Committee that meets regularly to assess, monitor, and update safety measures as needed related to COVID-19 for each location. At the start of the pandemic, where possible employees began working from home, and extensive safety measures were implemented, including temperature and health screenings, distanced workstations, plexiglass barriers, enhanced cleaning and disinfection protocols, required face coverings, and contact tracing when needed. Over time, the Safe Workplace Committee has adapted our safety protocols as local regulations and changing conditions have warranted. Our safety measures continue to be aligned with the recommendations of US and global health organizations.
The Human Resources function at Stoneridge is an active and visible partner to the business at all levels. Our Chief Human Resources Officer reports directly to the Chief Executive Officer and interacts frequently with the Company’s Board of Directors. Our Human Capital focus will continue to be on employee engagement, employee and leadership development, communications, and employee health and safety.
