Item 1. Business
General

Eaton Vance Corp. provides advanced investment strategies and wealth management solutions to forward-thinking investors around the world. Our principal business is managing investment funds and providing investment management and advisory services to high-net-worth individuals and institutions. Our core strategy is to develop and sustain management expertise across a range of investment disciplines and to offer leading investment strategies and services through multiple distribution channels. In executing our core strategy, we have developed broadly diversified investment management capabilities and a highly functional marketing, distribution and customer service organization. We measure our success as a Company based principally on investment performance delivered, client satisfaction, reputation in the marketplace, progress achieving strategic objectives, employee development and satisfaction, business and financial results, and shareholder value created.

We conduct our investment management and advisory business through wholly- and majority-owned investment affiliates, which include: Eaton Vance Management, Parametric Portfolio Associates LLC (Parametric), Atlanta Capital Management Company, LLC (Atlanta Capital) and Calvert Research and Management (Calvert). We also offer investment management advisory services through minority-owned affiliate Hexavest Inc. (Hexavest).

Through Eaton Vance Management, Atlanta Capital, Calvert and our other affiliates, we manage active equity, income, alternative and blended strategies across a range of investment styles and asset classes, including U.S., global and international equities, floating-rate bank loans, municipal bonds, global income, high-yield and investment grade bonds, and mortgage-backed securities. Through Parametric, we manage a range of systematic investment strategies, including systematic equity, systematic alternatives and managed options strategies. Through Parametric, we also provide custom portfolio implementation and overlay services,

including tax-managed and non-tax-managed Custom Core™ equity strategies, centralized portfolio management of multi-manager portfolios and exposure management services. We also oversee the management of, and distribute, investment funds sub-advised by unaffiliated third-party managers, including global, emerging market and regional equity and asset allocation strategies. 

Our breadth of investment management capabilities supports a wide range of strategies and services offered to fund shareholders and separate account investors. Our equity strategies encompass a diversity of investment objectives, risk profiles, income levels and geographic representation. Our income investment strategies cover a broad duration, geographic representation and credit-quality range and encompass both taxable and tax-free investments. We also offer alternative investment strategies that include global macro absolute return and commodity-based investments. Although we manage and distribute a wide range of investment strategies and services, we operate in one business segment, namely as an investment adviser to funds and separate accounts. As of October 31, 2019, we had $497.4 billion in consolidated assets under management.

We distribute our funds and individual separately managed accounts principally through financial intermediaries. We have broad market reach, with distribution partners including national and regional broker-dealers, independent broker-dealers, registered investment advisors, banks and insurance companies. We support these distribution partners with a team of approximately 130 sales professionals covering U.S. and international markets.

We employ a team of approximately 40 sales professionals focused on serving institutional and high-net-worth clients who access investment management services on a direct basis and through investment consultants. Through our wholly- and majority-owned affiliates, we manage investments for a broad range of clients in the institutional and high-net-worth marketplace in the U.S. and internationally, including corporations, sovereign wealth funds, endowments, foundations, family offices and public and private employee retirement plans.

Company History 

We have been in the investment management business for over 90 years, tracing our history to two Boston-based investment managers: Eaton & Howard, formed in 1924, and Vance, Sanders & Company, organized in 1934. Eaton & Howard, Vance Sanders, Inc. (renamed Eaton Vance Management, Inc. in June 1984 and reorganized as Eaton Vance Management in October 1990) was formed upon the acquisition of Eaton & Howard, Incorporated by Vance, Sanders & Company, Inc. on April 30, 1979. Following the 1979 merger of these predecessor organizations to form Eaton Vance, our managed assets consisted primarily of open-end mutual funds marketed to U.S. retail investors under the Eaton Vance brand and investment counsel services offered directly to high-net-worth and institutional investors. Over the ensuing years, we have expanded our investment offerings and distribution efforts to include closed-end, private and offshore funds, separately managed accounts offered through financial intermediaries, a broad array of investment strategies and services for institutional and high-net-worth investors, and multiple responsible investing options.

Our long-term growth strategy focuses on developing and growing market-leading investment franchises and expanding our distribution reach into new channels and geographic markets. Recent strategic acquisitions include our fiscal 2017 purchase of substantially all of the business assets of Calvert Investment Management, Inc. (Calvert Investments), Parametric’s fiscal 2013 purchase of The Clifton Group Investment Management Company (Clifton) and our fiscal 2012 purchase of a 49 percent interest in Hexavest.

In December 2016, we completed the purchase of substantially all of the business assets of Calvert Investments. Founded in 1976, Calvert Investments became a pioneer in responsible investing in 1982 by launching the first mutual fund to avoid investing in companies doing business in apartheid-era South Africa. At acquisition, Calvert had $11.9 billion of assets under management. Of this, $2.1 billion had previously been included in the Company’s consolidated managed assets because Atlanta Capital is sub-adviser to one of the Calvert-sponsored mutual funds (Calvert Funds). The total managed assets of Calvert, including assets sub-advised by other Eaton Vance affiliates, have grown to $19.8 billion at October 31, 2019. The 66 percent growth in Calvert’s managed assets since becoming a part of Eaton Vance in December 2016 reflects net inflows of $5.1 billion and market price appreciation of $2.7 billion.

The fiscal 2012 purchase of Clifton provided Parametric with a market-leading position in futures- and options-based portfolio implementation services and risk-management strategies. Managed assets of Parametric’s Clifton-sourced investment strategies and services have grown from $34.8 billion at purchase in December 2012 to $111.0 billion on October 31, 2019.

In fiscal 2012, we expanded our global equity offerings by acquiring a 49 percent interest in Hexavest, a Montreal-based investment adviser, and became Hexavest’s exclusive distribution partner in all markets outside Canada. Hexavest’s assets under management have grown from $11.0 billion at purchase in August 2012 to $13.4 billion on October 31, 2019.

In June 2019, we announced a strategic initiative involving our Parametric and Eaton Vance Management investment affiliates to further strengthen our leadership positions in rules-based, systematic investment strategies, customized individual separate accounts and wealth management solutions as discussed in greater detail in Current Developments under this Item 1 of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K. The internal change process supporting this initiative is targeted for completion in the first quarter of fiscal 2020.

Current Developments

We are currently pursuing four primary strategic priorities: (1) capitalizing on the near-term growth opportunities presented by our market-leading positions in customized individual separate accounts, responsible investing, specialty wealth management strategies and services, and the array of high-performing actively managed investment strategies we offer across asset classes and investment styles; (2) defending our floating-rate bank loan, global macro absolute return, systematic emerging market equity and closed-end fund businesses; (3) enhancing our competitive position by lowering operating costs, advancing our succession planning, developing new value-added investment offerings and opportunistically pursuing potential acquisitions; and (4) investing in the Company’s future by committing additional resources to building our technology and operating infrastructure, leadership and staff development, and diversity and inclusion strategies.

In fiscal 2019, we continued to experience strong growth in our customized, benchmark-based individual separate account offerings, which include Parametric Custom Core equity and Eaton Vance Management laddered municipal and corporate bond strategies. These market-leading offerings combine the benefits of benchmark-based investing with the ability to customize portfolios to meet individual preferences and needs. In fiscal 2019, net inflows into our customized, benchmark-based strategies offered as individual separate accounts totaled $15.3 billion, generating internal growth in managed assets of 18 percent. 

In June 2019, we announced a strategic initiative involving our Parametric and Eaton Vance Management affiliates to further strengthen our leadership positions in rules-based, systematic investment strategies, customized individual separate accounts and wealth management solutions. The three principal components of the initiative are: (1) rebranding Eaton Vance Management’s rules-based, systematic investment-grade fixed income strategies as Parametric and aligning internal reporting consistent with the revised branding; (2) combining the technology and operating platforms supporting the individual separately managed account businesses of Parametric and Eaton Vance Management; and (3) integrating the distribution teams serving Parametric and Eaton Vance Management clients and business partners in the registered investment advisor and multi-family office market. Through this strategic initiative, Parametric’s customized individual separate 

6


account offerings will expand to encompass a range of systematic fixed income strategies and maturity-based and liability-driven portfolio benchmarks. By expanding Parametric’s solution set and investing in technology to enhance client service and realize operating efficiencies and scale economies, we seek to further strengthen Parametric’s leadership position in the rapidly growing market for customized individual separate accounts. 

The Calvert Funds are one of the largest and most diversified families of responsibly invested mutual funds, encompassing actively and passively managed equity, fixed and floating-rate income, and multi-asset strategies managed in accordance with the Calvert Principles for Responsible Investment or other responsible investment criteria. Since Calvert became part of Eaton Vance in December 2016, we have experienced significant growth in Calvert-branded investment strategies and further distinguished Calvert as a leader in environmental, social and governance (ESG) research and responsible engagement. Including the Atlanta Capital-subadvised Calvert Equity Fund, assets under management in Calvert strategies grew to $19.8 billion at October 31, 2019 from $14.7 billion at October 31, 2018, reflecting net inflows of $3.7 billion and market price appreciation of $1.4 billion. Calvert’s $3.7 billion of net inflows in fiscal 2019 equates to internal growth in managed assets of 25 percent. 

While Calvert is the centerpiece of our responsible investment strategy, our commitment to responsible investing also encompasses our other investment affiliates. Eaton Vance Management and Atlanta Capital are increasingly utilizing Calvert’s proprietary ESG research as a component of their fundamental research processes, and portfolio customization to reflect individual client’s responsible investment criteria remains a central feature of Parametric separate account offerings. As of October 31, 2019, Parametric managed $23.7 billion of client assets based on client-specified responsible investment criteria. On an overall basis, Eaton Vance is one of the largest participants in responsible investing, a position we are committed to growing in conjunction with rising demand for investment strategies that incorporate ESG-integrated investment research and/or seek to achieve both favorable investment returns and positive societal impact.

Fiscal 2019 was a period of continuing strong investment performance across our principal investment affiliates. As of October 31, 2019, we sponsored 76 U.S. mutual funds with an overall Morningstar™ rating of four or five stars for at least one class of shares, including 32 five star-rated funds. As measured by total return net of expenses, at fiscal year-end 46 percent of our U.S. mutual fund assets ranked in the top quartile of their Morningstar peer groups over three years, 62 percent in the top quartile over five years and 58 percent in the top quartile over ten years. In the annual Barron’s/Lipper rankings of Best Mutual Fund Families for calendar 2018, Eaton Vance, Calvert and Parametric collectively ranked third overall among 57 fund families rated for one-year performance, 7th among 55 fund families based on five-year returns and 32nd among 49 families for ten-year performance. Among the active investment strategies we offer, notable high performers versus peers include: Atlanta Capital core and growth equities; Calvert growth, small-cap, emerging market and international equities; Eaton Vance Management balanced, core-plus bond, emerging market local income, floating-rate loan, global equity income, national municipal income and short-duration government income; and Parametric international equity. 

Demand for floating-rate loan strategies contracted in fiscal 2019 as investors responded to changing expectations for short-term interest rates in the U.S. and internationally. Our floating-rate income category moved from net inflows of $5.9 billion in fiscal 2018 to net outflows of $8.3 billion in fiscal 2019. During the fiscal year, our market share among bank loan mutual funds increased as the pace of industry net outflows exceeded our own. Recent Federal Reserve signaling of a stable near-term outlook for short-term interest rates suggests that bank loan fund flows may improve in 2020.

7


In our alternatives reporting category, fiscal 2019 net outflows of $3.9 billion were driven by $2.7 billion of net withdrawals from the two global macro absolute return mutual funds we offer in the U.S. and nearly $1.0 billion of net outflows from global macro institutional sub-advisory mandates. These strategies, which hold long and short positions in currency and short-duration sovereign debt instruments of emerging and frontier market countries, generated disappointing returns in calendar 2018 but rebounded to solid performance in 2019. Improved near-term performance coupled with generally muted return expectations for most traditional asset classes create an environment for potentially improved flows of our global macro absolute strategies in 2020.

In February 2019, Eaton Vance Management and related parties filed an application for exemptive relief with the SEC, seeking permission to offer exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that would employ a novel method of supporting efficient secondary market trading of their shares. Because disclosure of current holdings would not be required, the portfolio trading activity of ETFs utilizing the proposed method could remain confidential. Different from other proposed approaches to less-transparent ETFs that have recently received SEC exemptive relief, we believe our method should be broadly applicable across fund asset classes and can support efficient secondary market trading of fund shares in all market conditions. In conjunction with filing the exemptive application, we formed a new wholly-owned subsidiary, Advanced Fund Solutions, to manage the development and commercialization of ETFs utilizing this new method, for which the timing and likelihood of approval remains uncertain.

As discussed above, in June 2019 we announced a strategic initiative that includes combining the technology and operating infrastructure supporting the individual separately managed account businesses of Parametric and Eaton Vance Management into a single consolidated platform. The combination is geared towards achieving higher levels of client service, operating efficiencies and scale economies.

Open-end Funds
As of October 31, 2019, our open-end fund lineup included equity funds, floating-rate bank loan funds, taxable fixed income funds, state and national municipal income funds, alternative funds and multi-asset funds sold to U.S. and non-U.S. investors.

Our family of equity funds includes a broad range of fundamental active and systematic strategies in a variety of equity styles and market caps, managed both with and without consideration of shareholder tax effects, as well as Calvert-sponsored index funds. Assets under management in active equity funds managed for pre-tax returns and after-tax returns and equity index funds totaled $39.0 billion, $6.7 billion and $3.2 billion, respectively, on October 31, 2019.

Since introducing our first floating-rate bank loan fund in 1989, we have consistently ranked as one of the largest managers of retail bank loan funds. Assets under management in open-end floating-rate bank loan funds totaled $18.2 billion on October 31, 2019.

Our taxable fixed income funds cover a broad range of fixed income asset classes, including mortgage-backed securities, high-yield bonds, emerging market bonds, investment-grade bonds, short- and ultra-short duration income, and cash instruments. Assets under management in open-end taxable income funds totaled $21.7 billion on October 31, 2019.

Our family of municipal income mutual funds is one of the broadest in the industry, with 13 national and 17 state-specific funds in 16 different states. As of October 31, 2019, we managed $12.4 billion in open-end municipal income fund assets. 

11

As of October 31, 2019, 76 Eaton Vance-, Calvert- and Parametric-branded mutual funds offered in the U.S. were rated 4 or 5 stars by Morningstar for at least one class of shares, including 32 five-star rated funds. A good source of performance-related information for our funds is their websites, available at www.eatonvance.com and www.calvert.com. Information on these websites is not incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K. On our funds’ websites, investors can also obtain other current information about our funds, including investment objective and principal investment policies, portfolio characteristics, expenses and Morningstar ratings. 

Closed-end Funds
Our family of closed-end funds includes national and state-specific municipal bond, domestic and global equity, bank loan, multi-sector income and taxable income funds, three of which are term trusts. As of October 31, 2019, we managed $24.3 billion in closed-end fund assets, ranking as the third-largest manager of U.S. exchange-listed closed-end funds, according to Strategic Insight, a fund industry data provider.
Private Funds
Our private fund category consists primarily of privately offered equity funds designed to meet the diversification and tax-management needs of qualifying high-net-worth investors. We are recognized as a market leader for these types of funds, which had $26.3 billion of assets under management as of October 31, 2019. Also included in private funds are a range of equity, floating-rate income, fixed income and alternative funds offered primarily to institutional investors. Assets under management in these funds totaled $16.3 billion as of October 31, 2019. CLO entity assets included in the private fund category totaled $2.2 billion at October 31, 2019. 
Institutional Separate Accounts
We serve a broad range of clients in the institutional marketplace, both in the U.S. and internationally, including government, corporate and union retirement plans, endowments and foundations, nuclear decommissioning trusts, asbestos litigation trusts, sovereign wealth funds and investment funds sponsored by others for which we serve as a sub-adviser. Our diversity of capabilities allows us to offer domestic and international institutional investors a broad spectrum of equity, fixed and floating-rate income, alternative and multi-asset strategies, as well as portfolio implementation and exposure management services.

We have used EVTC, a non-depository trust company, as a platform to launch a series of commingled funds tailored to meet the needs of smaller institutional clients. EVTC also affords us the opportunity to participate in qualified plan commingled investment platforms offered in the broker-dealer channel. In addition to 

12


investment management services, EVTC provides certain custody services and has obtained regulatory approval to provide institutional trustee services.

Institutional separate account assets under management totaled $173.3 billion at October 31, 2019.

Individual Separate Accounts 
In fiscal 2019, we modified our reporting of assets and flows to combine the former retail managed account and high-net-worth separate account categories into a single individual separate account reporting category. 
Retail managed accounts are individual separately managed accounts offered through intermediary distribution platforms. We currently participate in over 50 managed account programs sponsored by broker-dealers. According to a report from the Money Management Institute and Cerulli Associates, as of year-end 2018 we were the largest manager of individual managed accounts offered through intermediary platforms in the U.S.

Our individual separately managed account assets consist primarily of Parametric Custom Core equity and Eaton Vance Management laddered municipal bond and corporate bond portfolios, which had assets under management of $80.4 billion and $31.5 billion, respectively, as of October 31, 2019. These market-leading offerings combine the benefits of benchmark-based investing with the ability to customize portfolios to meet individual preferences and needs. In fiscal 2019, we extended available customization for our laddered municipal bond and corporate bond separate account offerings to include systematic, year-round tax-loss harvesting, a key feature of Parametric Custom Core equity separate accounts.

Through EVIC, we offer personalized wealth management services to high-net-worth individuals and families. EVIC investment counselors work directly with clients to establish long-term financial programs and implement strategies designed to achieve their objectives. The Company has been in this business since the founding of our predecessor Eaton and Howard in 1924.

Individual separate account assets under management totaled $150.0 billion at October 31, 2019.

Investment Management and Related Services

Our direct and indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries Eaton Vance Management and BMR are investment advisers to Eaton Vance- and Parametric-branded funds, and Calvert is investment adviser to the Calvert funds. Although the specifics of our fund advisory agreements vary, the basic terms are similar. Pursuant to the advisory agreements, Eaton Vance Management, BMR or Calvert provides overall investment management services to each internally advised fund, subject, in the case of funds that are registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (1940 Act) (Registered Funds), to the supervision of each fund’s board of trustees or directors (together, trustees) in accordance with the fund’s investment objectives and policies. Parametric, Atlanta Capital, Hexavest and unaffiliated advisory firms act as sub-adviser to Eaton Vance Management, BMR or Calvert for certain funds. 

Eaton Vance Management provides administrative services, including personnel and facilities, necessary for the operation of all Eaton Vance- and Parametric-branded funds, and Calvert provides such services for the Calvert funds, subject to the oversight of each fund’s board of trustees. For certain funds, administrative services are provided under comprehensive management agreements that also include investment advisory services; other funds have separate administrative services agreements. Administrative services include recordkeeping, preparing and filing documents required to comply with federal and state securities laws, routine legal, fund administration and compliance services, supervising the activities of the funds’ custodians

13


and transfer agents, providing assistance in connection with the funds’ shareholder meetings and other administrative services, including providing office space and office facilities, equipment and personnel that may be necessary for administering the business affairs of the funds. Each agreement remains in effect indefinitely, subject to, in the case of Registered Funds, annual approval by each fund’s board of trustees. The funds generally bear all expenses associated with their operation and the issuance and redemption or repurchase of their securities, except for the compensation of trustees and officers of the fund who are employed by us. For certain sponsored funds, Eaton Vance Management, BMR or Calvert waives a portion of its management fee and/or has agreed to reimburse some expenses of the fund.

For Registered Funds, a majority of the independent trustees (i.e., those unaffiliated with the fund, its investment adviser and otherwise not an interested person under the 1940 Act) must approve the continuation of investment advisory and administrative agreements annually. The fund trustees generally may terminate these agreements upon 30 to 60 days’ notice without penalty. Shareholders of Registered Funds generally must approve amendments to the investment advisory agreements.

Eaton Vance Management, Calvert, EVTC and EVIC each has entered into an investment advisory agreement with the Gift Trust and/or related entities. The Gift Trust has a distribution agreement with EVD that compensates EVD for certain fundraising and servicing activities. EVTC also serves as trustee of the Gift Trust and related entities.

Either Eaton Vance Management, Parametric, Atlanta Capital, Calvert, BMR or EVIC has entered into an investment advisory agreement for each separately managed account that sets forth the account’s investment objectives and fee schedule, and provides for management of assets in the account in accordance with the stated investment objectives. Our separate account portfolio managers may assist clients in formulating investment strategies. 

EVTC is trustee of each collective investment trust we sponsor. As trustee, EVTC is responsible for designing and implementing each trust’s investment program or overseeing sub-advisers engaged to manage the trust’s investment portfolio. EVTC also provides certain administrative and accounting services to each trust. For services provided under each trust’s declaration of trust, EVTC receives a monthly fee based on the average daily net assets of the trust.

Investment counselors and separate account portfolio managers employed by our subsidiaries make investment decisions for the separate accounts we manage, tailoring portfolios to the needs of particular clients. We generally receive investment advisory fees for separate accounts quarterly, based on the value of the assets managed on a particular date, such as the first or last calendar day of a quarter, or, in some cases, on the average assets for the period. These advisory contracts are generally terminable upon 30 to 60 days’ notice without penalty.

Marketing and Distribution

We market and distribute shares of Eaton Vance-, Parametric- and Calvert-branded funds domestically through EVD. EVD generally sells fund shares through a network of financial intermediaries, including national and regional broker-dealers, banks, registered investment advisers, insurance companies and financial planning firms. The Eaton Vance International (Ireland) Funds are UCITS funds domiciled in Ireland and sold by EVMI through certain intermediaries and directly to investors who are citizens of the U.K., other member nations of the European Union (E.U.) and other countries outside the United States. The Eaton Vance International (Cayman Islands) Funds are Cayman Islands-domiciled funds sold by EVD and EVMI through intermediaries to non-U.S. investors.

Although the firms in our domestic retail distribution network have each entered into selling agreements with EVD, these agreements (which generally are terminable by either party) do not legally obligate the firms to sell any specific amount of our funds, investment strategies and services. EVD currently maintains a sales force of approximately 130 external and internal wholesalers who work closely with financial advisors in the retail distribution network to assist in placing Eaton Vance-, Parametric- and Calvert-branded funds.

Certain sponsored mutual funds have adopted distribution plans as permitted by the 1940 Act that provide for the fund to pay EVD distribution fees for the sale and distribution of shares and service fees for personal and/or shareholder account services (12b-1 fees). Each distribution plan with EVD for the Registered Funds is initially approved and its subsequent continuance must be approved annually by the board of trustees of the respective fund, including a majority of the independent trustees. 

EVD makes payments to financial intermediaries that provide marketing support, shareholder recordkeeping and transaction processing, and/or administrative services to the Eaton Vance-, Parametric- and Calvert-branded mutual funds. Payments are typically based on fund net assets, fund sales and/or number of accounts attributable to that financial intermediary. Registered Funds may pay all or a portion of shareholder recordkeeping and transaction processing and/or administrative services provided to their shareholders. Financial intermediaries also may receive payments from EVD in connection with educational or due diligence meetings that include information concerning funds and accounts we manage. 

EVD currently sells Eaton Vance-, Parametric- and Calvert-branded mutual funds under six primary pricing structures: front-end load commission (Class A); level-load commission (Class C); Calvert variable product 

15


pricing (Class F); institutional no-load (Class I, Class R6, and Institutional Class, referred to herein as Class I); retail no-load (Investor Class and Advisers Class, referred to herein as Class N); and retirement plan level-load (Class R). 

For Class A shares, the shareholder may be required to pay a sales charge to the selling broker-dealer of up to five percent and an underwriting commission to EVD of up to 75 basis points of the gross value of the shares sold. Under certain conditions, funds waive the sales load on Class A shares and the shares are sold at net asset value. EVD generally receives (and then pays to authorized firms after one year) a distribution and service fee of up to 30 basis points annually of average net assets of Class A shares outstanding. In recent years, most of our sales of Class A shares have been made on a load-waived basis through fee-based programs. EVD does not receive underwriting commissions on such sales. 

For Class C shares, the shareholder pays no front-end commissions but may be subject to a contingent deferred sales charge on redemptions made within the first 12 months of purchase. EVD pays a commission and the projected first-year service fees to the selling broker-dealer at the time of sale. The fund makes monthly distribution plan and service fee payments to EVD at an annual rate of up to 75 basis points and 25 basis points, respectively, of average net assets of the Class. EVD retains the distribution and service fees paid to EVD for the first 12 months and pays the distribution and service fees to the selling broker-dealer after one year. 

Class F shares of Calvert variable products are offered at net asset value and are not subject to any sales charges. EVD receives, and then generally pays to selling broker-dealers, distribution fees of up to 25 basis points of average daily net assets annually. 

Class I shares are offered at net asset value and are not subject to any sales charges, underwriter commissions, distribution fees or service fees. For designated Class I shares, a minimum investment of $250,000 or higher is normally required. Designated Institutional Class shares are normally subject to a minimum investment of $50,000. Sales of R6 shares are limited to participating retirement plans and certain other investors.

Class N shares are offered at net asset value and are not subject to any sales charges or underwriter commissions. EVD receives (and then generally pays to selling broker-dealers after one year) combined distribution and service fees of 25 basis points of average net assets annually. 

Class R shares are offered to retirement accounts at net asset value with no front-end sales charge. The Company receives, and then generally pays to selling broker-dealers, distribution fees of 25 basis points and service fees of 25 basis points of average net assets annually. 

We also sponsor unregistered equity funds that are privately placed by EVD, as placement agent, and by various financial intermediaries to whom EVD and the subscribing shareholders may make sales commission payments. The privately placed equity funds are managed by Eaton Vance Management and BMR.

The marketing and distribution of investment strategies to institutional clients is subsidiary-specific. Eaton Vance Management has institutional sales, consultant relations and client service teams dedicated to supporting the U.S. marketing and sales of strategies managed by Eaton Vance Management, Calvert and Hexavest. Hexavest maintains its own marketing and distribution team to service institutional clients in Canada. Parametric and Atlanta Capital each maintain separate marketing and distribution teams to sell their respective investment strategies to U.S.-based institutions. EVMI is otherwise responsible for the institutional

16


marketing and distribution of all Eaton Vance Management-, Parametric-, Atlanta Capital-, Calvert- and Hexavest-advised strategies to institutions outside of North America. 

In June 2019, we announced a strategic initiative involving our Parametric and Eaton Vance Management affiliates to further strengthen our leadership positions in rules-based, systematic investment strategies, customized individual separate accounts and wealth management solutions. As part of this initiative, we are combining the distribution teams serving Parametric and Eaton Vance Management clients and business partners in the registered investment advisor and multi-family office market. The combined team will support the sales and servicing of all of our investment strategies in this channel. 

During the fiscal year ended October 31, 2019, we did not have any customers that provided over 10 percent of our total revenue.

Regulation

Eaton Vance Management, Parametric, Atlanta Capital, Calvert, BMR, EVIC, EVMI and EVAIL are each registered with the SEC under the Advisers Act. The Advisers Act imposes numerous obligations on registered investment advisers, including fiduciary duties, recordkeeping requirements, operational requirements and disclosure obligations. Most Eaton Vance-, Parametric- and Calvert-branded funds are registered with the SEC under the 1940 Act. The 1940 Act imposes additional obligations on fund advisers, including governance, compliance, reporting and fiduciary obligations relating to the management of funds. Except for privately offered funds and exchange-listed funds exempt from registration, each U.S. fund is also required to make notice filings with most states and U.S. territories where it is offered for sale. Virtually all aspects of our investment management business in the U.S. are subject to various federal and state laws and regulations. These laws and regulations are primarily intended to benefit shareholders of the funds and separate account clients, and generally grant supervisory agencies and bodies broad administrative powers, including the power to limit or restrict us from carrying on our investment management business in the event we fail to comply with such laws and regulations. In such event, the possible sanctions that may be imposed include the suspension of individual employees, limitations on Eaton Vance Management, Parametric, Atlanta Capital, Calvert, BMR, EVIC, EVMI and EVAIL engaging in the investment management business for specified periods of time, the revocation of any such company’s registration as an investment adviser and other censures or fines.

Under a final rule and interpretive guidance issued by the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) in April 2012, certain non-bank financial companies have been designated for the Federal Reserve’s supervision as systemically important financial institutions (SIFIs). Additional non-bank financial companies, which may include large asset management companies such as us, may be designated as SIFIs in the future. If the Company were designated a SIFI, it would be subject to enhanced prudential measures, which could include capital and liquidity requirements, leverage limits, enhanced public disclosures and risk management requirements, annual stress testing by the Federal Reserve, credit exposure and concentration limits, supervisory and other requirements. These heightened regulatory obligations could, individually or in the aggregate, adversely affect our business and operations. 

Eaton Vance Management, Parametric and BMR are registered with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and the National Futures Association (NFA) as Commodity Pool Operators and Commodity Trading Advisors; other subsidiaries of the Company claim exemptions from registration. In 2013, the CFTC adopted rules for operators of registered mutual funds that are subject to registration as Commodity Pool Operators, generally allowing such funds to comply with SEC disclosure, reporting and recordkeeping rules as the means of complying with CFTC’s similar requirements. These CFTC rules do not, however, relieve

17


registered Commodity Pool Operators from compliance with applicable anti-fraud provisions and certain performance reporting and recordkeeping requirements. We may incur ongoing costs associated with monitoring compliance with these requirements, including, but not limited to, CFTC and NFA registration and exemption obligations and the periodic reporting requirements of Commodity Pool Operators and Commodity Trading Advisors.

Our mutual funds, privately offered funds and separate accounts that trade CFTC-regulated instruments are also regulated by the CFTC. In the event that Eaton Vance Management, Parametric or BMR fails to comply with applicable requirements, the CFTC may suspend or revoke its registration, prohibit it from trading or doing business with registered entities, impose civil penalties, require restitution and seek fines or imprisonment for criminal violations. In the event that clients on whose behalf we trade CFTC-regulated instruments fail to comply with requirements applicable to their trading, they would be subject to the foregoing remedies excluding suspension of license (provided they are not registered). In addition, to the extent any of the entities trade on a futures exchange or Swap Execution Facility, they would be subject to possible sanction for any violation of the facility’s rules. 

EVTC is registered as a non-depository Maine Trust Company and is subject to regulation by the State of Maine Bureau of Financial Institutions (Bureau of Financial Institutions). EVTC is subject to certain capital requirements, as determined by the Examination Division of the Bureau of Financial Institutions. At periodic intervals, regulators from the Bureau of Financial Institutions examine the Company’s and EVTC’s financial condition as part of their legally prescribed oversight function. There were no violations by EVTC of these capital requirements in fiscal 2019 or prior years. 

EVD is registered as a broker-dealer under the Exchange Act and is subject to regulation by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), the SEC and other federal and state agencies. EVD is subject to the SEC’s net capital rule designed to enforce minimum standards regarding the general financial condition and liquidity of broker-dealers. Under certain circumstances, this rule may limit our ability to make withdrawals of capital and receive dividends from EVD. EVD’s regulatory net capital consistently exceeded minimum net capital requirements during fiscal 2019. The securities industry is one of the most highly regulated in the United States, and failure to comply with related laws and regulations can result in the revocation of broker-dealer licenses, the imposition of censures or fines, and the suspension or expulsion from the securities business of a firm, its officers or employees.

EVMI is regulated in the U.K. by the FCA as an authorized firm under a Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID) license to conduct regulated business. EVMI’s primary business purpose is to distribute investment strategies and services in Europe and other non-U.S. markets. Under the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (FSMA), EVMI is subject to certain liquidity and capital requirements. Such requirements may limit our ability to make withdrawals of capital from EVMI. In addition, failure to comply with such requirements could jeopardize EVMI’s approval to conduct business in the U.K. There were no violations by EVMI of the liquidity and capital requirements in fiscal 2019 or prior years.

EVAIL is regulated by the FCA as a Full Scope Alternative Investment Fund Manager. EVAIL’s primary business is conducting discretionary investment management services. Under FSMA, EVAIL is subject to certain liquidity and capital requirements, which may limit our ability to make withdrawals of capital from EVAIL. Failure to comply with such requirements could jeopardize EVAIL’s approval to conduct business in the U.K. There were no violations by EVAIL of the liquidity and capital requirements in fiscal 2019 or prior years.

18


EVGA is regulated by the Central Bank of Ireland as a UCITS Management Company with Individual Portfolio Management permissions. EVGA’s primary business purpose is to provide management services to EV UCITS Funds and U.S.-domiciled accounts via Memorandum of Understanding as a Participating Affiliate. EVGA is subject to certain liquidity and capital requirements, which may limit our ability to make withdrawals of capital from EVGA. There were no violations by EVGA of the liquidity and capital requirements in fiscal 2019 or prior years.

EVMIA is regulated in Singapore by the MAS. EVMIA’s primary business purpose is to conduct investment management activities and distribute investment strategies. Under MAS, EVMIA is subject to certain liquidity and capital requirements, which may limit our ability to make withdrawals of capital from EVMIA. There were no violations by EVMIA of the liquidity and capital requirements in fiscal 2019 or prior years. 

Our officers, directors and employees may from time to time own securities that are held by one or more of the funds and separate accounts we manage. Our internal policies with respect to individual investments by investment professionals and other employees with access to investment information require prior clearance of most types of transactions and reporting of all securities transactions, and restrict certain transactions to seek to avoid possible conflicts of interest. All employees are required to comply with all prospectus restrictions and limitations on purchases, sales or exchanges of shares of our mutual funds, and to pre-clear purchases and sales of shares of our closed-end funds.

Competition

The investment management business is a highly competitive global industry. We are subject to substantial competition in each of our principal investment classifications and distribution channels. There are few barriers to entry for new firms, and consolidation within the industry continues to alter the competitive landscape. According to the Investment Company Institute, there were approximately 850 fund sponsors at the end of calendar 2018 that competed in the U.S. mutual fund market. We compete with these firms, many of which have substantially greater resources, on the basis of investment performance, diversity of offered strategies, distribution capability, scope and quality of service, fees charged, reputation and the ability to develop new investment strategies and services to meet the changing needs of investors.

In recent years, investor demand for passive investment strategies, such as those employed by index mutual funds and index ETFs, has outpaced the demand for higher-fee actively managed investment strategies. Across many asset classes, actively managed strategies as a whole are experiencing net outflows. While our suite of customized, benchmark-based separate account offerings is positioned to benefit from market demand for passive investment strategies, a large majority of our management fee revenue is derived from active strategies. The continuing shift in market demand toward index funds and other passive strategies reduces opportunities for active managers and may accelerate fee compression.

In the retail fund channel, we compete with other mutual fund management, distribution and service companies that distribute through affiliated and unaffiliated sales forces, broker-dealers and direct sales to the public. According to the Investment Company Institute, at the end of calendar 2018 there were over 10,000 registered open-end funds whose shares were being offered to the public in the U.S. We rely primarily on intermediaries to distribute our funds, and pursue sales relationships with all types of intermediaries to broaden our distribution network. A failure to maintain strong relationships with intermediaries that distribute our funds could adversely affect our gross and net sales, assets under management, revenue and financial condition. 

19


We are also subject to substantial competition from other investment management firms in separate account channels. Financial intermediaries sponsoring managed account programs generally limit the number of approved managers within their programs, and firms compete based on investment performance and other considerations to win and maintain positions in these programs. For institutional separate accounts, we compete with other investment management firms based on the breadth of investment strategies and services offered, investment performance, strength of reputation, price and the scope and quality of client service.

Human Capital

On October 31, 2019, we and our wholly- and majority-owned subsidiaries had 1,871 full-time and part-time employees. On October 31, 2018, the comparable number was 1,764. 

We focus on attracting, developing and retaining a team of highly talented and motivated employees. We conduct regular assessments of our compensation and benefit practices and pay levels to ensure that staff members are compensated fairly and competitively. We devote extensive resources to staff training and development, including tuition assistance for career-enhancing academic and professional programs. We sponsor a year-long leadership development program for managers identified as high-potential future leaders. Individual goals are set annually for each employee, and attainment of those goals is an element of the employee’s performance assessment. We recognize that the success of our Company is based on the talents and dedication of those we employ, and we are highly invested in their success.
