Item 1. BUSINESS
Overview
 
We have been recognized as an award-winning feature film and television specials production company. Through recent corporate restructurings, as discussed herein, we have re-oriented to the technology side of the burgeoning Augmented Reality (“AR”) and Virtual Reality (“VR”) markets.
 
We acquired a wholly owned subsidiary, Recall Studios, Inc., in July 2016 (“Recall Studios”). Using Recall Studios’ talent and technology, we focus on advancing VR and AR technologies and have two patents pending to create content and immersive, non-liner experiences, filling the demand attendant to the increased production of VR viewing devices absent a corresponding increase in content production.
 
Our Business
 
Recall Studios is the future of new media, entertainment and technology. With proprietary technologies (two patents pending) that are redefining media consumption, Recall Studios is focused on creating disruptive software that elevates the way consumers interact with content. It is prepared to go to market with three state of the art Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality and New Media applications that are built and ready for consumers. In this increasingly disconnected world, Recall Studios brings the future to the people and the people to each other.
 
The team, led by seasoned entertainment and technology executives, is committed to achieving significant growth through acquisitions and production. Recall Studios is at the forefront of new media focusing specifically on bringing Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality to the masses. Recall Studios operates at the convergence of the newest technologies that are defining the future of media.
 
Facebook, Google and Microsoft, among others, are betting that the billions they have spent developing Virtual Reality and Augmented Reality hardware will usher in a new era of information conveyance. Initially focused on gaming to drive unit sales, these hardware side companies are now clamoring for more Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality content. In the past, conversion software and editing software has closely followed each step in progressive New Media technologies. Recall Studios has anticipated, and met, this demand with the creation of its conversion and editing tools, allowing front facing consumers the opportunity to convert traditional 2d videos into Virtual Reality and allowing them to further edit their Virtual Reality creations. We are unaware of any similar products by competitors which have overcome the substantial engineering issues that we have.
 
Experienced at developing immersive narratives across multiple platforms, Recall’s executive team is well positioned to capitalize on the dearth of Virtual Reality content. To secure all of our intellectual property and bring our products to market, we are now seeking $2,000,000.
 
The Growing New Media Market
 
New Media is broadly defined as the interplay between technology, images and sound. Encompassing digital content and platform delivery, Virtual Reality is one form of New Media, and is the fastest growing segment. A quantitative analysis of the market reveals that it is, today, a multi-billion dollar industry even in its nascent form. Multiple sources project a multi-trillion dollar industry in the near term. Facebook paid $2 billion for Oculus Rift, maker of Virtual Reality viewing devices and Google invested approximately $600 million into Magic Leap, with Microsoft developing its own Augmented Reality device, the HoloLens. Coca Cola and McDonalds have quickly moved to make their packaging moldable into cardboard holders for smart phones that will be able to project Virtual Reality images directly to the retina.
 
Gaming currently fills the void left by media production companies. Indeed, it is the video game industry that quickly adapted to the New Media and alongside newly created eSports leagues, like the increasingly popular Major League Gaming, video games are poised to most quickly

capitalize on Virtual Reality’s initial growth. The film and television industry has yet to discover how best to capitalize on the billions of dollars being poured into Virtual Reality viewer development and marketing. Based on our research, Recall Studios is the first to commence development of an immersive viewing experience for feature length and episodic Virtual Reality stories beyond mere 10 minute vignettes.
 
Like the printing press, radio, television and internet, these Fortune 50 companies believe Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality is the newest platform and they are working hard to bring their ideals to fruition. These companies are focused on the hardware side of Virtual Reality. The other side of the equation is the necessity for content. Few companies have entered this space and traditional companies married to outdated business models are unable to meet the demand. Recall Studios is well positioned to do so.
 
What’s Old Is New Again
 
Capitalizing on the popularity of “choose your own ending” story-telling, Recall Studios has developed a new approach to Virtual Reality media production. While other content creators are finding it difficult to assimilate new media technology into their storytelling, getting lost in gimmicks and trickery, Recall Studios has commenced creation of plot lines amenable to Virtual Reality’s strengths. The Recall Storytm is written from a second-person point of view, with the primary viewer assuming the role of the protagonist, making outcome determinative choices. The primary viewer becomes a spy, a mountain climber, a tight rope walker, a soldier, an astronaut or a private detective searching through a multi-faceted universe. Friends watch immersively as the primary viewer chooses which way to go, which door to open and whether to fight or flee. Each action unlocks different plot lines and endings. Like the “choose your own ending” stories so popular in the mid 20th Century, the Recall Storytm may be watched over and over, with alternate viewers making the choices leading to myriad endings. Visual cues, like a person gesticulating wildly and asking the viewer to look up, will help drive the story. It is truly an amalgam of the newest technology with an old form of storytelling.
 
Recall Studios has an agreement in principle with a leading game designer to co-develop a game utilizing the technologies developed by both companies.
 
Recall Studios’ Technology
 
Recall Studios is building software that will redefine the way people interact with each other and media. The Company is in development of a suite of VR and AR products that will connect people in a way never before experienced.
 
Facetime, Skype, and Google Hangouts bridged distances using traditional recording techniques and sculpted a new way to interact with family, friends and colleagues. Recall is developing proprietary software that will allow you to be present in your family’s life even when you are thousands of miles from home.
 
Imagine you are away on a business trip.
 
What if your daughter could still see you across the dinner table at home telling her about your day and how much you love her?
 
Perhaps your children are tucked in for the night and they see you sitting on the edge of the bed reading them a goodnight story from across the globe.
 
You can even play hide and seek with your kids and they can see your reaction when they find you hiding behind the sofa in your living room.
 
Recall’s proprietary AR software makes all of this a reality.
 
Now imagine that you are at work while your child takes his first steps. Seeing the video on your phone will never be the same as being there in person.

With Remmersiontm you can experience this moment as if you were there, by converting the video your wife filmed with her iPhone into an immersive, headset ready, VR experience without the need for any specialized camera. Finally, imagine you are on a helipad in Dubai, a deep cover agent looks to you and asks what’s the next move partner, do we jump for the helicopter, or dig in and fight our way out? The fate of the mission is in your hands. You tell him let’s jump for it. He nods in cocky agreement and runs to the edge of the skyscraper and jumps. A gust of wind blows the helicopter off course and you see him plummet to the ground below....bad choice, but it was YOUR choice. The agent doesn’t make it, but this is VR so you get to try again.
 
The Recall Generator makes this possible. Our patent pending VR editing environment and accompanying mobile app allows users to create, edit and view voice activated ‘Choose Your Own Adventure’ experiences with the ease of drag, drop, and share. Creators can even see analytics on the viewers and what choices they made.
 
All of Recall Studios’ VR and AR software is designed to be easy to use so that anyone can create, edit and view unique experiences. Recall brings the empathetic power of immersive media to anyone with a smartphone.
 
Virtual Reality and Augmented Reality are changing the world; Recall Studios is changing the way we interact with it.
 
The Company is targeting primarily the private consumer market. Most companies in the industry are focused on software and hardware out of reach for the average consumer both in cost and complexity. Recall will bring virtual reality to the masses. Anyone with a smartphone will be able to create their own immersive stories.
 
The Board of Directors has taken the decision to take the Company to the next level based on a strong demand for its products and the products’ technological maturity.
 
The Company is raising funds to stay ahead of the competition, secure its intellectual property and bring its products to market.
 
Recall has two proprietary technologies that are patent pending but expects to secure additional intellectual property.
 
On June 15, 2017, the Company entered into a Purchase and Sale Agreement with Metropolitan Sound + Vision LLC (“Metro”). Pursuant to the agreement, the Company agreed to sell to Metro all of the shares of common stock of S&G Holdings, Inc., d/b/a High Five, owned by the Company, which shares constitute 75% of High Five’s issued and outstanding shares. Pursuant to current accounting guidelines, the business component is reported as discontinued operations.
 
Pursuant to the Metro agreement, at the closing of the High Five sale, the Company delivered to Metro 100% of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock of High Five owned by the Company, and Metro was required to pay for such stock as follows: (i) $10,000 in cash at closing, and (ii) at the end of each fiscal quarter, beginning at the end the third fiscal quarter of 2017, 5% of gross revenues collected during the quarter by Metro via the exploitation of High Five’s assets, up to a lifetime maximum of $590,000.
 
The Metro agreement requires Metro to use its best professional efforts to generate revenue from the exploitation of High Five’s assets, and if the Company has not received a total of at least $265,000 of the $590,000 lifetime maximum purchase price from Metro before July 1, 2022, the Company has the right to repurchase the stock and assets of the S&G from Metro for $10,000.
 
Recall Studios
 
Through Recall Studios, we create VR / AR content and technologies, and have developed (patent pending) non-linear consumer-based editing software. The Recall Studios acquisition was a related party transaction due to the common ownership interest by Alexander Bafer, who was then the Company’s Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chief Development Officer. Mr. Bafer now serves as the Company’s Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer.

We acquired Recall Studios in July 2016. Founded by business, media and entertainment industry leaders to meet growing demand for VR and AR content, Recall Studios operates within the convergence of immersive content and software. Recall Studios will allow consumers to create and share interactive experiences across all platforms. Combining modern business strategy with industry experience by bringing together highly trained relative newcomers and entertainment industry stalwarts to create low risk, high profit and artistically acclaimed feature film VR and television projects, the Company and its subsidiaries are analyzing profitability across myriad entertainment sectors. We believe that Recall Studios is the future of new media entertainment and technology.
 
New media is a multi-billion-dollar industry even in its nascent form. Demand for VR and mixed media content is growing rapidly. Experienced at developing immersive narratives and software, we believe that Recall Studios’ team is positioned to capitalize on the absence of high quality consumer VR experiences and software.
 
Management
 
The business side of our management team is disciplined in financial risk mitigation techniques. Aside from the commercialization of our management team’s past successes, which cannot in themselves necessarily predict future success, we are experienced at balancing projects, budgets and growth to effectively manage risk in light of our business objectives.
Competition
 
We don’t believe that any company has emerged as the leader in either VR production or technologies that allow consumers to edit, create, and distribute interactive VR content. Recall Studios’ competition is limited as we do not believe that there are any companies actively providing non-linear, interactive VR software/platform solutions for consumers.
Employees
 
As of April 16, 2018, we had four full-time employees and utilize independent contractors to fulfill our programming, coding and business development efforts. none of our employees is represented by a union. We consider our relations with our employees to be good.

On July 19, 2017, the Company entered into a Trademark Assignment and Settlement Agreement (the “Studiocanal Agreement”) with STUDIOCANAL, a Société anonyme of France (“STUDIOCANAL”).
 
A dispute had previously arisen between STUDIOCANAL and the Company in relation to the trademark for “CAROLCO” obtained by Brick Top Productions, Inc., an affiliate of the Company. Pursuant to the Studiocanal Agreement, and in order to settle the dispute, the Company agreed to assign the “CAROLCO” trademark to STUDIOCANAL.
 
In connection therewith, on the same date as the execution of the Studiocanal Agreement, the Company and STUDIOCANAL executed the Trademark Assignment Recordal Form attached to the Studiocanal Agreement as Exhibit A. In consideration of the assignment, STUDIOCANAL agreed to pay the Company a one-time fee of $9,000 within 15 days of the execution of the Studiocanal Agreement.
 
Pursuant to the Studiocanal Agreement, the Company was required, within three business days following the receipt of the payment, to surrender the domain name http://www.carolcopictures.com/ to STUDIOCANAL with any future payments related to the domain name to be assumed by STUDIOCANAL. The payment is expected to be received in the time frame referenced above, at which point the domain name will be transferred to STUDIOCANAL.
 
As of the effective date of the Studiocanal Agreement, the Company agreed that it and its affiliates will cease producing and distributing television shows, movies or any other media under the CAROLCO mark or any mark confusingly similar to the CAROLCO mark. In addition, the Company agreed that, within 10 days of the date of the Studiocanal Agreement, the Company will initiate the process of changing its name. Upon completion of the required securities and corporate law actions in connection with the name change, but in no event more than 75 days after the date of the Studiocanal Agreement, unless such delay is caused by a regulatory agency and not the Company, the Company agreed to change its name to remove reference to CAROLCO, and will remove all mention of the CAROLCO name from its products, website, and all future corporate documents.
 
The Company also agreed to remove all images and titles of Carolco Pictures’ library films from its and its affiliates’ websites as of the effective date of the Studiocanal Agreement, that neither it nor any of its affiliates will ever use any images from or titles of works in the Carolco Pictures library in the future, that neither it nor any of its affiliates will use or apply for registration of any marks containing the term CAROLCO or variations thereof in connection with any entertainment-related products or services, and that the Company would not oppose or otherwise challenge STUDIOCANAL’s use of, trademark applications, or registrations for the CAROLCO mark, or any mark containing a variation of the term CAROLCO.
 
Under the Studiocanal Agreement, each party released the other party, its affiliates, subsidiaries, holding companies and other entities within its control, successors and assigns, and all officers, directors, employees, agents, representatives, third party vendors, insurers and attorneys, from any and all claims, causes of action or demands of any kind or nature whatsoever which arise from use of the CAROLCO marks in connection with entertainment-related products or services and which existed prior to the effective date of the Studiocanal Agreement.

The Note carries interest of 10% per year and is due and payable on September 18, 2018. The outstanding amounts under the Note are convertible, at the option of the holder, into shares of common stock of the Company (the “Common Stock”), at a conversion price of the lower of (i) the closing sale price of the Common Stock on the principal market on which the Common Stock trades, as of the trading day immediately preceding the issuance date of the Note, and (ii) 50% of either the lowest sale price for the Common Stock during the 25 consecutive trading days including and immediately preceding the conversion date, or the closing bid price, whichever is lower, provided, however, if the Company’s share price at any time loses the bid (e.g., $0.0001 on the ask with zero market makers on the bid on level 2), then the conversion price may, in the Holder’s sole and absolute discretion, be reduced to a fixed conversion price of $0.00001 (if lower than the conversion price otherwise). In addition, if, on the date of delivery of the conversion shares to the holder, or any date thereafter while conversion shares are held by the holder, the closing bid price per share of Common Stock is less than the sale price per share of Common Stock on the used to calculate the conversion price hereunder, then the conversion price will be automatically reduced to the lower price and the holder will be issued a number of additional shares such that the holder holds a number of shares of Common Stock based on such adjusted conversion price.
 
In certain circumstances, the holder may elect to use a conversion equal to the lower of (i) the closing sale price of the Common Stock on the trading day immediately preceding the issuance date of the Note and (ii) 50% of either the lowest sale price or the closing bid price, whichever is lower for the Common Stock during any trading day in which the default has not been cured. If the Common Stock is chilled for deposit at DTC while the Note is outstanding or outstanding or deposit or other additional fees are payable due to a Yield Sign, Stop Sign or other trading restrictions, or if the closing sale price at any time falls below $0.2826 (as adjusted for stock splits, stock dividends, stock contributions and similar events), then the 50% figure specified above will be reduced to 35%. In the event that the Common Stock issuable on conversion of the Note is not deliverable via DWAC following the conversion of any amount of the Note, an additional 5% discount will be attributed to the conversion price. Additionally, if the Company ceases to be a reporting company pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or if the Note cannot be converted into free trading shares after 181 days from the issuance date, an additional 15% discount will be attributed to the conversion price.
 
The issuance of the Note occurred on September 18, 2017.
