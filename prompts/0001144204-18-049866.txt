Item 1. Business.
Overview
 
iBio is a biotechnology company focused on the development and manufacture of biotherapeutics. We utilize our proprietary technologies and production facilities to provide product development and manufacturing services from the early stages of product selection through regulatory approval and commercial product launch to clients, collaborators and third-party customers as well as developing our own product candidates.
 
Our assets and capabilities include proprietary and transformative methods for the development, improvement, and production of biologics using hydroponically grown, transiently-transfected green plants. We harness the natural protein production capability plants use to sustain their own growth, and direct it, instead, to produce proteins for a range of applications including monoclonal antibodies, antibody drug conjugates, vaccines and biopharmaceutical intermediates, and also to create and produce proprietary derivatives of pre-existing products with improved properties. We and our collaborators have used our technologies successfully with a diverse range of product candidates including products against fibrotic diseases, vaccines, enzyme replacements, monoclonal antibodies, and recombinant versions of marketed products that are currently derived from human blood plasma. Our technologies have also been used to advance the development of certain products that have been commercially infeasible to develop with conventional technologies such as Chinese hamster ovary cell systems and microbial fermentation methods. We have also used our technologies to create and produce experimental, proprietary derivatives of pre-existing products with improved properties.
 
Our current business model is comprised of three key elements:
 
CDMO Facility Activities
 
This element involves the creation of a contract development and manufacturing organization to produce revenue through the provision of goods and services based on our technologies, facilities and capabilities. These activities are accomplished through the acquisition of control of the large manufacturing facility in Bryan, Texas controlled and operated by our subsidiary, iBio CDMO LLC (“iBio CDMO” or “CDMO”) (formerly known as iBio CMO, LLC) under capital lease. The facility includes pilot-scale operations, laboratories, independent technology, human resources and development and manufacturing facilities, large-scale automated hydroponic systems capable of growing over four million plants as “in process inventory” and delivering over 300 kilograms of therapeutic protein active pharmaceutical ingredient per year. The facility capacity can also be doubled by adding additional plant growth equipment in a space already available for that purpose.
 
We have integrated into our iBio CDMO operations the rights iBio has obtained to certain patented and unpatented technologies developed for it by Novici Biotech LLC (“Novici”), in addition to novel manufacturing methods and processes developed by iBio CDMO. These technologies, methods, and processes are applied by iBio CDMO to a variety of tasks performed for clients, collaborators, and for iBio itself, including product and process development, analytics, and manufacturing services.
 
iBio CDMO is promoting commercial collaborations with third parties on the basis of these technology advantages and plans to work with customers to achieve laboratory and pilot-scale technical milestones that can form the basis of longer-term manufacturing business arrangements.
 
Product Candidate Pipeline
 
This element enables the creation of opportunities for iBio to share in the successful development, advancement and commercialization of selected product candidates by our collaborators and licensees as well as advancing our own product candidates. We expect to accomplish this objective through both investments we make to acquire or develop our own proprietary product candidates and also by participating with select customers and collaborators in the value created through the development, with our technologies, and manufacture of their product candidates.  On an ongoing basis, we evaluate potential product candidate opportunities generally consisting of product candidates originating in academic institutions or corporate research programs to which iBio technologies can add further value.
 
With respect to the development and commercialization of our own product candidates, our current pipeline is comprised of proprietary candidates for the treatment of a range of fibrotic diseases including systemic scleroderma and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.

IBIO-CFB03, based on exclusively in-licensed university patents and newer patent applications filed by iBio, is our lead therapeutic candidate being advanced for Investigational New Drug (“IND”) development.
 
Our research and development activities are directed and led by our President and by our Chief Scientific Officer and are either performed internally by iBio CDMO or outsourced to a third party. Our research and development work allows us to develop our product candidates, promote both the value of such product candidates and our technologies for licensing and product development purposes and uncover and pursue other strategic opportunities.
 
Facility Design and Build-out / Technology Transfer
 
This element includes the design and development for others of facilities based on the utilization of iBio technologies and experience to create and operate manufacturing facilities at substantially lower capital and operating costs, along with the provision for commercial technology transfer.
 
Due to the lower capital and operating cost requirements for biopharmaceutical (both vaccines and therapeutics) production via iBio technologies versus legacy methods, certain corporations and governments that have not already established manufacturing capacity for biologic products are client prospects for both development and for commercial technology transfer services to enable autonomous manufacturing in the market being served.
 
In some cases, we have additional opportunities to increase the value of these uses of our technologies by offering custom facility design services.
 
We expect to provide services and participate in collaborative development programs with a diverse group of clients and collaborators to enable us to achieve positive cash flow from operations sufficient for use in developing our own product candidates and enabling us to participate in the success of selected products developed jointly with collaborators.
 
Fraunhofer
 
In 2003, we engaged the Fraunhofer organization (“Fraunhofer”), through its Fraunhofer Center for Molecular Biotechnology in Newark, Delaware, an unincorporated unit of Fraunhofer USA, Inc. operated as part of an institute of the German organization, the Fraunhofer Institute for Molecular Biology and Applied Ecology, as our outsourced research and development contractor. Fraunhofer was contractually obligated to provide research and development services in the field of plant-based gene expression and protein products exclusively pursuant to agreements with us and our predecessor companies through 2014, and to use commercially reasonable efforts to enhance, improve and expand the technology for us. With the structural foundation of Fraunhofer’s exclusive obligations to us, we established a business model that we expected to enlarge and broaden the scope of applications of our platform technology and enhance the value of our retained commercial rights by leveraging certain funding received by Fraunhofer from governmental entities, NGOs and other similar organizations. Fraunhofer was obligated to use its best efforts to obtain funding from governments and NGOs for continuing development of our technology and to support iBio’s efforts to commercialize its technology. Based on the Fraunhofer commitments, our business model and plan contemplated licensing our technology to third parties and collaborating with third-party licensees, with Fraunhofer’s assistance as our research and development contractor, for product development using our proprietary technology and the Fraunhofer organization and their pilot plant facilities in Newark, Delaware for production of pre-clinical and clinical materials required for product approvals.
 
In 2014, however, we discovered conduct by Fraunhofer we believed constituted breaches of our contracts and after efforts to amicably resolve these matters ended unsuccessfully, we initiated litigation against Fraunhofer based upon those discovered breaches. Fraunhofer also refused to conduct technology transfer in further breach of our contracts, for which we also sought relief in the lawsuit against Fraunhofer. As additional allegations of misconduct by Fraunhofer emerged, we sought, and were permitted by the Court in 2017, to amend the lawsuit to include claims of fraud, conversion of our property by Fraunhofer for its own benefit, and other state law claims.
 
Discovery of these matters and Fraunhofer’s continued unwillingness to provide access and perform technology transfer, despite resolution efforts both within and outside the confines of the litigation, required us to eventually adopt a new business model, as detailed above, that was not dependent on Fraunhofer and its services but rather would rely on our own manufacturing capabilities, together with access to and the use of other technology and other technology development capabilities independent of Fraunhofer. This new business plan is being accomplished, in part, by the acquisition of the large manufacturing facility now controlled and operated by our subsidiary, iBio CDMO LLC (“iBio CDMO” or “CDMO”) (formerly known as iBio CMO, LLC.), which includes human resources, laboratories, independent technology, and development and manufacturing facilities that enable us to develop and practice new plant-made biopharmaceutical technologies and self-develop experience without depending on Fraunhofer and without continuing to rely upon the earlier technologies covered by or relating to the patents filed and issued during the period of our contracts with Fraunhofer.
 
iBio and its contractors and collaborators have since been developing, acquiring and using new technology instead of the Fraunhofer-derived technology that we had originally intended to use for the development and production of therapeutic proteins and vaccines and other recombinant proteins using transient gene expression in green plants.

iBio has rights to novel manufacturing methods and processes developed by iBio CDMO, as well as to certain patented and unpatented technologies developed for iBio by Novici. iBio’s investment in the creation of these new inventions and novel processes is ongoing and has led to the implementation of the new business model, as detailed above, that is not dependent on further performance of Fraunhofer’s obligations to iBio.
 
We own the technology and issued patents in the field of plant-based gene expression and protein products developed pursuant to the agreements with Fraunhofer. Our investments in the work of our contractors, collaborators and iBio CDMO in non-Fraunhofer derived technologies is not due to any doubt about our ownership of the Fraunhofer derived technologies nor our freedom to operate under the Fraunhofer-derived patents.
 
 iBio CDMO
 
 On December 16, 2015, we formed iBio CDMO as a Delaware limited liability company to develop and manufacture plant-made pharmaceuticals. As of December 31, 2015, we owned 100% of iBio CDMO. On January 13, 2016, we entered into a contract manufacturing joint venture with an affiliate of Eastern Capital Limited (“Eastern”), a stockholder of the Company (the “Eastern Affiliate”). The Eastern Affiliate contributed $15 million in cash for a 30% interest in iBio CDMO. We retained a 70% interest in iBio CDMO and granted iBio CDMO a non-exclusive license to use our proprietary technologies for research purposes and an exclusive U.S. license for manufacturing purposes. We retained the exclusive right to grant product licenses to those who wish to sell or distribute products made using our technology. On February 23, 2017, the Company entered into an exchange agreement with the Eastern Affiliate, pursuant to which the Company acquired substantially all of the interest held by the Eastern Affiliate in iBio CDMO and issued one share of the Company’s iBio CMO Preferred Tracking Stock, par value $0.001 per share. After giving effect to the transaction, the Company owns 99.99% of iBio CDMO. See Note 11 in the consolidated financial statements for a further discussion.
 
 iBio CDMO’s operations take place in Bryan, Texas in a facility controlled by another affiliate of Eastern (the “Second Eastern Affiliate”) as sublandlord. The facility is a Class A life sciences building located on land owned by the Texas A&M system designed and equipped for plant-made manufacture of biopharmaceuticals. The Second Eastern Affiliate granted iBio CDMO a 34-year capital lease for the facility. Commercial activities commenced in January 2016 with the large majority of efforts directed towards recommissioning the facility to help meet cGMP manufacturing standards. iBio CDMO expects to operate on the basis of three parallel lines of business:
 
(1) Development and manufacturing of third-party products;
 
(2) Development and production of iBio’s proprietary product(s) for treatment of fibrotic diseases and/or other proprietary iBio products; and
 
(3) Commercial technology transfer services including facility design, as needed.
 
The facility houses laboratory and pilot-scale operations, as well as large-scale automated hydroponic systems capable of growing over four million plants as "in process inventory" and delivering over 300 kilograms of therapeutic protein pharmaceutical active ingredient per year. The facility capacity can be doubled by adding additional plant growth equipment in a space already available for that purpose.
 
iBio CDMO is promoting commercial collaborations with third parties on the basis of iBio’s technology advantages and the competitive efficiencies of its processes and plans to work with customers to achieve laboratory and pilot scale technical milestones that can form the basis of longer-term manufacturing business arrangements. iBio itself is a client of iBio CDMO for further IND advancement of its proprietary products beginning with IBIO-CFB03 for the treatment of a range of fibrotic diseases. Dependent upon the success of IND advancement, iBio will then work with iBio CDMO on the production of IBIO-CFB03 for clinical trials and, with clinical success, for commercial launch.
 
Our Business
 
Our Technologies – iBio Process Technologies, iBio Product Technologies
 
iBio owns technology developed pursuant to agreements with Fraunhofer as discussed in the Overview section above. iBio has now developed or acquired independent proprietary technologies that provide the Company with apparently higher expression yields of certain proteins and increased efficiency in adapting gene sequences to achieve specific product objectives. In addition to development work by iBio CDMO, iBio has engaged contractors other than Fraunhofer, including Novici, to develop new, proprietary technologies and manufacturing processes that the Company is protecting both through patent applications and as trade secrets.
 
We believe our new technologies and capabilities offer advantages that are not available with conventional biopharmaceutical manufacturing systems. These include shorter and more efficient product development times and reduced production time and lower operating costs during full-scale manufacturing. Further, we believe that the capital investment required to create facilities that will manufacture proteins using the Company’s technologies will be substantially less than the capital investment that would be required for the creation of similar capacity facilities utilizing conventional manufacturing methods dependent upon animal cells, bacterial fermenters and chicken eggs. Operating costs in a manufacturing facility using iBio’s technologies are expected to be reduced significantly in comparison to conventional manufacturing processes due to the rapid nature of our production cycle and the elimination of the expenses associated with the operation and maintenance of bioreactors, fermenters, sterile liquid handling systems and other expensive equipment which is not required in connection with the use of the Company’s technologies.

Although the Company owns the patented iBioLaunch™ technology that arose out of the relationship with Fraunhofer and is entitled to use and prevent its use by others, the Company never received technology transfer from Fraunhofer to which the Company is entitled—including all of the know-how and data developed and accumulated during the period of its creation and use by Fraunhofer as the Company’s outsourced research and development contractor. Consequently, the Company now uses its newer and more advanced technologies in ongoing programs. However, even the older, less effective iBioLaunch™ technology was able to demonstrate significant potential for plant-based technologies in comparison to Chinese hamster ovary (“CHO”) and other legacy methods. For example, iBioLaunch™-produced vaccine candidates against each of the H1N1 “Swine” flu virus, the H5N1 avian flu virus, the bacterial pathogen that causes anthrax, and a candidate to block transmission of the malaria pathogen were successfully tested in Phase 1 clinical trials. Bio-Manguinhos/Fiocruz, or Fiocruz, a unit of the Oswaldo Cruz Foundation, a central agency of the Ministry of Health of Brazil, originally sponsored initial development efforts of yellow fever vaccine candidates, using the iBioLaunch™ technology to replace the vaccine it currently makes in chicken eggs for the populations of Brazil and more than 20 other nations, and these candidates have been successfully tested in non-human primates.
 
iBio Process Technologies
 
Based upon the results of successful in vivo preclinical studies in well-established highly predictive animal models and results from feasibility studies and other discovery and development work we have performed, we believe that iBio’s technologies can produce therapeutic proteins, vaccines, and other recombinant proteins more efficiently, as measured by time, cost and yield, than current conventional biologics manufacturing methods and more efficiently than iBio’s own, earlier technologies. As awareness of these advantages increases, we expect broader adoption of iBio’s technologies by biologics market participants.
 
An additional advantage of iBio’s technologies includes successful production of proteins that are difficult or impossible to produce on a commercially practical basis with conventional systems. This unique capability has been demonstrated by production of a therapeutic product candidate which requires production and purification of the target protein that could not be feasibly accomplished with other systems. For companies developing proprietary product opportunities, challenges often include overcoming obstacles to efficient production of complex or multiple proteins with simultaneous control of enzymes that modify the properties of the desired end product. iBio technologies offer the flexibility and sophistication necessary to enable practical development of such complex products.
 
With iBio technologies, it is possible to manufacture product candidates in less than a month from identifying the protein of interest. This rapid production cycle makes our processes particularly well-suited for producing treatments and vaccines for pandemic diseases and for bioterror response. The rapid production cycle is also advantageous to researchers and others seeking to develop new products as a greater number of experiments can be conducted in any time period at a cost less than that associated with conventional expression systems.
 
Utilizing expression technology which is transient (occurring over a period of four to seven days after introducing a foreign gene), iBio technologies eliminate the initial steps upon which other conventional expression technologies are dependent – namely, the need to isolate a high producing cell clone from millions of non-productive cells and then grow the clonal cells in a sterile fermenter to start the manufacturing process. This saves the year of process development time commonly associated with mammalian cell systems and eliminates the need for expensive fermenters and a sterile liquid-handling system to prevent bacterial, fungal, or viral contamination of the protein drug. In the iBio system, no animal- or human-derived materials are used, eliminating the risk of contamination by infectious agents. In place of such materials, normal green plants, grown under clean and controlled conditions, provide the biomass for pharmaceutical protein manufacturing. Because this entire process uses commonly available materials, we are not dependent on unique sources of raw material, nor are we limited to purchasing from single suppliers.
 
iBio process technologies have been established in iBio CDMO’s operations that begin with robotic seeding into an inert matrix for hydroponic growth, followed by automated infiltration of the young seedlings for gene expression and protein production. The iBio vectors are designed to bring foreign DNA to the nucleus of cells in the leaves of plants by allowing a vector and bacterial host to be introduced into the plant by “infiltrating” the bacterial vector host under a slight vacuum. The bacterial vector “launches” the foreign DNA into the plant nucleus, where it is coded into instructions that direct the plant’s own protein manufacturing apparatus to make foreign proteins. A clever arrangement of genes for plant viral enzymes causes these protein production instructions to be copied hundreds of thousands of times in each plant cell. Our proprietary gene transfer vectors combine the desirable features of the DNA mobilization plasmid of Agrobacterium tumefaciens with gene control elements taken from single-stranded RNA plant viruses.
 
Subsequent to the incorporation of the iBio vector in the plant tissues, protein synthesis is initiated and the target protein is produced over a period of four to seven days. The net effect of applying the iBio system is that the natural plant protein production capability becomes devoted to the expression of the desired gene, and the target protein rapidly accumulates to extremely high levels suitable for commercial use.

iBio Product Technologies
 
iBio has developed and acquired rights to patents and technologies associated with individual products such as our IBIO-CFB03 product candidate for fibrotic diseases. iBio has rights to certain patented and unpatented technologies developed by Novici, patented and unpatented inventions licensed from the University of Pittsburgh, and novel manufacturing methods and processes developed by iBio CDMO.
Application of iBio Technologies - Target Markets and Product Candidates
 
Target Markets and Commercialization Activities
 
We are actively engaged in efforts to commercialize our technologies and services. Our plan is to enter important markets through license and development agreements, commercial collaborations, and manufacturing contracts. Our current marketing efforts focus on those decision makers whom we expect will be attracted to the cost and efficiency advantages that may be obtained through use of our technologies and services. We believe that the advantages of our technologies and the efficiency and capabilities of our CDMO operations will enable us to compete effectively against the providers of other manufacturing systems that may be slower, more capital intensive and costlier to operate. We anticipate realizing revenues in connection with our development and manufacturing services, with licenses we may grant and technology transfer services we may provide.
 
In the United States and Europe, the robust ability of our technologies to favorably produce a wide range of protein types, including our ability to produce product candidates that are otherwise not feasible to commercially manufacture, offers us the opportunity to obtain value through exclusive, individual product licenses and development agreements which can be worldwide or geographically limited. In other geographic regions, such as Brazil, China and India, where the economies and middle classes are growing rapidly and decision-makers are building domestic biologics infrastructures, we anticipate entering into and deriving revenues from licenses and development agreements that may include multiple product categories to which our technology applies.
 
Additionally, we believe that governments and state corporations seeking to establish and maintain autonomous biodefense capabilities will also be attracted to the advantages realizable with our technologies. The market for biodefense countermeasures reflects continued awareness of the threat of global terror and bio-warfare activity as well as the need to have capacities to quickly manufacture both vaccines and therapeutics to a numerous and ever evolving list of biological agents that could be used to harm populations.
 
To enhance our success in the commercialization of our multiple technologies, we are engaging in efforts to advance select iBio sponsored product candidates. Our current internal efforts focus on the further development of a proprietary recombinant protein product candidate, IBIO-CFB03, for the treatment of systemic scleroderma, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, and other fibrotic diseases. We have selected this product candidate for further advancement on the basis of its individual commercial value and its value as representative of a class of products in an attractive market that may be successfully derived from iBio’s newer and more advanced technologies. We believe that demonstration of successful utilization of technologies by each of us and our license partners will enhance market awareness of the broad applicability and potential advantages realizable with iBio’s technologies and capabilities and generate increased opportunities for us to realize value from these assets.
 
Product Candidates
 
Therapeutic Protein Product Candidates
 
Many classes of therapeutic proteins can be successfully produced using our proprietary technologies. They range from large and complex monoclonal antibodies to smaller proteins such as interferons, growth factors, and enzymes.
 
IBIO-CFB03, a Proprietary Product for Treatment of Fibrosis
 
iBio has exclusively licensed and is developing, with its advanced technology, an innovative new product we have designated “IBIO-CFB03” for treatment of systemic sclerosis (SSC) and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), both fatal and incurable diseases. The total number of people affected by systemic sclerosis and IPF, while large in comparison to many biotechnology target markets, is small enough for iBio’s drug to qualify for the regulatory and financial benefits available under U.S. and European Orphan Drug incentives.
 
iBio’s candidate product has demonstrated efficacy in both animal disease models and through the reversal of fibrosis in human skin organ culture. Preclinical studies have established a strong safety profile for IBIO-CFB03 with no toxicity seen at concentrations well above the predicted effective doses. The drug is readily diffusible into organs and tissues and can reach its target site via several modes of administration. Systemic administration is effective at reducing skin and lung fibrosis. The anti-fibrotic effects of IBIO-CFB03 are observed even after the onset of fibrosis, suggesting that it is capable of reversing fibrosis—an effect not observed with any of the potential anti-fibrotic therapies that are currently in clinical use. Patients with existing fibrosis enter the clinic long after the onset of their disease, and thus do not benefit significantly from a drug used to prevent fibrosis rather than treat existing fibrosis.
 
Experimental drugs demonstrating efficacy against life-threatening diseases in early clinical trials are given higher priority review for marketing approval by regulatory agencies in the U.S. and Europe. In addition, both the U.S. and Europe offer financial and regulatory incentives for the development of new drugs for the treatment of smaller patient populations (Orphan Drugs), and such drugs can be approved for marketing faster and with less total investment than drugs that are intended to treat major diseases. iBio has obtained Orphan Drug designation for its drug candidate for systemic sclerosis.

Other Therapeutic Proteins
 
iBio evaluates addition product candidates from both universities and other companies as potential additions to its portfolio of proprietary product opportunities. In some cases, like with iBIO-CFB03, iBio will take a lead role in development. In other cases, iBio will, on a selective basis, provide the advantages of its technologies and facilities capabilities to third-party product developers in exchange for a minority interest in the product.
Vaccine Candidates
 
We and our collaborators have used our proprietary technologies to successfully express and demonstrate the feasibility of production of a broad array of vaccine candidates. We are currently developing for third parties, and evaluating the feasibility of developing, a number of vaccine candidates. However, vaccine products are not a category in which iBio expects to make significant financial investments. Rather, iBio expects its financial participation in novel vaccines to be through development agreements, manufacturing contracts, and royalties based on product or process patent licenses.
Biodefense Countermeasures
 
Our technologies have advantages that we believe are particularly well suited for the biodefense market. Speed of production and capability to produce both vaccines and therapeutic proteins and the potential to improve performance of vaccines through the application of iBio technologies are key features of biologics manufacturing systems that may be sought by governments and state corporations seeking to establish autonomous capabilities to protect their populations from bioterrorism threats.
Strategic Alliances and Collaborations
 
A significant component of our business plan is to enter into strategic alliances and collaborations with for-profit entities, governments, foundations, and others as appropriate to gain access to funding, capabilities, technical resources and intellectual property to further our development efforts, commercialize our technology and to generate revenues, including through the manufacture of products at iBio CDMO’s manufacturing facility.
 
Strategic Relationship with CC-Pharming Ltd. 
 
In June 2018, iBio established a strategic commercial relationship with CC-Pharming Ltd. of Beijing, China (“CC-Pharming”) for joint development of products and manufacturing facilities for the Chinese biopharmaceutical market, utilizing iBio’s technology. The first product focus selected pursuant to the Master Joint Development Agreement executed between iBio and CC-Pharming will be a therapeutic antibody, with additional, mutually selected products to be added to the venture as it proceeds. Service fees will be payable by CC-Pharming to iBio. iBio will provide process development and manufacturing services at its Texas facility for initial product development, and will assist CC-Pharming in facility design and optimization for eventual manufacturing in China. CC-Pharming will manage all operations in China with iBio participating through joint ownership of the China business and ongoing collaboration.
 
Collaboration Agreement with ONEWAY Diagnostica.
 
In June 2018, iBio entered into a joint product development, manufacturing and revenue sharing agreement with ONEWAY Diagnostica of Brazil for novel point of care diagnostic products initially focused on Zika and Chikungunya virus infections. iBio will provide antigen and antibody manufacturing for product prototype development, regulatory approval, commercial launch and ongoing commercial demand requirements. ONEWAY Diagnostica will manage marketing, distribution and sales in Brazil. The agreement provides iBio will receive fees for services and will participate in sales revenues. The initial phase of collaboration for product optimization, already under way, is being performed by iBio scientists at iBio CDMO in Texas and ONEWAY Diagnostica medical and scientific advisors in Brazil. The first two products under development are for reliable diagnosis of Zika virus and early stage Chikugunya virus infections.
 
Collaboration with AzarGen Biotechnologies (Pty) Ltd”)
 
In May 2017, iBio and AzarGen Biotechnologies (Pty) Ltd (“AzarGen”), announced the expansion of their collaboration under a Memorandum of Understanding. Based in South Africa, AzarGen is a biotechnology company focused on developing human therapeutic proteins using advanced genetic engineering and synthetic biology techniques in plants. iBio successfully used its latest technologies and manufacturing capabilities to advance the development of AzarGen's surfactant protein therapeutic through an initial assessment of production feasibility. AzarGen has modified its business plan and product priorities and engaged iBio to use those assets to initiate development of a "bio-better" version of a monoclonal antibody therapeutic product for the South African market.
Collaboration Agreement with The Texas A&M University System
 
In June 2016, iBio executed a joint development agreement with The Texas A & M University System (including Texas A & M University AgriLife Research, and the Texas A & M Institute of Infectious Animal Diseases (IIAD)) ("TAMUS"), for the establishment of a collaborative program in plant-produced pharmaceuticals.
Collaboration with Fraunhofer Center for Molecular Biotechnology (“Fraunhofer”)
 
In 2003, as described in the Overview section above, we engaged Fraunhofer to perform research and development activities exclusively for iBio to further develop the iBioLaunch™ platform and support commercialization of iBio’s platform and other assets. iBio and Fraunhofer have been in litigation since early 2015 as a result of Fraunhofer’s alleged breaches of contract.

Fiocruz Collaboration and License
 
In January 2011, we entered into collaboration and granted a commercial, royalty-bearing license to Fiocruz for the use of our proprietary iBioLaunch™ technology in connection with the development, manufacture and commercialization by Fiocruz of certain vaccine products. Fiocruz, a unit of the Oswaldo Cruz Foundation, a central agency of the Ministry of Health of Brazil, is a leader in the production, development and commercialization in Latin America of vaccines, reagents and biopharmaceuticals. Additionally, Fiocruz, a certified World Health Organization provider to United Nations agencies, is a global leader in the manufacture of yellow fever vaccine. Fiocruz manufactures and exports yellow fever vaccine to over 60 countries. The World Health Organization has estimated that 200,000 unvaccinated people contract yellow fever each year, and approximately 30,000 die from the disease.
 
Pursuant to the terms of the collaboration and license agreement among iBio, Fraunhofer and Fiocruz, Fiocruz has the right to develop and commercialize yellow fever vaccine derived from the use of our iBioLaunch™ technology in Latin America, the Caribbean and Africa. Fiocruz will fund development of this vaccine product and if successfully developed and commercialized, iBio will receive royalty payments from the sales of the product in those territories. iBio has retained the right, which is sublicenseable, to commercialize the product in all other territories subject to payment of a royalty back to Fiocruz. Based upon Fraunhofer’s representations of relevant expertise, we engaged Fraunhofer as our subcontractor to perform these research and development services.
 
On June 12, 2014, Fiocruz, Fraunhofer and iBio executed an amendment to the Agreement (the “Amended Agreement”) which provided for the engagement of Fraunhofer as iBio’s subcontractor for revised research and development, work plans, reporting, objectives, estimated budget, and project billing process. The effect of the amendment resulted in a charge of approximately $1.007 million to general and administrative expenses for the noncollectibility of an accounts receivable from Fiocruz for revenues recorded for the year ended June 30, 2013 and a credit of approximately $1.007 million to research and development expenses and a corresponding adjustment to accounts payable relating to expenses accrued at June 30, 2013 owed to Fraunhofer.
 
For the year ended June 30, 2014, under the Amended Agreement, the Company recognized revenue of $205,000 for work performed for Fiocruz pursuant to the Amended Agreement by the Company’s subcontractor, Fraunhofer, and recognized research and development expenses of the same amount — $205,000 – paid to Fraunhofer for that work.
 
For the year ended June 30, 2015, under the Amended Agreement, the Company recognized revenue of $1,851,000 for work performed for Fiocruz pursuant to the Amended Agreement by the Company’s subcontractor, Fraunhofer, and recognized research and development expenses of the same amount — $1,851,000 – paid to Fraunhofer for that work.
 
For the year ended June 30, 2016, under the Amended Agreement, the Company recognized revenue of $758,000 for work performed for Fiocruz pursuant to the Amended Agreement by the Company’s subcontractor, Fraunhofer, and recognized research and development expenses of the same amount — $758,000 – paid to Fraunhofer for that work.
 
For the year ended June 30, 2017, under the Amended Agreement, the Company recognized revenue of $137,000 for work performed for Fiocruz pursuant to the Amended Agreement by the Company’s subcontractor, Fraunhofer, and recognized research and development expenses of the same amount — $137,000 – $62,000 paid to Fraunhofer.
 
 For the year ended June 30, 2018, no revenues or research and development expenses were recognized under the Amended Agreement. At June 30, 2018, there is an outstanding balance payable by the Company offset by an outstanding balance receivable due to the Company of $75,000.
 
iBio and Fiocruz are currently evaluating plans for further collaboration without prospective reliance on older Fraunhofer-derived technology and data.

Intellectual Property
 
We exclusively own intellectual property acquired by or developed at Fraunhofer for human health and certain veterinary and diagnostic applications, noting that we have not yet used either the veterinary or diagnostic applications. We also own intellectual property developed or acquired independently of Fraunhofer. In addition, we have an exclusive worldwide license agreement with the University of Pittsburgh covering U.S. and foreign patents and patent applications and related intellectual property owned by the University of Pittsburgh pertinent to the use of endostatin peptides for the treatment of fibrosis. Our success will depend in part on our ability to obtain and maintain patent protection for our technologies and products and to preserve our trade secrets. Our policy is to seek to protect our proprietary rights, by among other methods, filing patent applications in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions to cover certain aspects of our technology.
 
We currently own some 25 U.S. patents and 68 international patents. We have an exclusive license to four U.S. patents and one application. Additionally, we have two international patent applications allowed, as well as four U.S. and 34 international applications pending. International patents and applications include numerous foreign countries including Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Hong Kong, India, Korea, Russia and several countries in Europe.

Competition
 
The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary products.

We face competition from many different sources, including commercial pharmaceutical and biotechnology enterprises, academic institutions, government agencies, and private and public research institutions. Our commercial opportunities will be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer, more effective, have fewer side effects or are less expensive than any products that we or our collaborators may develop based on the use of our technologies.
 
Our competition in the CDMO market includes a number of full-service contract manufacturers and large pharmaceutical companies offering third-party development and manufacturing services to fill their excess capacity. Large pharmaceutical companies have been seeking to divest portions of their manufacturing capacity, and any such divested businesses may compete with us in the future. In addition, most of our competitors may have substantially greater financial, marketing, technical or other resources than we do. Moreover, additional competition may emerge and may, among other things, result in a decrease in the fees paid for our services, which would affect our results of operations and financial condition.
 
While we believe that the potential advantages of our new technologies will enable us to compete effectively against other providers of technology for biologic product development and manufacturing, many of our competitors have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, clinical trials, regulatory approvals and marketing approved products than we do. Smaller or early stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through arrangements with large and established companies, and this may reduce the value of our technologies for the purposes of establishing license agreements. In addition, these third parties compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel, establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies and technology licenses complementary to our programs or advantageous to our business.
 
We expect to rely upon licensees, collaborators or customers for support in advancing certain of our drug candidates and intend to rely on additional work with our collaborators during our efforts to commercialize our product candidates. Our licensees, collaborators or customers may be conducting multiple product development efforts within the same disease areas that are the subjects of their agreements with us. Agreements with collaborators may not preclude them from pursuing development efforts using a different approach from that which is the subject of our agreement with them. Any of our drug candidates, therefore, may be subject to competition with a drug candidate under development by a customer.
 
There are currently approved vaccines and therapies for many of the diseases and conditions addressed by the product candidates our clients and collaborators may be developing or manufacturing or in our own pipeline. There are also a number of companies working to develop new drugs and other therapies for diseases of commercial interest to us that are undergoing various stages of testing including clinical trials. The key competitive factors affecting the success of our technologies for commercial product candidates are likely to be efficacy, safety profile, price, and convenience.
 
Government Regulation and Product Approval
 
Regulation by governmental authorities in the U.S. and other countries is a significant factor in the development, manufacturing and marketing of pharmaceutical drugs and vaccines. All of the vaccine and therapeutic products developed from our technologies will require regulatory approval by governmental agencies prior to commercialization. In particular, pharmaceutical drugs and vaccines are subject to rigorous preclinical testing and clinical trials and other pre-marketing approval requirements by the Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) and regulatory authorities in other countries. In the U.S., various federal, and, in some cases, state statutes and regulations, also govern or impact the manufacturing, safety, labeling, storage, record-keeping and marketing of vaccines and pharmaceutical products. The lengthy process of seeking required approvals and the continuing need for compliance with applicable statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial resources. Regulatory approval, if and when obtained for any of our product candidates, may be limited in scope, which may significantly limit the indicated uses for which our product candidates may be marketed. Further, approved vaccines and drugs are subject to ongoing review and discovery of previously unknown problems that may result in restrictions on their manufacture, sale or use, or in their withdrawal from the market.
 
Before any product candidates with potential immunization or therapeutic value may be tested in human subjects, we must satisfy stringent government requirements for preclinical studies. Preclinical testing includes both in vitro and in vivo laboratory evaluation and characterization of the safety and efficacy of the product candidate. “In vitro” refers to tests conducted with cells in culture and “in vivo” refers to tests conducted in animals. Preclinical testing results obtained from studies in several animal species, as well as data from in vitro studies, are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND application and are reviewed by the FDA prior to the commencement of human clinical trials. These preclinical data must provide an adequate basis for evaluating both the safety and the scientific rationale for the initial clinical trials. In the case of vaccine candidates, animal immunogenicity and immune protection tests must establish a sound scientific basis to believe that the product candidate may be beneficial when administered to humans.
 
An IND becomes effective automatically 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA raises concern or questions about the conduct of the clinical trials as outlined in the IND prior to that time. In such an event, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before clinical trials can proceed. For additional information on the most recent FDA regulations and guidance on vaccine and therapeutic product testing and approval, visit its website at http://www.fda.gov.
 
Any products we or a licensee manufactures or distributes under FDA approval are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including record-keeping requirements and reporting of adverse experiences with the products. Drug manufacturers and their subcontractors are required to register with the FDA and, where appropriate, state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and state agencies for compliance with current cGMPs, which are the standards the FDA requires be met during the manufacturing of drugs and biologic products, and which impose procedural and documentation requirements upon us and any third-party manufacturers we utilize.
 
To the extent we conduct vaccine or therapeutic product development activities outside the United States, we will also be subject to a wide variety of foreign regulations governing the development, manufacture and marketing of our product candidates. Whether or not FDA approval has been obtained, approval of a product by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries must still be obtained prior to manufacturing or marketing the product in those countries. The approval process varies from country to country and the time needed to secure approval may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval. We cannot assure you that clinical trials conducted in one country will be accepted by other countries or that approval in one country will result in approval in any other country. The product testing and clinical trial requirements that must be met before a product candidate can be marketed are substantial, time-consuming, and require investments of millions of dollars per product candidate.

Employees
 
As of August 31, 2018, we had eight employees in iBio and forty-six employees in iBio CDMO. Our employees are not represented by any union and are not the subject of a collective bargaining agreement. We consider our relations with our employees to be good and believe this staffing level will be sufficient to meet our needs.
Reverse Stock Split
 
On April 23, 2018, the Company held a special meeting of its stockholders at which the stockholders approved a proposal to effect an amendment to the Company's certificate of incorporation, as amended, to implement a reverse stock split at a ratio to be determined by the Company's Board of Directors in a range not less than one-for-two (1:2) and not greater than one-for-ten (1:10).
 
On May 23, 2018, the Company's Board of Directors approved the implementation of a reverse stock split at a ratio of one-for-ten (1:10) shares of the Company's common stock. As a result of the reverse stock split, every ten (10) shares of the Company's common stock either issued and outstanding or held by the Company in its treasury immediately prior to the effective time was, automatically and without any action on the part of the respective holders thereof, combined and converted into one (1) share of the Company's common stock. The reverse split also applied to common stock issuable upon the exercise of the Company’s outstanding stock options. The reverse stock split did not affect the par value of the Company’s common stock or the shares of common stock the Company is authorized to issue under its Certificate of Incorporation, as amended. No fractional shares were issued in connection with the reverse stock split. Stockholders who otherwise were entitled to receive a fractional share in connection with the reverse stock split instead were eligible to receive a cash payment, which was not material in the aggregate, instead of shares. The effective date of the reverse stock split was June 8, 2018. All share and per share amounts of common stock presented have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the one-for-ten reverse stock split.
