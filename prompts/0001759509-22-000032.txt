Our Mission
Improve people’s lives with the world’s best transportation.
Overview
Lyft, Inc (the “Company” or “Lyft”) started a movement to revolutionize transportation. In 2012, we launched our peer-to-peer marketplace for on-demand ridesharing and have continued to pioneer innovations aligned with our mission. Today, Lyft is one of the largest multimodal transportation networks in the United States and Canada. 
We believe that the world is at the beginning of a shift away from car ownership to Transportation-as-a-Service (“TaaS”). Lyft is at the forefront of this massive societal change. Our ridesharing marketplace connects drivers with riders via the Lyft mobile application (the “Lyft App”) in cities across the United States and in select cities in Canada. We believe that our ridesharing marketplace allows riders to use their cars less and offers a viable alternative to car ownership while providing drivers using our platform the freedom and independence to choose when, where, how long and on what platforms they work. As this evolution continues, we believe there is a massive opportunity for us to improve the lives of riders by connecting them to more affordable and convenient transportation options.
We are laser-focused on revolutionizing transportation. We have established a scaled network of users brought together by our robust technology platform (the “Lyft Platform”) that powers rides and connections every day. We leverage our technology platform, the scale and density of our user network and insights from a significant number of rides to continuously improve our ridesharing marketplace efficiency and develop new offerings. We’ve also taken steps to ensure our network is well positioned to benefit from technological innovation in mobility. 
Today, our offerings include an expanded set of transportation modes in select cities, such as access to a network of shared bikes and scooters (“Light Vehicles”) for shorter rides and first-mile and last-mile legs of multimodal trips, information about nearby public transit routes, and Lyft Rentals, an offering for renters who want to rent a car for a fixed period of time for personal use. We believe our transportation network offers a viable alternative to car ownership. 
We generate substantially all of our revenue from our ridesharing marketplace that connects drivers and riders. We collect service fees and commissions from drivers for their use of our ridesharing marketplace. As drivers accept more rider leads and complete more rides, we earn more revenue. We also generate revenue from riders renting Light Vehicles, drivers renting vehicles through Express Drive, Lyft Rentals renters, Lyft Driver Center and Lyft Auto Care users, and by making our ridesharing marketplace available to organizations through our Lyft Business offerings, such as our Concierge and Corporate Business Travel programs. In the second quarter of 2021, we began generating revenues from licensing and data access agreements, primarily with third-party autonomous vehicle companies.
We have made focused and substantial investments in support of our mission. For example, to continually launch new innovations on our platform, we have invested heavily in research and development and have completed multiple strategic acquisitions. We have also invested in sales and marketing to grow our community, cultivate a differentiated brand that resonates with drivers and riders and promote further brand awareness. Together, these investments have enabled us to create a powerful multimodal platform and scaled user network. 
Notwithstanding the impact of COVID-19, we are continuing to invest in the future, both organically and through acquisitions of complementary businesses. We also continue to invest in the expansion of our network of Light Vehicles and Lyft Autonomous, which focuses on the deployment and scaling of third-party self-driving technology on the Lyft network. Our strategy is to always be at the forefront of transportation innovation, and we believe that through these investments, we will continue to be well positioned as a leader in TaaS. Even as we invest in the business, we also remain focused on finding ways to operate more efficiently.
To advance our mission, we aim to build the defining brand of our generation and to advocate through our commitment to social and environmental responsibility. We believe that our brand represents freedom at your fingertips: freedom from the stresses of car ownership and freedom to do and see more. Through our LyftUp initiative, we’re working to make sure people have access to affordable, reliable transportation to get where they need to go - no matter their income or zip code. We are also proud to be leaders in the fight against climate change. We’ve made the commitment to reach 100% electric vehicles (“EVs”) on the Lyft network by the end of 2030. We believe many users are loyal to Lyft because of our values, brand and commitment to social and environmental responsibility. 
Our values, brand and focus on customer experience are key differentiators for our business. We continue to believe that users are increasingly choosing services, including a transportation network, based on brand affinity and value alignment. As we progress through the COVID-19 recovery, we remain confident the demand for our offerings will continue to grow as more and more people discover and rely on the convenience, experience and affordability of using Lyft.
Impact of COVID-19 to our Business
The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic continues to impact communities in the United States, Canada and globally. Since the pandemic began in March 2020, governments and private businesses - at the recommendation of public health officials - have enacted precautions to mitigate the spread of the virus, including travel restrictions and social distancing measures in many regions of the United States and Canada, and many enterprises have instituted and maintained work from home programs and limited the number of employees on site. Beginning in the middle of March 2020, the pandemic and these related responses caused decreased demand for our platform leading to decreased revenues as well as decreased earning opportunities for drivers on our platform. Our business continues to be impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.
Although we have seen some signs of demand improving, particularly compared to the demand levels at the start of the pandemic, demand levels continue to be affected by the impact of variants and changes in case counts. The exact timing and pace of the recovery remain uncertain. The extent to which our operations will continue to be impacted by the pandemic will depend largely on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be accurately predicted, including new information which may emerge concerning COVID-19 variants and the severity of the pandemic and actions by government authorities and private businesses to contain the pandemic or recover from its impact, among other things. For example, an increase in cases due to variants of the virus has caused many businesses to delay employees returning to the office, which in turn reduces levels of demand. Even as travel restrictions and shelter-in-place orders are modified or lifted, we anticipate that continued social distancing, altered consumer behavior, reduced travel and commuting, and expected corporate cost cutting will be significant challenges for us. The strength and duration of these challenges cannot be presently estimated.
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have adopted multiple measures, including, but not limited, to establishing new health and safety requirements for ridesharing and updating workplace policies. We also made adjustments to our expenses and cash flow to correlate with declines in revenues including headcount reductions in 2020.
For more information on risks associated with the COVID-19 pandemic and our litigation matters, see the section titled “Risk Factors” in Item 1A of Part I. For more information on the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on our business, see the section titled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Item 7 of Part II.
Our Transportation Network
Our transportation network offers riders seamless, personalized and on-demand access to a variety of mobility options.
Our transportation network is comprised of:
•Ridesharing Marketplace. Our core offering since 2012 connects drivers with riders who need to get somewhere. The scale of our network enables us to predict demand and proactively incentivize drivers to be available for rides in the right place at the right time. This allows us to optimize earning opportunities for drivers and offer convenient rides for riders, creating sustainable value to both sides of our marketplace. Our ridesharing marketplace connects drivers with riders in cities across the United States and in select cities in Canada. 
•Express Drive. Our flexible car rentals program for drivers who want to drive using our platform but do not have access to a vehicle that meets our requirements. Through our Express Drive program, drivers can enter into short-term rental agreements for vehicles that may be used to provide ridesharing services on the Lyft Platform. 
•Lyft Rentals. In 2019, we launched Lyft Rentals to offer an attractive option for users who have long-distance trips, such as a weekend away. This is a separate consumer offering from Express Drive.
•Light Vehicles. We have a network of shared bikes and scooters (“Light Vehicles”) in a number of cities to address the needs of users who are looking for options that are more active, usually lower-priced, and often more efficient for short trips during heavy traffic. These modes can also help supplement the first-mile and last-mile of a multimodal trip with public transit. 
•Public Transit. Available in select cities, our Transit offering integrates third-party public transit data into the Lyft App to offer users a robust view of transportation options around them and allows them to see transit routes to their destinations at no cost. Providing real-time public transit information is another step toward providing effective, equitable and sustainable transportation to our communities, and creating a more seamless and connected transportation network. 
•Lyft Autonomous. We have a number of strategic partnerships that offer access to autonomous vehicles. Our Open Platform partnership with Motional (formerly Aptiv) has enabled the commercial deployment of a fleet of autonomous vehicles on our platform in Las Vegas. In July 2021, we completed a multi-element transaction with Woven Planet, a subsidiary of Toyota Motor Corporation, for the divestiture of certain assets related to our self-driving vehicle division, Level 5, as well as commercial agreements for the utilization of Lyft rideshare and fleet data to accelerate the safety and commercialization of the automated-driving vehicles that Woven Planet is developing. In December 2021, we launched an autonomous rideshare service in Miami with Ford and Argo AI, delivering on a shared commitment to deploy Ford’s autonomous vehicles, powered by the Argo Self-Driving System, on our ridesharing network. 
We have established one of the largest transportation networks in the United States and Canada. While network scale is important, we recognize that transportation happens locally and each market has its own unique user network. Our dynamic platform adjusts to the specific attributes of each market on a real-time basis.
Drivers
The drivers on our platform are active members of their communities. They are parents, students, business owners, retirees and everything in between. We work hard to serve the community of drivers on our platform, empowering them to be their own bosses and providing them the opportunity to focus their time on what matters most. Key benefits to drivers on our platform include:
•Flexibility. We offer drivers the flexibility to generate income on their own schedule, so they can best prioritize what is important in their lives.
•Technology. Our predictive technology around ride volume and demand enables us to share key information with drivers about when and where to drive to maximize their earnings on a real-time basis. 
•Insurance. We procure insurance that helps protect transportation network company (“TNC”) drivers against financial losses related to automobile accidents while on the platform. 
•Community Standards. To help us uphold high community standards, we give both drivers and riders the opportunity to rate each other after a ride booked through the Lyft App. 
•Support. Our Driver Hubs and certain field locations in major cities serve as gathering places and offer in-person support and a personal connection to Lyft employees. In addition, drivers have access to 24/7 support and earnings tools as well as education resources and other support to meet their personal goals.
Riders
Riders are as diverse and dynamic as the communities we serve. They represent all adult age groups and backgrounds and use Lyft to commute to and from work, explore their cities, spend more time at local businesses and stay out longer knowing they can get a reliable ride home. Unless otherwise stated, riders are passengers who request rides from drivers in our ridesharing marketplace and renters of a shared bike, scooter or automobile. We work hard to provide riders with a quality experience every time they open the Lyft App, in order to earn the right to have Lyft be their transportation network of choice. Key benefits to riders on our platform include:
•Selection and Convenience. We designed the Lyft App with a focus on simplicity, efficiency and convenience. Our proprietary technology efficiently matches riders with drivers through advanced dispatching algorithms providing faster arrival times, localized pricing and maximum availability. Additional modes, such as Light Vehicles, offer riders more options for shorter trips. The more rides that are taken on our platform, the better we are able to offer riders personalized experiences most suitable to the trip being planned.
•Availability. We strive to ensure that riders can get a ride when they want one. We leverage our proprietary dispatch platform and data to help drivers and riders connect efficiently and reduce wait times. 
•Affordability. Our platform empowers riders to choose from a broad set of transportation options to easily optimize for cost, comfort and time.
•Safety. Since day one, we have worked continuously to enhance the safety of our platform and the ridesharing industry by developing innovative products, policies and processes.
Business
Lyft is evolving how businesses large and small take care of their people’s transportation needs across sectors including corporate, healthcare, auto, education and government. Our comprehensive set of solutions allows clients to design, manage and pay for ground transportation programs that contribute to productivity and satisfaction while reducing cost, improving transparency and streamlining operations. 
Our Technology Infrastructure and Operations
We organize our product teams with a full-stack development model, integrating product management, engineering, analytics, data science and design. We focus on affordability, reliability, efficiency, optimization and cohesion when developing our software. Our offerings are mobile-first and platform agnostic. We seek to continuously improve the Lyft Platform and the Lyft App. Our offerings are built on a scalable technology platform that enables us to manage peaks in demand.
We have a commercial agreement with Amazon Web Services (“AWS”) for cloud services to help deliver and host our platform. As a result of our partnership, we believe we are more resilient to surges in demand on our platform or product changes we may introduce. Our commercial agreement with AWS will remain in effect until terminated by AWS or us. AWS may only terminate the agreement for convenience after January 31, 2026, and only after complying with certain advance notice requirements. AWS may also terminate the agreement for cause upon a breach of the agreement or for failure to pay amounts due, in each case, subject to AWS providing prior written notice and a 30-day cure period. Under this agreement, we committed to spend an aggregate of at least $300 million between January 2019 and June 2022 on AWS services, with a minimum amount of $80 million in each of the three years. In February 2022, we amended the agreement and committed to spend an aggregate of at least $350 million between February 2022 and January 2026, with a minimum of $80 million in each of the four years. If we fail to meet the minimum purchase commitment during any year, we may be required to pay the difference. We pay AWS monthly, and we may pay more than the minimum purchase commitment to AWS based on usage. 
We designed our platform with multiple layers of redundancy to guard against data loss and deliver high availability. Both incremental and full backups are performed and redundant copies of content are stored independently in separate geographic regions. We are also investing in iterating and continuously improving our data privacy and security foundation, and continually review and implement the most relevant policies.
Our Proprietary Data-Driven Technology Platform
Our robust technology platform powers the millions of rides and connections that we facilitate every day and provides insights that drive our platform in real-time. We leverage historical data to continuously improve experiences for drivers and riders on our platform. Our platform analyzes large datasets covering the ride lifecycle, from when drivers go online and riders request rides, to when they match, which route to take and any feedback given after the rides. Utilizing machine learning capabilities to predict future behavior based on many years of historical data and use cases, we employ various levers to balance supply and demand in the marketplace, creating increased driver earnings while maintaining strong service levels for riders. We also leverage our data science and algorithms to inform our product development.
Our Intellectual Property
We believe that our intellectual property rights are valuable and important to our business. We rely on trademarks, patents, copyrights, trade secrets, license agreements, intellectual property assignment agreements, confidentiality procedures, non-disclosure agreements and employee non-disclosure and invention assignment agreements to establish and protect our proprietary rights. Though we rely in part upon these legal and contractual protections, we believe that factors such as the skills and ingenuity of our employees and the functionality and frequent enhancements to our solutions and offerings are larger contributors to our success in the marketplace.
We have invested in a patent program to identify and protect a substantial portion of our strategic intellectual property in ridesharing, autonomous vehicle-related technology, telecommunications, networking and other technologies relevant to our business. As of December 31, 2021, we held 343 issued U.S. patents and had 310 U.S. patent applications pending. We also held 70 issued patents in foreign jurisdictions and had 143 applications pending in foreign jurisdictions. We continually review our development efforts to assess the existence and patentability of new intellectual property.
We have an ongoing trademark and service mark registration program pursuant to which we register our brand names and product names, taglines and logos in the United States and other countries to the extent we determine appropriate and cost-effective. We also have common law rights in some trademarks. In addition, we have registered domain names for websites that we use in our business, such as www.lyft.com and other variations.
We intend to pursue additional intellectual property protection to the extent we believe it would be beneficial and cost-effective. Despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights, they may not be respected in the future or may be invalidated, circumvented or challenged. For additional information, see the sections titled “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Regulatory and Legal Factors—Claims by others that we infringed their proprietary technology or other intellectual property rights could harm our business” and “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Regulatory and Legal Factors—Failure to protect or enforce our intellectual property rights could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.”
Our Growth Strategy
Transportation represents a massive market opportunity, one that we are in the very early stages of addressing. Our key growth strategies include our plans to:
•Increase Rider Use Cases. We are continuously working to make Lyft the transportation network of choice across an expanding range of use cases. We offer products to simplify travel decision-making, for example with our Lyft Pink subscription plan, Lyft Pass commuter programs, first-mile and last-mile services and university safe rides programs. We also provide centralized tools and enterprise transportation solutions, such as our Concierge offering, that enable organizations to manage the transportation needs of customers, employees and other constituents.
•Grow Active Riders. We see opportunities to continue to recoup and grow our rider base amid the continuing COVID-19 pandemic. We may make incremental investments in our brand and in growth marketing to maintain and drive increasing consumer preference for Lyft. We may also offer discounts for first-time riders to try Lyft or provide incentives to existing riders to encourage increased ride frequency. We plan to continue to add density to our ridesharing marketplace by attracting and retaining more drivers on our network to deliver the best possible service levels. Additionally, we will continue to evaluate ways to expand our network coverage beyond the geographies and markets we currently serve. We also believe we are a beneficiary of demographic shifts, such as the growing percentage of the U.S. population that is accustomed to on-demand services and has digital-first preferences.
•Grow Our Share of Consumers’ Transportation Spend. Lyft’s transportation network is designed to address a wide range of mobility needs. The Lyft network spans rideshare, car rentals, bikes, scooters, transit and vehicle services. By integrating the fragmented transportation ecosystem, we are well positioned to deliver the best holistic experience to all of our riders and to capture significantly more of our market opportunity.
•Deliver Increasing Value to Drivers. We strive to provide drivers that use Lyft with the best possible experience, including access to the best economic opportunities. For example, through our Express Drive program, drivers can get access to rental cars they can use for ridesharing. We’ve also been investing in our Driver Centers, Mobile Services and related partnerships that offer drivers affordable and convenient vehicle maintenance services. By making the driver experience better and better, we can retain and attract more drivers to Lyft’s network. 
•Invest in our Marketplace Technology. Our investments in our proprietary technology allow us to deliver a convenient and high-quality experience to drivers and riders. Our investments in mapping, routing, payments, in-app navigation, matching technologies and data science are key to making our network more efficient and seamless to use.
•Thoughtfully Pursue M&A and Strategic Partnerships. In November 2018, we acquired Bikeshare Holdings LLC (“Motivate”), the largest bike sharing platform in the United States at the time and in February 2020, we acquired Flexdrive, LLC (“Flexdrive”), one of our longstanding Express Drive partners. We will continue to selectively consider acquisitions that contribute to the growth of our current business, help us expand into adjacent markets or add new capabilities to our network. We believe drivers and riders will continue to benefit from a broad partner ecosystem that builds on our existing loyalty and reward programs. We have also built strong relationships with transportation suppliers, state and local governments, and technology solutions providers and we intend to continue to pursue partnerships that contribute to our growth.
Competition
The market for TaaS networks is intensely competitive and characterized by rapid changes in technology, shifting rider needs and frequent introductions of new services and offerings. We expect competition to continue, both from current competitors and new 
entrants in the market that may be well-established and enjoy greater resources or other strategic advantages. If we are unable to anticipate or successfully react to these competitive challenges in a timely manner, our competitive position could weaken, or fail to improve, and we could experience a decline in revenue or growth stagnation that could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Our main ridesharing competitors in the United States and Canada include Uber and Via. Our main competitors in the bike and scooter sharing market include Lime and Bird. Our main competitors in the consumer vehicle rental market include Enterprise, Hertz and Avis Budget Group as well as emerging car-share marketplaces. We also compete with certain non-ridesharing transportation network companies and taxi cab and livery companies as well as traditional automotive manufacturers.
Additionally, there are other non-U.S.-based TaaS network companies, non-ridesharing transportation network companies and traditional automotive manufacturers that may expand into the United States and Canada, such as BMW, which has an ongoing presence in the transportation network market in Europe. There are also a number of companies developing autonomous vehicle technology that may compete with us in the future, including Alphabet (Waymo), Amazon (Zoox), Apple, Aurora, Baidu and General Motors (Cruise) as well as many other technology companies and automobile manufacturers and suppliers. We anticipate continued challenges from current competitors as well as from new entrants into the TaaS market.
We believe we can compete favorably. However, many of our competitors and potential competitors are larger and have greater brand name recognition, longer operating histories, larger marketing budgets and established marketing relationships, access to larger customer bases and significantly greater resources for the development of their offerings. For additional information about the risks to our business related to competition, see the section titled “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Operational Factors—We face intense competition and could lose market share to our competitors, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.”
Seasonality
The revenue we generate from our business may fluctuate from quarter to quarter due to seasonal factors including the weather and certain holidays. We expect the demand for our transportation network may decline over the winter season and the demand for our network of Light Vehicles may increase during more temperate and dry seasons. Our business is also subject to risks related to COVID-19. In particular, travel bans and mobility restrictions have weighed on demand. Although we have seen some signs of demand improving as COVID-19 conditions have improved, particularly compared to the start of the pandemic, the exact timing and pace of the recovery remain uncertain. We are unable to predict when and to what extent these public health and safety measures may be eased, how riders will respond to the easing of such measures, as well as whether additional measures may need to be implemented in the future, any of which may continue to result in decreased demand notwithstanding usual seasonality. 
Our Brand and Marketing
We believe good energy moves the world. The Lyft brand is rooted in our hospitality principles: safety, simplicity, reliability, care, and delight. Our marketing efforts bring our brand to life across a variety of communication channels ranging from national broadcast campaigns to more direct communications like email and social media engagement. We also benefit from positive word of mouth in the existing Lyft rider community
Our marketing efforts educate people about Lyft products in creative and memorable ways and generate greater brand awareness among potential drivers and riders. Our brand marketing includes but is not limited to Lyft-produced content, culture and entertainment partnerships, marketing partnerships, sponsored local events, and outdoor advertisements. 
We use specific channels and initiatives so we can measure the impact of our marketing spend. We attract new drivers and riders through referrals, partnerships, display advertising, radio, video, social media, email, search engine optimization, keyword search campaigns, and more. We continue to engage with current riders through a variety of initiatives, including emails, in-app notifications, social media content, promotions, and more.
Our Commitment to Safety
A strong guiding principle since day one has been to build a community that drivers and riders trust. Trust is the foundation of our relationship with drivers and riders on our platform, and we take significant measures every day that are focused on their safety. 
To ensure we are delivering exceptional service levels and upholding high quality standards, we have established our Safety and Customer Care, or SCC (formerly known as Customer Experience and Trust), team as a key part of our organization. With over 300 employees as of December 31, 2021, SCC is in charge of fielding safety and customer support inquiries and is available through multiple channels, including via self-service and assisted support directly within our apps. Our SCC team focuses on driving results based on experience-based metrics including First Contact Resolution, which is the number of support tickets resolved during first contact with a driver or rider, and Net Promoter Score. SCC aims to eliminate bad customer experiences, quickly resolve problems when they occur and maintain trust with drivers and riders. This dedication led our customer support to be recently named number one in Newsweek’s 2021 America’s Best Customer Service rankings for the Taxi and Ridesharing category. 
Some measures we take to promote the safety of riders and drivers on the platform include:
•Annual background checks. Every driver is required to pass a professionally administered background check before they drive and each year after that.
•Ongoing criminal monitoring. Continuous criminal monitoring allows us to quickly deactivate drivers with disqualifying criminal convictions. We also check driving records throughout the year to promptly identify and remove disqualified drivers from the platform as soon as a violation is detected.
•Mandatory safety education. Drivers must complete a safety program developed with RAINN, the largest anti-sexual violence organization in North America. These programs can vary by state and cover topics such as how to create a safe and comfortable ride, appropriate conversation topics, respecting personal boundaries, and recognizing and reporting sexual assault and sexual misconduct.
•Emergency help, supported by ADT. If a rider or driver feels uncomfortable or needs emergency assistance at any point, they are able to quickly connect with an ADT security professional.
•Hidden contact information and ride history. The Lyft App hides contact information for both the rider and driver before, during and after the ride. While riders and drivers are able to call or text one another through the app, personal information, including real user phone numbers, are not revealed. Drivers are also not able to see a rider’s drop-off location, whether it’s a specific address or a cross-street, after the ride is complete.
•Two-way ratings and mandatory feedback. At the end of each trip, drivers and riders are prompted to rate their ride on the scale of one to five stars. Any rider or driver who submits a rating of four stars or fewer is prompted to provide more details. Anyone who rates a rider or driver three stars or fewer will never be matched with that individual again through the app. 
In 2021, we published our Community Safety Report, which is available on our website and details the frequency of some of the most serious safety incidents that are reported to us, which are statistically very rare. From 2017 to 2019, over 99% of trips occurred without any reported safety incident, which accounted for 0.0002% of all trips in this period. However, while safety incidents on our platform are incredibly rare, we recognize that behind every report is a real person and real experience, and our goal is to make each Lyft ride as safe as we possibly can.
Government Regulation
We are subject to a wide variety of laws and regulations in the United States and other jurisdictions. Laws, regulations and standards governing issues such as TNCs, public companies, ridesharing, worker classification, labor and employment, anti-discrimination, payments, gift cards, whistleblowing and worker confidentiality obligations, product liability, defects, recalls, auto maintenance and repairs, personal injury, text messaging, subscription services, intellectual property, securities, consumer protection, taxation, privacy, data security, competition, unionizing and collective action, antitrust, arbitration agreements and class action waiver provisions, terms of service, mobile application accessibility, autonomous vehicles, bike and scooter sharing, insurance, vehicle rentals, money transmittal, non-emergency medical transportation, healthcare fraud, waste, and abuse, environmental health and safety, greenhouse gas emissions, background checks, public health, anti-corruption, anti-bribery, political contributions, lobbying, import and export restrictions, trade and economic sanctions, foreign ownership and investment, foreign exchange controls and delivery of goods including (but not limited to) medical supplies, perishable foods and prescription drugs are often complex and subject to varying interpretations, in many cases due to their lack of specificity. As a result, their application in practice may change or develop over time through judicial decisions or as new guidance or interpretations are provided by regulatory and governing bodies, such as federal, state and local administrative agencies.
The TNC industry has also come under increasing scrutiny from non-profit organizations, regulators, and legislators for its environmental impact, specifically increasing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. In 2018, California passed first-of-its-kind legislation (the “California Clean Miles Standard and Incentive Program”) to mandate that TNCs reduce their GHG emissions on a GHG per passenger-mile basis, with additional requirements that TNCs increase the percentage of zero-emission vehicles on their platforms. Policymakers recently proposed analogous legislation in Washington and Oregon. Other states are actively observing the California Clean Miles Standard and Incentive Program as well.
See the sections titled “Risk Factors,” including the subsections titled “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Regulatory and Legal Factors—Challenges to contractor classification of drivers that use our platform may have adverse business, financial, tax, legal and other consequences to our business,” “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Regulatory and Legal Factors—Our business is subject to a wide range of laws and regulations, many of which are evolving, and failure to comply with such laws and regulations could harm our business, financial conditions and results of operations,” “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Operational Factors—We rely on third-party payment processors to process payments made by riders and payments made to drivers on our platform, and if we cannot manage our relationships with such third parties and other payment-related risks, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected,” “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Regulatory and Legal Factors—Changes in laws or regulations relating to privacy, data protection or the protection or transfer of personal data, or any actual or perceived failure by us to comply with such laws and regulations or any other obligations relating to privacy, data protection or the protection or transfer of personal data, could 
adversely affect our business”, “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Regulatory and Legal Factors—We face the risk of litigation resulting from unauthorized text messages sent in violation of the Telephone Consumer Protection Act” and “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Regulatory and Legal Factors—Climate change may have a long-term impact on our business” for additional information about the laws and regulations we are subject to and the risks to our business associated with such laws and regulations.
Human Capital
Our employees are our human capital and they are our greatest strength and most valuable resource. As of December 31, 2021, we had 4,453 employees in approximately 119 offices and additional locations, including Driver Hubs, Driver Centers, and Service Desks. Approximately 40% of our employees work in our product management, engineering, design and science organizations. Our employees are passionate about our mission to improve people’s lives with the world’s best transportation.
We believe that achieving more diversity in workforce representation is an important priority. We are a company with a diverse customer base, and the more our employees reflect that diversity, the better we can serve our customers, ultimately making our business stronger. As of December 31, 2021, our employee base was 59% male and 39% female, and women represented 37% of our leadership overall. The ethnicity of our U.S. employees was 44% White, 30% Asian, 11% Hispanic or Latinx, 8% Black, and 5% two or more races, American Indian, Alaska Native, Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander. Our employee gender and ethnicity information is based on self-identification, and employees who did not disclose their gender or ethnicity have been excluded from the applicable disclosure. As of December 31, 2021, employees who did not disclose gender represented approximately 2% of total employees, and employees who did not disclose ethnicity represented approximately 2% of total U.S. employees. 
We strive to build a more representative workforce which requires an intentional and comprehensive effort to reach and recruit outstanding candidates, develop talent internally, and open up pathways for advancement. We launched initiatives such as requiring all director level and above roles to consider at least one woman and one Black or Latinx candidate at the onsite interview stage. We are continuing to focus on scaling and sustaining diverse partnerships and early candidate pipeline development as we believe recruiting and hiring initiatives can yield short and long-term benefits to the organization.
One of the most powerful examples of Lyft’s devotion to inclusivity is our ongoing commitment to pay fairness. We conducted an annual pay equity audit for our fifth consecutive year to assess for any systemic issues in our compensation. We worked with third party experts to conduct statistical tests on a majority of U.S. based team members’ annual salary, equity awards, and total compensation at hire. The goal was to identify whether any statistically significant pay differences existed between different demographic (gender and race) groups in the same band, level and job family. Where our analysis identified differences, we investigated, including looking at factors not accounted for in the statistical models we used. In 2021, we did not find patterns of statistically significant pay differences for different gender or racial groups after accounting for legitimate business factors like performance, experience, and location. 
Given continued uncertainty and as we recognize our remote work policy must be broadened, we have given many employees the option to work from home. 
None of our employees are represented by a labor union. We have not experienced any work stoppages, and we believe that our employee relations are strong. 
In December 2020, we released our 2020 Inclusion, Diversity and Racial Equity Report, which is available on our website. We have presented this report since 2017 and intend to continue to present this report to make available certain information about our diversity and inclusion efforts.
Environmental, Social and Corporate Governance
In May 2021, we released our 2021 Environmental, Social, and Corporate Governance Report, which is available on our website. We began publishing this report in 2020 and intend to continue to prepare this report annually to make available key information about our work toward environmental, social, and economic issues.
Environmental
Lyft was founded on the belief that technology will enable us to dramatically reduce carbon emissions from the transportation system. Our vision is to rebuild cities around people by offering seamless access through the Lyft App to on-demand rides, public transit, and car rentals as well as lower-carbon micromobility modes. As another step in the shift from personal car ownership, we’ve also launched Lyft Pink, our premier membership program, which offers discounted pricing for rideshare, bikes, and scooters, in addition to perks for car rentals.
We launched our national Resilient Streets Initiative in September 2020 and offered a vision for how cities can safely and efficiently move the greatest number of people as economic, educational and social activities resume in our cities. The initiative reimagined what a “resilient street corridor” might look like in cities where Lyft operates micromobility services. It also investigated the impact of street design on key metrics around vehicle miles traveled, socioeconomic demographics and GHG emissions.
Because we stand at a pivotal moment in the fight against climate change, Lyft made the commitment to reach 100% EVs on the Lyft Platform by the end of 2030. By working with drivers to transition to EVs, we have the potential to avoid tens of millions of metric tons of GHG emissions to the atmosphere and to reduce gasoline consumption by more than a billion gallons over the next decade. This is in line with the Clean Miles Standard and Incentive Program which was approved by the California Air Resources Board in May 2021 and sets the target that ninety percent of rideshare miles in California must be in EVs by the end of 2030. The shift to 100% EVs will mean transitioning all vehicles used on the Lyft platform over the next decade to all-electric or other zero-emission technologies. This includes cars in Express Drive, Lyft Rentals, Lyft Autonomous, and personal cars used by drivers on the Lyft platform. Switching to EVs is not just good for the planet; it’s good for people – riders, drivers, and the communities they serve.
Social
We approach working with our partners, cities and municipalities in a collaborative manner and seek to establish mutually beneficial relationships based on trust, respect and a common objective of improving people’s lives by improving transportation. Through our LyftUp initiative, we’re working to enable access to affordable, reliable transportation for all — no matter income or zip code. We built LyftUp to account for those still left behind. LyftUp aims to bridge some of the most serious outstanding transportation gaps. Through our LyftUp programs, we partner with leading organizations, including government agencies and nonprofits, to provide access to free and discounted car, bike and scooter rides to individuals and families in need. LyftUp programs included:
•Jobs Access - provides rides to and from job interviews, job trainings and/or the first few weeks of a new job;
•Grocery Access - provides rides to and from the grocery store for families living in certain areas without sufficient grocery store access;
•Community Grants Program - awards ride credits to hyperlocal nonprofit organizations across the country making a difference in their communities;
•Micromobility Access - provides deeply discounted bikeshare and scooter-share memberships for eligible applicants who qualify for federal, state or local assistance programs;
•Universal Vaccine Access Campaign - mobilizes a coalition of partners to provide rides to and from COVID-19 vaccination sites for low-income, underinsured and at-risk communities; 
•Disaster Response - provides rides to access vital services both leading up to and in the wake of disasters and other local emergencies when roads are safe to do so; and
•Voting Access - provides rides to the polls during Federal elections, with a focus on supporting individuals who traditionally face barriers to voting, such as seniors, veterans and communities of color.
In response to the passage of Texas Senate Bill 8 (“SB8”) which raised concerns that drivers could be sued simply for transporting passengers, Lyft created a Driver Legal Defense Fund to cover 100% of legal fees for drivers sued under SB8 while driving on our platform. We also donated $1 million to Planned Parenthood to help ensure that transportation is never a barrier to healthcare access. Drivers using Lyft are never responsible for monitoring where their riders go or why. Similarly, riders should never have to justify or share where they are going or why.
Corporate Governance
Our board of directors regularly evaluates our corporate governance structure and processes to help steer the company's direction and ensure it is operating with the utmost business integrity. More information about our directors, executive officers and corporate governance will be included in our definitive Proxy Statement for our 2022 Annual Meeting of Stockholders.
