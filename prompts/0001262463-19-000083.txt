In early 2017, management suspended its food and machinery sales business in favor of capitalizing on the growing Acer truncatum industry within China and decided that it would to direct efforts towards its Acer truncatum plantation operations during 2017.
 As of the date of this Current Report on Form 10-K, the Company employs a staff of 38 people and is located in Chongqing Municipality at Room 1702, Building 2, No. 301, Yunan Avenue, Banan District, Chongqing, China 401320.
 
Products and Market
 
Chongqing CAT9 operates Acer truncatum plantations and operations in China. Acer truncatum is a maple tree known as the “Shangtung maple” which is native to China that contains an extract from its leaves and seeds called Nervonic acid, or bunge seed oil. The tree itself typically grows 20-25 feet tall, blooms in the month of April, and is primarily a full sun to part shade tree. It is the principal extract of the Acer truncatum plant which Acer truncatum oil is derived. Nervonic acid is a rich omega-9 fatty acid that is known to be beneficial to memory related brain health, anti-aging, blood lipid regulation, and anti-fatigue symptoms. There are a few alternate sources where nervonic acid can be derived, however at much less yield than from an Acer truncatum plant.

CAT9 also seeks to establish five (5) additional planting bases of 350 acres each. These bases will become a CAT9 Group asset over years which we will seek to manage and develop to include land acquisitions, planting, and maintenance. In addition, we are planning to contract approximately 17,000 acres of existing forestry with local individuals, organizations and or provincial governments to insure our supply of raw materials. We are also planning to invest further into our research and development (R&D) to improve our processing yield of Acer truncatum and nervonic acid. This includes the research and development of planting technology, products, and process technology. We also plan to increase our spending on our information systems; we will seek to invest in a fully integrated information system to monitor crop production, fertilization, irrigation, and harvesting yield. We will also add quality control measures, POS systems, packaging, logistics, and e-commerce systems. A JIT (just in time) system to monitor inventory and critical path raw material requirements will also be implemented as well as a sourcing and seasonal cost data base of all suppliers for efficient and cost effective purchasing.
 
Our funds are kept in both financial institutions located in Hong Kong (“HK”) and the PRC, the latter does not provide insurance for amounts on deposit. Moreover, we are subject to the regulations of the PRC, which restrict the transfer of cash from the PRC, except under certain specific circumstances. Accordingly, such funds may not be readily available to us to satisfy obligations which have been incurred outside the PRC.
 We generally finance our operations through operating profit and borrowings from our directors. As of the date of this Form 10-K Annual Report, we have not experienced any difficulties due to a shortage of capital, we have not experienced any difficulty in raising funds through loans from banks, outside parties and financial institutions, and we have not experienced any liquidity problems in settling our payables in the normal course of business and repaying our loans when they come due. We are unaware of any trends, demands, commitments events or uncertainties that will result or be likely to result in material changes in our liquidity.

We believe that the level of financial resources is a significant factor for our future development and accordingly, we may determine from time to time to raise capital through private debt or equity financing to strengthen our financial position, to expand our facilities and to provide us with additional flexibility to take advantage of business opportunities. No assurances can be given that we will be successful in raising such additional capital on terms acceptable to us.

Risks Related to Our Business and Industry
 
We are a relatively new entrant in the Acer truncatum industry. In early 2017, our management believed that economic opportunities for the Company were favorable in the Acer truncatum industry and has established a presence with the signing of several plantation agreements. There is considerable risk in the Acer truncatum industry and there can be no assurance that we will be successful in our endeavor to lease additional land, or purchase and harvest additional Acer truncatum trees. There is also no assurances that if we are unsuccessful in our Acer truncatum business that we can pivot our company and re-engage our food distribution and farm equipment sales business.
 
Acer truncatum is claimed to have nutritional and health benefits but we cannot assure you that all or any of the claims made by others are accurate.
 
Acer truncatum’s health benefits are claimed by studies and users of its extracted oil. These users generally use Acer truncatum products due to word of mouth or other advertising by manufacturers of the product. Additionally, there are little to no restrictions or health regulations on Acer truncatum in China at this time. The Chinese Food and Drug Administration or State Food and Drug Administration (SFDA) of China has not opined on Acer truncatum at this time. While there are some resources that claim through abstract writings that there are health benefits that support brain health by way of high levels of nervonic acid found in Acer truncatum oil, the Company cannot make any assurances that these claims are in any way completely accurate. Claims have been made by various sources that Nervonic acid can repair damaged brain nerve pathways and promote the regeneration of nerve cells, used to treat schizophrenia, psychosis, peroxisomal disorders, diabetes, alcoholism and other conditions.
 
Management has not commissioned any third party reports to support any basis to these claims; however, it is management’s personal belief that the nature of these claims made by independent studies is credible.

We are subject to natural disasters.
 
Acer truncatum trees are generally strong and adaptable but can be damaged by harsh weather, diseases and crop pests. If our crops are damaged by natural disasters such as floods, drought, storms, or other farming risks, our business may suffer and our investors may lose their entire investment. Additionally, there are no known serious insect or disease problems that afflict Acer truncatum trees.
 
Increased Chinese government regulation of our production capacity and/or our sales and marketing operations could impact our business.
 
There are presently no significant Chinese government regulations of the health claims made by the participants in the Acer truncatum business regarding their products. Additionally, there are limited government regulations over the conditions under which we manufacture our products. While other countries such as the United States and the European Union have extensive regulations of nutraceutical and plant-based products, including strict health-related claims, there are no current regulations in China to the degree of these other countries.
 
Our business is reliant on retaining and hiring key personnel that are in high demand in China.
 
We operate within an intensely competitive environment for key personnel in such areas as biologists, chemists, technicians, production supervisors, and sales and marketing personnel. If we are unable to fulfill these roles as we grow as a company, our future success will be severely impaired, and we will be unable to implement our business plan.
 
We may have difficulty establishing adequate management and financial controls in China.
 
During the course of our fiscal year 2018, we have added several employees with public company experience from Fortune 500 and multinational foreign firms in areas of financial management and administration, however, China has only recently begun to adopt the management and financial reporting concepts and practices that investors in the United States are familiar with. We may have difficulty in hiring and retaining employees in China who have the experience necessary to implement the kind of management and financial controls that are expected for a United States public company. Despite our record as a fully-reporting company on Edgar since February 6, 2015, if we cannot continue to maintain such controls, we may experience difficulty in collecting financial data and preparing financial statements, books of account and corporate records and instituting business practices that meet U.S. standards.
 
Our success depends on collaborative partners, licensees and other third parties over whom we have limited control.
 
We have made a number of agreements to lease land to develop plantations for our Acer truncatum trees with third parties. To the extent we enter into these agreements, we cannot assure you that we will not encounter discourse or problems that may lead to loss of production. Additionally, due to the nature of the process of developing these plantations, we require arrangements with manufacturing facilities, marketing and commercialization partners of our products. There are no assurances that we will be able to establish or maintain collaborations that are important to our business on favorable terms, or at all.
 
A number of risks may arise from the Company's dependence on collaborative agreements with third parties. Product development and commercialization efforts could be adversely affected if any collaborative partner:
 

• | terminates or suspends its agreement with us; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------
• | causes delays; 
• | fails to timely develop or manufacture in adequate quantities;
• | otherwise fails to meet its contractual obligations. 


12
--


• | Our collaborative partners could pursue other technologies or develop alternative products that could compete with the products we are developing.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We have limited business insurance coverage.
 
We do not have any business liability or disruption insurance coverage for our operations in China. Any business disruption, litigation or natural disaster may result in our incurring substantial costs and the diversion of our resources.
 
Price controls may affect both our revenues and net income.
 
The laws of the PRC provide for the government to fix and adjust prices. To the extent that we are subject to price control, our revenue, gross profit, gross margin and net income will be affected since the revenue we derive from our sales will be limited and, unless there is also price control on the products that we purchase from our suppliers, we may face no limitation on our costs. Further, if price controls affect both our revenue and our costs, our ability to be profitable and the extent of our profitability will be effectively subject to determination by the applicable regulatory authorities in the PRC.
 
Our operations may not develop in the same way or at the same rate as might be expected if the PRC economy were similar to the totally market-oriented economies of member countries of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development ("OECD").
 
The economy of the PRC has historically been a nationalistic, "planned economy," meaning it functions and produces according to governmental plans and pre-set targets or quotas. In certain aspects, the PRC's economy has been making a transition to a more market-oriented economy, although the government imposes price controls on certain products and in certain industries. However, we cannot predict the future direction of these economic reforms or the effects these measures may have. The economy of the PRC also differs from the economies of most countries belonging to the OECD, an international group of member countries sharing a commitment to democratic government and market economy. For instance:
 

• | the level of state-owned enterprises in the PRC, as well as the level of governmental control over the allocation of resources is greater than in most of the countries belonging to the OECD; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• | the level of capital reinvestment is lower in the PRC than in other countries that are members of the OECD; 
• | the government of the PRC has a greater involvement in general in the economy and the economic structure of industries within the PRC than other countries belonging to the OECD; 
• | the government of the PRC imposes price controls on certain products and our products may become subject to additional price controls; and 
• | the PRC has various impediments in place that make it difficult for foreign firms to obtain local currency, unlike other countries belonging to the OECD where exchange of currencies is generally free from restriction.

 
As a result of these differences, our business may not develop in the same way or at the same rate as might be expected if the economy of the PRC were similar to those of the OECD member countries.
 
Our failure to effectively manage growth could harm our business.
 
We have rapidly and significantly expanded our operations since our inception and will endeavor to further expand our operations in the future. Any additional significant growth in the market for our services or our entry into new markets may require and expansion of our employee base for managerial, operational, financial, sales and marketing and other purposes.
  
13
--

 
During any growth, we may face problems related to our operational and financial systems and controls, including quality control and service capacities. We would also need to continue to expand, train and manage our employee base. Continued future growth will impose significant added responsibilities upon the members of management to identify, recruit, maintain, integrate, and motivate new employees.
 
Aside from increased difficulties in the management of human resources, we may also encounter working capital issues, as we will need increased liquidity to hire additional employees. For effective growth management, we will be required to continue improving our operations, management, and financial systems and controls. Our failure to manage growth effectively may lead to operational and financial inefficiencies that will have a negative effect on our profitability. We cannot assure investors that we will be able to timely and effectively meet that demand and maintain the quality standards required by our existing and potential customers.
 
We may pursue future growth through strategic acquisitions and alliances which may not yield anticipated benefits and may adversely affect our operating results, financial condition and existing business.
 
We may seek to grow in the future through strategic acquisitions in order to complement and expand our business. The success of our acquisition strategy will depend on, among other things:


• | the availability of suitable candidates;
--+-----------------------------------------


• | competition from other companies for the purchase of available candidates;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | our ability to value those candidates accurately and negotiate favorable terms for those acquisitions;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the availability of funds to finance acquisitions;
--+---------------------------------------------------


• | the ability to establish new informational, operational and financial systems to meet the needs of our business;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the ability to achieve anticipated synergies, including with respect to complementary products or services; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the availability of management resources to oversee the integration and operation of the acquired businesses.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


If we are not successful in integrating acquired businesses and completing acquisitions in the future, we may be required to reevaluate our acquisition strategy. We also may incur substantial expenses and devote significant management time and resources in seeking to complete acquisitions. Acquired businesses may fail to meet our performance expectations. If we do not achieve the anticipated benefits of an acquisition as rapidly as expected, or at all, investors or analysts may not perceive the same benefits of the acquisition as we do. If these risks materialize, our stock price could be materially adversely affected.

We face risks related to natural disasters, terrorist attacks or other unpredictable events in China which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. 
 
Our business could be materially and adversely affected by natural disasters, terrorist attacks or other events in China where all of our operations are located. For example, in early 2008, parts of China suffered a wave of strong snow storms that severely impacted public transportation systems. In May 2008, Sichuan Province in China suffered a strong earthquake measuring approximately 8.0 on the Richter scale that caused widespread damage and casualties. The May 2008 Sichuan earthquake has had a material adverse effect on the general economic conditions in the areas affected by the earthquake. The occurrence of any future disasters such as earthquakes, fires, floods, wars, terrorist attacks, computer viruses, transportation disasters or other events, or our information system or communications network breaks down or operates improperly as a result of such events, our facilities may be seriously damaged, and we may have to stop or delay operations. We may incur expenses relating to such damages, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. 
 We may adopt an equity incentive plan under which we may grant securities to compensate employees and other services providers, which would result in increased share-based compensation expenses and, therefore, reduce net income.
 We may adopt an equity incentive plan under which we may grant shares or options to qualified employees. Under current accounting rules, we would be required to recognize share-based compensation as compensation expense in our statement of operations, based on the fair value of equity awards on the date of the grant, and recognize the compensation expense over the period in which the recipient is required to provide service in exchange for the equity award. We have not made any such grants in the past, and accordingly our results of operations have not contained any share-based compensation charges. The additional expenses associated with share-based compensation may reduce the attractiveness of issuing stock options under an equity incentive plan that we may adopt in the future. If we grant equity compensation to attract and retain key personnel, the expenses associated with share-based compensation may adversely affect our net income. However, if we do not grant equity compensation, we may not be able to attract and retain key personnel or be forced to expend cash or other compensation instead. Furthermore, the issuance of equity awards would dilute the shareholders’ ownership interests in our company.
 If we are unable to maintain or expand our sales and marketing capabilities, and attract and retain skilled personnel, we may not be able to generate anticipated revenues.
 Increasing our customer base and penetrating our target markets will depend to a significant extent on our ability to expand our sales and marketing operations and activities. We expect to be largely dependent on our sales force to obtain new customers. We also expect to be highly dependent on skilled computer programmers. Competition for both are intense, and we may not be able to attract, integrate sufficient highly qualified personnel.
  Our failure to obtain capital may significantly restrict our proposed operations.
 We will need to raise more capital to expand our business. Future sources of capital may not be available to us when we need it or may be available only on unacceptable terms.
 
We are subject to the risk that certain key personnel, including key employees named below, on whom we depend, in part, for our operations, will cease to be involved with us. The loss of any these individuals would adversely affect our financial condition and the results of our operations.
 
We are dependent on the experience, knowledge, skill and expertise of our President, CEO, Chairman, Wenfa “Simon” Sun. We are also in large part dependent on Meihong, “Sanya” Qian, our CFO and Secretary. The loss of any of the key personnel listed above could materially and adversely affect our future business efforts. Our success depends in substantial part upon the services, efforts and abilities of Wenfa “Simon” Sun, due to his experience, history and knowledge of the agricultural industry and his overall insight into our business direction. The loss or our failure to retain Mr. Sun, or Ms. Qian, or to attract and retain additional qualified personnel, could adversely affect our operations. We do not currently carry key-man life insurance on any of our officers and have no present plans to obtain this insurance. See “Management.”

The lack of public company experience of our management team may put us at a competitive disadvantage.
 
As a company with a class of securities registered under the Exchange Act, we are subject to reporting and other legal, accounting, corporate governance, and regulatory requirements imposed by the Exchange Act and rules and regulations promulgated under the Exchange Act. Our President, Chairman and CEO has no public company experience and under the Federal securities laws of the United States and rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, which could impair our ability to comply with these legal, accounting, and regulatory requirements. Such responsibilities include complying with Federal securities laws and making required disclosures on a timely basis. Our senior management may not be able to implement and effect programs and policies in an effective and timely manner that adequately responds to such increased legal and regulatory compliance and reporting requirements. Our failure to do so could lead to the imposition of fines and penalties and further result in the deterioration of our business.
 
If we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls, our ability to provide accurate financial statements and comply with the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 could be impaired, which could cause our stock price to decrease substantially if we succeed in becoming a publicly-traded company.
 
We have committed limited personnel and resources to the development of the external reporting and compliance obligations that would be required for a public company. Recently, we have taken measures to address and improve our financial reporting and compliance capabilities and we are in the process of instituting changes to satisfy our obligations in connection with becoming a publicly-traded company. We plan to obtain additional financial and accounting resources to support and enhance our ability to meet the requirements of being a publicly-traded company. We will need to continue to improve our financial and managerial controls, reporting systems and procedures, and documentation thereof. If our financial and managerial controls, reporting systems or procedures fail, we may not be able to provide accurate financial statements on a timely basis or comply with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 as it applies to us. Any failure of our internal controls or our ability to provide accurate financial statements could cause the trading price of our common stock to decrease substantially upon trading as a publicly-traded company. We have implemented, or plan to implement, the measures described below under the supervision and guidance of our management to remediate the above control deficiencies and to strengthen our internal controls over financial reporting. Key elements of the remediation effort include, but are not limited to, the following initiatives, which have been implemented, or are in the process of implementation, as of the date of filing of this Annual Report:
 

• | We have increased efforts to enforce internal control procedures. We have also reorganized the structure of our accounting department in China and clarified the responsibilities of each key personnel in order to increase communications and accountability. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• | We have recruited and will continue to bring in additional qualified financial personnel for the accounting department to further strengthen our China financial reporting function. 
• | We continually review and improve our standardization of our monthly and quarterly data collection, analysis, and reconciliation procedures. 
• | We plan on significantly increasing the level of communication and interaction among our China management, independent auditors, our directors of the Board, and other external advisors. 
• | We are making progress on engaging qualified internal control consultants to help us comply with internal control obligations, including Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. We also plan to dedicate sufficient resources to implement required internal control procedures.

 
If our financial and managerial controls, reporting systems or procedures fail, we may not be able to provide accurate financial statements on a timely basis or comply with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 as it applies to us. Any failure of our internal controls or our ability to provide accurate financial statements could cause the trading price of our common stock to decrease substantially.

Competition
 The Acer truncatum industry in China is highly competitive with competitors from larger enterprises to smaller farmers. The company also competes with various distribution methods such as online sales through mobile applications and internet websites.
Strategy
 Our goal is to become a leading provider of Acer truncatum-based products in China by offering select options for consumer consumption by way of edible cooking oils, capsules, nutrients, and other value-added solutions containing Acer truncatum extract.
Risks Related To Us Doing Business in China 
 
As substantially all of our assets are located in the PRC and all of our revenues are derived from our operations in China, changes in the political and economic policies of the PRC government could have a significant impact upon the business we may be able to conduct in the PRC and accordingly on the results of our operations and financial condition.
 
Our business operations may be adversely affected by the current and future political environment in the PRC. The Chinese government exerts substantial influence and control over the manner in which we must conduct our business activities. Our ability to operate in China may be adversely affected by changes in Chinese laws and regulations, including those relating to taxation, import and export tariffs, raw materials, environmental regulations, land use rights, property and other matters. Under the current government leadership, the government of the PRC has been pursuing economic reform policies that encourage private economic activity and greater economic decentralization. There is no assurance, however, that the government of the PRC will continue to pursue these policies, or that it will not significantly alter these policies from time to time without notice.
 
Our operations are subject to PRC laws and regulations that are sometimes vague and uncertain. Any changes in such PRC laws and regulations, or the interpretations thereof, may have a material and adverse effect on our business.
 
The PRC’s legal system is a civil law system based on written statutes. Decided legal cases do not have so much value as precedent in China as those in the common law system prevalent in the United States. There are substantial uncertainties regarding the interpretation and application of PRC laws and regulations, including but not limited to, governmental approvals required for conducting business and investments, laws and regulations governing the advertising industry, as well as commercial, antitrust, patent, product liability, environmental laws and regulations, consumer protection, and financial and business taxation laws and regulations.
 The Chinese government has been developing a comprehensive system of commercial laws, and considerable progress has been made in introducing laws and regulations dealing with economic matters. However, because these laws and regulations are relatively new, and because of the limited volume of published cases and judicial interpretation and their lack of force as precedents, interpretation and enforcement of these laws and regulations involve significant uncertainties.
 Our PRC subsidiaries, CQC9, is considered a foreign invested enterprise under PRC laws, and as a result is required to comply with PRC laws and regulations, including laws and regulations specifically governing the activities and conduct of foreign invested enterprises. We cannot predict what effect the interpretation of existing or new PRC laws or regulations may have on our businesses. If the relevant authorities find us in violation of PRC laws or regulations, they would have broad discretion in dealing with such a violation, including, without limitation:
 
• | levying fines;
--+---------------


• | revoking our business license, other licenses or authorities;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------


17
--


• | requiring that we restructure our ownership or operations; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------


• | requiring that we discontinue any portion or all of our business.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Investors may experience difficulties in effecting service of legal process, enforcing foreign judgments or bringing original actions in China based upon U.S. laws, including the federal securities laws or other foreign laws against us or our management.
 
All of our current operations are conducted in China. Moreover, all of our directors and officers are nationals and residents of China. All or substantially all of the assets of these persons are located outside the United States and in the PRC. As a result, it may not be possible to effect service of process within the United States or elsewhere outside China upon these persons. In addition, uncertainty exists as to whether the courts of China would recognize or enforce judgments of U.S. courts obtained against us or such officers and/or directors predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the securities laws of the United States or any state thereof, or be competent to hear original actions brought in China against us or such persons predicated upon the securities laws of the United States or any state thereof.
 
Contract drafting, interpretation and enforcement in China involves significant uncertainty.
 
We have entered into numerous contracts governed by PRC law, many of which are material to our business. As compared with contracts in the United States, contracts governed by PRC law tend to contain less detail and are not as comprehensive in defining contracting parties’ rights and obligations. As a result, contracts in China are more vulnerable to disputes and legal challenges. In addition, contract interpretation and enforcement in China is not as developed as in the United States, and the result of any contract dispute is subject to significant uncertainties. Therefore, we cannot assure you that we will not be subject to disputes under our material contracts, and if such disputes arise, we cannot assure you that we will prevail.
 
Recent PRC regulations relating to acquisitions of PRC companies by foreign entities may create regulatory uncertainties that could restrict or limit our ability to operate. Our failure to obtain the prior approval of the China Securities Regulatory Commission, or the CSRC, for our planned public offering and the listing and trading of our common stock could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, reputation and trading price of our common stock if and when we become trading.
 
The PRC State Administration of Foreign Exchange, or “SAFE,” issued a public notice in November 2005, known as Circular 75, which has become null and void and has been replaced by Circular (2014) 37, issued on 14 July, 2014, concerning the use of offshore holding companies controlled by PRC residents in mergers and acquisitions in China. This circular requires that (1) a PRC resident shall register with a local branch of the SAFE before he or she establishes or controls an overseas special purpose vehicle, or SPV, for the purpose of overseas equity financing (including convertible debt financing);(2) when a PRC resident contributes the assets of or his or her equity interests in a domestic enterprise to an SPV, or engages in overseas financing after contributing assets or equity interests to an SPV, such PRC resident must register his or her interest in the SPV and any changes in such interest with a local branch of the SAFE; and (3) when the SPV undergoes a material change regarding to PRC resident, such as a change in share capital or merger or acquisition, the PRC resident shall, register such change with a local branch of the SAFE. In addition, SAFE issued updated internal implementing rules, or the Implementing Rules in relation to Circular 37. However, there exist uncertainties regarding the SAFE registration for PRC residents’ interests in overseas companies. If any PRC resident stockholder of a SPV fails to make the required SAFE registration and amended registration, the onshore PRC subsidiaries of that offshore company may be prohibited from distributing their profits and the proceeds from any reduction in capital, share transfer or liquidation to the offshore entity. Failure to comply with the SAFE registration and amendment requirements described above could result in liability under PRC laws for evasion of applicable foreign exchange restrictions. Because of uncertainty in how Circular 37 will be interpreted and enforced, we cannot be sure how it will affect our business operations or future plans. For example, CQFI's ability to conduct foreign exchange activities, such as the remittance of dividends and foreign currency-denominated borrowings, may be subject to compliance with Circular 37 by our PRC resident beneficial

holders over whom we have no control. In addition, we cannot assure you that such PRC residents will be able to complete the necessary approval and registration procedures required by the SAFE regulations. Failure by any PRC resident beneficial holder to register as required with the relevant branch of SAFE could subject these PRC resident beneficial holders to fines or legal sanctions, restrict our overseas or cross-border investment activities, limit CQFI's ability to make distributions or pay dividends or affect our ownership structure, which could adversely affect our business and prospects.
 
On August 8, 2006, the PRC Ministry of Commerce (“MOFCOM”), joined by the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission of the State Council, the State Administration of Taxation, the State Administration for Industry and Commerce, the China Securities Regulatory Commission and SAFE, released a substantially amended version of the Provisions for Foreign Investors to Merge with or Acquire Domestic Enterprises (the “Revised M&A Regulations”), which took effect on September 8, 2006 and was further amended on June 22, 2009. These new rules significantly revised China’s regulatory framework governing onshore-to -offshore restructurings and foreign acquisitions of domestic enterprises. These new rules signify greater PRC government attention to cross-border merger, acquisition and other investment activities, by confirming MOFCOM as a key regulator for issues related to mergers and acquisitions in China and requiring MOFCOM approval of a broad range of merger, acquisition and investment transactions. Further, the new rules establish reporting requirements for acquisition of control by foreigners of companies in key industries, and reinforce the ability of the Chinese government to monitor and prohibit foreign control transactions in key industries.
 
Among other things, the Revised M&A Regulations include new provisions that purport to require that an offshore special purpose vehicle, or SPV, formed for listing purposes and controlled directly or indirectly by PRC companies or individuals must obtain the approval of the CSRC prior to the listing and trading of such SPV’s securities on an overseas stock exchange. On September 21, 2006, the CSRC published on its official website procedures specifying documents and materials required to be submitted to it by SPVs seeking CSRC approval of their overseas listings. However, the application of this PRC regulation remains unclear with no consensus currently existing among the leading PRC law firms regarding the scope and applicability of the CSRC approval requirement. Our PRC counsel, Hubei Taoshi Law Firm, believes that it is uncertain whether the transaction is subject to CSRC’s approval, and in reality, many other similar companies have completed similar transactions like the share exchange and private placement contemplated under the Exchange Agreement without CSRC’s approval and our PRC legal counsel is not aware of any situation in which the CSRC has imposed a punishment or penalty in connection with any such transactions. However, if the CSRC or other PRC Government Agencies subsequently determine that CSRC approval is required for the share exchange and private placement contemplated under the Exchange Agreement, we may face material regulatory actions or other sanctions from the CSRC or other PRC Government Agencies.
 
If the CSRC or another PRC regulatory agency subsequently determines that CSRC approval was required for our restructuring, we may face regulatory actions or other sanctions from the CSRC or other PRC regulatory agencies. These regulatory agencies may impose fines and penalties on our operations in the PRC, limit our operating privileges in the PRC, or take other actions that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, reputation and prospects, as well as the trading price of our common stock.
 
According to the Revised M&A Regulations and other PRC rules regarding foreign exchange, an offshore company’s shares can be used as consideration for the acquisition of a domestic PRC company’s equity by foreign investors only under very limited circumstances. Prior approval from the MOFCOM must be obtained before such a share exchange can be done. If relevant PRC government authorities deem a future acquisition of a domestic PRC company’s equity by us or our offshore subsidiary using our common stock or other types of our securities as consideration to be a transaction subject to the Revised M&A Regulations, complying with the requirements of this regulation to complete such transactions could be time- consuming and any required approval processes, including obtaining approval from the MOFCOM, may delay or inhibit our ability to complete such transactions. Any delay or inability to obtain applicable approvals to complete acquisitions could affect our ability to expand our business or maintain our market share. However, the application of the Revised M&A Regulations remains unclear and it is uncertain whether a future acquisition of a domestic PRC company’s equity by our domestic PRC subsidiaries using our common stock or other types of our securities as consideration will be subject to such regulations.
 
Also, if later the CSRC requires that we obtain its approval, we may be unable to obtain a waiver of the CSRC approval requirements, if and when procedures are established to obtain such a waiver. Any uncertainties and/or negative publicity regarding this CSRC approval requirement could have a material adverse effect on the trading price of our common stock. It is uncertain that CSRC is or will be curtailing or suspending overseas listings for Chinese private companies.

It is uncertain how our business operations or future strategy will be affected by the interpretations and implementation of Circular 37 and the Revised M&A Regulations. It is anticipated that application of the new rules will be subject to significant administrative interpretation, and we will need to closely monitor how MOFCOM, SAFE, CSRC and other ministries apply the rules to ensure that our domestic and offshore activities continue to comply with PRC law. Given the uncertainties regarding interpretation and application of the new rules, we may need to expend significant time and resources to maintain compliance with such rules.
 
If the land use rights of our landlord are revoked, we would be forced to relocate operations.
 
Under Chinese law, land is owned by the state or rural collective economic organizations. The state issues to the land users the land use right certificate. Land use rights can be revoked and the land users could be forced to vacate at any time when redevelopment of the land is in the public interest. The public interest rationale is interpreted quite broadly and the process of land appropriation may be less than transparent. We limited land use rights and each of our facilities relies on land use rights of our landlords, and the loss of such rights would require us to identify and relocate our operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial conditions and results of operations.
 
We will not be able to complete an acquisition of prospective acquisition targets in the PRC unless their financial statements can be reconciled to U.S. generally accepted accounting principles in a timely manner.
 
Companies based in the PRC may not have properly kept financial books and records that may be reconciled with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. If we attempt to acquire a significant PRC target company and/or its assets, we would be required to obtain or prepare financial statements of the target that are prepared in accordance with and reconciled to U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Federal securities laws require that a business combination meeting certain financial significance tests require the public acquirer to prepare and file historical and/or pro forma financial statement disclosure with the SEC. These financial statements must be prepared in accordance with, or be reconciled to U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and the historical financial statements must be audited in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), or PCAOB. If a proposed acquisition target does not have financial statements that have been prepared in accordance with, or that can be reconciled to, U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and audited in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB, we will not be able to acquire that proposed acquisition target. These financial statement requirements may limit the pool of potential acquisition targets with which we may acquire and hinder our ability to expand our retail operations. Furthermore, if we consummate an acquisition and are unable to timely file audited financial statements and/or pro forma financial information required by the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), such as Item 9.01 of Form 8-K, we will be ineligible to use the SEC’s short-form registration statement on Form S-3 to raise capital, if we are otherwise eligible to use a Form S-3. If we are ineligible to use a Form S-3, the process of raising capital may be more expensive and time consuming and the terms of any offering transaction may not be as favorable as they would have been if we were eligible to use Form S-3.
 
We face uncertainty from China’s Circular on Strengthening the Administration of Enterprise Income Tax on Non-Resident Enterprises’ Share Transfer Income (“Circular 698”) that was released in December 2009 with retroactive effect from January 1, 2008.
 
The Chinese State Administration of Taxation (SAT) released a circular (Guoshuihan No. 698 – Circular 698) on December 10, 2009 that addresses the transfer of shares of Chinese resident companies by nonresident companies. Circular 698, which is effective retroactively to January 1, 2008, may have a significant impact on many companies that use offshore holding companies to invest in China. While, Circular 698 does not apply to shareholders who are individuals, the PRC authority has the discretion to determine whether these enterprise shareholders are treated as a resident enterprise. If such shareholders are recognized as non-resident enterprises, Circular 698 may have been applicable to the Share Exchange due to the transfer of shares of CAT9 Cayman, which Wenfa "Simon" Sun, or MeiHong "Sanya" Qian directly holds the equity interests of CQFI, the Company by such enterprise

shareholders. Circular 698 provides that where a non-resident enterprise investor indirectly transfers the equity of a PRC resident enterprise, if the overseas intermediary holding company being transferred by the non-resident enterprise is established in a country/region where the effective tax rate is less than 12.5% or which does not tax the overseas income of its residents, the non-resident enterprise must submit the required documents to the PRC tax authority in charge of the PRC resident enterprise within 30 days after the equity transfer agreement is concluded. {This clause has been terminated by Bulletin (2013)72} However, there is uncertainty as to the application of Circular 698. For example, while the term "indirectly transfer" is not defined, it is understood that the relevant PRC tax authorities have jurisdiction regarding requests for information over a wide range of foreign entities having no direct contact with China. Moreover, the relevant authority has not yet promulgated any formal provisions or formally declared or stated how to calculate the effective tax in the country or jurisdiction and to what extent and the process of the disclosure to the tax authority in charge of that Chinese resident enterprise. We have not provided any information to the relevant PRC tax authorities regarding the share exchange transaction.
 
We have sought the advice, but not an opinion, of PRC legal counsel regarding the application of and the risks associated with Circular 698. Circular 698, which provides parties with a short period of time to comply its requirements, indirectly taxes foreign companies on gains derived from the indirect sale of a Chinese company. It further provides that where a foreign investor indirectly transfers equity interests in a Chinese resident enterprise through an abuse of form of organization and there are no reasonable commercial purposes such that the corporate income tax liability is avoided, the PRC tax authority will have the power to re-assess the nature of the equity transfer in accordance with PRC’s “substance-over-form” principle and deny the existence of the offshore holding company that is used for tax planning purposes. However, there are no formal declarations with regard to how to decide “abuse of form of organization” and “reasonable commercial purpose,” which can be utilized by us to balance if our company complies with the Circular 698.
 
Due to the short history of the New EIT law and lack of applicable legal precedents, it remains unclear how the PRC tax authorities will determine the PRC tax resident treatment of our holding companies, CAT9 Cayman, a company organized under the laws of the Cayman Islands (“CAT9 Cayman”) and CAT9 China Investment Limited, a company organized under the laws of Hong Kong (“CAT9 HK”). If we, CAT9 Cayman or CAT9 HK is determined to be a PRC resident enterprise by PRC tax authorities, Circular 698 will not be applicable to any direct or indirect transfer of our shareholdings in CQFI. If we, CAT9 Cayman or CAT9 HK is determined to be a non-resident enterprise by the PRC tax authorities and the direct or indirect transfer of our shareholdings in CQFI, is recognized by the tax authority in charge as the transfer of shares of Chinese resident companies by nonresident companies, we may become at risk of being taxed under Circular 698 and we may be required to expend valuable resources to comply with Circular 698 or to establish that we should not be taxed under Circular 698, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Because CAT9 HK, a Hong Kong company owns 100% of CQFI; CAT9 Cayman, a Cayman Islands company owns 100% of CAT9 HK; and the Company, a Delaware corporation, owns 100% of CAT9 Cayman, it is possible that Circular 698 could apply to any transfer of shares of the Company, CAT9 Cayman or CAT9 HK, as an indirect transfer of the equity of CQFI, if such transfers are not made through a public securities market or by individuals. If the PRC tax authority determines that Circular 698 applies to us, we will be obligated to make tax returns filings with the relevant PRC tax authority in accordance with PRC tax laws and regulations. Failure to do so will subject us to fines up to RMB10,000 ($1,471). Furthermore, if the PRC tax authority determines that our arrangement which resulted in the underpayment of taxes was done to evade taxation, in addition to paying all the underpaid taxes, we may be subject to further penalties including late fees, fines ranging from 50% to 500% of the underpaid taxes, and even criminal liabilities under grave circumstances.
 The foreign currency exchange rate between U.S. Dollars and Renminbi could adversely affect our financial condition.
 
Until 1994, the Renminbi experienced a gradual but significant devaluation against most major currencies, including dollars, and there was a significant devaluation of the Renminbi on January 1, 1994 in connection with the replacement of the dual exchange rate system with a unified managed floating rate foreign exchange system. Since 1994, the value of the Renminbi relative to the U.S. dollar has remained stable and has appreciated slightly against the U.S. Dollar. Countries, including the United States, have argued that the Renminbi is artificially undervalued due to China’s current monetary policies and have pressured China to allow the Renminbi to float freely in world markets. In July 2005, the PRC government changed its policy of pegging the value of the Renminbi to the U.S. dollar. Under the new policy the Renminbi is permitted to fluctuate within a narrow and managed band against a basket of designated foreign currencies. While the international reaction to the Renminbi revaluation has generally been positive, there remains significant international pressure on the PRC government to adopt an even more flexible currency policy, which could result in further and more significant appreciation of the Renminbi against the U.S. dollar.
 

21
--

 
As we may rely on dividends and other fees paid to us by our subsidiary and affiliated consolidated entities in China, any significant revaluation of the Renminbi may materially and adversely affect our cash flows, revenues, earnings and financial position, and the amount of, and any dividends payable on, our shares in U.S. dollars. To the extent that we need to convert U.S. dollars into Renminbi for our operations, appreciation of the Renminbi against the U.S. dollar would have an adverse effect on the Renminbi amount we would receive from the conversion. Conversely, if we decide to convert our Renminbi into U.S. dollars for the purpose of making payments for dividends on our shares or for other business purposes, appreciation of the U.S. dollar against the Renminbi would have a negative effect on the U.S. dollar amount available to us. In addition, since our functional and reporting currency is the U.S. dollar while the functional currency of our subsidiary and affiliated consolidated entities in China is Renminbi, appreciation or depreciation in the value of the Renminbi relative to the U.S. dollar would have a positive or negative effect on our reported financial results, which may not reflect any underlying change in our business, results of operations or financial condition.
 
Governmental control of currency conversion may limit our ability to utilize our revenues.
 
Substantially all of our revenues and expenses are denominated in Renminbi. Under PRC laws, the Renminbi is currently convertible under a company’s “current account,” which includes dividends, trade and service-related foreign exchange transactions, but not under the company’s “capital account,” which includes foreign direct investment and loans, without the prior approval of SAFE. SAFE reserves the discretion to deny the conversion of RMB into foreign currencies for capital account transactions. Currently our PRC subsidiary, CQC9, may purchase foreign currencies for settlement of current account transactions, including payments of dividends to us, without the approval of SAFE. Therefore, CQC9may convert the revenues it generates in RMB into other currencies, such as U.S. Dollars, for settlement of current account transactions without having to obtain approval from SAFE. However, foreign exchange transactions by CQC9under the capital account continue to be subject to significant foreign exchange controls and require the approval of or need to register with PRC governmental authorities, including SAFE. Therefore, CQC9 may not convert its sales revenues from RMB into other currencies for capital account transactions, such as to repay a loan, without first obtaining the approval of SAFE. If CQC9,borrows foreign currency loans from us or other foreign lenders, these loans must first be registered with the SAFE. If CQC9, a wholly foreign-owned enterprise, borrows foreign currency, the accumulative amount of its foreign currency loans shall not exceed the difference between the total investment and the registered capital of CQC9. If we finance CQC9, by means of additional capital contributions, these capital contributions must be approved by certain government authorities such as the Ministry of Commerce or its local counterparts. Additionally, the existing and future restrictions on currency exchange may affect the ability of our PRC subsidiary or affiliated entities to obtain foreign currencies, limit our ability to meet our foreign currency obligations, or otherwise materially and adversely affect our business.
 
Inflation in the PRC could negatively affect our profitability and growth.
 
While the PRC economy has experienced rapid growth, such growth has been uneven among various sectors of the economy and in different geographical areas of the country. Rapid economic growth can lead to growth in the money supply and rising inflation. According to the National Bureau of Statistics of China, the change in China’s Consumer Price Index increased to 8.5% in April 2008. If prices for our products and services rise at a rate that is insufficient to compensate for the rise in the costs of supplies such as raw materials, it may have an adverse effect on our profitability.
 
Furthermore, in order to control inflation in the past, the PRC government has imposed controls on bank credits, limits on loans for fixed assets and restrictions on state bank lending. In January 2010, the Chinese government took steps to tighten the availability of credit including ordering banks to increase the amount of reserves they hold and to reduce or limit their lending. The implementation of such policies may impede economic growth. In October 2004, the People’s Bank of China, the PRC’s central bank, raised interest rates for the first time in nearly a decade and indicated in a statement that the measure was prompted by inflationary concerns in the Chinese economy. In April 2006, the People’s Bank of China raised the interest rate again. Repeated rises in interest rates by the central bank would likely slow economic activity in China which could, in turn, materially increase our costs and also reduce demand for our products and services.

Because our funds are held in banks which do not provide insurance, the failure of any bank in which we deposit our funds could affect our ability to continue in business.
 
Banks and other financial institutions in the PRC do not provide insurance for funds held on deposit. A significant portion of our assets are in the form of cash deposited with banks in the PRC, and in the event of a bank failure, we may not have access to our funds on deposit. Depending upon the amount of money we maintain in a bank that fails, our inability to have access to our cash could impair our operations, and, if we are not able to access funds to pay our suppliers, employees and other creditors, we may be unable to continue in business.
 
Failure to comply with the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act could subject us to penalties and other adverse consequences.
 
As our ultimate holding company is a Delaware corporation, we are subject to the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which generally prohibits United States companies from engaging in bribery or other prohibited payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Foreign companies, including some that may compete with us, are not subject to these prohibitions. Corruption, extortion, bribery, pay-offs, theft and other fraudulent practices may occur from time-to-time in the PRC. We can make no assurance, however, that our employees or other agents will not engage in such conduct for which we might be held responsible. If our employees or other agents are found to have engaged in such practices, we could suffer severe penalties and other consequences that may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
 
If we make equity compensation grants to persons who are PRC citizens, they may be required to register with the State Administration of Foreign Exchange of the PRC, or SAFE. We may also face regulatory uncertainties that could restrict our ability to adopt an equity compensation plan for our directors and employees and other parties under PRC law.
 
On March 28, 2007, SAFE issued the “Operating Procedures for Administration of Domestic Individuals Participating in the Employee Stock Ownership Plan or Stock Option Plan of An Overseas Listed Company, also known as “Circular 78.” It is not clear whether Circular 78 covers all forms of equity compensation plans or only those which provide for the granting of stock options.
 
Domestic individuals who are granted shares or share options by companies listed on overseas stock exchanges based on the employee share option or share incentive plan are required to register with the State Administration of Foreign Exchange or its local counterparts. Pursuant to Circular 78, PRC individuals participating in the employee stock option plans of the overseas listed companies shall entrust their employers, including the overseas listed companies and the subsidiaries or branch offices of such offshore listed companies in China, or engage domestic agents to handle various foreign exchange matters associated with their employee stock options plans. The domestic agents or the employers shall, on behalf of the domestic individuals who have the right to exercise the employee stock options, apply annually to the State Administration of Foreign Exchange or its local offices for a quota for the conversion and/or payment of foreign currencies in connection with the domestic individuals’ exercise of the employee stock options. The foreign exchange proceeds received by the domestic individuals from sale of shares under the stock option plans granted by the overseas listed companies must be remitted into the bank accounts in China opened by their employers or PRC agents. If we adopt an equity compensation plan in the future and make option grants to our officers and directors, most of whom are PRC citizens, Circular 78 may require our officers and directors who receive option grants and are PRC citizens to register with SAFE.
 
We will comply with Circular 78 if we adopt an equity incentive plan. We believe that the registration and approval requirements contemplated in Circular 78 will be burdensome and time consuming. If it is determined that any of our equity compensation plans are subject to Circular 78, failure to comply with such provisions may subject our PRC subsidiary when it is deemed a domestic agent as defined under Circular 78 and participants of our incentive plan who are PRC citizens to fines and legal sanctions and may prevent us from being able to grant equity compensation to our PRC employees. If we are unable to compensate our PRC employees and directors through equity compensation, our business operations may be adversely affected.

Under the New EIT Law, we, CAT9 Cayman and CAT9 HK may be classified as “resident enterprises” of China for tax purposes, which may subject us, CAT9 Cayman and CAT9 HK to PRC income tax on taxable global income.
 
Under the new PRC Enterprise Income Tax Law (the “New EIT Law”) and its implementing rules, both of which became effective on January 1, 2008, enterprises are classified as resident enterprises and non-resident enterprises. An enterprise established outside of China with its “de facto management bodies” located within China is considered a “resident enterprise,” meaning that it can be treated in a manner similar to a Chinese domestic enterprise for enterprise income tax purposes. The implementing rules of the New EIT Law define de facto management body as a managing body that in practice exercises “substantial and overall management and control over the production and operations, personnel, accounting, and properties” of the enterprise. Due to the short history of the New EIT law and lack of applicable legal precedents, it remains unclear how the PRC tax authorities will determine the PRC tax resident treatment of a foreign company such as us, CAT9 Cayman and CAT9 HK. The Company has not sought the advice of PRC tax counsel regarding the risks associated with the New EIT Law. Because our CAT9 Cayman and CAT9 HK's members of management are located in China, we believe it is likely that we, CAT9 Cayman and CAT9 HK meet the qualifications of a “resident enterprise” and would be recognized as a Chinese “resident enterprise,” subject to the ultimate judgment of the PRC tax authority, based on the standard of “de facto management body”. “Resident enterprise” treatment would not have impacted the Company’s results since the New EIT Law’s effectiveness, as CAT9 Cayman and CAT9 HK have no taxable income and no dividends were paid by any of our subsidiaries, including CAT9 Cayman and CAT9 HK, CQC9. If the PRC tax authorities determine that we, CAT9 Cayman and CAT9 HK are collectively a “resident enterprise” for PRC enterprise income tax purposes, a number of PRC tax consequences could follow. First, we may be subject to the enterprise income tax at a rate of 25% on our worldwide taxable income, including interest income on the proceeds from this offering, as well as PRC enterprise income tax reporting obligations. The failure to pay such taxes will subject us to fines up to RMB10,000 ($1,471), and furthermore, if the PRC tax authority determines that our arrangement which resulted in the underpayment of taxes was done to evade taxation, in addition to paying all the underpaid taxes, we may be subject to further penalties including late fees, fines ranging from 50% to 500% of the underpaid taxes, and even criminal liabilities under grave circumstances. Second, the New EIT Law provides that dividend paid between “qualified resident enterprises” is exempted from enterprise income tax. A recent circular issued by the State Administration of Taxation on April 22, 2010, regarding the standards used to classify certain Chinese-invested enterprises controlled by Chinese enterprises or Chinese group enterprises and established outside of China as “resident enterprises” clarified that dividends and other income paid by such “resident enterprises” will be considered to be PRC source income, subject to PRC withholding tax, currently at a rate of 10%, when recognized by non-PRC shareholders. It is unclear whether the dividends that we, CAT9 Cayman and CAT9 HK receive from CQC9 will constitute dividends between “qualified resident enterprises” and would therefore qualify for tax exemption, because the definition of qualified resident enterprises is unclear and the relevant PRC government authorities have not yet issued guidance with respect to the processing of outbound remittances to entities that are treated as resident enterprises for PRC enterprise income tax purposes. We are actively monitoring the possibility of “resident enterprise” treatment for the applicable tax years and are evaluating appropriate organizational changes to avoid this treatment, to the extent possible. As a result of the New EIT Law, our historical operating results will not be indicative of our operating results for future periods and the value of our common stock may be adversely affected.
 
Dividends payable by us to our foreign investors and any gain on the sale of our shares may be subject to taxes under PRC tax laws.
 
If dividends payable to our stockholders are treated as income derived from sources within China, then the dividends that stockholders receive from us, and any gain on the sale or transfer of our shares, may be subject to taxes under PRC tax laws. We have not consulted with PRC tax counsel regarding the taxes that may be associated with dividends paid by us.
 
Under the New EIT Law and its implementing rules, PRC enterprise income tax at the rate of 10% is applicable to dividends payable by us to our investors that are non-resident enterprises so long as such non-resident enterprise

investors do not have an establishment or place of business in China or, despite the existence of such establishment of place of business in China, the relevant income is not effectively connected with such establishment or place of business in China, to the extent that such dividends have their sources within the PRC. Similarly, any gain realized on the transfer of our shares by such investors is also subject to a 10% PRC income tax if such gain is regarded as income derived from sources within China and we are considered as a resident enterprise which is domiciled in China for tax purpose. Additionally, there is a possibility that the relevant PRC tax authorities may take the view that the purpose of us, CAT9 Cayman and CAT9 HK is holding CQC9, and the capital gain derived by our overseas shareholders or investors from the share transfer is deemed China-sourced income, in which case such capital gain may be subject to a PRC withholding tax at the rate of up to 10%. If we are required under the New EIT Law to withhold PRC income tax on our dividends payable to our foreign shareholders or investors who are non-resident enterprises, or if you are required to pay PRC income tax on the transfer or our shares under the circumstances mentioned above, the value of your investment in our shares may be materially and adversely affected.
 
In January, 2009, the State Administration of Taxation promulgated the Provisional Measures for the Administration of Withholding of Enterprise Income Tax for Non-resident Enterprises (“Measures”), pursuant to which, the entities which have the direct obligation to make the following payment to a non-resident enterprise shall be the relevant tax withholders for such non-resident enterprise, and such payment includes: incomes from equity investment (including dividends and other return on investment), interests, rents, royalties, and incomes from assignment of property as well as other incomes subject to enterprise income tax received by non-resident enterprises in China. Further, the Measures provides that in case of equity transfer between two non-resident enterprises which occurs outside China, the non-resident enterprise which receives the equity transfer payment shall, by itself or engage an agent to, file tax declaration with the PRC tax authority located at place of the PRC company whose equity has been transferred, and the PRC company whose equity has been transferred shall assist the tax authorities to collect taxes from the relevant non-resident enterprise. However, it is unclear whether the Measures refer to the equity transfer by a non-resident enterprise which is a direct or an indirect shareholder of the said PRC Company. Given these Measures, there is a possibility that we may have an obligation to withhold income tax in respect of the dividends paid to non-resident enterprise investors. If we have such an obligation, our omission or failure to fulfill such obligation may subject us to similar penalties to those applied to a taxpayer, including fines up to RMB10,000, and in the case of being recognized as constituting evasion of taxation, other than making up for the underpaid taxes, we may be subject to further penalties including late fees, fines ranging from 50% to 500% of the underpaid taxes, and even criminal liabilities under grave circumstances.
 
SAFE rules and regulations may limit our ability to transfer the net proceeds from this offering to our PRC subsidiaries, which may adversely affect the business expansion of our PRC subsidiaries, and we may not be able to convert the net proceeds from this offering into Renminbi to invest in or acquire any other PRC companies.
 
On August 29, 2008, SAFE promulgated Circular 142, a notice regulating the conversion by a foreign -invested company of foreign currency into Renminbi by restricting how the converted Renminbi may be used. The notice requires that the registered capital of a foreign-invested company settled in Renminbi converted from foreign currencies may only be used for purposes within the business scope approved by the applicable governmental authority and may not be used for equity investments within the PRC. In addition, SAFE strengthened its oversight of the flow and use of the registered capital of a foreign-invested company settled in Renminbi converted from foreign currencies. The use of such Renminbi capital may not be changed without SAFE’s approval, and may not in any case be used to repay Renminbi loans if the proceeds of such loans have not been used. Violations of Circular 142 will result in severe penalties, such as heavy fines.
 
Any recurrence of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), Avian Flu, or another widespread public health problem, such as the spread of H1N1 (“Swine”) Flu, in the PRC could adversely affect our operations.
 
 A renewed outbreak of SARS, Avian Flu or another widespread public health problem, such as the spread of H1N1 (“Swine”) Flu, in China, where all of our operations are located and where the substantial portion of our sales occur, could have a negative effect on our operations. Our business is dependent upon our ability to continue to market and sell advertising time and produce television programs. Such an outbreak could have an impact on our operations as a result of:

Risks Related to Our Capital Structure
 Our common stock has only recently become trading on the Over-the-Counter market, however, at the this Form 10-K, there is a limited trading market for our common stock, and there can be no assurances made of an established, robust public trading market, which if we were unable to accomplish, may adversely affect the ability of our investors to sell their securities in the public market.
 Our common stock is quoted for trading under the trading symbol CATN on the Over-the-Counter market, and is DTC eligible.
 The market price and trading volume of shares of our common stock may be volatile.
 When and if a more robust market develops for our securities, the market price of our common stock could fluctuate significantly for many reasons, including for reasons unrelated to our specific performance, such as reports by industry analysts, investor perceptions, or negative announcements by customers, competitors or suppliers regarding their own performance, as well as general economic and industry conditions. For example, to the extent that other large companies within our industry experience declines in their share price, our share price may decline as well. In addition, when the market price of a company’s shares drops significantly, shareholders could institute securities class action lawsuits against the company. A lawsuit against us could cause us to incur substantial costs and could divert the time and attention of our management and other resources.
 Regulations, including those contained in and issued under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (“SOX”) and the Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (“Dodd-Frank”), increase the cost of doing business and may make it difficult for us to retain or attract qualified officers and directors, which could adversely affect the management of our business and our ability to obtain or retain listing of our Common Stock.
 
We are a public company. The current regulatory climate for public companies, even small and emerging growth companies such as ours, may make it difficult or prohibitively expensive to attract and retain qualified officers, directors and members of board committees required to provide for our effective management in compliance with the rules and regulations which govern publicly-held companies, including, but not limited to, certifications from executive officers and requirements for financial experts on boards of directors. The perceived increased personal risk associated with these recent changes may deter qualified individuals from accepting these roles. For example, the enactment of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 has resulted in the issuance of a series of new rules and regulations and the strengthening of existing rules and regulations by the SEC.
 
 Further, recent and proposed regulations under Dodd-Frank heighten the requirements for board or committee membership, particularly with respect to an individual’s independence from the corporation and level of experience in finance and accounting matters. We may have difficulty attracting and retaining directors with the requisite qualifications. If we are unable to attract and retain qualified officers and directors, the management of our business could be adversely affected.

Our internal controls over financial reporting may not be effective, and our independent auditors may not be able to certify as to their effectiveness, which could have a significant and adverse effect on our business. 
 
We are subject to various SEC reporting and other regulatory requirements. We have incurred and will continue to incur expenses and, to a lesser extent, diversion of our management’s time in our efforts to comply with SOX Section 404 regarding internal controls over financial reporting. Our management’s evaluation over our internal controls over financial reporting may determine that material weaknesses in our internal control exist. If, in the future, management identifies material weaknesses, or our external auditors are unable to attest that our management’s report is fairly stated or to express an opinion on the effectiveness of our internal controls, this could result in a loss of investor confidence in our financial reports, have an adverse effect on our stock price, and subject us to sanctions or investigation by regulatory authorities.
 Limitations on director and officer liability and our indemnification of our officers and directors may discourage stockholders from bringing suit against a director. 
 Our Certificate of Incorporation and By-Laws provide, with certain exceptions as permitted by Delaware corporation law, that a director or officer shall not be personally liable to us or our stockholders for breach of fiduciary duty as a director, except for acts or omissions which involve intentional misconduct, fraud or knowing violation of law, or unlawful payments of dividends. These provisions may discourage stockholders from bringing suit against a director for breach of fiduciary duty and may reduce the likelihood of derivative litigation brought by stockholders on our behalf against a director. In addition, our Certificate of Incorporation and By-Laws provide for mandatory indemnification of directors and officers to the fullest extent permitted by governing state law. 
 We may incur a variety of costs to engage in future acquisitions of companies, products or technologies, to grow our business, to expand into new markets, or to provide new services. As such, the anticipated benefits of those acquisitions may never be realized.
 It is management’s intention to acquire other businesses to grow our customer base, to expand into new markets, and to provide new product lines. We may make acquisitions of, or significant investments in, complementary companies, products or technologies, although no additional material acquisitions or investments are currently pending. Acquisitions may be accompanied by risks such as: 
 
• | difficulties in assimilating the operations and employees of acquired companies;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | diversion of our management’s attention from ongoing business concerns;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | our potential inability to maximize our financial and strategic position through the successful incorporation of acquired technology and rights into our products and services;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | additional expense associated with amortization of acquired assets;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------


• | additional expense associated with understanding and development of acquired business;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | maintenance and implementation of uniform standards, controls, procedures and policies; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | impairment of existing relationships with employees, suppliers and customers as a result of the integration of new management employees.

Our failure to manage growth effectively could harm our ability to attract and retain key personnel and adversely impact our operating results.
 
There can be no assurance that we will be able to manage our expansion through acquisitions effectively. Our current and planned personnel, systems, procedures and controls may not be adequate to support and effectively manage our future operations, especially as we employ personnel in multiple geographic locations. We may not be able to hire, train, retain, motivate and manage required personnel, which may limit our growth, damage our reputation and negatively affect our financial performance and harm our business.
 
The forecasts of market growth included in this Offering may prove to be inaccurate, and even if the market in which we compete achieve the forecasted growth, we cannot assure you our business will grow at similar rates, if at all.
 
Growth forecasts are subject to significant uncertainty and are based on assumptions and estimates, which may not prove to be accurate. Forecasts relating to the expected growth in the agricultural sector within China, including the forecasts or projections referenced in this Offering Memorandum, may prove to be inaccurate. Even if these markets experience the forecasted growth, we may not grow our business at similar rates, or at all. Our growth is subject to many factors, including our success in implementing our business strategy, which is subject to many risks and uncertainties. Accordingly, the forecasts of market growth included in this prospectus should not be taken as indicative of our future growth.
 
We might require additional capital to support business growth, and this capital might not be available on acceptable terms, if at all.
 
We intend to continue to make investments to support our business growth and may require additional funds to respond to business challenges, including the need to develop new features or enhance our existing products, improve our operating infrastructure or acquire complementary businesses and technologies. Accordingly, we may need to engage in equity or debt financings to secure funds. If we raise funds through issuances of equity or convertible debt securities, our existing stockholders could suffer significant dilution, and any new equity securities we issue could have rights, preferences and privileges superior to those of holders of our common stock. Any debt financing secured by us in the future could involve restrictive covenants relating to our future capital raising activities and other financial and operational matters, which may make it more difficult for us to obtain additional capital and to pursue business opportunities, including potential acquisitions. In addition, we may not be able to obtain additional financing on terms favorable to us, if at all. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to us, when we require it, our ability to continue to support our business growth and to respond to business challenges could be significantly impaired.
 
If we obtain financing, existing shareholder interests may be diluted.
 
If we raise additional funds by issuing equity or convertible debt securities, the percentage ownership of our shareholders will be diluted. In addition, any new securities could have rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of our common stock. Furthermore, we cannot assure you that additional financing will be available when and to the extent we require or that, if available, it will be on acceptable terms.
 
The requirements of being a public company may strain our resources and distract our management, which could make it difficult to manage our business, particularly after we are no longer an “emerging growth company.”
 
We are required to comply with various regulatory and reporting requirements, including those required by the SEC. Complying with these reporting and other regulatory requirements are time-consuming and expensive and could have a negative effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

As a public company, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, and requirements of SOX. The cost of complying with these requirements may place a strain on our systems and resources. The Exchange Act requires that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with respect to our business and financial condition. SOX requires that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting. To maintain and improve the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures, we must commit significant resources, may be required to hire additional staff and need to continue to provide effective management oversight.
 
We will be implementing additional procedures and processes for the purpose of addressing the standards and requirements applicable to public companies. Sustaining our growth also will require us to commit additional management, operational and financial resources to identify new professionals to join the Company and to maintain appropriate operational and financial systems to adequately support expansion.
 
These activities may divert management’s attention from other business concerns, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
 
As an “emerging growth company” as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (“JOBS Act”) enacted on April 5, 2012, we may take advantage of certain temporary exemptions from various reporting requirements including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of SOX (and rules and regulations of the SEC thereunder, which we refer to as Section 404) and reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements.
 
When these exemptions cease to apply, we expect to incur additional expenses and devote increased management effort toward ensuring compliance with them. We will remain an “emerging growth company” for up to five years, although we may cease to be an emerging growth company earlier under certain circumstances. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations –JOBS Act” for additional information on when we may cease to be deemed to be an emerging growth company. We cannot predict or estimate the amount of additional costs we may incur as a result of becoming a public company or the timing of such costs.
 
Our reported financial results may be adversely affected by changes in accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.
 
Generally accepted accounting principles in the United States are subject to interpretation by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB), the SEC, and various bodies formed to promulgate and interpret appropriate accounting principles. A change in these principles or interpretations could have a significant effect on our reported financial results, and could affect the reporting of transactions completed before the announcement of a change.
 
Employment Laws
 
We are subject to laws and regulations governing our relationship with our employees, including: wage and hour requirements, working and safety conditions, and social insurance, housing funds and other welfare that may be applicable. These include local labor laws and regulations, which may require substantial resources for compliance.
 
China's National Labor Law, which became effective on January 1, 1995, and China's National Labor Contract Law, which became effective on January 1, 2008, permits workers in both state and private enterprises in China to bargain collectively. The National Labor Law and the National Labor Contract Law provide for collective contracts to be developed through collaboration between the labor union (or worker representatives in the absence of a union) and management that specify such matters as working conditions, wage scales, and hours of work. The laws also permit workers and employers in all types of enterprises to sign individual contracts, which are to be drawn up in accordance with the collective contract. The National Labor Contract Law has enhanced rights for the nation's workers, including permitting open-ended labor contracts and severance payments. The legislation requires employers to provide written contracts to their workers, restricts the use of temporary labor and makes it harder for employers to lay off employees. It also requires that employees with fixed-term contracts be entitled to an indefinite-term contract after a fixed-term contract is renewed twice or the employee has worked for the employer for a consecutive ten-year period.
 
Foreign Currency Exchange


29
--

 
The principal regulations governing foreign currency exchange in China are the Foreign Exchange Administration Regulations promulgated by the State Council, as amended on August 5, 2008, or the Foreign Exchange Regulations. Under the Foreign Exchange Regulations, the RMB is freely convertible for current account items, including the distribution of dividends, interest payments, trade and service-related foreign exchange transactions, but not for capital account items, such as direct investments, loans, repatriation of investments and investments in securities outside of China, unless prior approval of the PRC State Administration of Foreign Exchange, or SAFE is obtained and prior registration with the SAFE is made. Foreign-invested enterprises may only buy, sell and/or remit foreign currencies at those banks authorized to conduct foreign exchange business after providing valid commercial documents and, in the case of capital account item transactions, obtaining approval from the SAFE. Capital investments by foreign-invested enterprises outside of China are also subject to limitations, which include approvals by the Ministry of Commerce ("MOFCOM"), the SAFE and the State Reform and Development Commission.
 
Dividend Distributions
 
Under applicable PRC regulations, foreign-invested enterprises in China may pay dividends only out of their accumulated profits, if any, determined in accordance with PRC accounting standards and regulations. In addition, a foreign-invested enterprise in China is required to set aside at least 10% of its after-tax profit based on PRC accounting standards each year to its general reserves until the accumulative amount of such reserves reach 50% of its registered capital. These reserves are not distributable as cash dividends. The board of directors of a foreign-invested enterprise has the discretion to allocate a portion of its after-tax profits to staff welfare and bonus funds, which may not be distributed to equity owners except in the event of liquidation.
Properties
 
Our principal executive offices are located at: Room 1702, Building 2, No. 301, Yunan Avenue, Banan District, Chongqing, China 401320.
 
Legal Proceedings
 
We are not involved in any material legal proceedings outside of the ordinary course of our business.
