 Antares Pharma, Inc. (“Antares,” “we,” “our,” “us” or the “Company”) is a combination drug device company focused primarily on the development and commercialization of self-administered parenteral pharmaceutical products and technologies.  Our strategy is to identify new or existing approved drug formulations and apply our patented drug delivery technology to enhance the drug delivery methods.  We develop, manufacture and commercialize, for ourselves or with partners, novel therapeutic products using our advanced drug delivery systems that are designed to provide commercial or functional advantages, such as improved safety and efficacy, reduced side effects, and enhanced patient comfort and adherence. Our intramuscular and subcutaneous injection technology platforms include the VIBEX® and VIBEX® QuickShot® pressure-assisted auto injector systems suitable for branded and generic injectable drugs in unit dose containers as well as disposable multi-dose pen injectors. We have a portfolio of proprietary and partnered commercial products and ongoing product development programs in various stages of development.  We have formed significant strategic alliances and partnership arrangements with industry leading pharmaceutical companies including Teva, AMAG and Pfizer.  
2018 Highlights
 Antares Pharma, Inc. experienced several significant and transformative milestones in 2018.  The following is a discussion of significant accomplishments:
  
• | Approval and Launch of XYOSTEDTM – We developed XYOSTED™ (testosterone enanthate) injection, indicated for testosterone replacement therapy in adult males for conditions associated with a deficiency or absence of endogenous testosterone, which was approved by the FDA on September 28, 2018 and launched for commercial sale in November 2018. XYOSTED™ is the only FDA approved subcutaneous testosterone enanthate product for once-weekly, at-home self-administration. In connection with the launch of XYOSTED™, we hired approximately 50 additional sales representatives and cross-trained the combined specialty sales force to leverage our existing resources and enhance our commercial organization. Our sales representatives started detailing XYOSTED™ to physicians in the second half of December 2018.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Approval and Launch of Teva’s Generic Epipen® - In collaboration with Teva, we developed a version of our VIBEX® auto injector for use in a combination epinephrine auto injector product that was approved by the FDA in August 2018 and was commercially launched in limited quantities in late fourth quarter of 2018. Teva’s Epinephrine Injection USP is indicated for emergency treatment of severe allergic reactions including those that are life threatening (anaphylaxis) in adults and certain pediatric patients and was approved as a generic drug product with an AB rating, meaning that it is therapeutically equivalent to Mylan, Inc.’s branded products EpiPen® and EpiPen Jr® and therefore, subject to state law, substitutable at the pharmacy. We are the exclusive supplier of the device and Teva is responsible for commercialization and distribution of the finished product, for which we also receive royalties on net sales. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Approval and Launch of AMAG’s Makena® subcutaneous auto injector – In collaboration with AMAG, we developed a variation of our VIBEX® QuickShot® subcutaneous auto injector for the Makena® (hydroxyprogesterone caproate injection) Subcutaneous Auto-Injector product, which was approved by the FDA in February 2018 and launched for commercial sale in March 2018. The Makena® subcutaneous auto injector is a ready-to-administer treatment indicated to reduce the risk of preterm birth in women pregnant with one baby and who spontaneously delivered one preterm baby in the past. We are the exclusive supplier of the devices and the final assembled and packaged commercial product, upon which we receive royalties on net sales made by AMAG. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | New Pipeline Development with Pfizer - In August 2018, we entered into a new collaboration agreement with Pfizer to jointly develop a combination drug device rescue pen that will utilize our QuickShot® auto injector and an undisclosed Pfizer drug. Pfizer will pay us for design and development services and be responsible for obtaining FDA regulatory approval. We intend to enter into a separate supply agreement with Pfizer under which we will provide fully packaged commercial ready finished product to Pfizer. Pending FDA approval, Pfizer will then be responsible for commercialization and sale of the product, upon which we will receive royalties on net sales.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 In addition to these significant achievements in 2018, we continue to market and sell our proprietary product OTREXUP® (methotrexate) injection and, through our partner Teva, Sumatriptan Injection USP, expand our commercial organization and our sales and marketing capabilities, meet the supply demands of our partners, devote significant resources to our research and development programs to further our development pipeline and maintain a disciplined approach to growth and expenditures.

 Our Strategy and Market Opportunity
 Our business strategy is to identify development and commercialization opportunities that apply our patented drug delivery injection technology to new or existing approved drug formulations in order to enhance the drug delivery methods and provide commercial and/or functional advantages.  Our strategy is to pursue these opportunities both on our own or with industry leading partners.  We believe this strategy offers a distinct value to patients, healthcare providers, pharmaceutical partners and our shareholders. Our focus is primarily on the market for delivery of self-administered injectable drugs, comprised of non-biologic, small molecule drugs and biological products or biosimilars. Our patented drug delivery technologies, such as the VIBEX® QuickShot®, enable the delivery of highly viscous drug compounds through fine gauge needles.  We believe our technology platforms have potential in both the branded and generic marketplace, and that there are a number of existing approved drugs that may benefit from an alternate route of delivery such as subcutaneous injection.

Injection is a common drug delivery pathway, and the delivery of pharmaceutical therapies through injection systems often improves the systemic bioavailability of those treatments by overcoming absorption barriers common with oral and, in some cases, transdermal delivery. Improved bioavailability is considered beneficial when considering the role of route of administration on pharmaceutical efficacy. We believe our business model of developing our own pharmaceutical products in targeted therapeutic categories using our pressure-assisted auto injectors and pen injectors, combined with our strategy to partner with pharmaceutical manufacturers of injectable products outside of our therapeutic focus offers us additional potential to profit from our proprietary injector systems in multiple markets in the future.
 We and our partners have historically sought, and are in the process of seeking, FDA approval for certain product candidates primarily using the 505(b)(2) NDA (New Drug Application) or ANDA (Abbreviated New Drug Application) approval pathways, which are further described in the Government Regulation section below. Our technology platforms allows for device customization, which can provide multiple opportunities in both the 505(b)(2) NDA and generic market spaces. There are a number of injectable branded products that have recently lost patent protection in the U.S. that will be or have been subject to the ANDA approval pathway. By way of example, two of the products in development with our partner Teva (disposable pen injector products with teriparatide and exenatide) are being developed as generic versions of the branded products.  Unlike branded products which need to be detailed to a physician by a sales force, a generic product with an AB rating may be substitutable at the pharmacy in lieu of the branded product affording a potentially low cost, high market penetration generic product. 
 Many pharmaceutical companies continue to focus on the development of important chronic care products and therapies that can be administered only by injection. We believe that many of these injectable drugs that are currently under development may eventually be administered by self-injection once they reach the market. Our belief is supported by the ongoing effort to reduce hospital and institutional costs by early patient release, and the gathering momentum of new classes of drugs that require injection. Additionally, major pharmaceutical companies market directly to consumers and encourage the use of innovative, user-friendly drug delivery systems, offering patients an ability to self-inject products at home. We believe the patient-friendly attributes of our injection technologies meet these market needs.
 We believe that many injectable products currently offered in vials could be replaced with user-friendly auto injectors promoting better compliance and improvement in dose accuracy.  Several manufacturers of injectable products have introduced convenient alternatives to vials, such as prefilled syringes and injector systems, and an increasing proportion of people who self-administer drugs are transitioning to prefilled syringes and other injector systems when offered. We believe that our advanced drug delivery systems can result in improved safety and efficacy, reduced side effects, and enhanced patient comfort and adherence. 
 Continuing pressures to reduce physician visit costs by managed care organizations, combined with patient preferences for convenience and comfort, are driving a change in the treatment setting from the health care facility to patients’ homes.  This trend is creating a shift from the chronic care injections and even some acute care injections being administered by a doctor or nurse to self-administration by the patient, a family member, or other lay caregiver.   This shift has produced a transition in how injectable drugs are configured to facilitate use by consumers.  In many therapeutic categories, pre-filled syringes and other injection systems offering greater ease-of-use and security for patients now exceed vials in unit volume.  
 According to a Market Research Engine report, it is estimated that the global injectable drug delivery market will grow to $624.5 billion by 2022, representing a compounded annual growth rate of 11.5% from 2016 - 2022.  This expected growth is attributable to several factors, including label expansion for approved products, increasing the patient pool for such products, a pipeline of injectable medications at various stages of clinical development, and the increasing incidence of certain diseases that will necessitate the utilization of injectable medications.
 See also “Our Products and Products in Development” below for additional discussion of market size and opportunities relative to the current therapeutic areas associated with our existing portfolio of products and products in development.
 Our Competitive Strengths
 We have a proven business model of applying our patented drug delivery injection technology to new and existing therapeutic products. We believe our key competitive strengths are our proprietary injection technologies, and our ability to form significant strategic alliances with industry-leading pharmaceutical partners to develop and commercialize proprietary and partnered products. We believe our management team has unique knowledge of, and experience in the drug/device combination product space, and in identifying new product candidates that could potentially benefit from our device technology platforms, which creates opportunities for us and potential pharmaceutical partners that look to us for our unique capabilities and know-how. Our business model for developing and commercializing proprietary and partnered products has been validated, we believe, by the successive FDA approvals of our NDAs for XYOSTEDTM and OTREXUP® and our ANDA for Sumatriptan Injection USP, as well as the FDA approval of

AMAG’s sNDA for the Makena® auto injector utilizing our VIBEX® QuickShot® technology and the recent FDA approval of Teva’s AB-rated generic version of the EpiPen® also utilizing our VIBEX® auto injector. 
 Intellectual Property, Patents, Trade Secrets and Proprietary Information
 We strive to protect and enhance the proprietary technologies that we believe are important to our business and rely on know-how and continuing technological innovation to develop, strengthen, and maintain our competitive position. When appropriate, we actively seek protection for our products and proprietary information by means of U.S. and international patents and trademarks.  We currently hold a portfolio of patents with expirations dates ranging from 2019 to 2036, and numerous patent applications pending in the U.S. and other countries.  These patents consist primarily of design, formulation and method-of-use patents. 
 In addition to our patents and patent applications, trade secrets play an important role in protecting our products and technologies and provide protection beyond patents and regulatory exclusivity.  We strive to preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets, proprietary know-how and inventions by maintaining physical security of our sites and electronic security of our information technology systems. We also require all employees, contractors and third-party consultants with access to proprietary information to execute confidentiality agreements prohibiting the disclosure of confidential information to anyone outside the Company. These agreements also require disclosure and assignment to us of discoveries and inventions made by such individuals while devoted to Company-sponsored activities. Partners with which we have entered into development agreements have the right to certain technology developed in connection with such agreements.
 Our Technology and Product Platforms
 Pressure assisted auto injection is a form of parenteral drug delivery that continues to gain acceptance and demand among the medical and patient community. Encompassing a wide variety of sizes and designs, our technology operates by using pressure to force the drug, in solution or suspension, through the skin and deposits the drug into the subcutaneous tissue. We have designed disposable, pressure assisted auto injector devices to address acute and chronic medical needs, such as rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis, allergic reactions, migraine headaches, testosterone deficiency and maternal health. Our current platforms includes the VIBEX® and the VIBEX® QuickShot® disposable pressure assisted auto injection systems, disposable pen injection systems and needle-free injectors.  
 Disposable VIBEX® Injectors
 Our proprietary VIBEX® disposable auto injector systems combine a spring-based power source with a shielded needle, which delivers the needed drug solution subcutaneously or intramuscularly. In order to minimize the anxiety and perceived pain associated with injection-based technologies, the VIBEX® system features a triggering collar that shields the needle from view. The patented retracting collar springs back and locks in place as a protective needle guard after the injection, making the device safe for general disposal. We believe the key competitive advantages of the VIBEX® system include:
  
• | Reliable subcutaneous or intramuscular injection
--+-------------------------------------------------


• | Designed around conventional pre-filled syringes
--+-------------------------------------------------


• | Rapid injection with ability to deliver viscous solutions
--+----------------------------------------------------------


• | Ease of use in emergencies
--+---------------------------


• | Reduced pain
--+-------------

 The primary goal of the VIBEX® disposable pressure assisted auto injector is to provide a fast, safe, and time-efficient method of self-injection. This device is designed around conventional single dose pre-filled syringes, which is a primary drug container, offering ease of transition for potential pharmaceutical partners.  Our proprietary product OTREXUP® uses the VIBEX® auto injector system for delivery of methotrexate. We also have two license agreements with Teva for our VIBEX® system, one for Teva’s generic epinephrine auto injector and the other for our Sumatriptan Injection USP.  
 VIBEX® QuickShot® Auto Injectors
An advancement of our proprietary line of VIBEX® auto injectors is the VIBEX® QuickShot® auto injector system, which offers a dose capacity of 1 mL or greater in a compact design. VIBEX® QuickShot® is designed to enhance performance on the attributes we believe most critical to patient acceptance, which are speed, comfort and discretion. VIBEX® QuickShot® achieves these advancements by incorporating a novel triggering mechanism and space-saving spring configuration. The unique design also accommodates fast injection of highly viscous drug products that less-powerful conventional auto injectors are typically unable to 
 7


deliver.  Many self-injectable drugs that are currently marketed or in clinical development are of higher viscosity and are formulated to be administered in a 1 mL dose volume. Our proprietary product XYOSTEDTM was developed using the VIBEX® QuickShot® auto injector platform, which is also used in the Makena® subcutaneous auto injector that we developed with our partner AMAG.  We also have a license agreement with Pfizer to develop a rescue pen utilizing our VIBEX® QuickShot® auto injector system with an undisclosed Pfizer drug.
 Disposable Pen Injector System
 Our multi-dose, disposable pen injector technology complements our portfolio of single-use pressure assisted auto injector devices.  The disposable pen injector device is designed to deliver drugs by injection through needles from multi-dose cartridges.  Our disposable pen injector is designed for chronic conditions such as diabetes, which require daily injection of a product.  Depending on dosage, our pens can deliver up to thirty days of drug.  We have licensed our pen injector device technology to Teva for two potential products: a multi-dose pen with teriparatide for the treatment of osteoporosis (a generic form of Forteo®) and a multi-dose pen with exenatide for the treatment of diabetes (a generic version of BYETTA®).
 Needle-Free Injectors
 Needle-free devices administer injectable drugs by using a spring to push the active ingredient in solution or suspension through a micro-fine opening in the needle-free syringe. A fine liquid stream then penetrates the skin, and the dose is dispersed into the layer of fatty, subcutaneous tissue. Needle-free injection combines proven delivery technology for molecules that require parenteral administration with a device that eliminates the part of the injection that patients dislike – the needle.  Improving patient comfort through needle-free injection may increase compliance and mitigate the problem of daily injections. However, needle-free devices may be commercially limited due to the high cost of the product and the need for consumable disposables.  
 On October 10, 2017, we entered into the Ferring Transaction. We will continue to manufacture and supply needle-free devices under the existing license and supply agreements until the completion of the transaction, which is expected to occur in 2019.
 Our Products
 The following is a discussion of our approved and marketed commercial products, including proprietary and partnered products.  For a discussion of other product candidates currently in development, see “Research and Development” section below.
 OTREXUP® (methotrexate) injection
 OTREXUP® is our proprietary combination product comprised of a pre-filled methotrexate syringe and our VIBEX® self-injection system designed to enable rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis patients to self-inject methotrexate reliably, accurately, comfortably and conveniently at home. OTREXUP® (methotrexate) injection is the first FDA-approved subcutaneous methotrexate for once weekly self-administration with an easy-to-use, single dose, disposable auto injector.  Our initial NDA, approved in October 2013, covered the 10 mg, 15 mg, 20 mg and 25 mg dosage strengths. We have FDA approval for eight dosage strengths of OTREXUP®.
 OTREXUP® is indicated for use in adults with severe, active rheumatoid arthritis (“RA”) or children with active polyarticular juvenile arthritis (“pJIA”) who are intolerant of or had an inadequate response to first‑line therapy, including full dose non‑steroidal anti‑inflammatory agents, and adults with severe recalcitrant psoriasis.  RA is a chronic autoimmune disease, resulting in pain, stiffness, swelling, joint damage, and loss of function of the joints. According to the Arthritis Foundation, RA affects approximately 1.5 million Americans, which is almost 0.5% of the U.S. population.  The disease onset generally occurs between the ages of 30 to 60 years in women.  In men, it often occurs later in life.  pJIA is the most common rheumatic disease in childhood, and according to the Arthritis Foundation, juvenile arthritis affects nearly 300,000 children in the U.S. Methotrexate is also used to treat psoriasis, which is believed to be an autoimmune disease characterized by thick patches of inflamed, scaly skin, created by abnormal, rapid, and excessive proliferation of skin cells.  According to the American Academy of Dermatology, as many as 7.5 million Americans, or approximately 2.2% of the population suffer from psoriasis.

Methotrexate is considered the first-line disease modifying anti-rheumatic drug (“DMARD”) prescribed to patients with RA according to the Johns Hopkins Arthritis Center.  Methotrexate is usually started at 7.5 mg, 10 mg or 15 mg given orally, once-a-week, and titrated up for greater therapeutic effect, or until the patient incurs side effects.  The maximum oral dose given is generally 20 mg to 25 mg per week (8 to 10, 2.5 mg tablets given in one dose).  Studies have reported as many as 30% to 60% of patients experience gastrointestinal side effects with oral methotrexate, preventing further dose escalation or requiring discontinuation in some patients.  Also, the extent of oral absorption of methotrexate varies considerably between patients.   
 We believe that OTREXUP® offers physicians and patients an important alternative to oral methotrexate tablets and vials of the injectable form of the drug administered with a needle and syringe.  OTREXUP® provides physicians and patients a convenient, practical and virtually painless option for administering parenteral methotrexate as an alternative to proceeding directly from oral methotrexate to biologics.  Additionally, OTREXUP® is a self-contained injection device designed to minimize accidental contact with methotrexate, a hazardous drug agent. Since its launch in February 2014, OTREXUP® has been prescribed by over 3,500 physicians. Our marketing data reveals that some physicians regularly use OTREXUP® in RA patients who have experienced an inadequate response to oral methotrexate therapy for reasons of tolerability and/or efficacy. 
 Medac Pharma markets and sells Rasuvo®, a subcutaneous injectable methotrexate, which is a direct competitor to OTREXUP®. Competition in the methotrexate market also includes tablets and parenteral forms that are currently marketed in the U.S. by several generic manufacturers, including Teva, Pfizer, Inc. (“Pfizer”), Mylan, Inc. (“Mylan”), Hospira and Accord Healthcare.  In several European countries, Canada, and South Korea, Medac International or its licensees market methotrexate in prefilled syringes (Metoject®) and have also launched an auto injector with methotrexate in those territories.  Other commonly used pharmaceutical treatments for rheumatoid arthritis include analgesics, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), corticosteroids, DMARDs and biologic response modifiers.  In addition to methotrexate, the DMARDs include azathioprine (Imuran®), cyclosporine (Neoral®), hydroxychloroquine (Plaquenil®), auranofin (Ridura®), leflunomide (Arava®) and sulfasalazine (Azulfidine®).  The biologic response modifiers include etanercept (Enbrel®), adalimumab (Humira®), golimumab (Simponi®), tocilizumab (Actemra®), certolizumab (Cimzia®), infliximab (Remicaid®), abatacept (Orencia®), and rituximab (Rituxan®). They are often prescribed in combination with DMARDs such as methotrexate. 
 XYOSTED™ (testosterone enanthate) injection
XYOSTED™ (testosterone enanthate) injection is our proprietary product for subcutaneous administration of testosterone replacement therapy (“TRT”) in adult males for conditions associated with a deficiency or absence of endogenous testosterone. XYOSTED™ was approved by the FDA on September 28, 2018 and was commercially launched in November 2018. Our sales representatives started detailing XYOSTED™ to physicians in the second half of December 2018.  XYOSTED™ is the only FDA approved subcutaneous testosterone enanthate product for once-weekly, at-home self-administration and is approved in three dosage strengths, 50 mg, 75 mg and 100 mg. 
 According to an IQVIA National Sales Perspectives® (“NSP”) report of nationally projected sales activities, the U.S. TRT market was approximately $2.15 billion in 2018 based on wholesale acquisition costs (“WAC”). The same report showed injectable TRT grew from $339.4 million in 2017 to $357.7 million in 2018, an increase of 5.4%. There is significant competition within the TRT market among many pharmaceutical companies including Abbvie, Inc. (formerly Abbott), Lilly, Endo, Pfizer, Sandoz, Mylan and Teva. We believe that XYOSTED™ provides several potential benefits over other TRT treatments such as topical gels and other forms of injectable testosterone administered via needle and syringe in healthcare settings.  These benefits include easy and virtually pain-free administration, low risk of transfer as compared to topical gels and the ability to achieve and maintain more steady levels of testosterone. 
 Topical formulations of TRT are frequently prescribed in the U.S.  Not all men are able to adequately absorb the gel formulations or otherwise find them unacceptable for reasons including risks of transferring the gel to spouses or children, dissatisfaction with the application process, or suboptimal clinical results due to variability in exposure and compliance.  Injectable testosterone is an option for men with an inadequate response to transdermal therapies.
 Currently, injectable testosterone is available and represents a majority of all TRT prescriptions. These injections, prescribed as a combination of a vial, needle, and syringe, are usually given deep into the muscle tissue of the buttocks with large bore needles (typically 19 gauge needles).  Injection testosterone is an esterified formulation in oil that is absorbed slowly from the muscle tissue, producing a sustained increase in serum testosterone over time, requiring repeated injections typically administered in the physician’s office every two to four weeks.  The higher doses given to facilitate less frequent injections are sometimes associated with supra-physiologic levels.  Such high levels may lead to polycythemia, a proliferation of red blood cells, which places the patient at increased risk of thrombus or clot formation leading to strokes, heart attacks, pulmonary embolism, and possibly death.   Excessive variability 
 9


between peak testosterone levels occurring shortly after the injection to the lowest levels immediately preceding a dose are also associated with mood swings. 
 
Competition in the U.S. testosterone replacement market includes topical solutions such as Abbvie’s Androgel® and Androgel® 1.62%, Perrigo’s generic 1.62% testosterone topical gel, Lilly’s Axiron®, Endo’s Fortesta® and Testim® (and the authorized generic) and Allergan plc (“Allergan”) Androderm®. Other forms of TRT include injectables, such as Endo’s Aveed®, Pfizer’s Depo®-Testosterone, and several generic testosterones in oil products sold by Actavis, Sandoz, Mylan, Teva and others, as well as Testopel® pellets by Endo.  In addition, two additional oral treatments for low testosterone levels are in development. Clarus is developing an oral formulation of testosterone undecanoate, Rextoro™ and Lipocine, Inc. (“Lipocine”) is also developing an oral formulation of testosterone undecanoate, Tlando®.  Acerus Pharmaceuticals markets Natesto™, an intra-nasal testosterone.
 Sumatriptan Injection USP
 We, through our partner Teva, sell Sumatriptan Injection USP, indicated in the U.S. for the acute treatment of migraine headaches and cluster headache in adults.  We received FDA approval of our ANDA for the 4 mg/0.5 mL and 6 mg/0.5 mL single-dose prefilled syringe auto-injectors, a generic equivalent to Imitrex® STATdose Pen®, in December 2015.  We have a license, supply and distribution agreement with Teva, under which Teva is responsible for the manufacture and supply of the drug, and we manufacture the device and complete assembly and packaging of the finished product. Teva is responsible for commercialization and distribution.  
 According to a survey commissioned by the National Headache Foundation, migraine affects nearly 37 million Americans.  Migraine headaches are often characterized by a headache of moderate or severe intensity, nausea (the most common characteristic), one-sided and/or pulsating quality, aggravated by routine physical activity, duration of hours to 2-3 days; and an attack frequency anywhere between once a year and once a week.  Healthcare professionals frequently prescribe triptans to stop migraine attacks. 
 The total U.S. retail anti-migraine market was $4.7 billion in 2018 according to IQVIA’s National Prescription Audit® (“NPA”) report based on TRx Pharmacy Dollars. The majority of patients who use triptans take oral tablets.  Oral drugs accounted for $3.8 billion of the total, and injectable products accounted for approximately $391 million of the total market, measured in terms of TRx Pharmacy Dollars. While oral triptans have benefited many migraine sufferers, they are most consistently effective when taken at a relatively early stage in the migraine attack. Studies have shown that injectable sumatriptan is more effective and rapid-acting in the treatment of migraine headache that has reached the moderate to severe level of intensity.
 According to IQVIA’s NPA, about 3% of triptan prescriptions are currently for injectable triptans. Sumatriptan is the only injectable triptan approved for use in the U.S.  Sumatriptan is currently available in an oral formulation, a nasal spray (Imitrex, GSK and generic) and a needleless injector (Sumavel, Astellas/Zogenix). There is extensive competition in the sumatriptan marketplace and several manufacturers offer versions of injectable sumatriptan with a delivery device, including GSK (Imitrex STATdose Pen®), Pfizer (Alsuma), ENDO Pharmaceuticals (Sumavel DosePro), and Sun Pharma (generic sumatriptan autoinjector) and Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories generic sumatriptan auto-injector (Zembrace SymTouch).  One company, Sandoz, Inc. (“Sandoz”) markets an authorized generic version of GSK’s Imitrex STATdose Pen®.  At least three companies, including Teva, and Fresenius Kabi have FDA approval to market injection sumatriptan in prefilled syringes, although we are not aware of any that presently market this product configuration.  Additionally, several generics manufacturers offer injectable sumatriptan in vials.
 Makena® (hydroxyprogesterone caproate injection) Subcutaneous Auto Injector
 We developed a variation of our VIBEX® QuickShot® subcutaneous auto injector for use with AMAG’s progestin hormone drug Makena® (hydroxyprogesterone caproate injection) under an exclusive license and development agreement. The Makena® subcutaneous auto injector drug-device combination product is a ready-to-administer treatment indicated to reduce the risk of preterm birth in women pregnant with one baby and who spontaneously delivered one preterm baby in the past. The product was approved by the FDA in February 2018. We are the exclusive supplier of the devices and the final assembled and packaged commercial product, which was launched in the U.S. for commercial sale by AMAG in March 2018.  
 The Makena® subcutaneous auto injector provides an alternative to the existing intramuscular methods of administration, and was designed to enhance performance based on the attributes we believe are most critical to healthcare providers and patient acceptance, including decreased time to administer and reduced pain by using a shorter, thinner nonvisible needle for subcutaneous injection. The development of the subcutaneous auto-injector was part of AMAG’s broader next-generation program exploring alternative injection methods, sites and formulations. 
 10


Makena® (hydroxyprogesterone caproate) is the only FDA approved drug indicated to reduce the risk of preterm birth in women pregnant with a single baby who have a history of singleton spontaneous preterm birth. Makena® was approved by the FDA in February 2011 as a weekly intramuscular injection, and was granted orphan drug exclusivity through February 3, 2018. The Makena® intramuscular injection is administered weekly by a healthcare professional through a large-gauge needle, with treatment beginning between 16 weeks and 20 weeks and six days of gestation and continuing until 36 weeks and six days of gestation or delivery, whichever happens first.  
 Makena® is a progestin whose active ingredient is hydroxyprogesterone caproate (“HPC”), which is a synthetic chemical structurally related to progesterone. Progestins, such as HPC, and progesterone belong to a class of drugs called progestogens. Progestogens have been studied to reduce preterm birth and have shown varying results depending upon the subjects enrolled. The Society for Maternal Fetal Medicine Publications Committee published clinical guidelines for the use of progestogens to reduce the risk of preterm birth in the American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology in May 2012, which were affirmed in 2014. Preterm birth is defined as a birth prior to 37 weeks of pregnancy. According to the National Center for Health Statistics Report, in 2016, preterm births affected nearly 400,000 babies, or one of every ten infants born in the U.S. According to AMAG, revenue from Makena® was $322.0 million in 2018, and the company estimates that approximately half of all eligible patients are currently treated with Makena®. The 7-year orphan drug exclusivity expired in February 2018, and there are now two generic versions of the intramuscular formulation of Makena®.
 Epinephrine Injection USP
 We developed and are the exclusive supplier of the device for Teva’s generic Epinephrine Injection USP products, indicated for emergency treatment of severe allergic reactions including those that are life threatening (anaphylaxis) in adults and certain pediatric patients. Teva’s Epinephrine Injection, utilizing our patented VIBEX® injection technology, was approved by the FDA in August 2018 as a generic drug product with an AB rating, meaning that it is therapeutically equivalent to Mylan, Inc.’s branded products EpiPen® and EpiPen Jr® and therefore, subject to state law, substitutable at the pharmacy. We supply the device and Teva is responsible for the drug, assembly and packaging, distribution and commercialization of the finished product, for which we also receive royalties on Teva’s net sales. Teva announced a limited commercial launch of its generic epinephrine product in late fourth quarter of 2018 and have indicated they expect full availability and launch of the generic EpiPen Jr in 2019.
 Epinephrine is utilized for the treatment of severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis) to insect venom, foods, drugs and other allergens as well as anaphylaxis to unknown substances or exercise-induced anaphylaxis. Mylan’s EpiPen®, along with its own authorized generic of the product, continues to be the global market leader in the epinephrine auto injector market.  In December 2016, Mylan announced the availability of its lower-priced authorized generic to EpiPen®, intended to address pricing concerns of the branded version. In the U.S., sales of epinephrine injection products were approximately $1.8 billion in 2018 based on WAC, according to the IQVIA NSP report. There are other companies and alternative products competing in or poised to enter the market.  For example, in January 2017, CVS announced that a low-cost epinephrine auto injector option, the authorized generic for Adrenaclick® manufactured by Impax Laboratories, is available at all CVS Pharmacy locations. Kaléo announced the availability of AUVI-Q® (Epinephrine Injection, USP) Auto-Injector in the U.S. beginning in February 2017, and Adamis Pharmaceuticals announced FDA approval of SYMJEPI™, an epinephrine pre-filled syringe, which will be marketed and distributed in the U.S. by Sandoz Inc. 
 Needle-Free Injectors with hGH
 Our needle-free auto injector products, including the ZOMAJET™ and Twin-Jector® II, were designed to provide a needle-free means of administering human growth hormone to patients with growth retardation. We have historically sold needle-free injection devices to partners who manufacture and/or market human growth hormone directly. These partners then market our device together with their growth hormone. The device is reusable and designed to last for approximately 3,000 injections (or approximately two years) while the needle-free syringe included in the device is disposable after approximately one week when used by a patient for injecting from multi-dose vials.
 On October 10, 2017 we entered into the Ferring Transaction. We will continue to manufacture and supply needle-free devices under existing license and supply agreements until the completion of the transaction, which is expected to occur in 2019.
 Research and Development
 We are committed to a strong research and development program, recognizing that the development of new product offerings is critical to our future success. Our research and development efforts are focused primarily on leveraging our existing product and technology platforms by broadening their applications for use in other drug/device combination products, as well as exploring new pharmaceutical products, technologies and drug delivery methods. 
 11


Our research and development programs consist primarily of clinical, regulatory, formulation development, engineering, device development and commercial development activities for our current products, next generation versions of current products, and new proprietary and partnered products and technologies in development.  Our internal research and development team works with external consultants, industry experts, physicians and other medical personnel in an effort to drive a robust product development pipeline. We also have a business development team that actively seeks and evaluates product opportunities and business alliances. In addition, our clinical, quality and regulatory teams are committed to verifying and maintaining the safety and efficacy of our products according to regulatory standards enforced by the FDA and other international regulatory bodies. The following is a discussion of our significant research and development activities.
 ATRS-1701
 We are currently developing a proprietary drug device combination product for the neurology market, identified as ATRS-1701. In the fourth quarter of 2018, we conducted in man studies with two formulations of ATRS-1701 and did not achieve the optimal pharmacokinetic levels we expect to see in our products.  Based on the results of the study data, we are reformulating the drug and anticipate advancing the product to clinical trials. 
 Partnered Development Projects – We, along with our pharmaceutical partners, are engaged in research and development activities related to our VIBEX® disposable pressure assisted auto injectors and our disposable pen injectors.  We have signed license agreements with Teva for our pen injector devices for use with generic versions of Forteo® (teriparatide) and BYETTA® (exenatide), and a collaboration arrangement with Pfizer for the development of a rescue pen utilizing our QuickShot® platform. The development programs consist of determination of the device design, development of prototype tooling, production of prototype devices for testing and clinical studies, and development of commercial tooling and assembly.  We expect development related to these products to continue, however, the development timelines are generally controlled by our partners and the extent of near-term and future development will be dependent on decisions made by our partners. The following is a summary of the development stages for each of the partnered products in development.
 Disposable Pen Injector with Teriparatide
 We are developing with Teva, under a license, development and supply agreement, a multi-dose disposable pen injector device with teriparatide for the treatment of osteoporosis. Teva is actively working toward a regulatory approval with the FDA for a generic version of Forteo® (teriparatide [rDNA origin] injection) using the ANDA pathway.  Teva and Eli Lilly and Company (“Lilly”) settled their Paragraph IV patent litigation, the terms of which have not been disclosed. Teva also successfully completed a decentralized procedure registration process in 17 countries in Europe for teriparatide, and is awaiting patent clearance in the EU prior to launch. 
 Teriparatide is used for the treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women and men at increased risk of fracture and for glucocorticoid induced osteoporosis in men and women. According to Lilly’s 2018 annual report on Form 10-K, 2018 global sales of Forteo® grew to $1.58 billion, of which $758.0 million was recorded in the U.S. and $818.0 million in the rest of the world.
 Disposable Pen Injector with Exenatide
 We are also developing with Teva a multi-dose pen injector device for use with a generic form of BYETTA® (exenatide injection) for the treatment of diabetes.  Teva is working through the U.S. regulatory approval process for its exenatide pen using the ANDA pathway. 
 Exenatide, marketed as BYETTA®, is used along with diet and exercise to treat type 2 diabetes, a condition in which the body does not use insulin normally and therefore cannot control the amount of sugar in the blood. Exenatide works by stimulating the pancreas to secrete insulin when blood sugar levels are high. Insulin helps move sugar from the blood into other body tissues where it is used for energy. Exenatide also slows the emptying of the stomach and causes a decrease in appetite. Exenatide is not used to treat type 1 diabetes, a condition in which the body does not produce insulin and therefore cannot control the amount of sugar in the blood. Exenatide is not used instead of insulin to treat people with diabetes who need insulin.  Total gross U.S. sales of BYETTA® (exenatide) by AstraZeneca in 2018 were approximately $216 million according to IQVIA NSP. BYDUREON®, a long acting form of the medication BYETTA®, had approximately $1.2 billion in gross sales in the U.S. in 2018 based on WAC, according to IQVIA NSP.
 Rescue Pen (drug undisclosed)
 In August 2018, we entered into a collaboration agreement with Pfizer and began developing a combination drug device rescue pen. This rescue pen will utilize the Antares QuickShot® auto injector and an undisclosed Pfizer drug. We will develop the product and Pfizer will be responsible for obtaining FDA approval of the combination product. We intend to enter into a separate supply 
 12


agreement with Pfizer pursuant to which we will provide fully packaged commercial ready finished product to Pfizer and Pfizer will then be responsible for commercializing the product in the U.S., pending FDA approval, for which the Company will receive royalties on net sales.  We have begun design work, feasibility testing and Human Factor studies.
 Manufacturing
 We do not own any manufacturing facilities; we use third parties to manufacture our products and product candidates.  To the extent that we are the sponsor of a drug/device combination product or product candidate or to the extent that we are responsible for drug and device operations with regard to products or product candidates sponsored by our partners, we must ensure that the product or product candidate is manufactured in accordance with FDA’s current Good Manufacturing Practices (“cGMPs”) for drug products and FDA’s current Quality System Regulations (“QSRs”) for medical devices and equivalent provisions in the EU and elsewhere which are required as part of the overall obligations necessary, in the EU for instance, to obtain a CE-mark .  To the extent that we are only supplying the device component to one of our partners, we are responsible for compliance with QSRs. We believe that our third party manufacturers are currently in compliance with cGMPs and QSRs, to the extent applicable. Assembly and packaging of all of our products is performed by third-party service providers under our direction.  All manufacturers and suppliers are monitored and evaluated by our quality department to assess compliance with regulatory requirements and our internal quality standards and benchmarks.  We perform quality review and product release.  
 We utilize a range of third party manufacturers to manufacture and supply certain components, drugs, final assembly and finished product.  Below is a summary of our production, manufacturing, assembly and packaging arrangements with third parties:
  
• | We have contracted with Minnesota Rubber and Plastics (“MRP”), a contract manufacturing company, to manufacture and assemble our needle-free devices and certain related disposable component parts for our partners Ferring and JCR.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | We have contracted with Phillips-Medisize Corporation (“Phillips”), an international outsource provider of design and manufacturing services, to produce clinical and commercial quantities of our VIBEX® QuickShot® auto injector device for XYOSTED™, our VIBEX® QuickShot® device for the Makena® auto injector product with AMAG and our VIBEX® epinephrine auto injector.

--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Our partner Teva supplies the pre-filled syringes for Sumatriptan Injection USP.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We also have a highly experienced quality group that works with and regularly inspects or meets with our manufacturers and suppliers to review the manufacturing process for our products and to provide input on quality matters.
 Sales & Marketing
 We have built a robust internal commercial organization, consisting of specialty sales representatives, management and support staff, to market and sell our proprietary products OTREXUP® and XYOSTED™ in the U.S. We have entered into agreements with vendors for certain commercialization services such as third-party logistics, distribution, data analytics and claims processing. We may enter into licensing and or additional distribution arrangements for commercialization of our products outside the U.S. 
 Distribution – We have contracted with a third-party logistics provider, Cardinal Health 105, Inc., also known as Specialty Pharmaceutical Services (“Cardinal”), for key services related to logistics, warehousing and inventory management, distribution, 
 13


contract administration and chargeback processing, accounts receivable management and call center management. We also utilize a division of Cardinal for sample administration. In addition, we utilize third parties to perform various other services for us relating to regulatory monitoring, including adverse event reporting, safety database management and other product maintenance services.
 Trade – We have contracted with numerous wholesale distributors, including Cardinal, McKesson Corporation (“McKesson”) and Amerisource Bergen Corporation, to distribute our OTREXUP® and XYOSTED™ products to the retail pharmacies as well as the Veterans Administration and other governmental agencies.  In addition to shipping our product, these distributors provide inventory and sales reports as well as other services.  In exchange for these services, we pay fees to certain distributors based on a percentage of wholesale acquisition cost.
 Third Party Reimbursement and Pricing – In the U.S. and elsewhere, sales of pharmaceutical products to consumers depend to a significant degree on the availability of coverage and reimbursement by third-party payers, such as government and private insurance plans. Third-party payers increasingly are challenging the prices charged for medical products and services and implementing other cost containment mechanisms. This is especially true in markets where generic options exist.  It is, and will be, time consuming and expensive for us to go through the process of maintaining or seeking reimbursement for our products from Medicaid, Medicare and private payers. Our products and those of our partners may not be considered cost effective, and coverage and reimbursement may not be available or sufficient to allow us to sell our products on a competitive and profitable basis, potentially resulting in contract changes with these major payers.
 Third-party payers often utilize a tiered reimbursement system, which may adversely affect demand for our products by placing them in a more expensive patient co-payment tier. Additionally, third party payers may require step edits or prior authorization. We cannot be certain that our products will successfully be placed on the list of drugs covered by particular health plan formularies or in a more preferential position on their formularies. Third-party payers are currently demanding, and will most likely continue to demand more aggressive pricing and rebates from Antares for favorable formulary placement. Some states have also created Medicaid preferred drug lists and include drugs on those lists only when the manufacturers agree to pay a supplemental rebate. If our products not included on these preferred drug lists, they may be subject to prior authorization. Physicians may not be inclined to prescribe OTREXUP® or XYOSTED™ to their Medicaid patients, and even if they do prescribe it, Medicaid may not authorize payment, thereby diminishing the potential market for our products in this market segment.
 We offer discount card programs and co-pay assistance to patients for OTREXUP® and XYOSTED™ in which patients covered by commercial pharmacy benefit plans receive discounts on their prescriptions. Our XYOSTEDTM STEADYCare Co-pay Assistance Program provides financial support to most commercially insured patients to assist with out-of-pocket costs of XYOSTEDTM. We utilize a contract service provider to process and pay claims to patients for actual usage.
 Similarly, in order to ensure coverage by Medicare Part D and commercial pharmacy benefit plans, we participate in certain rebate programs, which provide discounted prescriptions to qualified insured patients.  Under these rebate programs, we pay a rebate to the third-party administrator of the program, generally two to three months after the quarter in which prescriptions subject to the rebate are filled. We also provide discounts to authorized users of the Federal Supply Schedule (“FSS”) of the General Services Administration under an FSS contract negotiated by the Department of Veterans Affairs, including discounts mandated by the Veterans Health Care Act, discounted prescriptions to DoD’s Tricare retail pharmacy program, and discounts to federal grantees and safety net providers referred to as covered entities pursuant to our pharmaceutical pricing agreement with the Department of Health and Human Services and the 340B drug discount program, which is required as a condition of Medicaid coverage. Government agencies ordering under the FSS and covered entities purchase products from the wholesale distributors at the discounted price, and the wholesale distributors then charge back the difference between the current wholesale acquisition cost and the price the entity paid for the product.
 Sales, Marketing & Distribution of Partnered Products
 Our partnered products may encounter some of the same reimbursement issues described above, and although we do not control the reimbursement rate or discounts contracted with third-party payers by our partners, it ultimately affects our royalty payments we receive on net sales. The industry has experienced an increasingly widening gap between gross sales and net sales after discounts.  
 Makena® subcutaneous auto injector – Pursuant to our exclusive license, development and supply agreements with AMAG, AMAG is responsible for the commercialization and distribution of the Makena® subcutaneous auto injector. AMAG supplies the pre-filled syringe of the drug to Antares, and Antares manufactures the device and oversees the assembly and packaging of the final product, which is sold to AMAG at cost plus margin. Antares receives high single digit to low double digit royalties on net sales of the Makena® subcutaneous auto injector as well as sales based milestones. AMAG primarily sells Makena® to specialty pharmacies, specialty distributors, home infusion companies and pharmacies which, in turn, sell Makena® to healthcare providers, hospitals, government agencies and integrated delivery systems. AMAG plans to continue to offer the intramuscular formulation of Makena®.
 14


Sumatriptan Injection USP – Under a license, supply and distribution agreement with Teva for the auto injector product containing sumatriptan, we manufacture the device and perform final assembly and packaging of the product. Teva manufactures and supplies the drug and distributes the finished combination product in the U.S.  Teva also has an option for distribution rights in other territories.  Under the agreement, we received an upfront payment and a milestone payment upon commercial launch, and are compensated at cost for shipments of product to Teva.  In addition, net profits from sales of the product, after deduction of product sales allowances such as discounts, rebates and chargebacks, are split 50/50 between us and Teva.  The term of the agreement is seven years from commercial launch, with automatic one-year renewals unless terminated by either party after the initial term.
 Epinephrine Injection USP – We are the exclusive supplier of the device used in Teva’s epinephrine injection product.  We receive payment for each device sold to Teva and royalties on Teva’s commercial sales of the product.  Teva’s epinephrine injection was approved as a generic drug product with an AB rating, meaning that it is therapeutically equivalent to Mylan, Inc.’s branded products EpiPen® and EpiPen Jr® and therefore, subject to state law, is substitutable at the pharmacy. Teva is solely responsible for commercialization and distribution of the finished product.

 Collaborative Arrangements and License Agreements
 We have entered into significant partnering arrangements and licensing agreements with Teva, AMAG, Pfizer and other pharmaceutical partners. The following is a summary of those agreements. 
Teva License, Development and Supply Agreements
 In July 2006, we entered into an exclusive License, Development and Supply Agreement with Teva for an epinephrine auto injector product to be marketed in the U.S. and Canada. Pursuant to the agreement, Teva is obligated to purchase all of its delivery device requirements from us. We received an upfront cash payment and a milestone payment upon FDA product approval.  We also receive a negotiated purchase price for each device sold, as well as royalties on Teva’s future sales of the product.  This agreement has been amended to provide for payment of capital equipment and other ongoing development work that was outside the scope of the original agreement.  The agreement will continue until the expiration of the last to expire patent that is filed no later than 12 months after FDA approval.  We have multiple patents that have been granted by the USPTO that cover this product, the latest of which will expire in 2033.  We have and plan to continue to file patent applications covering this product.
 In December 2007, we entered into a license, development and supply agreement with Teva under which we developed and will supply a disposable pen injector for two therapeutic products: exenatide and teriparatide.  Under the agreement, we received an upfront payment and development milestones, and may receive royalties on future product sales.  This agreement has been amended numerous times and provides for payment of capital equipment and other development work that was outside the scope of the original agreement. This agreement will continue until the later of December 2017 or the expiration date of the last to expire patent covering the device or product that is filed no later than 12 months after FDA approval, and will be automatically renewed for successive periods of two years each.  Currently the expiration date of the last to expire patent is 2035.
 In November 2012, we entered into a license, supply and distribution agreement with Teva for an auto injector product containing sumatriptan for the treatment of migraines.  Under the agreement, we received an upfront payment and a milestone payment upon commercial launch.  Teva is responsible for the manufacture and supply of the drug, and we are responsible for the manufacture and supply of the device and assembly and packaging of the finished product.  We are compensated at cost for product shipment to Teva and Teva distributes the product in the U.S.  Teva also received an option for distribution rights in other territories.  In addition, net profits are split 50/50 between us and Teva.  The term of the agreement continues seven years from commercial launch, which was in June 2016, with automatic one-year renewals unless terminated sooner by either party in accordance with the terms of the agreement.
 15


AMAG Agreements
 In September 2014, we entered into a development and license agreement with Lumara Health, Inc., which was subsequently acquired by AMAG, to develop and supply an auto injector system for use with Makena®, a progestin drug (hydroxyprogesterone caproate) indicated to reduce the risk of preterm birth.  Under the agreement, we granted an exclusive, worldwide, royalty-bearing license, with the right to sublicense, to certain intellectual property rights, including know-how, patents and trademarks, and received an upfront payment for our license and development activities.  We are also entitled to milestone payments upon the achievement of pre-determined amounts of net sales of the product.
 AMAG was responsible for the clinical development and preparation, submission and maintenance of all regulatory applications, and is responsible for the manufacture and supply of the drug to be used in the product, and to market, distribute and sell the product.  We are the exclusive supplier of the auto injection system devices for the product and are responsible for the manufacture and supply of the devices and final assembly and packaging of the finished product.  Under the arrangement, we will receive payment for each device, and royalties based on AMAG’s net sales of products commencing on product launch in a particular country until the product is no longer developed, marketed, sold or offered for sale in such country. The royalty rates range from high single digit to low double digits and are tiered based on levels of net sales of products and decrease after the expiration of licensed patents or where there are generic equivalents to the auto injector product being sold in a particular country.
 In March 2018, we entered into a manufacturing agreement with AMAG for the exclusive supply of the devices and fully assembled and packaged final finished product of the Makena® subcutaneous auto injector. The term of the agreement is concurrent with the term of the development and license agreement, and will continue until such time AMAG halts commercialization of the product. We receive a contracted price per unit on product manufactured for AMAG.
 Pfizer Agreement
 In August 2018, we entered into a collaboration agreement with Pfizer to jointly develop a combination drug device rescue pen. This rescue pen will utilize the Antares QuickShot® auto injector and an undisclosed Pfizer drug. Pfizer will pay us for design and development services and be responsible for obtaining FDA approval of the combination product. We intend to enter into a separate supply agreement with Pfizer pursuant to which we will provide fully packaged commercial ready finished product to Pfizer and Pfizer will then be responsible for commercializing the product in the U.S., pending FDA approval, for which the Company will receive royalties on net sales and other sales-based milestone payments. 
Ferring Agreements
 In January 2003, we entered into a revised License Agreement with Ferring, under which we licensed certain of our intellectual property and extended the territories available to Ferring for use of certain of our reusable needle-free injection devices to include all countries and territories in the world except Asia/Pacific. Specifically, we granted to Ferring an exclusive, royalty-bearing license, within a prescribed manufacturing territory, to utilize certain of our reusable needle-free injector devices for the field of hGH until the expiration of the last to expire of the patents in any country in the territory. We granted to Ferring similar non-exclusive rights outside of the prescribed manufacturing territory.  In 2007, we amended this agreement providing for non-exclusive rights in Asia along with other changes to financial terms of the agreement.  We receive a purchase price and a royalty for each device sold to Ferring and a royalty on their hGH sales if we meet certain product quality metrics. This agreement will remain in effect until the completion of the Ferring Transaction, as described in Part I, Item 1. Business “Overview” section above.
 In September 2006, we entered into a Supply Agreement with Teva, and in December 2014, Ferring acquired the U.S. rights from Teva and assumed Teva’s obligations under the Supply Agreement.  Pursuant to the agreement, Ferring is obligated to purchase all of its delivery device requirements from us for hGH marketed in the U.S. We received an upfront cash and milestone payments and are entitled to royalty payments on net sales of hGH, as well as a purchase price for each device sold.  The original term of this agreement extended through September 2013, which was amended in May 2013 to provide for one-year automatic renewals unless terminated by either party six months ahead of the expiring term.   This agreement will remain in effect until the completion of the Ferring Transaction, as described in Part I, Item 1. Business “Overview” section above.
 In November 2009, we entered into a license agreement with Ferring under which we licensed certain of our patents and agreed to transfer know-how for our transdermal gel technology for certain pharmaceutical products.  Under this agreement, we received an upfront payment, milestone payments and will receive additional milestone payments as certain defined product development milestones are achieved.  The agreement is effective until the last to expire patent.
 16


Other Agreements
 We have a licensing agreement with Allergan, plc, under which we receive royalties on sales of their oxybutynin gel product Gelnique® 10%. The term of the agreement ends on the later of April 2024 or the expiration date of the last to expire patent. We also have a licensing agreement with Meda (acquired by Mylan in 2016), under which we receive royalties on sales of Elestrin®.
 Seasonality of Business
 We do not believe seasonality has a significant impact on our business.
 Competition
 The pharmaceutical, medical device and biotechnology industries are intensely competitive and subject to rapid and significant technological change. We have a wide range of competitors depending upon the branded or generic marketplace, the therapeutic product category, and the product type, including dosage strengths and route of administration. Our competitors include established biotechnology development companies, specialty pharmaceutical companies, major brand name and generic manufacturers of pharmaceuticals such as Teva, Mylan, Lilly and Endo, as well as a wide range of medical device companies that sell a single or limited number of competitive products or participate in only a specific market segment.  Our competitors also include third party contract medical device design and development companies such as Scandinavian Health Ltd. (“SHL”) and Owen Mumford Ltd. (“Owen Mumford”). Many of our competitors have greater financial and other resources than we have, such as more commercial resources, larger research and development staffs and more extensive marketing and manufacturing organizations. Smaller or early stage emerging companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large, established companies.
 Competition in the injectable drug delivery market is intensifying. We face competition from traditional needles and syringes as well as newer pen-like and sheathed needle syringes and other injection systems as well as alternative drug delivery methods including oral, transdermal and pulmonary delivery systems. Nevertheless, the majority of injections are still currently administered using needles. Because injections are typically only used when other drug delivery methods are not feasible, the auto injector systems may be made obsolete by the development or introduction of drugs or drug delivery methods which do not require injection for the treatment of conditions we have currently targeted. In addition, because we intend to, at least in part, enter into collaborative arrangements with pharmaceutical companies, our competitive position will depend upon the competitive position of the pharmaceutical company with which we collaborate for each drug application.
 If competitors introduce new products, delivery systems or processes with therapeutic or cost advantages, our products can be subject to progressive price reductions or decreased volume of sales, or both. Branded products not only face competition from other brands, but also from generic versions. Generic versions are generally significantly less expensive than branded versions, and, where available, may be required in preference to the branded version under third-party reimbursement programs, or substituted by pharmacies. Most new products that we introduce must compete with other products already on the market or products that are later developed by competitors. Manufacturers of generic pharmaceuticals typically invest far less in research and development than research-based pharmaceutical companies and therefore can price their products significantly lower than branded products. Accordingly, when a branded product loses its market exclusivity, it normally faces intense price competition from generic forms of the product. To successfully compete for business with managed care and pharmacy benefits management organizations, we must often demonstrate that our products offer not only medical benefits but also cost advantages as compared with other forms of care.
 Newly introduced generic products with limited or no other generic competition typically command higher prices initially. At the expiration of the exclusivity period, other generic distributors may enter the market, resulting in a significant price decline for the drug. As a result, the maintenance of profitable operations in generic pharmaceuticals depends, in part, on our ability to select, develop and launch new generic products in a timely and cost efficient manner and to maintain efficient, high quality manufacturing capabilities.
 Industry Trends
 Based upon our experience, we believe the following significant trends have important implications for the growth of our business. Recent trends in the pharmaceutical industry include merger and acquisition activity leading to further market consolidation.  In many cases, the resulting combined pharmaceutical companies are bigger and have more financial, technical and market strength and greater resources, which increases competitive pressure in the industry.
There is ongoing effort by public and private payers to reduce the cost of drugs and reduce the overall cost of health care.  There continues to be greater pressure on drug manufacturers to provide greater discounts and rebates on their products.  The drug 
 17


distribution channels are complex and involve many different parties.  Recently, such channels have undergone and continue to undergo consolidation.  Drug wholesalers and retail drug chains have merged or consolidated resulting in significantly larger organizations with greater resources and bargaining power controlling multiple levels of the drug distribution network.  Consequently, pharmaceutical companies are facing increasing pressure to reduce prices.  Additionally, the emergence of large buying groups representing independent retail pharmacies and other drug distributors, and the prevalence and influence of managed care organizations and similar institutions, enable those groups to demand larger price discounts on our products. For example, there has been a recent trend of large wholesalers and retailer customers forming partnerships, such as the alliance between CVS and Cardinal Health. As a result of this consolidation among wholesale distributors as well as the growth of large retail drug store chains, a small number of large wholesale distributors control a significant share of the market. 
 Government Regulation
 Any potential products discovered, developed and manufactured by us or our collaborative partners must comply with comprehensive regulation by the FDA in the U.S. and by comparable authorities in other countries. These national agencies and other federal, state, and local entities regulate, among other things, the pre-clinical and clinical testing, safety, effectiveness, approval, manufacturing operations, quality, labeling, distribution, controlled substance security, export, import, storage, record keeping, safety and other reporting, sampling, advertising, marketing, and promotion of pharmaceutical products and medical devices. Facilities and certain company records are also subject to inspections by the FDA and comparable authorities or their representatives. 
 The FDA has broad discretion in enforcing the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (“FFDCA”) and the regulations thereunder, and noncompliance can result in a variety of regulatory enforcement actions ranging from warning letters, product detentions, device alerts or field corrections to recalls, seizures, manufacturing shut downs, quarantines, refusal of the government to approve NDAs or ANDAs, or supplements to the same, clinical holds, injunctive actions, withdrawal of approvals, civil or criminal actions or penalties, disgorgement, adverse publicity, labeling revisions, dear healthcare provider letters, FDA debarment, exclusion from Federal healthcare programs, contract debarment or refusal of future orders under existing government contracts, consent decrees, and corporate integrity agreements.  Furthermore, new government requirements may be established that could delay or prevent regulatory approval of our products under development.
 Drug Approval Process
 FDA approval of our own and our partners’ products is required before the products may be commercialized in the U.S. Section 505 of the FFDCA describes three regulatory pathways for marketing authorization for a new drug: 
  
• | A 505(b)(1) NDA is an application that is used for the approval of a new drug that contains full reports of investigations of safety and effectiveness.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | A 505(b)(2) NDA is an application where at least some of the information required for approval comes from studies not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference or use from the person by or for whom the investigations were conducted. This alternate route for regulatory approval permits the applicant to rely in part upon the FDA’s findings of safety and effectiveness for previously approved products and/or published scientific literature. The FDA may then approve the new product candidate for all or some of the labeled indications for which the reference product has been approved, as well as for any new strength, dosage form, route of administration or indication sought by the 505(b)(2) applicant that is supported by new clinical data and/or published scientific literature. The 505(b)(2) product, may have some or all of the same warnings and precautions in its label as the reference product.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Section 505(j) establishes an abbreviated approval process for generic versions of approved drug products through the submission of an ANDA. An ANDA provides for marketing of a drug product that has the same active ingredients in the same strengths, route of administration, and dosage form as the listed drug, which has the same labeling, performance, characteristics, and intended use as the listed drug, and has been shown to be bioequivalent to the listed drug. Limited changes to these factors are permitted in some cases but must be pre-approved by the FDA via a suitability petition. The FDA will approve the generic product as suitable for an ANDA application if it finds that the generic product does not raise new questions of safety and effectiveness as compared to the innovator product. A product is not eligible for ANDA approval if, among other reasons, the FDA determines that it is not equivalent to the referenced listed innovator drug, if it is intended for a different use, or if it is not subject to an approved suitability petition. ANDA applicants are generally required to conduct bioequivalence testing to confirm pharmaceutical and therapeutic equivalence to the branded reference drug. Generic versions of drugs can often be substituted by pharmacists under prescriptions written for the branded reference drug, pursuant to state laws.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 18


For both NDAs and ANDAs, the FDA reviews applications to determine, among other things, whether a product is safe and effective for its intended use and whether the manufacturing methods and controls are adequate to assure and preserve the product’s identity, strength, quality, safety, potency, and purity.
The following table provides a summary description of the various regulatory pathways:
 
 
 | ANDA | 505(b)(2) NDA | 505(b)(1) NDA 
--------------------------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Clinical Trials/Testing Required | Generally, bioequivalence. | Yes, to address potential differences between the branded reference product and the 505(b)(2) product, as well as bridging studies. | Yes, full reports of safety and efficacy. 
Results in Orange Book Listed Patents | No | Yes, for novel formulations, other enhancements and new indications. | Yes 
Exclusivity | Potential for 180 days against other generic filers if first generic to file a substantially complete application containing a paragraph IV certification that is lawfully maintained. | Potential for 30-month stay if ANDA or 505(b)(2) applicant citing our or our partners’ product as a reference listed drug includes a paragraph IV certification. | Potential for five years for a new chemical entity, or three years for new clinical investigations (other than bioavailability and bioequivalence studies) that are essential to approval of the application. Potential for 30-month stay if ANDA or 505(b)(2) applicant citing our or our partners’ product as a reference listed drug includes a paragraph IV certification. 
Patent Certification Required | Yes | Yes | No 
Potential orphan drug designation Drug Status | No | Yes | Yes 

 
NDA Submission
 The process required by the FDA before a new drug pharmaceutical product or a change to an already approved pharmaceutical product, may be approved for marketing in the U.S. generally involves:
  
• | pre-clinical laboratory and animal tests;
--+------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of an Investigational New Drug (“IND”) application, which must be in effect before clinical trials may begin;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | adequate and well controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the drug for its intended indication(s);
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | development of manufacturing processes to ensure the drug’s identity, strength, quality, and purity;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of a NDA;
--+--------------------------------


• | FDA compliance inspections and/or clearance of all manufacturers and facilities, as well as select clinical trial sites; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | FDA review of the NDA in order to determine, among other things, whether the drug is safe and effective for its intended uses.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 19


The preclinical and clinical testing and approval process takes many years and the actual time required to obtain approval, if any, may vary substantially based upon the type, complexity and novelty of the product or disease. Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, formulation and toxicity, as well as animal studies to assess the characteristics and potential safety and efficacy of the product. The conduct of the preclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements, including cGLPs. The results of preclinical testing are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND, to support human clinical trials along with other information, including information about product chemistry, manufacturing and controls, available scientific literature, and a proposed clinical trial protocol. Some preclinical testing may continue even after the IND is submitted. In the case of drug product candidates for which the sponsor will seek marketing approval via a 505(b)(2) NDA application, some of the above information may be abbreviated or omitted.
 A sponsor of a proposed clinical trial must submit an IND application to the FDA before a clinical trial may commence.  The IND application automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30-day time period, raises concerns or questions relating to one or more proposed clinical trials and places the clinical trial on a clinical hold, including concerns that human research subjects will be exposed to unreasonable health risks. If the FDA places a trial on clinical hold, the sponsor must address the issue to the FDA’s satisfaction before the trial may begin. In addition, an independent Institutional Review Board (“IRB”), covering each site proposing to conduct the clinical trial or a central IRB must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial, subject communications, and informed consent information for subjects before the trial commences at that site and it must monitor the study until completed. The FDA, the IRB, or the sponsor may suspend a clinical trial, place a trial on hold, or discontinue a trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk or for failure to comply with the IRB's or FDA’s requirements. 
 Once an IND is in effect, each new clinical protocol and any amendments to the protocols must be submitted to the IND for FDA review, and to the IRB for approval. Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must also be submitted at least annually to the FDA and the IRB and more frequently if serious adverse events or other significant safety information is found.
 Sponsors of clinical trials generally must register and report, at the NIH-maintained website ClinicalTrials.gov, key parameters of certain clinical trials, including clinical trial results within set timeframes. Failure to submit the required information to ClinicalTrials.gov can result in monetary penalties. Investigators must also provide certain information to the clinical trial sponsors to enable sponsors to make certain financial disclosures to the FDA. Moreover, under the 21st Century Cures Act, manufacturers or distributors of investigational drugs for the diagnosis, monitoring, or treatment of one or more serious diseases or conditions must have a publicly available policy concerning expanded access to investigational drugs.
 Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational new drug to healthy volunteers or patients in accordance with the applicable protocol and all applicable laws, rules and regulations. Clinical trials are typically conducted in sequential phases, which may overlap, though in the case of a 505(b)(2) NDA, some study requirements may be abbreviated.  Studies, in addition to the below, such as pediatric studies, may also be required by the FDA: 
  
• | Phase I - During phase I, when the drug is initially given to human subjects, the product is tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion. Phase I studies are often conducted with healthy volunteers depending on the drug being tested. If possible, Phase I trials may also be used to gain an initial indication of product effectiveness.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase II - Phase II involves controlled studies in a limited patient population, typically patients with the conditions needing treatment, to evaluate preliminarily the efficacy of the product for specific, targeted indications; determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage; and identify possible adverse effects and safety risks.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Pivotal or Phase III - Adequate and well-controlled trials are undertaken in phase III in order to evaluate efficacy and safety in a comprehensive fashion within an expanded patient population for seeking approval of the new drug. Typically, two Phase III trials are required by FDA for product approval.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
In the case of 505(b)(2) NDAs, the above studies may be abbreviated. In addition to the above traditional kinds of data required for the approval of a NDA, the recently passed 21st Century Cures Act, provides for FDA acceptance of new kinds of data such as patient experience data, real world evidence for previously approved products, and, for appropriate indications sought through supplemental marketing applications, data summaries.
 In addition, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, or PREA, a NDA or supplement to a NDA for a new active ingredient, indication, dosage form, dosage regimen, or route of administration must contain data that are adequate to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations, and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDA may, on its own initiative or at the request of the 
 20


applicant, grant deferrals for submission of some or all pediatric data until after approval of the product for use in adults, or full or partial waivers from the pediatric data requirements.
 The FDA, an IRB, or a sponsor may suspend or terminate clinical trials at any point in this process on various grounds, including a finding that patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk, if they decide it is unethical to continue the study, the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with FDA or IRB requirements, or based on evolving business objectives or the competitive climate. Results of pre-clinical and clinical trials must be summarized in comprehensive reports for the FDA. In addition, the results of phase III studies are subject to rigorous statistical analyses.
 Following marketing approval, sponsors may also voluntarily or be required to conduct additional studies, called Phase IV studies.  For instance, the FDA may approve a NDA for a product candidate, but require that the sponsor conduct additional clinical trials to further assess the drug after NDA approval under a post-approval commitment. In addition, a sponsor may decide to conduct additional clinical trials after the FDA has approved a NDA. 
 The results of drug development, pre-clinical studies and clinical trials are submitted to the FDA as part of a NDA. NDAs also must contain extensive chemistry, manufacturing and control information. In most cases, the submission of a NDA is subject to a substantial application user fee. Fee waivers or reductions are available in certain circumstances.
 Once the FDA receives an application, it has 60 days to review the NDA to determine if it is substantially complete to permit a substantive review. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept a NDA for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA’s goal is to review 90% of all applications for non-New Molecular Entities (“NMEs”), within ten months from the submission date. The FDA, however, may give a priority review designation to drugs that are intended to treat serious conditions and, if approved, would provide significant improvements in the safety or effectiveness of the treatment, diagnosis, or prevention of the serious conditions. A priority review means that the goal for the FDA is to review an application within six months of the submission date for non NMEs. These timeframes, however, are only goals, which FDA may not meet.  Moreover, the review process may also be extended if the FDA requests or the NDA sponsor otherwise provides substantial additional information or clarification regarding the submission.     
 The FDA may also refer drugs to advisory committees when it is determined that an advisory committee’s expertise would be beneficial to the regulatory decision-making process, including the evaluation of new technology. An advisory committee is a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, which review, evaluate, and make a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions.
 After evaluating the NDA and all related information, and inspection reports regarding the manufacturing facilities and clinical trial sites, the FDA may issue an approval letter, or, in some cases, a Complete Response Letter (“CRL”) describing the application deficiencies. If a CRL is issued, the applicant may either resubmit the NDA, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter; withdraw the application; or request an opportunity for a hearing. The FDA has the goal of reviewing 90% of application resubmissions in either two or six months of the resubmission date, depending on the kind of resubmission. Even with submission of this additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval. If and when those conditions have been met to the FDA’s satisfaction, the FDA may issue an approval letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications.
 ANDA Submissions
 Much like NDAs, FDA approval is required before a generic drug equivalent to a listed drug can be marketed. Generic drugs are the pharmaceutical and therapeutic equivalents of branded products, and are generally marketed under their generic (chemical) names rather than by brand names. A pharmaceutical company seeking to market a generic version of a branded drug must file a ANDA with the FDA. For ANDAs, applicants are not required to conduct complete clinical studies. Such applications, though, normally require bioavailability and/or bioequivalence studies. “Bioavailability” indicates the rate and extent to which the active ingredient or active moiety is absorbed from a drug product and becomes available at the site of drug action. “Bioequivalence” indicates that there are no significant differences in the rate and extent to which the active ingredient or active moiety becomes available at the site of drug action, when administered at the same molar dose and under similar conditions in an appropriately designed study. Generic drug products must be bioequivalent to a drug product approved by the FDA under a NDA application, referred to as a reference listed drug.  While an IND, in many cases, is not required for bioavailability and bioequivalence testing, such studies must still be conducted in accordance with Good Clinical Practices (“GCPs”) and under the supervision of an IRB.
 21


Like NDAs, ANDAs must be accompanied by user fees.  For generic drugs, other fees, such as fees for drug master files, program fees and fees for manufacturing facilities, also may also be required to be paid by the applicant, manufacturer, and/or drug master file holder.
 Following submission of an ANDA, the FDA has 60 days to evaluate the application to determine if it is substantially complete.  If the agency finds that the application is substantially complete, it will receive the application and begin its substantive review.  As part of this substantive review, the FDA will determine whether or not the generic version submitted by the company meets the necessary approval standards, including bioequivalence to the reference listed drug, adequate chemistry, manufacturing, and controls, and manufacturing facilities and clinical study sites passing pre-approval inspections.  Under FDA’s Generic Drug User Fee Act performance goals, the FDA has the goal of reviewing and acting on 90% of standard original ANDAs within ten months of submission.  Certain factors, such as the availability of other approved drug products, certain patent certifications, and certain exclusivities, may result in an ANDA being considered to be a priority ANDA, which can result in this review time being shortened to eight months, provided that a sufficiently complete and accurate pre-submission facility correspondence is submitted to FDA two months before the ANDA submission, and information provided in this correspondence remains unchanged.  
 Following its completion of the review of a ANDA, the FDA will either issue an approval letter or a CRL.  If a CRL is issued, the applicant may either respond to FDA, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter; withdraw the application; or request an opportunity for a hearing. The FDA has the goal of reviewing 90% of applicants’ CRL responses within eight or ten months, depending on whether a preapproval inspection is required.  This timeframe may be shortened to six or eight months, respectively, for priority responses and provided that certain criteria are met.  Even with the applicant’s submission of this additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval. If and when those conditions have been met to the FDA’s satisfaction, the FDA may issue an approval letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications.
 Upon approval, the FDA will rate generic drug products in the Orange Book.  Products meeting bioequivalence standards will typically receive an AB rating.  Under state law, such generic drug products may be able to be substituted at the pharmacy for the brand-name drug, without the intervention of the prescribing physician, unless otherwise specified by the patient or physician, Many third party payers of prescription drugs (e.g., health insurance plans, Medicare and Medicaid programs) have adopted policies to encourage the substitution of the lower-priced AB-rated generic drugs for the higher-priced branded drugs, when an AB-rated generic drug is available, as generic drugs are sold generally at prices below those of the corresponding branded products. Generic drugs may provide a cost-effective alternative for consumers, while maintaining the same active ingredient(s), dosage form, strength, route of administration, and conditions of use as the branded product.
 Generally Applicable Requirements
 Clinical trials for all product candidates must be conducted in accordance with GCPs, which include the requirements that all research subjects provide their informed consent in writing for their participation in any clinical trial as well as review and approval of the study by an IRB.  Before approving an application the FDA may inspect one or more clinical trial sites to assure compliance with GCPs.
 Further, during development, the manufacture of investigational drugs for the conduct of human clinical trials is subject to cGMP requirements. Investigational drugs and active pharmaceutical ingredients imported into the U.S. are also subject to regulation by the FDA relating to their labeling and distribution. Further, the export of investigational drug products outside of the U.S. is subject to regulatory requirements of the receiving country as well as U.S. export requirements under the FDCA.
 For both NDAs and ANDAs, the FDA also may require submission of a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (“REMS”) or REMS, to ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh the risks of the drug. The REMS plan could include medication guides, physician communication plans, and elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries, or other risk minimization tools. An assessment of the REMS must also be conducted at set intervals. Following product approval, a REMS may also be required by the FDA if new safety information is discovered and the FDA determines that a REMS is necessary to ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh the risks of the drug.  
 After approval, some types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes, and additional labeling claims, are subject to further testing requirements and FDA review and approval. Further, should new safety information arise, additional testing, product labeling, or FDA notification may be required.

The Hatch-Waxman Amendments, Regulatory Exclusivity, and Patent Term Extension
 Orange Book Patent Listing
 When a NDA is submitted to the FDA seeking approval of a drug, including a 505(b)(2) NDA, the applicant is required to list certain patents whose claims cover the applicant's product or method of use with the FDA. Upon approval of a NDA, each of the patents listed in the application for the drug is then published in the Orange Book. The Orange Book listed NDA products may be cited by potential competitors in support of approval of an ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA.  Any applicant who files an ANDA seeking approval of a generic equivalent version of a drug listed in the Orange Book or a 505(b)(2) NDA referencing a drug listed in the Orange Book must certify to the FDA that (1) no patent information on the drug product that is the subject of the application has been submitted to the FDA; (2) such patent has expired; (3) the date on which such patent expires and approval will not be sought until after the patent expiration; or (4) such patent is invalid or will not be infringed upon by the manufacture, use or sale of the drug product for which the application is submitted. This last certification is known as a paragraph IV patent certification. The applicant may also elect to submit a "section viii" statement certifying that its proposed label does not contain (or carves out) any language regarding the patented method-of-use rather than certify to a listed method-of-use patent. Generally, the ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA approval cannot be made effective by FDA until all listed patents have expired, except where the ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA applicant challenges a listed patent through a paragraph IV certification or if the applicant is not seeking approval of a patented method of use.
 If the ANDA or 505(b)(2) applicant makes a paragraph IV certification challenging an Orange Book-listed patent, a notice of the paragraph IV certification must be provided to each owner of the patent that is the subject of the certification and to the holder of the approved NDA to which the ANDA or 505(b)(2) application refers. 
 If the NDA holder or patent owners of the listed drug asserts an infringement of the patent in court within 45 days of the receipt of the paragraph IV certification notice, the FDA is prohibited from making the approval of the ANDA or 505(b)(2) application effective until the earlier of 30 months from the receipt of the paragraph IV certification, the expiration of the patent, the settlement of the lawsuit,  a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the applicant, or such shorter or longer period as may be ordered by a court. The ANDA or 505(b)(2) application approval also will not be made effective until any applicable non-patent exclusivity listed in the Orange Book for the reference drug has expired as described in further detail below.
 Non-Patent Exclusivity
 The holder of the NDA for the listed drug may be entitled to a period of non-patent exclusivity, during which the FDA cannot make the approval of an ANDA or 505(b)(2) application that relies on the listed drug effective. For example, a pharmaceutical manufacturer may obtain five years of non-patent exclusivity upon NDA approval of a new chemical entity (“NCE”), which is a drug that contains an active moiety that has not been approved by FDA in any other NDA. An "active moiety" is defined as the molecule or ion responsible for the drug substance's physiological or pharmacological action. During the five year exclusivity period, the FDA cannot accept for filing any ANDA seeking approval of a generic version of that drug or any 505(b)(2) NDA for the same active moiety and that relies on the FDA's findings regarding that drug, except that FDA may accept an application for filing after four years if the follow-on applicant makes a paragraph IV certification.
 The holder of a NDA, including one approved under Section 505(b)(2), may obtain a three-year period of exclusivity for a particular condition of approval, or change to a marketed product, such as a new formulation for a previously approved product or a new dosage form or route of administration, if one or more new clinical studies (other than bioavailability or bioequivalence studies) was essential to the approval of the application and was conducted or sponsored by the applicant. Should this occur, the FDA would be precluded from making the approval of any ANDA or 505(b)(2) application effective for the protected modification until after that three year exclusivity period has run. However, unlike NCE exclusivity, the FDA can accept an application and begin the review process during the exclusivity period.
 As a general matter, because the three year exclusivity is related to the product’s changed condition only, it does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs or 505(b)(2) NDAs for generic or modified versions of the original, unmodified drug product.  Instead, three year exclusivity prohibits the FDA making the approval of subsequent ANDAs and 505(b)(2) NDAs that seek approval for that same changed condition and that reference the drug product with the three year exclusivity effective. Five year and three year exclusivity will also not delay the submission or approval of a full NDA.
 In addition, an applicant submitting an ANDA to the FDA may be entitled to a 180 day market exclusivity period with respect to subsequently filed generic applications if such applicant is the first to submit a substantially complete application to FDA and whose filing includes a Paragraph IV certification that the applicable patent(s) are invalid, unenforceable and/or not infringed, obtains approval, and launches the product in the marketplace without triggering any statutory forfeiture provisions. An ANDA for a product designated as competitive generic therapy that does not otherwise have patent or exclusivity protections listed in the Orange Book and that is the first approved applicant, is also eligible for a period of 180 days of regulatory exclusivity with respect to other ANDAs. 
 23


These ANDA exclusivity periods, however, can be lost under certain circumstances.  Competitive generic therapies are products for which there is not more than one approved drug included in the Orange Book.
 Pediatric exclusivity is another type of non‑patent marketing exclusivity in the U.S. and, if granted, provides for the attachment of an additional six months of marketing protection to the term of any existing regulatory and statutory exclusivity for NDA products, including the non‑patent exclusivity period described above and patent protections. This six‑month exclusivity may be granted if a NDA sponsor submits pediatric data that fairly respond to a written request from the FDA for such data. The data do not need to show the product to be effective in the pediatric population studied; rather, if the clinical trial is deemed to fairly respond to the FDA’s request, the additional protection is granted. If reports of requested pediatric studies are submitted to and accepted by the FDA within the required time frames, whatever statutory or regulatory periods of exclusivity or Orange Book listed patent protection cover the drug are extended by six months. This is not a patent term extension, but it effectively extends the regulatory period during which the FDA cannot approve an ANDA or 505(b)(2) application owing to regulatory exclusivity or listed patents. Moreover, pediatric exclusivity attaches to all formulations, dosage forms, and indications for products with existing marketing exclusivity or patent life that contain the same active moiety as that which was studied.
 If approved, drug products may also be eligible for periods of U.S. patent term restoration.  If granted, patent term restoration extends the patent life of a single unexpired patent, that has not previously been extended, for a maximum of five years.  The total patent life of the product with the extension also cannot exceed fourteen years from the product’ approval date.  Subject to the prior limitations, the period of the extension is calculated by adding half of the time from the effective date of an IND to the initial submission of a marketing application, and all of the time between the submission of the marketing application and its approval.  This period may be reduced by any time that the applicant did not act with due diligence.  Whether any of our product candidates will be eligible for patent term restoration is currently unknown.  Later, the applicable regulatory authorities may determine that we are not eligible for such restoration periods.
 Depending on the drug product, other periods of regulatory exclusivity, such as orphan drug product exclusivity, may also block subsequent applicants.
 Orphan Drug Designation
 Some jurisdictions, including the U.S., may designate drugs for relatively small patient populations as orphan drugs. Pursuant to the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA grants orphan drug designation to drugs intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the U.S., or affecting more than 200,000 in the U.S. and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making the product available in the U.S. will be recovered from U.S. sales. Additionally, sponsors must present a plausible hypothesis for clinical superiority to obtain orphan designation if there is a product already approved by the FDA that is intended for the same indication and that is considered by the FDA to be the same as the already approved product. This plausible hypothesis must be demonstrated to receive orphan exclusivity.  This hypothesis must be demonstrated to obtain orphan exclusivity.  Orphan drug designation provides certain benefits, such as the opportunity for grants, tax credits, application user fee waivers, and exemption from program user fees under certain circumstances.  The tax advantages, however, were limited in the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.  If approved for the orphan designation, orphan designated drugs may receive seven years of exclusivity, which, subject to certain exceptions, protects the drug from FDA approval of another drug with the same principal molecular features for the same orphan indication.  FDA may, however, approve a product with the same principal molecular features for the same orphan indication during this time period, if such product is able to demonstrate clinical superiority.  Orphan exclusivity can also be lost under certain circumstances, such as the inability of the application holder to ensure sufficient quantities of the product.  Orphan drugs are also exempt from the above discussed PREA requirements. 
Combination Drug/Device Regulation
 Our products, our products marketed by our partners, as well as our products being developed by our partners are most often categorized as “drug-device combination products” because they contain both a drug and a device to administer the drug. To date, our and our partners’ combination products have been regulated as drug, and are therefore subject to the NDA, ANDA, sNDA, sANDA and 505(b)(2) drug approval process and regulations. Combination drug/device products raise unique scientific, technical and regulatory issues. The FDA has established an Office of Combination Products (“OCP”) to address the challenges associated with the review and regulation of combination products. The OCP assists in determining strategies for the approval of drug/delivery combinations and assuring agreement within the FDA on review responsibilities.  The device specific information is filed with FDA as part of the drug approval submission or it may be filed separately in the form of a device master file, also known as the master access file (“MAF”).  MAF is not an FDA approval submission, but is a filing that can be used to provide supporting data for our partners’ drug approval submissions.  A MAF will be reviewed by the FDA only when referenced in an approval submission.  By filing a MAF, we are able to provide information directly to the FDA, which can then be referenced by our partners in their drug approval submissions, without having to share our proprietary information directly with our partners.    
 24


Where common data elements may be part of several submissions for regulatory approval, as in the case of information supporting an injection system, a MAF filing with the FDA may be the preferred route.  A delivery device that is applicable to a variety of drug/device combination products, represents another opportunity for such a filing.  Another option would be to obtain a 510(k) premarket clearance from FDA for our delivery device as a stand-alone product. We intend to pursue such strategies as permitted by the law and as directed by the FDA either through guidance documents or discussions.
 Development of a device with a specific drug likely will be handled as part of the marketing application for the drug product, which may be a NDA, ANDA, or supplemental application. Under these circumstances, the device component is only approved if the drug component is approved.
 To the extent that our injectors are packaged with the drug, as part of a drug delivery system, the entire package will be subject to the requirements for drug/device combination products. These include drug manufacturing requirements, drug adverse reaction and other reporting requirements, and all of the restrictions that apply to drug labeling and advertising. Additionally, such products will also be subject to certain device requirements, including QSRs and certain device reporting requirements.  These requirements necessitate additional expenditures of time and resources, which could have a substantial adverse impact on our ability to commercialize our products and our operations.
 Other Post-Approval Requirements and Promotional Activities
 Any product manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements related to manufacturing, recordkeeping, reporting, including adverse experience reporting, drug shortage reporting, and periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, advertising, marketing, and promotion, and post‑approval obligations imposed as a condition of approval, such as Phase IV clinical trials, REMS, and surveillance to assess safety and effectiveness after commercialization.
 There also are continuing annual user fee requirements. In addition, drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register and, in the case of generic drug products, self-identify their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies and list their drug products.  Device manufacturers must also register their facilities and list the devices that they design, develop, manufacture, or import, except those subject to a drug approval.  These facilities must also pay annual registration fees. The distribution of prescription pharmaceutical product samples is also subject to the Prescription Drug Marketing Act (“PDMA”).
 The FDA closely regulates the post-approval marketing and promotion of drugs and devices, including standards and regulations for direct-to-consumer advertising, dissemination of off-label information, industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities and promotional activities involving the Internet. Drugs may be marketed only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. Further, if there are any modifications to the drug, including changes in indications, labeling, or manufacturing processes or facilities, we may be required to submit and obtain FDA approval of a new or supplemental NDA, which may require us to develop additional data or conduct additional preclinical studies and clinical trials. Failure to comply with these requirements can result in adverse publicity, Warning Letters, Untitled Letters, corrective advertising and potential civil and criminal penalties, as well as liability under the civil False Claims Act, exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs, mandatory compliance programs under corporate integrity agreements, debarment, and refusal of government contracts among other consequences.
 Physicians may prescribe legally available products for uses that are not described in the product’s labeling and that differ from those tested by us and approved by the FDA. Physicians may believe that such off-label uses are the best treatment for many patients in varied circumstances. The FDA does not regulate the behavior of physicians in their choice of treatments. The FDA does, however, impose stringent restrictions on manufacturers’ communications regarding off-label use. Specifically, manufacturers and product sponsors may not promote a product for off-label uses and must also comply with FDA’s other promotional requirements.
 Manufacturing and Quality Regulations 
 The FDA established regulations to require that the methods used in, and the facilities and controls used for, the manufacture, processing, packing and holding of drugs and medical devices conform to cGMPs and QSRs. The cGMP regulations the FDA enforces are comprehensive and cover all aspects of manufacturing operations, and require the conduct of investigations and FDA reporting under certain circumstances. The cGMP regulations for devices, called the Quality System Regulation, are also comprehensive and cover all aspects of device manufacture, from pre-production design requirements and validation to installation and servicing, insofar as they bear upon the safe and effective use of the device and whether the device otherwise meets the requirements of the FFDCA. Compliance with the regulations requires a continuous commitment of time, money and effort in all operational areas.
 25


Concurrent with clinical trials, companies must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the product candidate as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP and QSR requirements. The FDA conducts pre-approval inspections of facilities engaged in the development, design, import, manufacture, processing, packing, testing and holding of the drugs and devices subject to NDAs and ANDAs. In addition, manufacturers of both pharmaceutical products and active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) used to formulate the drug also ordinarily undergo a pre-approval inspection. Failure of any facility to pass a pre-approval inspection will result in delayed or non-approval and would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
 The FDA also conducts periodic inspections of drug and device facilities to assess the cGMP/QSR status of marketed products. Following such inspections, the FDA may issue an untitled letter as an initial correspondence that cites violations that do not meet the threshold of regulatory significance for a Warning Letter. FDA guidelines also provide for the issuance of Warning Letters for violations of “regulatory significance” for which the failure to adequately and promptly achieve correction may be expected to result in an enforcement action. Finally, the FDA could issue a Form 483 Notice of Inspectional Observations. Moreover, depending on the violation, the FDA could take more significant enforcement actions as a result of inspectional findings.  Any of the foregoing could cause us to modify certain activities identified during the inspection. If the FDA were to find serious cGMP/QSR non-compliance during such an inspection, it could take other regulatory actions that could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Imported API and other components needed to manufacture our products could be rejected by U.S. Customs. In respect to domestic establishments, the FDA could initiate product seizures or request or in some instances require product recalls and seek to enjoin or otherwise limit a product’s manufacture and distribution. In certain circumstances, violations could support civil penalties, criminal prosecutions, and sanctions that include preventing that company from receiving the necessary licenses to export its products, among other consequences.
 Controlled Substances Regulation
 Certain of our drug products are considered “controlled substances” as defined in the Controlled Substances Act (“CSA”) and implementing regulations, which, depending on the controlled substance Schedule, establish certain registration, security, reporting, storage, distribution, importation, inventory, quota, record keeping, and other requirements administered by the Drug Enforcement Agency (“DEA”). The DEA regulates controlled substances as Schedule I, II, III, IV or V substances, with Schedule I and II substances considered to present the highest risk of substance abuse and Schedule V substances the lowest risk. These requirements are directly applicable to us and also applicable to our contract manufacturers and to distributors, prescribers and dispensers of our products.
 The DEA regulates the handling of controlled substances through a closed chain of distribution. This control extends to the equipment and raw materials used in their manufacture and packaging, in order to prevent loss and diversion into illicit channels of commerce.
 The active ingredient in our product XYOSTED™, testosterone, is listed by the DEA as a Schedule III substance under the CSA. Consequently, XYOSTED™ is subject to certain regulations under the CSA. For example, certain prescription requirements must be met for the dispensing of Schedule III controlled substances both on the federal and state level.
 Annual registration is required for any facility that manufactures, distributes, dispenses, imports or exports any controlled substance. The registration is specific to the particular location, activity and controlled substance schedule. 
 The DEA typically inspects a facility to review its security measures prior to issuing a registration and on a periodic basis. Security requirements vary by controlled substance schedule.  Certain reports must also be made for controlled substances, such as reports for thefts or significant losses of any controlled substance.  Failure to maintain compliance with applicable requirements, particularly as manifested in loss or diversion, can result in administrative, civil or criminal enforcement action that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. The DEA may seek civil penalties, refuse to renew necessary registrations, or initiate administrative proceedings to revoke those registrations. In certain circumstances, violations could result in criminal proceedings.
 Individual states may also regulate controlled substances, and we, as well as our third-party suppliers and manufacturers, are subject to such regulation by several states with respect to the manufacture and distribution of certain controlled substances.
 Foreign Approval Process
 In addition to regulations in the U.S., we (and, where appropriate, our partners marketing medicinal products incorporating our devices) are subject to various foreign regulations governing clinical trials, manufacturing, and the commercial sales and distribution of our medicinal products. We and/or our partners must obtain approval of a medicinal product by the comparable regulatory 
 26


authorities of foreign countries before we can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. The requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, manufacturing, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement and the regulatory approval process all vary greatly from country to country. Additionally, the time it takes to complete the approval process in foreign countries may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval. Foreign regulatory approvals of our products are necessary whether or not we obtain FDA approval for such products. Finally, before a new drug may be exported from the U.S., it must either be approved for marketing in the U.S. or meet the requirements of exportation of an unapproved drug under Section 802 of the Export Reform and Enhancement Act or comply with FDA regulations pertaining to INDs.
 In the European Union (“EU”), marketing authorizations for medicinal products can be obtained through several different procedures, principally the centralized procedure, the decentralized procedure and the mutual recognition procedure. The centralized procedure allows a company to submit a single application to the European Medicines Agency (“EMA”), which may provide a positive opinion regarding the application to the effect that it meets certain safety, quality and efficacy requirements. A centralized marketing authorization will be granted based on a positive opinion of the EMA as approved by the European Commission. It is valid in all EU member states and three of the four European Free Trade Association countries (Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway). The centralized procedure is mandatory for certain medicinal products, including orphan medicinal products and biologic products, and optional for certain other high technology products. The decentralized procedure allows companies to file identical applications for authorization to several EU member states simultaneously for medicinal products that have not yet been authorized in any EU member state. The competent authority of one EU member state, selected by the applicant (the Reference Member State), assesses the application for marketing authorization. The competent authorities of the other EU member states are subsequently required to grant marketing authorization for their territories on the basis of this assessment except where grounds of potential serious risk to public health require an authorization to be refused. The mutual recognition procedure allows companies that have a medicinal product already authorized in one EU member state to apply for this authorization to be recognized by the competent authorities in other EU member states. 
 In so far as our products may be sold as medical devices outside of the U.S. (as opposed to a delivery system of a medicinal product) we are also subject to foreign legal and regulatory requirements. Legal restrictions on the sale of imported medical devices and products vary from country to country. The time required to obtain approval by a foreign country may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval, and the requirements may differ. We primarily rely upon the companies marketing our injectors in foreign countries to obtain the necessary regulatory approvals for sales of our products in those countries. 
 Our Minneapolis Quality Management System has ISO 13485: 2003 certification, the medical device industry standard for our quality systems. This certification shows that our device development and manufacturing comply with standards for quality assurance, design capability and manufacturing process control. Such certification, along with compliance with the European Medical Device Directive 93/42/EC (to be replaced in 2020 by the EU Medical Devices Regulation 2017/745), enables us to affix the CE Mark (a certification indicating that a product has met EU consumer safety, health or environmental requirements) to current products and supply the device with a Declaration of Conformity. Regular surveillance audits by our notified body, British Standards Institute, are required to demonstrate continued compliance.
 Other Healthcare Laws and Compliance Requirements
 In the U.S., the research, manufacturing, distribution, marketing, sale and promotion of drug products and medical devices are subject to numerous regulations by various federal, state and local authorities.  
 We are subject to various U.S. federal and state laws restricting certain marketing practices in the pharmaceutical industry, including anti-kickback laws and false claims laws. The federal healthcare program anti-kickback statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for or recommending the purchase, lease or order of any healthcare item or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid or other federally financed healthcare programs, except for activities protected by narrowly-drawn statutory and regulatory safe harbors. Liability under the federal anti-kickback statute may be established without a person or entity having actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it, and a violation of the anti-kickback statute may be grounds for a government or whistleblower claim under the federal False Claims Act. Violations of the federal anti-kickback statute may be punished by civil and criminal fines, imprisonment, and/or exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs. 
 The federal civil False Claims Act prohibits, among other things, any person from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment of federal funds, or knowingly making, or causing to be made, a false statement to get a false claim paid. Claims may be pursued by whistleblowers through qui tam actions, even if the government declines to intervene.  Intent to deceive is not necessary to establish civil liability, which may be predicated on reckless disregard for the truth.  The civil False Claims Act authorizes imposition of treble damages and a civil penalty for each false claim, such as an invoice, submitted for payment and may result in significant financial penalties and damages.  The criminal federal False Claims Act imposes 
 27


criminal fines or imprisonment against individuals or entities who make or present a claim to the government knowing such claim to be false fictitious or fraudulent.  Conviction or civil judgment for violation of the False Claims Act can also result in debarment from government contracting and exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs. 
Various federal and state health care programs obligate us to report drug pricing information that is used as the basis for their reimbursement rates for pharmacies and other health care providers, prices charged certain federal agencies and non-federal purchasers, and rebates on prescriptions paid by Medicaid and other plans.  States, such as California, have also enacted transparency laws that require manufacturers to report price increases and related information.  Some government health care programs impose penalties if drug price increases exceed specified percentages or inflation rates, and these penalties can result in mandatory penny prices for certain federal and 340B program customers. Failure to comply with the rules for calculating and submitting pricing information or otherwise overcharging the government or its beneficiaries could expose us to sanctions, including False Claims Act liability.
 In addition, the Physician Payment Sunshine Act provisions of the Healthcare Reform Act require extensive tracking of payments and transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals and public reporting of the data collected, and government agencies and private entities may inquire about our marketing practices or pursue other enforcement activities based on the disclosures in those public reports. The Sunshine Act and similar state laws impose reporting requirements for various types of payments to physicians and teaching hospitals. Failure to comply with required reporting requirements under these laws could subject manufacturers and others to substantial civil money penalties.
 The majority of states also have statutes or regulations similar to the federal anti-kickback law and the False Claims Act, which apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payer. A number of states now require pharmaceutical companies to report expenses relating to the marketing and promotion of pharmaceutical products and to report gifts and payments to individual physicians in the states. Other states restrict when pharmaceutical companies may provide meals to prescribers or engage in other marketing related activities. Some states require the posting of information relating to clinical studies and their outcomes. In addition, some states require pharmaceutical companies to implement compliance programs or marketing codes of conduct. 
 Although we may not provide financial assistance to Medicare patients taking drugs sold by us, the OIG has established guidelines that permit pharmaceutical manufacturers to make donations to charitable organizations who provide co-pay assistance to Medicare patients, provided that such organizations, among other things, are bona fide charities, are entirely independent of and not controlled by the manufacturer, provide aid to applicants on a first-come basis according to consistent financial criteria, and do not link aid to use of a donor’s product. If we or our vendors or donation recipients are deemed to fail to comply with relevant laws, regulations or evolving government guidance in the operation of these programs, we could be subject to damages, fines, penalties or other criminal, civil or administrative sanctions or enforcement actions. 
 Federal price reporting laws require manufacturers to calculate and report complex pricing metrics used to determine prescription rebates paid under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program and amounts reimbursed pharmacies and other providers by the Medicaid and Medicare programs.  Payment for a manufacturer’s drugs by these programs is conditioned on submission of this pricing information.  Failure to report accurate pricing information may result in criminal, civil, or administrative sanctions or enforcement actions.
 The Veterans Health Care Act of 1992 requires, as a condition of payment by certain federal agencies and the Medicaid program, that manufacturers of “covered drugs” enter into a Master Agreement and Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) contract with the Department of Veterans Affairs through which their covered drugs must be offered for sale at a mandatory ceiling price to certain federal agencies, including the VA and Department of Defense.  FSS contracts require compliance with applicable federal procurement laws and regulations, including disclosure of commercial prices during contract negotiations and maintenance of price relationships during the term of the contract, and subject manufacturers to contractual remedies as well as administrative, civil, and criminal sanctions.  The Veterans Health Care Act also requires manufacturers to enter into pricing agreements with the Department of Health and Human Services to charge no more than a different ceiling price (derived from the Medicaid rebate percentage) to covered entities participating in the 340B drug discount program.  Failure to provide the mandatory discount may subject the manufacturer to specific civil monetary penalties.  Termination of either of these agreements also jeopardizes payment by Medicaid for the manufacturer’s drugs.
 The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, which we refer to together as the Healthcare Reform Act, expanded healthcare coverage within the U.S., primarily through establishment of state insurance exchanges and expansion of the Medicaid program. This law substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers and significantly impacts the pharmaceutical industry. Changes that may affect our business include those governing enrollment in federal healthcare programs, reimbursement changes, payment of an annual fee by 
 28


manufacturers of branded drugs and biological products based on their share of the federal market, benefits for patients within a coverage gap in the Medicare Part D prescription drug program (commonly known as the “donut hole”), rules regarding prescription drug benefits under the health insurance exchanges, changes to the Medicaid Drug Rebate program, expansion of the Public Health Service’s 340B drug pricing discount program, or 340B program, fraud and abuse and enforcement. These changes impact existing government healthcare programs and are resulting in the development of new programs, including Medicare payment for performance initiatives and improvements to the physician quality reporting system and feedback program. The Affordable Care Act has since been amended to repeal the individual health insurance mandate and increase manufacturers’ share of Medicare Part D prescription costs in the donut hole, and other provisions of the law may be repealed and replaced by Congress, which may greatly affect these government and third-party programs and their effect on our business.  
 In addition, we may be subject to, or our marketing activities may be limited by, data privacy and security regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. One such statute is the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 ("HIPAA") and its implementing regulations. HIPAA established uniform standards for certain "covered entities," which are certain healthcare providers, health plans and healthcare clearinghouses, as well as their business associates, governing the conduct of specified electronic healthcare transactions and protecting the security and privacy of protected health information. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, commonly referred to as the economic stimulus package, included the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act ("HITECH"), which expanded certain of HIPAA's privacy and security standards. Among other things, HITECH makes HIPAA's security standards and certain privacy standards directly applicable to business associates. HITECH also created four new tiers of civil monetary penalties, amended HIPAA to make civil and criminal penalties directly applicable to business associates, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorneys' fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions.
 The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”) further prohibits any U.S. individual or business from paying, offering, or authorizing payment or offering of anything of value, directly or indirectly, to any foreign official, political party, or candidate for the purpose of influencing any act or decision of the foreign entity in order to assist the individual or business in obtaining or retaining business. The FCPA also obligates companies whose securities are listed in the U.S. to comply with accounting provisions requiring the company to maintain books and records that accurately and fairly reflect all transactions of the corporation, including international subsidiaries, and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls for international operations. Activities that violate the FCPA, even if they occur wholly outside the U.S., can result in criminal and civil fines, imprisonment, disgorgement, oversight, and debarment from government contracts.
 If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the health regulatory laws described above or any other laws that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including criminal and significant civil monetary penalties, damages, fines, imprisonment, disgorgement, contractual damages, reputational harm, exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs, injunctions, recall or seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production, denial or withdrawal of pre-marketing product approvals, private qui tam actions brought by individual whistleblowers in the name of the government or refusal to allow us to enter into supply contracts, including government contracts and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations. To the extent that any of our products are sold in a foreign country, we may be subject to similar foreign laws and regulations, which may include, for instance, the U.S. In particular, in the EU the data privacy regime is regarded as stricter than in the US and the coming into force of the General Data Protection Regulation on 25 May 2018 is in broad terms more restrictive than the current EU data protection laws. EU laws restrict the export of personal data outside the EU, for instance to the US, unless certain safeguards are in place.
 Third-Party Payer Coverage and Reimbursement
 The commercial success of the approved products in our portfolio depends, in part, upon the availability of coverage and adequate reimbursement from third-party payers at the federal, state and private levels. Patients who are prescribed treatments for their conditions and providers performing the prescribed services generally rely on third-party payers to reimburse all or part of the associated healthcare costs. Sales of our product portfolio will therefore depend substantially, both domestically and abroad, on the extent to which the costs of our product portfolio will be paid by health maintenance, managed care, pharmacy benefit, and/or similar healthcare management organizations, or are reimbursed by government health administration authorities, such as Medicare and Medicaid, private health coverage insurers and other third-party payers. The market for our product portfolio will depend significantly on access to third-party payers' formularies, or lists of treatments for which third-party payers provide coverage and reimbursement.
 Also, third-party payers are developing increasingly sophisticated methods of controlling healthcare costs. For example, for high cost specialty drugs, third party payers have begun demanding value-based pricing in which price is linked to performance metrics.  Further, coverage and reimbursement for therapeutic products can differ significantly from payer to payer. As a result, the coverage determination process will require us to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of our products to each payer separately, 
 29


with no assurance that adequate coverage and reimbursement will be obtained. The cost of pharmaceuticals and medical devices continues to generate substantial governmental and third-party payer scrutiny. We expect that the pharmaceutical industry will experience continued pricing pressures due to the trend toward managed healthcare, the increasing influence of managed care organizations and additional legislative and administrative proposals. Our results of operations and business could be adversely affected by current and future third-party payer policies as well as healthcare legislative and administrative reforms.
 Some third-party payers also require pre-approval of coverage for new or innovative devices or drug therapies before they will reimburse healthcare providers who use such therapies. While we cannot predict whether any proposed cost-containment measures will be adopted or otherwise implemented in the future, these requirements or any announcement or adoption of such proposals could have a material adverse effect on our ability to obtain adequate prices for our product portfolio and to operate profitably.
 In international markets, there are health technology assessment regimes with price ceilings and supply and demand side restraints on specific products and therapies and profit controls in certain countries including the UK. There can be no assurance that our products will be considered medically reasonable and necessary for a specific indication, that our products will be considered cost-effective by third-party payers, that an adequate level of reimbursement will be available or that the third-party payers' reimbursement policies will not adversely affect our ability to sell our products profitably.
 Healthcare Reform
 In the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions, the legislative landscape continues to evolve. There have been a number of legislative and regulatory changes to the healthcare system that will likely affect our future operations. In particular, there have been and continue to be a number of initiatives at the U.S. federal and state levels that seek to reduce healthcare costs, improve access, and improve quality. The Affordable Care Act (“ACA”), passed in 2010, provided more Americans with health care coverage while attempting to curb the growth in healthcare spending in the U.S..  The legislation included reforms to patient rights and protections, rules for insurance companies, taxes, tax breaks, funding, spending, and amended other laws including the Food, Drug and Cosmetics Act. Some of the main provisions of the ACA that affected the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry include, among others, the following:

• | an annual, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports certain branded prescription drugs and biologic agents, apportioned among these entities according to their market share in certain government healthcare programs;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | an increase in the statutory minimum rebates a manufacturer must pay under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program to 23.1% and 13% of the average manufacturer price for most branded and generic drugs, respectively, and inclusion of Medicaid managed care plan utilization in manufacturers’ rebate obligations;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | new methodologies by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program;
--+-----------------------------------------------------


• | expansion of eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs thereby potentially increasing manufacturers' Medicaid rebate liability;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | expansion of the entities eligible for discounts under the Public Health Service pharmaceutical pricing program;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | expansion of healthcare fraud and abuse laws, including the federal civil False Claims Act and the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, new government investigative powers, and enhanced penalties for noncompliance;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Since enactment of the ACA, some of its provisions have been repealed or amended, and other provisions may be repealed and replaced by Congress.
 The Drug Supply Chain Security Act imposes on manufacturers of certain pharmaceutical products obligations related to product tracking and tracing, among others.  Among the requirements of this legislation, manufacturers are required to provide certain information regarding the drug product to individuals and entities to which product ownership is transferred, are required to label drug product with a product identifier, and are required to keep certain records regarding the drug product.  The transfer of information to subsequent product owners by manufacturers is required to be done electronically. Manufacturers are also required to verify that purchasers of the manufacturers' products are appropriately licensed.  Further, manufacturers have drug product investigation, quarantine, disposition, and FDA and trading partner notification responsibilities related to counterfeit, diverted, stolen,  and intentionally adulterated products that would result in serious adverse health consequences or death to humans, as well as products that are the subject of fraudulent transactions or which are otherwise unfit for distribution such that they would be reasonably likely to result in serious health consequences or death. Similar requirements are also imposed on other trading partners in the supply chain.
 We expect that additional state and federal healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future. Legislators and regulators at both the federal and state level are increasingly focused on containing the cost of drugs, and there has been increasing legislative 
 30


and enforcement interest in the U.S. with respect to specialty drug pricing practices. Specifically, there have been  recent U.S. Congressional inquiries and proposed bills designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drugs. For example, California recently enacted a transparency law requiring manufacturers to report drug price increases and related information, and CMS reduced the payment rate for certain hospitals purchasing outpatient drugs at the 340B program discounted price.  In 2016, CMS issued a final rule regarding the Medicaid drug rebate program, which among other things, revises the manner in which the “average manufacturer price” is to be calculated by manufacturers participating in the program and implements certain amendments to the Medicaid rebate statute created under the ACA. However, certain aspects of the proposed rule have yet to be finalized.  Similarly, 340B program regulations on civil monetary penalties for statutory violations, which had been finalized in early 2017, went into effect in 2018. In October 2018, CMS issued an advance notice of proposed rulemaking paving the way for a proposed rule in 2019 that would significantly reduce the price of drugs paid by Medicare Part B by basing reimbursement on the average prices among other industrialized countries, and in January 2019, CMS proposed eliminating the Anti-Kickback Act safe harbor for rebates typically provided to PBMs and health plans that are included in their cost effectiveness determinations.   These and any additional healthcare reform measures could further constrain our business or limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services, which could result in additional pricing pressures.
 Other Regulatory Requirements
 In addition to regulations enforced by the FDA, we must also comply with regulations under the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Environmental Protection Act, the Toxic Substances Control Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and other federal, state and local regulations. We are also subject to various laws and regulations regarding laboratory practices, the experimental use of animals, and the use and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances in connection with our research. In each of these areas, as above, the FDA and other government agencies have broad regulatory and enforcement powers, including, among other things, the ability to levy fines and civil penalties, suspend or delay issuance of approvals, seize or recall products, and withdraw approvals, any one or more of which could have a material adverse effect on us.
Corporate Information
 Antares is a Delaware corporation with principal executive offices located at 100 Princeton South Corporate Center, Suite 300, Ewing, New Jersey 08628.  We have two wholly owned subsidiaries in Switzerland (Antares Pharma AG and Antares Pharma IPL AG).  On January 31, 2001, we completed a business combination to acquire the operating subsidiaries of Permatec Holding AG, headquartered in Basel, Switzerland. Upon completion of the transaction, our name was changed from Medi Ject Corporation to Antares Pharma, Inc. We were incorporated as a Delaware corporation on April 29, 2005.
Segment and Geographic Information
 We have a single reportable operating segment, which includes all of our self-administered parenteral pharmaceutical products and technologies.  See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 about segment financial information.
 Employees
 We believe that our success is largely dependent upon our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel in the research, development, manufacturing, business development and commercialization fields.
