Overview
As a worldwide marketing solutions partner, Quad leverages its more than 50-year heritage of platform excellence, innovation, strong culture and social purpose to create a better way for its clients, employees and communities. The Company’s integrated marketing platform removes friction throughout the marketing process thereby helping brands and marketers reduce complexity, increase efficiency and enhance marketing spend effectiveness. Quad provides its clients with a complete through-the-line marketing offering, providing unmatched scale for on-site services and expanded subject expertise in marketing strategy, creative solutions, media deployment and marketing management services. With a client-centric approach that drives the Company to continuously hone and evolve its offering, combined with leading-edge technology, advanced data and analytics and single-source simplicity, the Company has the resources and knowledge to help a wide variety of clients target, more deeply engage and grow audiences in multiple verticals, including those in established and emerging industries, such as retail, publishing, consumer technology, consumer packaged goods, financial services, insurance, healthcare and direct-to-consumer.
Quad was founded in Pewaukee, Wisconsin, as a Wisconsin corporation, in 1971 by the late Harry V. Quadracci. As of January 31, 2022, the Quadracci family, through the Quad/Graphics, Inc. Amended and Restated Voting Trust Agreement (“Quad Voting Trust”), has voting control of approximately 71%, which the Company believes provides it with continued stability and flexibility as Quad works to achieve its long-term strategic vision. As of December 31, 2021, the Company had approximately 15,100 full-time equivalent employees in North America (including Mexico and the Dominican Republic), South America, Europe and Asia, and served a diverse base of approximately 4,600 clients. Quad locations span 14 countries, including 45 manufacturing and distribution facilities and more than 90 client-based on-site locations, with additional investments in printing operations in India.
During Quad’s first 40 years, the Company grew rapidly through greenfield growth, built a premier manufacturing and distribution platform equipped with the latest technology, established its reputation as one of the printing industry’s foremost innovators and created a strong Company culture based on enduring values and commitment to social purpose that remains in place today.
Beginning in 2010, Quad strategically expanded its offerings to create enhanced value for its clients. Quad saw an opportunity to participate in industry consolidation in response to economic and industry pressures following the great recession of 2008 and 2009 that severely impacted print volumes and accelerated the impact of media disruption. Through a series of disciplined consolidating acquisitions that included World Color Press, Inc., Vertis Holdings Inc. and Brown Printing Company, the Company added experienced talent and enhanced and expanded its print-based product and service offerings while removing inefficient and underutilized capacity by transitioning work to more efficient facilities, and reducing costs. This period of consolidation created a disciplined cost reduction philosophy and advanced investment in the highly automated and efficient manufacturing and distribution capabilities the Company operates today.
Beginning in 2014, Quad focused on strategic investments in marketing services, talent and technology to accelerate its transformation as a marketing solutions partner. During this transformation period, known as Quad 3.0, Quad made several growth acquisitions including a premier marketing services provider specializing in customized marketing and business process outsourcing with unmatched scale for on-site marketing services; a top five independent creative agency offering world-class capabilities in strategy, including media buying and analytics, creative and account management, and packaging design and premedia services; and a leading performance marketing agency specializing in media, analytics and customer experience in digital channels. In addition, the Company hired business professionals with client-side marketing experience and consulting expertise to strategically expand its integrated marketing offering, enter new market verticals, and change product-centric conversations with clients to a solutions-based approach. To reflect its transformation to a marketing solutions partner with a strong foundation in print, the Company evolved its brand from Quad/Graphics to Quad in 2019.
Today, Quad provides brands and marketers with a more efficient and effective way to go to market and reach consumers. Through its integrated marketing platform, the Company creates greater value for clients by removing friction in the marketing process and speeding the overall marketing journey by delivering all the elements of a successful campaign under one roof. For Quad clients, this:
•Reduces the complexities of working with multiple agency partners and vendors. 
•Increases process efficiencies through workflow re-engineering, content production and process optimization. 
•Enhances marketing spend effectiveness through integrated solutions that help clients target, more deeply engage and grow audiences; plan and measure marketing; strategize, create and activate big ideas; produce content at scale; and connect with consumers in the most appropriate channels and with the right amplitude for eliciting maximum response. 
As a good corporate citizen, Quad also creates societal value through a strong commitment to proactively addressing environmental, social and governance matters. This dedication to driving positive, sustainable change in its business and in the world aligns with Quad’s long-standing commitment to create a better way – a hallmark of the Company’s culture.
In 2021, the Company delivered strong financial results while navigating the COVID-19 pandemic, paper and supply chain disruptions, inflationary cost pressures and labor shortages. Despite these challenges, Quad worked thoughtfully and diligently to mitigate these impacts on the business and proactively manage client expectations. Quad continued to grow print segment share because of its dependable performance, operational and financial stability, and ongoing investments in its platform. It also continued to expand its marketing solutions with new and existing accounts, providing clients with the simplicity, efficiency and effectiveness of an integrated approach. Further, Quad shared how it is creating a better way to drive positive change in its business and the world through a comprehensive environmental, social and governance report featuring commitments in key areas integral to its business strategy as a marketing solutions partner. Quad believes it will be able to maintain its leading competitive position through its consistent business strategy, dedicated and passionate employees, and integrated marketing platform, providing stability and innovative solutions for clients into the future.

Industry and Competition
According to an October 2021 Dun & Bradstreet First Research report, the U.S. advertising and marketing services industry is forecast to grow at an annual compounded rate of 4% between 2021 and 2026, as compared to portions of the printing industry which are in secular decline. The secular decline of the printing industry has accelerated due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the further migration of advertising dollars from print to digital channels. These industry dynamics support Quad’s transformation as a marketing solutions partner.
The advertising and marketing services industry is highly fragmented. According to the October 2021 Dun & Bradstreet First Research report, the top 50 companies in the U.S. advertising and marketing services industry generate approximately 40% of industry revenue. Services in this industry include advertising for print, broadcast and online media (about 43% of industry sales); public relations (12%); and direct marketing (10%). Other services include display advertising, media buying (reselling advertising time or space), and media representation (selling advertising time or space on behalf of media outlet owners). The U.S. advertising and marketing services industry includes about 38,000 establishments (single-location companies and units of multi-location companies), with combined annual revenue of about $110 billion.
The commercial print industry is also highly fragmented. According to the October 2021 Printing in the U.S. IBISWorld industry report, the United States commercial printing industry, in the aggregate, generates an estimated $78 billion in annual revenue, employs approximately 350,000 people and is comprised of over 45,000 companies. The report also states that no printing company accounts for more than 5% of total commercial print industry annual revenue in the United States.
In addition to being highly fragmented, competition in the printing industry remains intense, and the Company believes that there are indicators of heightened competitive pressures. The Company faces competition due to the increased accessibility and quality of digital alternatives to traditional delivery of printed documents through the online distribution and hosting of media content, and the digital distribution of documents and data. The Company faces competition from print management and marketing consulting firms that look to streamline processes and reduce the overall print spend of the Company’s clients. 
The commercial print industry has moved toward a demand for shorter print runs, faster product turnaround and increased production efficiency of products with lower page counts and increased complexity. This, combined with increases in postage expenses and the increased use of digital marketing and communication channels, has led to excess manufacturing capacity in the print industry. This excess capacity has allowed certain larger competitors, like Quad, with economies of scale, strong balance sheets and access to capital markets, the ability to invest in automation and more efficient equipment, take advantage of consolidating acquisition opportunities to remove excess, inefficient and/or underutilized capacity, and reduce overall costs.
Competition in both the advertising and marketing services and print industries is affected by real gross domestic product growth, as economic activity and advertising spending are key drivers of consumer demand. In times of economic prosperity, advertisers may increase spending to build brand awareness and to drive sales. Conversely, in times of global economic uncertainty and budget pressures, advertisers may reduce spending or shift their spending to other forms of media, as demonstrated during the COVID-19 pandemic. For print specifically, magazine publishers that face diminished advertising pages reduce total page counts and frequency; catalog marketers reduce page counts, circulation or frequency of print campaigns; retailers curb investments in store inventory and cut back on retail insert newspaper circulation and advertising; and other advertisers reduce their direct mail volume. It is possible that these customers instead decide to move advertising spend to digital alternatives.
Marketing services providers face pressure to satisfy major clients’ needs, as the win or loss of a major client account can impact revenue significantly. Another challenge facing marketing service providers relates to public concern and general annoyance with advertising methods. For example, data collection of personal information for marketing purposes is an issue under scrutiny from federal and state legislation, and marketing service providers are facing future restrictions on certain types of data they collect. In Europe, the European Union enforces data protection through the General Data Protection Regulations.
The Company faces competition in the advertising and marketing services industry based on access to a skilled workforce, pricing, adapting quickly to new technology, creating unique and effective campaigns and offering superior customer service. Across Quad’s range of printed products, competition is based on total price of printing, materials and distribution; availability of materials; quality; distribution capabilities; customer service; access to a highly skilled workforce; availability of labor; availability to schedule work on appropriate equipment; on-time production and delivery; and state-of-the-art technology to meet a client’s business objectives, including the ability to adopt new technology quickly.
As consumer media consumption habits change, marketing services providers face increased demand to offer end-to-end marketing services, from strategy and creative through execution, across all channels, traditional and digital. As new marketing and advertising channels emerge, marketing services providers must expand their services beyond traditional channels, such as for television, newspapers, print publications and radio, to digital channels, such as mobile, internet search, internet display and video, to create effective multichannel campaigns for their clients.
Quad believes that business users of print and print-related services are focused on generating and tracking the highest returns on their marketing spend. Quad believes it is well positioned to help clients achieve greater process efficiencies and marketing spend effectiveness through data-driven integrated marketing solutions. The Company believes that its clients receive the greatest return on their marketing spend when they start with a strong marketing strategy that uses print in combination with other media channels, informed by customer data, to create targeted and relevant multichannel marketing campaigns.
Seasonality
Quad is subject to seasonality in its quarterly results as net sales and operating income are higher in the third and fourth quarters of the calendar year as compared to the first and second quarters. The fourth quarter is typically the highest seasonal quarter for cash flows from operating activities and Free Cash Flow due to the reduction of working capital requirements that reach peak levels during the third quarter. Seasonality is driven by increased retail inserts and catalogs primarily due to back-to-school and holiday-related advertising and promotions. The Company expects this seasonality impact to continue in future years. Due to the continued uncertainty surrounding the continuing COVID-19 pandemic and supply chain shortages, the Company anticipates this seasonality may be further impacted in future periods, as the Company is heavily dependent on consumer demand.
Strategic Priorities 
Quad’s overarching business strategy and singular vision as a marketing solutions partner is achieved through the execution of the following five consistent strategic priorities:
Walk in the Shoes of Clients
The Company encourages all employees, regardless of job title, to walk in the shoes of clients by putting a priority on listening to clients’ needs and challenges, doing what they can to make it easy to work with Quad, and making the client experience enjoyable and inclusive at every touchpoint. With a focus on solving problems and removing friction wherever a client experiences it in the marketing process, Quad seeks to become an invaluable strategic marketing partner for its clients, helping them successfully navigate today’s constantly evolving media landscape through innovative data-driven solutions, produced and deployed efficiently across multiple media channels. A key component of Quad’s client-facing strategy is to strengthen relationships at higher levels within a client’s organization so the Company can better understand, anticipate and satisfy the organization’s requirements, including their diversity, equity and inclusion goals, and broader environmental, social and governance objectives. The Company also believes its proactive thought leadership in the key issues facing its clients, including data-driven marketing, mar-tech and postal reform, will foster loyalty to the Quad brand.
Grow the Business Profitably
This strategic priority centers on Quad’s ability to defend against significant media disruption, deploy balanced use of capital, including disciplined and compelling investments, and grow the business as a marketing solutions partner. Key components of this priority are:
•Acquire new and expand existing account relationships by introducing clients to the Company’s complete through-the-line marketing offering – from strategy and creative through production, execution and analytics – that helps them market more efficiently and effectively. To this end, Quad is focused on ensuring it has the right talent in the right positions to facilitate strategic marketing conversations and tailored solutions based on a better understanding of their needs.
•Expand in key vertical industries with growth opportunities, such as consumer technology, consumer-packaged goods, financial services, insurance, healthcare and direct-to-consumer, while continuing to capitalize on the Company’s established expertise in retail and publishing. Through existing and new offerings, Quad delivers solutions dedicated to solving client marketing and process challenges.
•Make disciplined and compelling investments that take many different forms. The Company intends to continue to pursue growth investments that help expand and strengthen its integrated marketing platform. In addition, the Company intends to continue making long-term investments in its talent, such as hiring business professionals with client-side marketing experience and consulting expertise to enhance its position as a marketing solutions partner, as well as investments to attract new employees and increase existing employee engagement, retention and productivity.
Bolster Platform Strength
The Company operates what it believes to be a superior and unparalleled integrated marketing platform, which it has consciously built to remove friction in the marketing process and speed the overall marketing journey through reduced complexity, increased efficiencies and enhanced marketing spend effectiveness across channels. Through this unique platform, the Company offers a complete through-the-line marketing offering featuring agency, consulting and implementation solutions encompassing marketing strategy, including consumer insights and data analytics; creative solutions for producing quality content at scale; and media deployment and optimization for all channels, including print, broadcast, digital, in-store, out-of-home and packaging supported by 24/7 global production, including industry-leading print manufacturing and mail-distribution capabilities. Quad uses a disciplined return on capital framework to make regular, strategic investments in this platform, resulting in what it believes is the most integrated, automated, efficient, innovative and modern marketing platform of its kind. The Company’s long-standing, disciplined culture of holistic Continuous Improvement and commitment to Lean Enterprise methodologies, along with ongoing, strategic investments in talent, technology, products and services to accelerate its position as a marketing solutions partner.
To strengthen its offering, the Company continually seeks to enhance its product portfolio, especially in the direct marketing, in-store and packaging spaces, with innovations that support clients’ ability to stand out in a consumer’s mailbox or front doorstep, or on the store shelf. These innovations include proprietary solutions unavailable anywhere else in the marketing, communications or printing industries. 
Additionally, Quad has chosen to strategically divest of those businesses that cannot be easily leveraged as part of its greater integrated marketing platform, such as the QuadExpress third-party logistics business Quad sold in 2021. Through these types of optimization efforts, Quad maintains a superior, unparalleled platform that delivers value to clients and, ultimately, their customers.
Empower Employees
Quad’s strategic priority to empower employees throughout their career journey builds on the key aspects of the Company’s distinct corporate culture, which the Company views as a competitive advantage. These aspects include the Company’s enduring values, which are centered on trust, innovation, growth, believing in people and doing the right thing. The Company understands that its employees perform better at work when they can simply be themselves – confident in their abilities, comfortable sharing their ideas, opinions and beliefs, and able to bring their truest and best selves to the workplace – all of which leads to a more inclusive environment and better engagement, decision-making and business outcomes. The Company embraces forward-thinking workplace practices, such as flexible work models for the long-term future of work; implements innovative talent acquisition strategies to meet its labor and business needs; and provides training and reward programs to engage, develop and retain its employees. Employees are encouraged to take advantage of the Company’s continuous growth environment, which not only teaches critical on-the-job and leadership skills, but also helps them respond to rapid change, cultivate effective networks, and create high-quality relationships necessary for personal, professional and company growth. The Company believes its approach to continuous growth for each employee is advantageously distinct from other employers. With the Company’s encouragement to do things differently, to be something greater and to create a better way, employees are more fully engaged in their day-to-day activities, producing better results for clients and advancing the Company’s strategic priorities. Additionally, the Company engages employees and fosters corporate pride by supporting community activities, initiatives and organizations that improve the quality of life near Quad’s operations. 
Enhance Financial Strength and Create Shareholder Value
Quad follows a disciplined approach to maintaining and enhancing financial strength to create shareholder value, which is essential given ongoing media disruption, including printing industry challenges. This strategy is centered on the Company’s ability to drive profitable growth, and maximize net earnings, Free Cash Flow and operating margins; maintain consistent financial policies to ensure a strong balance sheet, liquidity level and access to capital; and retain the financial flexibility needed to strategically allocate and deploy capital as circumstances change. The priorities for capital allocation and deployment are balanced according to prevailing circumstances and what the Company thinks is best for shareholder value creation at any particular point in time. Those priorities currently include: deleveraging the Company’s balance sheet through debt and pension liability reductions; making compelling investments that drive profitable organic growth and productivity in the Company’s print manufacturing and distribution operations, as well as expansion into higher-growth marketing services; and paying dividends and stock buybacks over the long term.
To provide ongoing improvement in manufacturing productivity and, ultimately, maximize operating margins, the Company applies holistic Continuous Improvement and Lean Enterprise methodologies to simplify and streamline processes. These same methodologies are applied to its selling, general and administrative functions to create a truly Lean Enterprise. The Company continually works to lower its cost structure by consolidating its manufacturing operations into its most efficient facilities, as well as realizing purchasing, mailing and logistics efficiencies by centralizing and consolidating print manufacturing volumes, and eliminating redundancies in its administrative and corporate operations. Quad believes that its focused efforts to be the high-quality, low-cost producer generates increased Free Cash Flow and allows the Company to maintain a strong balance sheet through debt and pension liability reduction. The Company’s disciplined financial approach also allows it to maintain sufficient liquidity and to reduce refinancing risk, with the nearest significant debt maturity of $211.5 million occurring in May 2022 and of which the Company is well-positioned to address at or before maturity due to its liquidity. The Company had total liquidity of $576.6 million as of December 31, 2021, which consisted of up to $396.7 million of unused capacity under its revolving credit arrangement, which was net of $35.8 million of issued letters of credit, and cash and cash equivalents of $179.9 million. In addition, the Company completed the amendment of its $1 billion bank debt agreement, extending the maturity to November 2026. Quad is proud of its strong and trusted banking relationships, which provide the Company with increased financial flexibility to continue to pay down debt and to make strategic investments to accelerate its position as a marketing solutions partner.
Competitive Advantages
Quad’s strategic priorities are powered by three key competitive advantages that the Company believes distinguish it from its competitors: a commitment to integrated marketing platform excellence, a commitment to ongoing innovation, and a commitment to its culture and social purpose.
Commitment to Integrated Marketing Platform Excellence
Through a 24/7 “always on” global platform featuring strategic consulting, creative talent, and production and implementation resources across North America, South America, Europe and Asia, Quad provides a better way to solve clients’ marketing and process challenges. The Company’s data-driven integrated marketing platform enables clients to strategically plan, produce, deploy, manage and measure their content across multiple media channels – rapidly, at scale and without handoffs that compromise quality, consistency and timeliness. Through this platform, Quad gives brands and marketers a more efficient, effective and frictionless way to go to market and reach consumers using its unmatched scale in client on-site services and expanded subject matter expertise in: 
•Marketing Strategy, including customer insights and analytics, campaign planning and media services, to understand and connect with a target audience; 
•Creative Solutions, including campaign development, photo and video production, adaptive design and cross-media production to produce quality content quickly and at scale; 
•Media Deployment, including print, broadcast, all forms of digital, in-store, out-of-home and packaging, to reach multi-channel consumers while maximizing budgets; and 
•Marketing Management Services, including dedicated marketing services teams, sourcing and procurement, and print and paper management, to remove friction in the process so clients can focus on other critical aspects of their business.
A key aspect of Quad’s integrated marketing platform is dedicated client on-site and near-site teams, including a network of photography and video production studios. These teams serve as a natural extension of a client’s internal marketing department, fulfilling traditional agency executional roles while also providing production efficiencies at scale for content creation, creative production and marketing execution. These teams also offer seamless access to the Company’s other integrated services and subject matter experts, removing friction in the marketing process. The Company believes this model increases process efficiencies and enables clients to focus on what they do best: sell more products, services and content. Quad has more than 500 professionals embedded at more than 90 on-site locations covering grocery, sporting goods, mass merchandisers and publishers.
Over its more than 50 year heritage, the Company also has led the industry in its printing and print distribution capabilities – the most capital intensive part of Quad’s integrated marketing platform, but also a key point of differentiation with traditional creative agencies and agency holding companies. Unlike traditional agencies or agency holding companies that develop creative and then outsource production, or traditional consulting firms that provide strategy and then outsource implementation, Quad provides all campaign elements for seamless, expedited execution. As far as printing, Quad continually invests in its equipment, automation and leading-edge technology to enhance print product features, including personalization, while maximizing labor productivity, increasing throughput and reducing labor costs. For example, through ongoing investments in digital press technology, the Company provides marketers and publishers a full range of options to produce and deliver more relevant content faster, in smaller print-run quantities, and more cost-effectively versus conventional web offset press technology. Recent investments in digital press technology also have enabled Quad to enter markets in which it previously was not as competitive. These ongoing investments, along with innovative front-end toolsets and data workflows, and industry-best, back-end logistics and postal optimization, have enabled Quad to better serve the needs of today’s leading marketers who prize direct access to consumers’ home mailboxes. Quad carries over this commitment to print media to other forms of media, including all forms of digital, broadcast, in-store and out-of-home.
Another key aspect of the Company’s manufacturing capabilities is the operation of very large facilities (greater than one million square feet) that produce multiple different product lines under one roof to maximize utilization of equipment and labor resources, while also driving savings in certain product lines (such as publications and catalogs) due to economies of scale. The Company has continued to strengthen its manufacturing operations by:
•Removing excess and/or under-utilized capacity, and by consolidating work into facilities where it can achieve the greatest manufacturing and distribution efficiencies.
•Reconfiguring and re-equipping manufacturing facilities for growth segments, such as direct mail, in-store and packaging. This includes recent investments in advanced digital sheetfed press technology that is new to the North America continent.
Postal rates are a significant component of many clients’ cost structures, and Quad believes that postal costs influence the number of pieces that its clients print and mail. Therefore, the Company has invested significantly in its mailing and distribution platform to mitigate increasing postage costs, and to help clients successfully navigate the ever-changing postal environment. One of Quad’s postal optimization programs is co-mailing, which involves the sorting and bundling of multiple printed products to be mailed to consumers in order to facilitate better integration with the United States Postal Service (“USPS”). In return, the USPS offers significant work-sharing discounts for this sorting, bundling and drop-shipping. Quad’s co-mail program is the largest in the print industry (based on information published or otherwise made available from competitors). Due to the continuously increasing costs of utilizing the USPS and to help control costs for its clients, Quad continues to expand its alternate delivery service for clients that altogether bypasses the USPS to deliver products to consumers’ doorsteps.
Commitment to Ongoing Innovation
At the forefront of innovation for more than 50 years, Quad believes its commitment to ongoing innovation drives its purpose to create a better way, which benefits all stakeholders.
Marketing Solutions
When it comes to marketing solutions, Quad takes a disciplined approach to (1) expand its existing product offerings; (2) develop and commercialize new products offerings; and (3) deliver integrated solutions that solve clients’ marketing and process challenges in the areas of Marketing Strategy, Creative Solutions, Media Deployment and Marketing Management. 
The Company has hired talent with client-side marketing experience and consulting expertise to help advance conversations with clients to be more solutions-based. Quad’s Sales team is focused on understanding client pain points, and aims to expand relationships with higher-level executives responsible for corporate strategy, including Chief Executive Officers and Chief Marketing Officers, to create and implement solutions that incorporate a broad range of Quad’s products and services. Through these relationships, the Company is able to gain insights into additional client marketing needs, and then uses a disciplined process to develop and commercialize those solutions to expand and deepen Quad’s relationships.  These solutions include media products, and innovative solutions for cost-effective mailing and distribution, as well as online and cloud-based solutions for effectively integrating multichannel campaigns.
Marketing Strategy: The Company has made recent investments in its data and analytics capabilities, including campaign planning and media services, to improve marketing execution and drive stronger results for clients and advertisers. The Company’s data-driven customer insights and analytics services not only help clients identify their optimal target audience based on behaviors and demographics, but also the best content and mix of channels to reach and engage that audience at the moment they are most receptive across all paid, owned and earned touchpoints. Proprietary and highly valuable household-level data and insights are derived from Quad’s unique data set, Profile Collective – a database of in-home resident media and mobile engagements, including QR code scans, that only Quad can compile. This unique information is augmented with existing third-party data and clients’ first-party information to create an unparalleled audience and household targeting tool.
Accordingly, the Company is able to outline the ideas, places, spaces and experiences that can deliver a communications strategy for maximizing end-customer value and behavior change (i.e., response). As far as measurement, the Company can provide a unified view of campaign, channel and individual tactic performance. Complementing these services are advanced testing capabilities, including a proprietary online testing platform that allows clients to rapidly test print alternatives to identify precisely what combination of format, offer, messaging and imagery will be most successful. The Company has innovated media buying by providing in-house media services for all channels, creating a single point of accountability for streamlined planning, execution, measurement and testing of all marketing efforts while reducing cycle time, leading to more opportunities to iterate, adjust and optimize spend across all channels and segments.
Creative Solutions: With its premier marketing, advertising and creative talent, Quad creates world-class campaigns that attract attention and activate audiences, and then implements those campaigns using processes that save money and time to get in market faster. Technology plays a key role in Quad’s Creative Solutions which include content workflow solutions that simplify and optimize the creative process, from concept through production; content production services that enable clients to generate high-volume, high-quality content with a noncompetitive, complementary partner; creative services that seamlessly connect strategy, concept and design; and mar-tech solutions centered on solving client challenges in the areas of marketing operations, content accessibility, content production (including but not limited to copywriting, videography and photography), content workflows, asset management, content deployment and data optimization. Clients credit the Company’s creative solutions for providing a more integrated, channel agnostic, content-first approach.
Media Deployment: Unlike traditional creative agencies or agency holding companies, Quad has the ability to seamlessly activate through-the-line media – both online and offline – and create value by understanding how every touchpoint in a client’s marketing and media mix is performing at a particular moment in time and then guiding how to optimize that investment to provide the greatest return. The Company manages hundreds of millions of dollars of gross media billings annually on behalf of its clients. As the number of marketing channels expands, each with its own return-on-investment measurement, the Company continues to innovate mar-tech solutions that help marketers know where to allocate their marketing budget to achieve their business goals. For example, through Connex, its proprietary cross-channel media optimization platform, Quad helps digital marketers eliminate the noise of disparate data sets and helps marketers identify the specific value-driving actions they need to take in real time to drive revenue and grow their business.
Quad’s maintains its leadership in print by leveraging its expertise in every facet of print production and deployment. Quad’s own Smartools® proprietary enterprise resource planning system provides seamless, real-time information flow across print sales and estimating, production planning, scheduling, manufacturing, warehousing, logistics, invoicing, reporting and customer service. Quad also has applied robotic process automation to streamline data processing and report generation. Where appropriate, Quad also leverages artificial intelligence in areas such as labor management, scheduling and predictive machine maintenance.
Quad continues to make investments in the most advanced and efficient print manufacturing and distribution capabilities in the industry, averaging 2% of its annual net sales for capital expenditures over the past five years. These investments, which include automated guided vehicles, robotic palletizers and efficient digital and wide-web offset presses, have resulted in what the Company believes is the most advanced and efficient print manufacturing and distribution capabilities in the industry and have allowed the Company to reduce the amount invested in recent years without impacting its leading technological excellence. These investments also have enabled it to remain the print industry’s high-quality, low-cost producer.
Marketing Management: Quad leverages its deep expertise and expansive network to help clients manage their operations the way it runs its own – with diligence toward efficiency and cost-savings. Through this innovative approach, Quad removes friction in the process, offering clients its network of in-house experts and capabilities for marketing and production outsourcing; sourcing and procurement of goods and services; and print and paper management. As a result, clients can focus on other critical aspects of business while leveraging Quad’s expertise and purchasing power.
Vertically Integrated Capabilities
A commitment to innovation and creating a better way to do business has also helped to expand Quad’s vertically-integrated print and non-print capabilities. Through ongoing innovation in prepress/premedia services, paper procurement and ink manufacturing (through Quad’s Chemical Research\Technology subsidiary), the Company maintains a competitive advantage in delivering lower costs and enhanced customer service for its clients while providing the Company with substantial control over critical links in the overall print supply chain to help control the quality, cost and availability of key inputs in the printing process.
The Company created a health and wellness subsidiary, QuadMed, LLC (“QuadMed”) in 1990 to address its own employees’ needs for quality, cost-effective health care. Today, QuadMed provides worksite health care solutions nationally for approximately 60 employers of all sizes and across all industries, including private and public sector employers. These solutions include onsite, near-site and virtual health delivery of comprehensive primary and preventive care, condition management, wellness programs and coaching, physical therapy, behavioral health, pharmacy services, occupational health and more. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Quad, its employees and their dependents have benefited from guidance and best practices provided by QuadMed, which maintains relationships with leading health care organizations and research organizations across the country.
Commitment to Culture and Social Purpose
Quad believes its ability to create value is not limited to generating economic value, but also social and environmental value, and that the Company can do good in the world while doing well as a business. Quad’s long-standing focus on “creating a better way” – a hallmark of the Company’s culture for more than 50 years – has inspired creativity in how it addresses environmental, social and business challenges and contributed to good corporate citizenship. Further, the Company believes that its distinct corporate culture, which evolved from a core set of values conceived by the Company’s late founder Harry V. Quadracci, drives thoughtful decision-making, especially with regard to its disciplined approach to managing operations, innovating solutions for clients, and better positioning the Company to prevail in a dynamic marketplace.
In this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the Company reports on its commitment to culture and social purpose through achievements in environmental, social (Human Capital Management) and governance matters as outlined below.
Environmental
Quad believes that doing what is good for the environment is good for business, and seeks to operate in an environmentally responsible manner by challenging itself to find new and better ways to conduct business that better serves the environment and reflect the values of its clients and their customers. This approach focuses on conserving raw materials, minimizing waste, recycling and reusing products and materials, and reducing environmental impacts wherever possible across Quad’s integrated marketing platform. Examples of Quad’s commitment to environmental responsibility and sustainability include:
•Aligning the Company’s efforts and initiatives with environmentally focused United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) such as SDG 12: Responsible Consumption and Production and SDG 15: Life on Land.
•Partnering with federal, state and local regulatory agencies; educational institutions; industry trade groups; and non-profit organizations to share information, best-management practices, development of new tools and metrics, and innovative technology that lead to the reduction or elimination of environmental impacts.

As the owner, lessee or operator of various real properties and facilities, Quad is subject to various federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations, including those relating to air emissions; waste generation, handling, management and disposal; sanitary and storm water discharge; and remediation of contaminated sites. Historically, compliance with these laws and regulations has not had a material adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations, financial position or cash flows. Compliance with existing or new environmental laws and regulations may require the Company to make future expenditures.
Human Capital Management
The Company continually invests in and supports its employees. Its people-focused, values-driven culture is a key competitive advantage that the Company believes distinguishes itself from its competitors. 
Attracting, Developing and Retaining Highly Qualified Talent
Quad relies on highly qualified, skilled and knowledgeable talent to advance its strategic priorities and maintain its competitive advantage. Accordingly, the Company heavily invests in efforts to attract, develop and retain employees, and in tools, technologies, processes, training and education to increase engagement, productivity and efficiency.
As of December 31, 2021, the Company had approximately 15,100 full-time equivalent (“FTE”) employees in the following geographies:

Geographic Region | Number of FTE Employees
North America (Includes Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean) | 12,700 
Europe, Middle East and Africa | 1,500 
South America | 800 
Asia | 100 

The ways in which Quad attracts, develops and retains highly qualified talent include, among others, the following:
•Providing and maintaining a world-class culture and environment for health and safety. The Company strives for zero workplace injuries and illnesses through its Safety Accountability for All Employees (SAFE) policy which states that no department is considered properly managed – regardless of proficiency in other managerial areas – unless it maintains an acceptable level of safety performance. All employees, from entry-level through senior management, are held accountable for adhering to the Company’s safety policies. In 2020, the Company also implemented a Safe at Work program in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, which prioritizes the health and safety of employees through a variety of initiatives. (For additional information on this program, see “COVID-19” below).
•Creating jobs with competitive pay and innovative benefits that support families, strengthen communities and provide long-term career growth opportunities. The Company regularly evaluates its pay practices and structures, including implementing a new wage structure over the past few years for hourly manufacturing employees in its most competitive labor markets.
•Offering career development through a variety of programs, including Accelerated Career Training, which provides a fast-track for career advancement in manufacturing positions; People Leading People that focuses on best-in-class manager behaviors; Corporate Trainee Program, which develops skills and leadership abilities through a series of agency and corporate rotations; and hands-on, mentor-led manufacturing apprenticeship programs, including registered apprenticeships and youth apprenticeships.
•Listening to employees through annual engagement surveys and open forums at department and company-wide meetings to help better understand what employees like about working for the Company, what it can improve, and what could drive greater job satisfaction, and acting on that employee feedback. 
•Fostering pride through employee recognition programs, including a new engagement and retention award for manufacturing locations that work to create an engaging workplace; employee and family events; and community outreach activities.
•Offering a new flexible work model (aka The Future of Work @ Quad) for office-based employees who have been working remotely during the pandemic that provides benefits to both employees and the business by emphasizing flexibility based on roles, technology requirements and responsibilities.
Compensation and Benefits
The Company invests in its workforce by offering market competitive compensation, regularly conducting total compensation benchmarking as part of its basic operations, as well as offering a comprehensive benefits package as part of its Total Rewards program. Features of this program include:
•Comprehensive medical, prescription, dental and vision coverage to employees, including access to 24/7 telemedicine and virtual care being piloted in certain regions.
•On-site and near-site primary and specialty healthcare, pharmacy, dental, vision and physical therapy services and fitness centers at several large-scale employee locations, owned and operated by the Company’s health and wellness subsidiary, QuadMed.

•Short- and long-term disability insurance, and employer-paid life insurance.
•On-site affordable childcare and summer camps for school-aged children at some of the Company’s largest manufacturing locations.
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI) is part of Quad’s overall business strategy and a key driver behind specific business outcomes, including attracting and retaining talent, strengthening and protecting its brand reputation, increasing employee productivity, and competing in growth verticals. Quad’s DEI strategy is focused on (1) achieving a workforce that reflects the communities where employees live and work, as well as the clients who trust Quad with their business; (2) ensuring that procedures, processes and distribution of resources create equal opportunities and fair and just outcomes; and (3) creating a safe and open environment where all Quad employees can bring their truest and best selves to work every day, consistent with the Company’s long-standing values. 
The Company is focused on the following areas to ensure it achieves its stated DEI goals:
•Launching a DEI task force to build and execute a more comprehensive and sustainable strategy that supports learning and development, intercultural awareness and growth, removes inhibitors to true inclusion in areas such as workforce policies and procedures, procurement and how the Company serves its clients, creates a consistent and common language throughout the organization to increase understanding, and establishes metric reporting.
•Strengthening Quad’s commitment to DEI through partnerships with nationally recognized DEI experts, consultants and researchers that include tailored learning and development programs for employees.
•Supporting employee-led Business Resource Groups (BRGs), which are designed to cultivate an open company culture for employees who share common interests and can easily and regularly connect to encourage the growth and development of each other. The Company currently has six BRGs supporting women, military veterans and their families, the LGBTQIA+ community, Black employees, Hispanic / Latinx employees and working parents.
•Investing in programs to support underserved communities, such as Milwaukee-based Running Rebels’ Pipeline2Promise workforce development program where Quad connects people to jobs, and provides the tools, training and transportation to set them up for success. 
•Engaging employees in DEI-related topics through I am. We Are., an internal education and communication platform. 
•Supporting the education and advancement of talent from underrepresented communities in the creative industry through scholarships at institutions committed to diversifying the talent pipeline and talent development programs, such as The Brandlab, a non-profit that introduces young people who are racially or ethnically diverse or from lower-income households to viable creative careers.
•Growing a more inclusive supplier base by developing mutually beneficial relationships with suppliers representing women-, minority-, LGBTQIA+, veteran- and disability-owned businesses.
Building Strong Communities
The Company continuously seeks to build strong relationships with the communities where employees live and work through volunteerism, outreach, philanthropy, pro bono and in-kind services, and charitable giving. Through its efforts, the Company has made a meaningful difference through support of:
•Important community pillars, such as firefighters, schools, libraries and military veterans groups; 
•Organizations that help underserved communities, such as non-profits dedicated to improving educational or employment opportunities for individuals who are racially or ethnically diverse or from lower-income households; and
•Employees who are involved in local volunteer efforts and charitable events, from stocking food pantries to assembling care packages for military service members to participating in fundraisers and holiday toy and clothing drives. 
Communication
The Company believes that timely, transparent communication with all employees is an important engagement tool, and uses a variety of channels to inform and educate employees about business operations and matters of personal importance (e.g., benefits). These channels include InsideQuad, the employee intranet; executive blogs and video logs (vlogs); executive town halls; department meetings; email; text messaging; in-plant electronic and print signage; and in-home mailings. Quad’s CEO hosts regular town halls for all employees, accessible online and also posts video and written messages.
Corporate Governance
Effective corporate governance has been a part of Quad since its founding and is informed by the Company’s values, especially Do the Right Thing, which strengthens partnerships, reduces risk and creates sustainable value for the long term. Key aspects of Quad’s approach to strong governance practices include:
•Maintaining consistent, stable leadership that is focused on making decisions in the best long-term interest of the Company. It is able to do this because of the Quadracci family voting control, which enables the Company to manage its strategy and disciplined financial policy by being able to avoid the pitfalls of short-term decision making that could potentially jeopardize the stability and longevity of the Company.
•Retaining an experienced management team with a proven track record that is committed to preserving the Company’s values-based culture. The senior management team includes entrepreneurially minded leaders with a long tenure at Quad combined with strategic new hires or leaders from recent acquisitions, further supplemented by managers and employees committed to advancing the Company as a marketing solutions partner. The Company believes the experience and stability of senior management, paired with next-generation talent, will contribute to its long-term success.
•Sustaining a disciplined approach to managing operations and commitment to innovating solutions to drive growth for clients and the Company. 
•Reducing risk to the business and to clients through a formal enterprise risk management program that is guided by a team that takes a strategic role in risk identification and response planning, and is managed by an executive risk steering committee with overall program responsibility. 
•Maintaining a high standard for corporate compliance and ethical business practices to keep the business healthy and protect the Company and its stakeholders from risk. The Company’s values, especially Do the Right Thing, serve as the foundation for Quad’s ethical approach to decision-making and business practices. The Company’s Code of Conduct appears on the employee intranet and corporate website, and explicitly states that Quad is committed to a workplace where every employee, regardless of job title or position, is responsible for doing the right thing. 
•Training all employees annually on a suite of ethics and compliance topics, including Code of Conduct, anti-harassment, conflict of interest, C-TPAT, data privacy, HIPAA, information security and physical security, acceptable use policy for technology assets, and, where relevant, fraud, waste and abuse training, and anti-bribery and anti-corruption training. 
•Making it safe and easy for employees to report violations of the Code of Conduct through multiple channels, including a 24/7 Ethics and Compliance Hotline or web-based reporting tool with guidance in multiple languages.
•Continually updating and strengthening the Company’s information and data security program to address the fast-changing threat landscape and ensure oversight. The program includes ongoing employee 
education to ensure physical and digital workspaces remain secure, valuable data remains private, spot potential phishing and malware threats, and avoid risky behaviors.
•Creating a Supplier Code of Conduct to ensure suppliers, vendors, contractors, consultants, agents and other providers of goods and services follow the Company’s policies related to business integrity, ethical labor and human rights practices, associate health and safety, and environmental management. This Code also includes anti-corruption and anti-bribery policies. 
COVID-19
Throughout the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, Quad has prioritized protecting employees’ health and well-being while also protecting the financial health and long-term viability of the Company. The Company’s COVID-19 response is led by an internal Crisis Management Team consisting of leaders from Risk Management, Human Resources, Legal, Manufacturing, Agency Solutions and Communications, as well as medical professionals from QuadMed, the Company’s health and wellness subsidiary. The Company’s response is informed by guidance from the public health professionals, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, local health authorities, and direction from federal and state governments, along with best practices and recommendations from QuadMed, which maintains relationships with leading health care organizations and research universities across the country.
Quad’s Safe at Work program, updated throughout the pandemic, provides for the health and safety of employees while we continue to meet the needs of clients. This program:
•Strongly encourages all employees and family members to get the COVID-19 vaccine and booster, making it as easy as possible to do so through the Company’s own QuadMed health clinics and on-site vaccination events. Quad also offered incentives and a competition between manufacturing facilities to achieve higher vaccination rates.
•Details policies and procedures for mask wearing, social distancing, good hygiene, daily disinfecting and more to protect against COVID-19.
•Features an internal Rapid Response Team of HR and other professionals to assess each potential COVID-19 case, perform contact tracing, and support and track employees through their return to work at the appropriate time.
•Includes a branded communication strategy built on transparent, frequent and consistent communication across multiple channels and regularly featuring QuadMed healthcare professionals. 
•Equips any employee able to perform their duties remotely to work from home to prevent the spread of the virus, especially during times of high transmission rates.
Clients
Quad enjoys long-standing relationships with a diverse base of clients, which includes both national and regional corporations in North America, South America, Europe and Asia. The Company’s clients include industry-leading blue chip companies that operate in a wide range of industries and serve both businesses and consumers, including retailers, publishers and direct marketers. The Company’s relationships with its largest clients average over 17 years in duration.
In 2021, Quad served approximately 4,600 clients, and its ten largest clients accounted for approximately 16% of consolidated sales, with none representing more than 5% individually. The Company believes that its large and diverse client base, broad geographic coverage and extensive range of marketing capabilities are competitive strengths.
Patents, Trademarks and Trade Names
Quad operates research and development facilities that support the development of new equipment, process improvements, raw materials and content management, and distribution technologies to better meet client needs and improve operating efficiencies. The Company continues to innovate within the printing and print-related industry and, as a result, has developed what it believes to be one of the most powerful patent portfolios in the print industry.
Quad currently holds or has rights to commercialize a wide variety of worldwide patents and applications relating to its business. The Company intends to continue to file patent applications that it believes will help ensure the continued strength of the Company and its portfolio. Additionally, the Company markets products, services and capabilities under a number of trademarks and trade names. Quad aggressively defends its intellectual property rights and intends to continue to do so in the future.
Raw Materials
The primary raw materials that Quad uses in its print business are paper, ink and energy. At this time, the Company’s supply of raw materials are available from numerous vendors; however, based on market conditions, the current supply is under pressure due to supply chain shortages and higher than expected inflation. The Company generally buys these raw materials based upon market prices that are established with the vendor as part of the procurement process.
Approximately half of the paper used in the printing process is supplied directly by the Company’s clients. For those clients that do not directly supply their own paper, the Company makes use of its purchasing efficiencies to supply paper by negotiating with leading paper vendors, uses a wide variety of paper grades, weights and sizes, and does not rely on any one vendor. In addition, the Company generally includes price adjustment clauses in sales contracts for paper and other critical raw materials in the printing process. Although these clauses generally mitigate paper price risk, higher paper prices and tight paper supplies, as well as changes in the United States import or trade regulations, may have an impact on client demand for printed products. The Company’s working capital requirements, including the impact of seasonality, are partially mitigated through the direct purchasing of paper by its clients.
The Company produces the majority of ink used in its print production, allowing it to control the quality, cost and supply of key inputs. Raw materials for the ink manufacturing process are purchased externally from a variety of vendors.
The Company generally cannot pass on to clients the impact of higher electric and natural gas energy prices on its manufacturing costs, and increases in energy prices result in higher manufacturing costs for certain of its operations. The Company mitigates its risk through natural gas hedges when appropriate. In its logistic operations, however, the Company is able to pass a substantial portion of any increase in fuel prices directly to its clients.
Strategic Investments
On June 15, 2020, the Company purchased units of equity in Rise Interactive Media & Analytics, LLC (“Rise”) from a previous holder in the form of a $15.9 million note payable paid in full on October 1, 2020, and $1.0 million cash paid on June 15, 2020. In addition, on June 15, 2020, Rise purchased and retired units of equity from previous holders of Rise for $5.4 million in cash. These transactions resulted in the Company’s ownership interest changing from 57% to 99%. On April 30, 2021, Rise purchased and retired units of equity from previous holders of Rise for $1.9 million in cash. This transaction resulted in the Company’s ownership interest changing from 99% to 100%. The Company began consolidating the results of Rise in the Company’s consolidated financial statements when its equity ownership increased to 57% on March 14, 2018. The portion of Rise’s operating results not owned by the Company of 43% through June 15, 2020 and of 1% from June 15, 2020 through April 30, 2021, was recorded as net earnings (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests on the consolidated statement of operations. The portion of net assets not owned by the Company was recorded as noncontrolling interests as of the December 31, 2020 consolidated balance sheet.
