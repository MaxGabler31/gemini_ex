ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
Our goal is to slow the progression of chronic kidney disease, or CKD, through the treatment of metabolic acidosis. We are a pharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of our drug candidate, TRC101 (veverimer), a non-absorbed, orally-administered polymer designed to treat metabolic acidosis by binding and removing acid from the gastrointestinal, or GI, tract. We have successfully completed all of the clinical trials that we planned to complete prior to submission of a New Drug Application, or NDA, to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, and are preparing to file our NDA under the Accelerated Approval Program in the second half of 2019.
In May 2018, we completed our randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial, TRCA-301, in 217 CKD patients with metabolic acidosis, and in March 2019, the results of this trial were published in The Lancet. The TRCA-301 trial met both its primary and secondary endpoints in a highly statistically significant manner (p<0.0001 for both the primary and secondary endpoints). TRC101 was well tolerated in our TRCA-301 trial. One hundred ninety-six of the 208 eligible subjects who completed the 12-week treatment period in our pivotal TRCA-301 trial agreed to continue into our 40-week blinded extension trial, TRCA-301E.
In March 2019, we completed our TRCA-301E trial. Based on the initial topline data analyses, the TRCA-301E trial met its primary and all secondary endpoints. We believe these results provide evidence of long-term safety and tolerability of TRC101 and durability of its blood bicarbonate effect. The placebo-adjusted improvements in favor of TRC101-treated subjects in the two measures of physical function at Week 52 approximately doubled compared to the results at Week 12 observed in the parent trial, TRCA-301. We believe the results from these two measures of physical function provide consistent evidence of a clinically meaningful improvement in physical function and related aspects of quality of life for TRC101-treated subjects. The statistical analysis plan for the TRCA-301E trial also specified a comparison of the TRC101 and placebo groups for the time to the composite clinical endpoint of death (all-cause mortality), dialysis/kidney transplant (renal replacement therapy) or a ≥50% decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) (taken together, DD50) over the combined (TRCA-301 and TRCA-301E) 52-week treatment period. Of the 124 subjects randomized to the TRC101 group, 5 (4.0%) subjects had a DD50 event. There were no deaths in the TRC101 group and one TRC101-treated subject initiated dialysis during the 52-week treatment period. Of the 93 subjects randomized to the placebo group, 10 (10.8%) subjects had a DD50 event, including four subjects who died and one who initiated dialysis during the 52-week treatment period. The time to DD50 was prolonged in the TRC101 group compared to the placebo group, with an annualized DD50 incidence rate, calculated as 100 times the number of events divided by the total person-years, of 4.2% in the TRC101 group vs 12.0% in the placebo group (p = 0.0224). We are conducting a confirmatory postmarketing trial, VALOR-CKD, as part of the Accelerated Approval Program. We have committed to completely enrolling, or nearly completely enrolling, subjects in the VALOR-CKD trial prior to our NDA submission. 
Metabolic acidosis is a chronic condition commonly caused by CKD and is believed to accelerate the progression of kidney deterioration. Today, there are no FDA-approved chronic therapies for treating metabolic acidosis. TRC101 is an in-house discovered, new chemical entity that we believe may effectively treat metabolic acidosis and slow the progression of kidney disease in CKD patients with metabolic acidosis.
We estimate that metabolic acidosis affects approximately 3 million CKD patients in the United States, and we believe that slowing the progression of CKD in patients with metabolic acidosis represents a significant medical need and market opportunity. We have an intellectual property estate that we believe will provide patent protection for TRC101 until at least 2034 in the United States, the European Union, Japan, China, India and certain other markets. Tricida is led by a seasoned management team that includes a founder of Ilypsa, Inc. and Relypsa, Inc. Our management team has extensive experience in the development and commercialization of therapeutics, with deep expertise in developing polymers for the treatment of kidney-related diseases.

Our Strategy
Our strategy is to develop and commercialize TRC101 as a first-in-class FDA-approved chronic treatment for metabolic acidosis for the large CKD population of patients with metabolic acidosis. Key elements of our strategy are to:

• | Obtain FDA approval of TRC101. Based on feedback from the FDA, we believe TRC101 will be eligible for review and potential approval through the FDA’s Accelerated Approval Program. If approved, TRC101 could be the first FDA-approved therapy for the chronic treatment of metabolic acidosis to slow the progression of CKD. We plan to submit an NDA for TRC101 in the second half of 2019.


• | Commercialize TRC101 in the United States. If TRC101 is approved by the FDA, we plan to initially commercialize it in the United States by deploying an 80- to 100-person specialty sales force targeting that subset of nephrologists most focused on treating CKD patients. With this approach, we believe we can reach a majority of the approximately 600,000 Stage 3 to 5 CKD patients with metabolic acidosis that are treated by nephrologists. Over time, due to the disease modification potential of TRC101, we intend to address the broader population of CKD patients who receive care from cardiologists, endocrinologists, diabetologists and a subset of primary care physicians, either on our own or with a partner.


• | Commercialize TRC101 outside of the United States with one or more partners. We believe there is a significant commercial opportunity for TRC101 in markets outside the United States. To address these markets, we plan to seek one or more partners with international sales expertise who can commercialize TRC101 in target markets.

Chronic Kidney Disease and Metabolic Acidosis Represent a Major Health Crisis
Overview of CKD
CKD is a serious condition characterized by the gradual loss of essential kidney functions over time. In CKD patients, normal fluid and electrolyte balance can no longer be maintained, and the excretion of metabolic end products, toxins and drugs is impaired. Furthermore, production and secretion of certain enzymes and hormones are disturbed.
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, or CDC, more than 30 million people in the United States are afflicted with CKD, representing an overall prevalence in the adult population of approximately 15%. The incidence of CKD is primarily driven by the increasing prevalence of diabetes and hypertension. CKD represents the ninth leading cause of death in the United States. The treatment of CKD adds a tremendous financial burden to the United States, with annual Medicare expenses for CKD in 2018 totaling approximately $114 billion, including approximately $79 billion on CKD costs and approximately $35 billion for end-stage renal disease, or ESRD. ESRD is total and permanent kidney failure that is treated with a kidney transplant or dialysis. There are approximately 700,000 people in the United States living on kidney dialysis or with a kidney transplant and approximately 124,000 new ESRD cases annually. Each year kidney disease kills more people than breast cancer or prostate cancer. According to United States Renal Data System report, there were approximately 100,000 deaths from ESRD in 2016. There is a significant medical need to slow progression of kidney disease and reduce the number of patients progressing to kidney failure.

To help improve the diagnosis and management of kidney disease, the National Kidney Foundation, or NKF, has divided CKD into five stages. The severity of CKD at each stage is identified by the estimated glomerular filtration rate, or eGFR. Treatment during the first four stages of CKD focuses on ways to preserve kidney function for as long as possible. ESRD is the final stage of CKD in which the patient typically requires renal replacement therapy, i.e., dialysis or a kidney transplant, for survival.
Stages of CKD and Key Risk Factors for CKD Progression
Overview of Metabolic Acidosis
Diabetes and hypertension have long been recognized as modifiable primary risk factors for the progression of CKD. More recently, metabolic acidosis, a serious condition in which the body has accumulated too much acid, has also been identified as a key modifiable risk factor in the progression of CKD. The human body generates acid every day through normal food intake and metabolism. Sources of acid include amino and nucleic acids from daily dietary intake and digestion of proteins. A healthy kidney counteracts these sources of acid through excretion mechanisms that rid the body of the excess acid and by restoring bicarbonate, a base that buffers acid. Metabolic acidosis results when the kidneys can no longer excrete sufficient acid or reabsorb sufficient bicarbonate back into the blood stream to balance acid production.
The prevalence and severity of metabolic acidosis in people with CKD progressively rises as kidney function declines. Adaptations by the kidneys initially prevent a fall in blood bicarbonate concentration but as eGFR continues to decline below 40 ml/min/1.73 m2, metabolic acidosis commonly develops. Over time, metabolic acidosis can lead to an increased risk of muscle wasting, loss of bone density and death. Additionally, if uncontrolled, a vicious cycle of worsening metabolic acidosis and accelerated progression of kidney disease can result.
The mechanism that links metabolic acidosis to kidney disease involves a cascade of events whereby patients with compromised kidneys do not excrete adequate amounts of acid to maintain acid-base balance. This imbalance and acid load accumulation leads to increases in the production of select peptides and hormones, including endothelin-1, aldosterone and angiotensin II, that increase the secretion of acid through the proximal and distal renal tubules of the remaining healthy nephrons in the compromised kidney. As currently understood, this sustained over-production of hormones exacerbates the damage in the diseased kidneys, resulting in long-term consequences, including renal fibrosis, proteinuria and inflammation, as well as sodium and water retention, which are hallmarks of the progression of CKD.
Metabolic acidosis can be diagnosed by measuring the level of bicarbonate in the blood, which is part of a standard metabolic panel. Properly functioning kidneys will maintain a blood bicarbonate level of between 22 to 
5

29 milliequivalents per liter, or mEq/L. A persistent blood bicarbonate level below 22 mEq/L indicates metabolic acidosis. The NKF’s Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative, or KDOQI, guidelines and the International Society of Nephology’s Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes, or KDIGO, guidelines recommend that in people with CKD, blood bicarbonate be maintained within the normal range of 22 to 29 mEq/L. Blood bicarbonate concentrations less than 22 mEq/L are associated with increased risk of CKD progression and increased risk of death.
The prevalence and severity of metabolic acidosis increases from Stage 3 to Stage 5 of CKD. We estimate the prevalence of metabolic acidosis to be 9% of the estimated 13.4 million Stage 3a CKD patients, 18% of the estimated 5.7 million Stage 3b CKD patients and over 30% of the estimated 2.5 million Stage 4 and Stage 5 CKD patients, resulting in a total prevalence of approximately 3 million CKD patients in the United States.
Metabolic Acidosis Poses a Significant Health Risk to Approximately 3 Million CKD Patients in the United States
There is Significant Evidence that Treating Metabolic Acidosis Can Slow the Progression of CKD
Multiple retrospective studies provide qualitative and quantitative evidence for the relationship between metabolic acidosis and the progression of CKD across a wide range of baseline eGFRs and blood bicarbonate levels. Prospective studies have shown that treating metabolic acidosis translates into a clinically meaningful slowing of CKD progression.
In particular, four prospective trials (Garneata et al., 2016; de Brito-Ashurst et al., 2009; Phisitkul et al., 2010; Dubey et al., 2018) studying Stage 3 to 5 CKD patients with metabolic acidosis demonstrated slowing of CKD progression following an increase in blood bicarbonate with three different interventions, comprising a very low-protein diet, oral sodium bicarbonate and oral sodium citrate. Increases in blood bicarbonate resulted in improved clinical outcomes, including fewer patients who progressed to ESRD and/or experienced significant declines of eGFR. Additionally, clinical trials reported by Goraya et al., 2013 and 2014 and Mahajan et al., 2010 showed that, in patients with Stages 2 to 4 CKD due to hypertensive nephropathy, increasing blood bicarbonate levels with sodium bicarbonate or a low protein diet rich in fruits and vegetables resulted in reduced markers of kidney injury and slower decline in eGFR.
6

Four large published retrospective database analyses show an association between higher blood bicarbonate levels and slower progression of CKD, independent of baseline eGFR and other factors such as age, sex, proteinuria, hypertension and diabetes (Dobre et al., 2013; Raphael et al., 2011; Shah et al., 2009; Tangri et al., 2011). In these four distinct large cohorts of CKD patients, the analyses all demonstrate that clinical outcomes for CKD patients with blood bicarbonate levels that are below normal (i.e., < 22 mEq/L) are significantly worse compared to patients with normal blood bicarbonate levels (i.e., 22 to 29 mEq/L).
Dr. Navdeep Tangri, M.D., Ph.D., and colleagues have developed a validated model which is an accepted standard for predicting the risk of kidney disease progression (Tangri et al., 2011). This validated model and its underlying kidney failure risk equations have been proven generalizable in a multinational retrospective study of more than 30 cohorts and 720,000 participants with CKD, including 450,000 individuals from the Veterans Affairs Health System (Tangri et al., 2016). Blood bicarbonate is one of the key variables predicting kidney disease progression in Dr. Tangri’s eight variable risk equation.
Together with Dr. Tangri, we presented data at the NKF 2018 Spring Clinical Meeting that describes an analysis of the relationship between blood bicarbonate and a composite renal outcome (≥ 40% reduction in eGFR or ESRD) very similar to that being assessed in our confirmatory postmarketing trial (≥ 40% reduction in eGFR, ESRD or renal death). For purposes of this analysis, Dr. Tangri isolated the effect of blood bicarbonate on disease progression in a population of CKD patients with metabolic acidosis. Included in this analysis were 2,378 non-dialysis patients with Stage 3 to 5 CKD from Dr. Tangri’s validated cohort who had at least two nephrology visits and a blood bicarbonate value at their baseline visit (including a cohort of 289 patients with eGFR between 15 to 45 mL/min/1.73m2 and blood bicarbonate of 12 to 22 mEq/L). The resulting predictive metabolic acidosis model, or the Predictive MA Model, established the quantitative relationship between an increase in blood bicarbonate and the reduction in risk of kidney disease progression. The Predictive MA Model shows that the relationship between blood bicarbonate and the renal outcome is effectively linear, independent of baseline kidney function (eGFR), and consistent across subgroups of patients with reduced eGFR and those with established metabolic acidosis. Furthermore, it shows that each 1 mEq/L increase in blood bicarbonate is associated with a 6% to 9% reduction in the risk of CKD progression.
The Unmet Medical Need for the Chronic Treatment of Metabolic Acidosis
While the need to treat metabolic acidosis to slow the progression of CKD is well established, there are no FDA-approved therapies for the chronic treatment of metabolic acidosis. Specifically, the KDIGO guidelines recommend that in people with CKD, blood bicarbonate be maintained within the normal range of 22 to 29 mEq/L, because blood bicarbonate concentrations less than 22 mEq/L are associated with increased risk of CKD progression and increased risk of death.
Unapproved methods to increase blood bicarbonate include oral alkali supplements, such as sodium bicarbonate. However, the use of oral alkali supplements such as sodium bicarbonate to increase blood bicarbonate introduces significant amounts of sodium to patients. Approximately 90% of later-stage CKD patients suffer from sodium sensitive comorbid conditions, such as hypertension, cardiovascular disease, heart failure or edema, and require a sodium-restricted diet. As such, the use of sodium-based supplements can lead to worsening blood pressure control and volume overload in this population.
A randomized, crossover study conducted by Husted et al., 1977, demonstrated that when equal amounts of sodium were delivered from either sodium bicarbonate or sodium chloride, each regimen led to similar increases in systolic blood pressure and fluid retention resulting in weight gain after just 4 days of dosing. In the control cohort the CKD patients were given approximately 12 grams/day of sodium chloride and in the treatment cohort the CKD patients were given approximately 6 grams/day sodium chloride plus approximately 8 grams/day sodium bicarbonate. During the treatment period, mean blood bicarbonate increased from 21 to 26 mEq/L. Systolic blood pressure increases (9 to 13 mm Hg) and weight gains (2 to 3 pounds) were not significantly different after administration of sodium chloride or sodium bicarbonate. We believe that increases of this magnitude in systolic blood pressure and fluid-based weight gain would pose a significant risk in CKD patients. In addition, a recent review of the literature by Bushinsky et al., 2018, indicates that the sodium from both sodium bicarbonate and sodium chloride has a consistent effect on fluid retention and/or blood pressure. 
In a recent randomized, placebo-controlled, open-label study with a 6-month treatment conducted by Dubey et al., 2018, oral sodium bicarbonate was less well tolerated than placebo. Overall, adverse events occurred in significantly (p=0.01) more subjects in the sodium bicarbonate group compared to the control group. The safety profile of oral sodium bicarbonate showed that more subjects experienced GI side effects, fluid retention and 
7

worsening hypertension compared to placebo, despite significantly higher use of diuretics in the sodium bicarbonate group (p=0.008).
Consistent with the Husted et al., 1977 study, Abramowitz et al., 2013, demonstrated that achieving a 2 to 3 mEq/L increase in blood bicarbonate requires 4 to 6 grams of sodium bicarbonate (for an 80 kilogram, or kg, patient) which results in an additional sodium load of 1.1 to 1.6 grams (each gram of sodium bicarbonate delivers 274 mg of sodium). According to the CDC, the average diet in the United States includes approximately 3.4 grams of sodium each day, which equates to 8.6 grams of sodium chloride. KDIGO guidelines recommend that CKD patients consume less than 2 grams of total sodium per day. Given the sodium-sensitive comorbidities of most CKD patients, there are significant limitations on the use of sodium-based supplements.
As a result, while existing guidelines recommend treating patients into the normal range of blood bicarbonate, the limitations of currently available options results in approximately 3 million CKD patients with metabolic acidosis in the United States alone. There is a significant unmet medical need for a chronic therapy which treats metabolic acidosis and slows the progression of kidney disease in these patients. To chronically treat the broad population of CKD patients with metabolic acidosis, physicians need an FDA-approved treatment that is proven to be safe, effective and easy to comply with.
Our Solution—TRC101
TRC101 is a novel, non-absorbed, orally-administered polymer that is designed to bind hydrochloric acid in the GI tract and remove it from the body through excretion in the feces thereby decreasing the total amount of acid in the body and increasing blood bicarbonate. TRC101 is administered orally as a suspension in water. TRC101 removes acid without delivering additional sodium or other counterions, such as potassium and calcium, which would allow for the chronic treatment of patients with common comorbidities such as hypertension, edema and heart failure.
TRC101 Target Product Profile
We have designed TRC101 to target the following product profile:

• | Significantly Increase Blood Bicarbonate: Bind and remove sufficient amounts of acid such that a majority of the patients will achieve an increase from baseline blood bicarbonate of 4 mEq/L or more and/or reach the normal blood bicarbonate range.


• | Well-Tolerated: Based on our long-term TRCA-301E trial results, patients reported GI-related adverse events at a similar rate to placebo. These events were generally mild, self-limited and did not require treatment or dose adjustment of TRC101.


• | Suitable for a Broad Population of Patients, including Patients with Sodium-Sensitive Comorbidities: Increase blood bicarbonate without delivering sodium or other counterions; such a therapy would be particularly advantageous for the approximately 90% of later-stage CKD patients with hypertension, cardiovascular disease, heart failure or edema comorbidities.


• | Compatible with Other Medications: Allow concomitant dosing of common CKD medications. TRC101’s unique characteristics include a particle size designed to prevent systemic absorption and size-exclusion that provides high selectivity for hydrochloric acid.


• | Convenient, Once-Daily, Oral Administration: In our pivotal TRCA-301 trial, subjects self-administered 3-, 6- or 9-gram doses, once daily, with high overall compliance.


• | Room-Temperature Stable: Current data demonstrate 12-month room temperature stability and we plan to have data supporting 24-month shelf-life at room temperature at the time of the commercial launch.

TRC101 Mechanism of Action
The metabolic acidosis observed in CKD patients is often caused by an imbalance in production of acids relative to acid excretion. The human body generates acid every day through normal food intake and metabolism. Sources of acid include amino and nucleic acids from daily dietary intake and digestion of proteins. The daily load of acids from metabolic processes amounts to approximately 1 mEq per kg of body weight, or 50 to 100 mEq per day 
8

for adults. Prior studies with alkali supplementation have shown that 40% to 80% (20 to 80 mEq) of the daily acid produced needs to be neutralized in order to increase blood bicarbonate.
Acid binding is a novel approach to treating metabolic acidosis and increasing blood bicarbonate levels without introducing deleterious counterions or metals. This approach mimics the physiologic response to acid removal seen with persistent vomiting or nasogastric suction that results in an elevated blood bicarbonate level. To achieve the desired effect of increasing blood bicarbonate with a compliance enhancing daily dose of less than 10 grams per day, an acid binding polymer should have an amine capacity to bind at least 5 mEq of proton/gram. Once protonated, the acid binding polymer needs to preserve the effect of the proton binding by not removing anions such as fatty and bile acids that represent precursors metabolized to bicarbonate in the blood. The complementary anion to be bound that ensures net acid removal from the GI tract is chloride, the smallest anion present in the GI tract.
TRC101 is composed of low-swelling, spherical polymer beads that are approximately 100 micrometers in diameter. Each bead is a single, high molecular weight, crosslinked polyamine molecule. The size of the beads prevents the systemic absorption of TRC101 from the GI tract. The high degree of cross-linking within the TRC101 beads limits swelling and the overall volume in the GI tract, to ensure good GI tolerability. The high amine content of TRC101 provides proton binding capacity of at least 10 mEq/gram of polymer. Size exclusion built into the three-dimensional structure of the polymer enables preferential binding of chloride versus larger inorganic and organic anions, including phosphate, citrate, fatty acids and bile acids. This size exclusion mechanism allows a majority of the binding capacity to be used for hydrochloric acid binding.
The mechanism of action of TRC101 is illustrated below:

Our Development Program for TRC101
Overview
Our development program for TRC101 is designed to obtain approval of TRC101 pursuant to the FDA’s Accelerated Approval Program. Under the Accelerated Approval Program, we plan to pursue approval for TRC101 based upon data from a primary endpoint that measures a change from baseline in blood bicarbonate. We have successfully completed all of the clinical trials that we planned to complete prior to filing an NDA, including a successful 135-subject, Phase 1/2 trial, TRCA-101, a successful 217-subject, pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial, TRCA-301 and a successful 196-subject, Phase 3 extension trial, TRCA-301E. Both TRCA-101 and TRCA-301 utilized change from baseline in blood bicarbonate as their primary endpoint. Subjects who completed the 12-week treatment period in our pivotal TRCA-301 trial were invited to continue in our extension trial, TRCA-301E, which enrolled 196 of these 208 subjects. The primary endpoint of the TRCA-301E trial was the assessment of the long-term safety profile of TRC101 versus placebo. Based on feedback from the FDA, we believe that the data from the TRCA-101, TRCA-301 and TRCA-301E clinical trials will provide sufficient clinical evidence of safety and efficacy to support the submission 
9

and review of an NDA for TRC101 pursuant to the Accelerated Approval Program. We plan to submit the NDA for TRC101 in the second half of 2019.
As part of the Accelerated Approval Program, the FDA may require one or more confirmatory postmarketing trials to verify and describe the anticipated effect or clinical benefit. In the fourth quarter of 2018, we initiated a confirmatory postmarketing trial, known as the VALOR-CKD trial, or TRCA-303, to evaluate the efficacy and safety of TRC101 in delaying CKD progression in subjects with metabolic acidosis. We anticipate that the VALOR-CKD trial will randomize approximately 1,600 subjects in order to show a 30% to 35% reduction in renal events, defined for purposes of the VALOR-CKD trial as a ≥ 40% reduction in eGFR, ESRD or renal death. The FDA has requested that the VALOR-CKD confirmatory postmarketing trial be completely enrolled, or nearly completely enrolled, prior to submission of our NDA for TRC101. We plan to complete the VALOR-CKD trial after the FDA’s review of our NDA for TRC101 and potential approval of TRC101. VALOR-CKD is a time-to-event study, and we estimate it will take approximately 4 years to accrue the number of events necessary to complete the study. Assuming successful completion of the VALOR-CKD trial, we plan to file a supplemental NDA, or sNDA, that incorporates results from the VALOR-CKD trial.
TRC101 Clinical and Nonclinical Results
TRCA-301 Phase 3 Clinical Trial and TRCA-301E Extension Trial
TRCA-301 Phase 3 Clinical Trial
In May 2018, we completed our pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial, TRCA-301, and in March 2019, the results of this trial were published in The Lancet. The double blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial enrolled 217 subjects with Stage 3b or 4 CKD (an estimated glomerular filtration rate, or eGFR, of 20 to 40 mL/min/1.73m2) and low blood bicarbonate levels (between 12 and 20 mEq/L). At the beginning of the 12-week treatment period, subjects were randomized in a 4:3 ratio to receive once-daily, or QD, TRC101 or placebo. Subjects in the active group initially received a QD dose of 6 grams of TRC101 (2 sachets). After week 4, bi-directional blinded dose adjustments to 3 grams/day (1 sachet) or 9 grams/day (3 sachets) were allowed in order to maintain blood bicarbonate in the normal range. Subjects in the placebo group initially received 2 sachets of placebo, with the same ability for bi-directional dose adjustments after 4 weeks. The dose titration algorithm required down-titration at blood bicarbonate values of ≥ 27 to ≤ 30 mEq/L. Subjects with a blood bicarbonate level > 30 mEq/L underwent an interruption of the study drug in accordance with the titration algorithm. Subjects were permitted to continue their existing oral alkali supplement during the trial, provided dosing remained stable. We conducted the trial at 47 sites in the United States and Europe, of which 37 sites enrolled patients.
TRCA-301 Pivotal Phase 3 Clinical Trial
The underlying comorbid conditions of TRC101-treated subjects and subjects in the placebo group in the TRCA-301 trial were well-balanced and included 97% hypertension, 65% type 2 diabetes, 44% left ventricular hypertrophy, and 31% congestive heart failure. During the three months prior to baseline, 12% of subjects had shortness of breath with exertion and 9% had edema or fluid overload. Nine percent of the total patient population in the trial reported the use of oral alkali therapy at baseline.
TRCA-301 Pivotal Phase 3 Trial Results
Primary and Secondary Endpoints
The blood bicarbonate levels of subjects were measured on day 1, week 1, week 2, and bi-weekly thereafter, up to and including week 14, which was a final post-treatment visit for those subjects not continuing into the TRCA-301E extension trial. The primary endpoint of the trial was an increase in blood bicarbonate level of at least 4 mEq/L or achieving a blood bicarbonate level in the normal range of 22 to 29 mEq/L, at the end of the 12-week 
10

treatment period. The secondary endpoint of the trial was the change from baseline in blood bicarbonate at the end of the 12-week treatment period.
Analysis of our pivotal Phase 3 trial demonstrated that treatment with TRC101 resulted in statistically significant increases in blood bicarbonate, meeting both the primary and secondary endpoints. After 12 weeks of treatment, 59.2% of subjects in the TRC101-treated group, compared with 22.5% of subjects in the placebo group, had an increase in blood bicarbonate level of at least 4 mEq/L or achieved a blood bicarbonate level in the normal range of 22 to 29 mEq/L, which was the primary endpoint of the trial. The secondary endpoint of the trial, the least squares, or LS, mean change from baseline to week 12 in blood bicarbonate, was 4.42 mEq/L in the TRC101-treated group, compared with 1.78 mEq/L in the placebo group. The mean change in blood bicarbonate from baseline to week 12 was 4.49 mEq/L in the TRC101-treated group, compared with 1.66 mEq/L in the placebo group. The results of the primary and secondary endpoints were both highly statistically significant (p<0.0001).
Summary Data for Our Pivotal Phase 3 Clinical Trial, TRCA-301
Exploratory Endpoints
Metabolic acidosis has been implicated as an important factor contributing to reduced muscle mass, manifested in decreases in lean body mass and muscle strength as well as increases in protein catabolic rate. Prior to a measurable decrease in blood bicarbonate, the body adapts, in part, to the increasing acid load by using intracellular buffers in muscle (primarily proteins and organic phosphates). We included two exploratory endpoints in our pivotal Phase 3 trial, TRCA-301, to assess whether improvement in physical function and physical function-related quality of life could be demonstrated in this patient population through the treatment of metabolic acidosis.
The first exploratory endpoint examined the effect of treatment with TRC101 on self-reported responses to the physical functioning subpart of the Kidney Disease and Quality of Life Short Form, or the KDQOL-SF, survey. The KDQOL-SF survey is a validated questionnaire designed to assess health-related quality of life, or HRQOL, in kidney disease patients. Subjects in the trial responded to 10 questions related to physical function during daily activities, or the KDQOL-SF Physical Function Survey.
The second exploratory endpoint objectively measured physical function derived from a repeated chair stand test, or Repeated Chair Stand Test. In the Repeated Chair Stand Test, subjects were asked to fold their arms across their chests and to stand up from a sitting position once; if they successfully rose from the chair, they were asked to stand up and sit down five times as quickly as possible, and the time for these five repetitions was recorded.
11

The KDQOL-SF Physical Function Survey and Repeated Chair Stand Test were administered and scored in a blinded fashion, and a change in KDQOL-SF Physical Function Survey score and Repeated Chair Stand Test time from baseline at week 12 were pre-specified as exploratory endpoints.
Analyses of the TRCA-301 trial demonstrated statistically significant results from the KDQOL-SF Physical Function Survey. The least squares, or LS, mean change from baseline in the TRC101-treated group was 6.29 points (p<0.0001). In the placebo group, the LS mean change from baseline was 1.10 points (p=0.4787). The between group change from baseline difference between TRC101-treated subjects versus subjects in the placebo group was 5.19 points and was statistically significant (p=0.0122).
The TRCA-301 results for the second exploratory endpoint, the Repeated Chair Stand Test, showed a statistically significant improvement for the TRC101-treated subjects after 12 weeks of treatment, compared to their baseline score (a reduction in the LS mean of 1.17 seconds, p=0.0249) and showed a trend toward significance for the difference between TRC101-treated subjects and subjects in the placebo group (a reduction in the LS mean of 1.52 seconds, p=0.0630). Due to the non-normal distribution of data related to the two exploratory endpoints, post-hoc rank-based analyses were performed to supplement the pre-specified data analyses described above. The rank-based analyses showed consistent between group difference for the KDQOL-SF Physical Function Survey (p=0.0117) and a stronger association for the between group difference in the Repeated Chair Stand Test (p=0.0027), both favoring TRC101. 
We believe the 12-week results from the two exploratory endpoints are consistent and suggest an improvement, on average, in the physical function and related quality of life for TRC101-treated subjects in this trial. We believe the two endpoints together address the same potential clinical benefit in this acidotic population and are consistent with the basic physiology of the disease.
Safety
The overall safety profile of TRC101 observed in our pivotal Phase 3 trial, TRCA-301, is consistent with that expected for the general population of patients with Stage 3 to 5 CKD and with similar non-absorbed polymer drugs with a site of action in the gastrointestinal tract. The incidence of serious adverse events was low and balanced in the two treatment groups. The types of serious adverse events were consistent with those expected in the study population, and none of the serious adverse events were assessed to be related to treatment by the trial investigator, Medical Monitor or Drug Safety and Pharmacovigilance Team. There were two deaths in the study and both of these occurred in the placebo group.
TRC101 was well tolerated in our pivotal Phase 3 trial, TRCA-301. In total, over 95% of subjects in each of the groups completed the trial. Overall treatment-related adverse events occurred in 9.7% of subjects in the placebo group and 13.7% of TRC101-treated subjects. The most common treatment-related adverse events were mild to moderate GI disorders, which occurred in 5.4% of subjects in the placebo group and 12.9% of TRC101-treated subjects. The treatment-related GI adverse events that occurred in more than one subject in the trial included diarrhea, flatulence, nausea and constipation. The only other treatment-related adverse event that occurred in more than one subject was paresthesia (1.1% of subjects in the placebo group and 0.8% of TRC101-treated subjects). There were no apparent effects of TRC101 on serum parameters, such as sodium, calcium, potassium, phosphate, magnesium, or low-density lipoprotein observed in the trial that would indicate off-target effects of TRC101. A high blood bicarbonate level, defined as greater than 30 mEq/L, was observed transiently in 2 subjects, or 0.9%. Discontinuation of TRC101 per the protocol-defined dosing algorithm resulted in normalization of blood bicarbonate in these subjects.
TRCA-301E Extension Trial
The TRCA-301E trial was a blinded, 40-week extension of the 12-week TRCA-301 trial, which randomized 217 subjects with non-dialysis dependent CKD and metabolic acidosis to treatment with TRC101 (N=124) or placebo (N=93). Two hundred eight (208; 95.9%) subjects completed the 12-week treatment period in the TRCA-301 trial and had the option to continue into the extension trial and receive the same blinded treatment (TRC101 or placebo) to which they were assigned in the parent study. One hundred ninety-six subjects (196; 94.2%), (114 in the TRC101 group and 82 in the placebo group) elected and were qualified to continue in the extension trial. One hundred eleven (111; 97.4%) subjects in the TRC101 group and 74 (90.2%) subjects in placebo group completed one year of treatment.

TRCA-301E Phase 3 Extension Clinical Trial
TRCA-301E Clinical Trial Results
Based on the initial topline data analyses, the TRCA-301E trial met its primary and all secondary endpoints. The primary endpoint of the TRCA-301E trial was the assessment of the long-term safety profile of TRC101 versus placebo. The results demonstrated that fewer subjects on TRC101 than on placebo discontinued the 40-week treatment period prematurely (2.6% vs 9.8%, respectively). The incidence of serious adverse events was 1.8% for subjects in the TRC101 group and 4.9% for subjects in the placebo group, and none were assessed to be related to study drug by the trial investigator, Medical Monitor or Drug Safety and Pharmacovigilance Team. The only adverse event with a between-group frequency difference of >5% was headache, which was more common in the placebo group. Gastrointestinal disorders adverse events occurred in 21.4% of subjects in the TRC101 group and in 25.9% of subjects in the placebo group. 
The statistical analysis plan for the TRCA-301E trial also specified a comparison of the TRC101 and placebo groups for the time to the composite clinical endpoint of death (all-cause mortality), dialysis/kidney transplant (renal replacement therapy) or a ≥50% decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate, or eGFR, (taken together, DD50) over the combined (TRCA-301 and TRCA-301E) 52-week treatment period. Of the 124 subjects randomized to the TRC101 group, 5 (4.0%) subjects had a DD50 event. There were no deaths in the TRC101 group and one TRC101-treated subject initiated dialysis during the 52-week treatment period. Of the 93 subjects randomized to the placebo group, 10 (10.8%) subjects had a DD50 event, including four subjects who died and one who initiated dialysis during the 52-week treatment period. The time to DD50 was prolonged in the TRC101 group compared to the placebo group, with an annualized DD50 incidence rate, calculated as 100 times the number of events divided by the total person-years, of 4.2% in the TRC101 group vs 12.0% in the placebo group (p = 0.0224). The TRCA-301/TRCA-301E clinical trials were not designed or powered to assess all-cause mortality and/or the progression of CKD outcomes; they enrolled only 217 subjects and followed them over a one-year treatment period to support the long-term safety and efficacy profile of TRC101. Nevertheless, we observed a 65% reduction in the annualized event rate of the composite endpoint of all-cause mortality and/or the progression of CKD (DD50) in TRC101-treated subjects versus subjects in the placebo group.
The secondary endpoints of the TRCA-301E trial assessed the durability of effect of TRC101, both on blood bicarbonate levels and on measures of physical function, over the 52-week treatment period for those subjects who participated in the TRCA-301E trial. All were met with high statistical significance.
The durability of effect of TRC101 was assessed by comparing the changes in blood bicarbonate from baseline between TRC101 versus placebo subjects who completed the 52-week treatment period. Sixty-three percent of the 111 TRC101 subjects treated for 52 weeks exhibited an increase in blood bicarbonate level of at least 4 mEq/L or achieved a blood bicarbonate level in the normal range of 22 to 29 mEq/L, compared with 38% of the 74 placebo subjects who completed 52 weeks of treatment (p=0.0015). The least squares (LS) mean change in blood bicarbonate from baseline to end of treatment in the TRC101 group was 4.7 mEq/L, compared with 2.7 mEq/L in the placebo group (p=0.0002). We believe these results provided evidence of the long-term durability of blood bicarbonate effect of TRC101-treated group compared to placebo. 
Measures of physical function were assessed through the self-reported responses to the KDQOL Physical Functioning Survey and the Repeated Chair Stand Test. Improvement from baseline to end of treatment in the self-reported responses to the KDQOL Physical Functioning Survey was significantly greater in the TRC101 group (+11.4 points) compared to the placebo group (-0.7 points), with a between-group difference of 12.1 points in favor of TRC101 (p<0.0001). Improvement from baseline to end of treatment in physical function using the Repeated Chair Stand Test was also significantly greater in the TRC101 group (4.3 seconds faster) compared to the placebo group 
13

(1.4 seconds faster), with a between-group difference of 2.9 seconds in favor of TRC101 (p<0.0001). The placebo-adjusted improvements in favor of TRC101-treated subjects in the two measures of physical function at Week 52 approximately doubled compared to the results at Week 12 observed in the parent trial, TRCA-301. We believe the results from the KDQOL Physical Functioning Survey and the Repeated Chair Stand Test are consistent with each other and both indicate a clinically meaningful improvement in physical function and related aspects of quality of life for TRC101-treated subjects. 
TRCA-101 Phase 1/2 Clinical Trial
In 2016, we completed our Phase 1/2 trial, TRCA-101, a 135-subject, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial of TRC101. In this trial, subjects received either placebo or one of four different dosing regimens of TRC101 for two weeks as shown in the diagram below:
TRCA-101 Phase 1/2 Clinical Trial
The subjects were Stage 3 or 4 CKD patients with blood bicarbonate levels at baseline between 12 and 20 mEq/L. The treatment groups were demographically well matched, and the mean blood bicarbonate levels at baseline ranged between 17.5 and 18.0 mEq/L across the treatment groups. Comorbid conditions of the subjects enrolled in TRCA-101 included 93% of patients with hypertension, 70% with type 2 diabetes, 29% with left ventricular hypertrophy and 21% with congestive heart failure. We conducted the trial at five in-patient clinical research units where the subjects were monitored for the duration of the 2-week treatment period. During the 16-day in-unit residence (including the 14-day treatment period), clinical trial subjects were given a diet controlled for protein, caloric content, anions, cations and fiber, in accordance with dietary recommendations for CKD patients. The potential renal acid load, or PRAL, value was calculated for the daily meal plans to ensure that the trial diet was neither acidic nor basic. Daily PRAL values averaged 0.8 mEq/day. Average protein intake during the trial was 0.7 g/kg/day.
The blood bicarbonate levels of subjects were measured on a daily basis. Statistically significant increases in blood bicarbonate levels were observed in all TRC101-treated groups within 24 to 72 hours of initiation of therapy. After 14 days of treatment, the mean increase in blood bicarbonate levels from baseline in each of the TRC101-treated groups was between 2.95 and 3.83 mEq/L, with a mean blood bicarbonate increase of 3.3 mEq/L in the combined TRC101 group. All of these results were highly statistically significant (p-value < 0.0001), as were the increases from baseline as compared to the placebo group, whose mean blood bicarbonate level decreased by 0.18 mEq/L. The blood bicarbonate levels of all subjects were measured up to four times during the 2-week off-treatment follow-up period. In the TRC101-treated groups, the mean levels had reverted to near baseline levels after two weeks off treatment.

TRC101 Significantly Increased Mean Blood Bicarbonate Throughout the
2-week Treatment Period, with Blood Bicarbonate Rapidly Returning
Toward Baseline After Treatment Discontinuation
In our Phase 1/2 trial, TRC101 was well-tolerated. All subjects completed treatment and remained in the trial through the applicable follow-up period. All treatment emergent adverse events, or TEAEs, were mild or moderate, and there were no serious adverse events. The most common TEAE was diarrhea which was reported by 20.2% of TRC101-treated subjects as compared to 12.9% of subjects in the placebo group. All cases of diarrhea were mild, self-limited, and none required treatment. There were no apparent effects of TRC101 on serum parameters, such as sodium, calcium, potassium, phosphate, magnesium, or low-density lipoprotein observed in the trial that would indicate off-target effects of TRC101. There were no apparent effects on vital signs, such as blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate or temperature, or body weight. The results of this trial were published in the Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (Bushinsky, et al., 2018).
Nonclinical Studies
We have conducted a range of nonclinical in vivo and in vitro studies to assess the mechanism of action, pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, and toxicology of TRC101.
Nonclinical in vitro and in vivo pharmacology studies demonstrated robust proton and chloride binding and retention by the TRC101 polyamine polymer resulting in removal of hydrochloric acid from the body. In vitro studies demonstrated that TRC101 can selectively bind and retain chloride under conditions that mimic the pH, transit times, and ionic content of various compartments of the GI tract. The marked binding capacity and selectivity for chloride observed with TRC101 in vitro translates into in vivo pharmacological effects. Removal of acid by TRC101 results in a dose-dependent increase in mean blood bicarbonate, as observed in rats with adenine-induced nephropathy and low blood bicarbonate. A significant increase in fecal chloride relative to controls suggests that TRC101 retained its functional integrity during transit through the rat GI tract. This study in an animal model of CKD illustrated the potential of TRC101 to correct depleted blood bicarbonate levels, the hallmark of metabolic acidosis.
Safety pharmacology assessments of the central nervous, respiratory, cardiovascular, and GI systems did not identify any TRC101-related adverse effects at oral doses up to 4 g/kg (central nervous system, respiratory) and up to 2 g/kg (GI) in rats and at 2 g/kg (cardiovascular) in dogs.
Lack of TRC101 absorption from the GI tract was demonstrated in both rats and dogs administered a single oral dose of radiolabeled [ 14 C]-TRC101. Because radioactivity was not observed in the plasma of either species, 
15

metabolism was not evaluated. The lack of absorption, in conjunction with the in vivo pharmacology study in rats, supports that TRC101 is not metabolized or degraded but maintains functional, and therefore, structural integrity during transit through the GI tract following oral administration. The results of the radiolabeled TRC101 absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion, or ADME, studies demonstrating a lack of oral bioavailability is consistent with the physicochemical properties of TRC101 (insolubility in aqueous and organic solvents, particle size averaging 100 micrometers in diameter, and particle stability).
Repeat-dose, GLP toxicology studies of up to 26 weeks duration in rats and 39 weeks duration in dogs demonstrated that TRC101 has a very low order of toxicity and was well tolerated. There were no effects on male or female reproductive organs and local GI tolerance was good. The no observed adverse effect level, or NOAEL, in both the rat and dog in the chronic toxicity studies was the highest dose of 2 g/kg/day; this dose of TRC101 is 13-fold higher than the highest proposed human dose of 9 g/day (0.15 g/kg/day based on a 60-kg patient). We also established that the polymer has no effect on the absorption of fat-soluble vitamins, such as A, D2, D3, and E. Reproductive toxicity studies indicate there are no adverse TRC101-related effects on maternal reproductive function or embryofetal development and no evidence of teratogenicity. TRC101 was not mutagenic or clastogenic when evaluated in genotoxicity studies. Given the non-absorbed nature of TRC101, we have been granted a waiver from FDA for fertility and early embryonic development (Segment I) and peri/postnatal development (Segment III) reproductive toxicity and carcinogenicity studies.
Drug-drug Interaction Studies
As part of our NDA filing, we will submit data evaluating the potential for drug-drug interactions, or DDIs, to occur with TRC101. TRC101 was designed to minimize DDIs. The size of the TRC101 particles prevents systemic absorption of the polymer from the GI tract; therefore, potential DDIs are confined to those that could occur in the GI tract (i.e., direct binding or indirect effects on bioavailability resulting from transient increases in gastric pH). In vitro studies have demonstrated that, as expected, given the charge and the size exclusion properties of TRC101, potential direct binding interactions are limited to small compounds (< 435 daltons) that are negatively charged under physiologic conditions. In our review of the structures of drugs commonly used in the CKD patient population, we observed that drugs with these characteristics are uncommon (approximately 10% of commonly used drugs in CKD patients). In our in vitro studies, the two drugs showing the most binding to TRC101 were aspirin and furosemide, both of which are small, negatively-charged and commonly used in the CKD patient population. We have tested aspirin and furosemide in vivo in human DDI studies conducted in healthy volunteers and these drugs showed a change in exposure of < 20% when co-administered with TRC101.
Because it is a hydrochloric acid binder, TRC101 can transiently increase gastric pH. The magnitude and duration of effect of TRC101 on gastric pH was measured continuously in vivo in healthy volunteers using a microelectrode pH probe. TRC101 increased gastric pH by approximately 3 pH units and approximately 1.5 pH units in the fasted and fed states, respectively. The increase in gastric pH was short-lived, with a peak within 1 hour after TRC101 dosing and a return to baseline after approximately 1.5 hours and approximately 3 hours under fasting and fed conditions, respectively. The effect on gastric pH following administration of TRC101 was similar in the presence and absence of a proton pump inhibitor (omeprazole). The bioavailability of orally administered drugs that are weak acids and weak bases can be affected by changes in gastric pH. Therefore, the clinical relevance of the transient increase in gastric pH caused by TRC101 was evaluated in vivo in human DDI studies conducted in healthy volunteers using three drugs with pH-dependent solubility: furosemide (weak acid), dabigatran (weak base) and warfarin (weak acid). These drugs showed a change in exposure of < 20% when co-administered with TRC101.
Based on the results of our DDI studies, we do not believe we need to recommend dosing separation for co-administered drugs with TRC101, either due to direct binding interactions or due to pH sensitivity. We believe it is reasonable to propose dosing instructions for TRC101 that do not include any dose separation recommendations for other oral medications. However, ultimate label instructions regarding co-administration of TRC101 with other oral medications will be subject to FDA review and approval.
TRC101 Regulatory Pathway and Confirmatory Postmarketing Trial, VALOR-CKD
Our Development of TRC101 Pursuant to the Accelerated Approval Program.
Based upon the success of the TRCA-101 Phase 1/2, TRCA-301 pivotal Phase 3 and TRCA-301E extension trials and discussions with the FDA, we plan to pursue approval of TRC101 through the Accelerated Approval Program. The FDA’s Accelerated Approval Program allows for drugs for serious conditions that address an unmet medical need to be approved based on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit. 
16

Surrogate endpoints are used instead of clinical outcomes in some clinical trials. Surrogate endpoints are used when the clinical outcomes might take a very long time to study, or in cases where the clinical benefit of improving the surrogate endpoint, such as controlling blood pressure, is well understood. Clinical trials are needed to show that surrogate endpoints can be relied upon to predict, or correlate with, clinical benefit. Surrogate endpoints that have undergone this testing are called validated surrogate endpoints and those are accepted by the FDA as evidence of benefit.
Surrogate endpoints that the FDA determines are reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit may be used to support approval, in some cases, but are not yet validated. This is accomplished under the FDA’s Accelerated Approval Program, which is intended to provide patients with serious diseases more rapid access to promising therapies. Because such surrogate endpoints have not been validated, sponsors relying on them are generally required to verify the predicted clinical benefit of their products with confirmatory postmarketing clinical trials.
We believe that TRC101 is eligible for approval pursuant to the FDA’s Accelerated Approval Program based upon meeting the following three criteria:

• | Treatment of a Serious Condition: We believe that the progression of CKD to ESRD is a serious condition and the chronic treatment of metabolic acidosis may slow the progression of CKD.


• | Meaningful Advantage over Available Therapy: We believe that there is an unmet need for chronic therapies that slow progression to ESRD in CKD patients with metabolic acidosis. There are no FDA-approved chronic treatments for metabolic acidosis and there exists a large CKD patient population with metabolic acidosis.


• | Demonstrates an Effect on an Endpoint That Is Reasonably Likely to Predict Clinical Benefit: We believe that blood bicarbonate is an appropriate surrogate endpoint and that increasing blood bicarbonate is reasonably likely to predict slowing of progression of CKD.

Under the Accelerated Approval Program, we believe that our TRCA-301 Phase 3 trial will serve as the pivotal trial for our NDA submission for TRC101.
VALOR-CKD (also known as TRCA-303) Clinical Trial
As a condition of filing our NDA pursuant to the Accelerated Approval Program, we have committed to conduct our confirmatory postmarketing trial, VALOR-CKD, which is designed to demonstrate that TRC101 provides a clinical benefit (i.e., improves how the patient feels, functions or survives) in addition to increasing blood bicarbonate levels. The FDA has requested that the trial be completely enrolled, or nearly completely enrolled, prior to submission of our NDA. If we receive FDA approval for TRC101, but do not complete the postmarketing trial, or if the postmarketing trial fails to show a clinical benefit of TRC101 treatment, the FDA may revoke its approval of TRC101.
In the fourth quarter of 2018, we initiated the VALOR-CKD postmarketing trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of TRC101 in delaying CKD progression in subjects with metabolic acidosis. The postmarketing trial is being conducted as a condition of filing our TRC101 NDA pursuant to the Accelerated Approval Program. 
VALOR-CKD Postmarketing Clinical Trial
The protocol for the VALOR-CKD trial was designed in collaboration with a steering committee of international key opinion leaders in the fields of chronic kidney disease progression and metabolic acidosis and with input from the FDA. It is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of subjects with Stage 3b or 4 CKD (eGFR of 20 to 40 mL/min/1.73m2) and metabolic acidosis (blood bicarbonate levels of 12 to 20 mEq/L). The eligibility criteria for the VALOR-CKD trial are similar to those used in our pivotal Phase 3 trial, TRCA-301. Based on observations from the TRCA-301 trial, we have strengthened the screening requirements in the VALOR-CKD trial to enable enrollment of subjects with confirmed metabolic acidosis at baseline. Subjects will be treated with TRC101 (3, 6 or 9 g QD) or placebo, with titration to attempt to maintain blood bicarbonate in the normal range (22 to 29 mEq/L); we have removed the requirement for dose down-titration for subjects with blood bicarbonate ≥ 27 mEq/L 
17

and ≤ 30 mEq/L that was stipulated in the TRCA-301 trial, as we believe that down-titration is no longer needed to avoid sustained blood bicarbonate levels above the normal range. 
The primary endpoint of the VALOR-CKD trial compares the time to first renal event, with a renal event defined as a ≥ 40% reduction in eGFR, progressing to ESRD, or renal death, in TRC101-treated subjects versus subjects in the placebo group. Subjects will be followed in the trial until the independent blinded Clinical Endpoint Committee has positively adjudicated the targeted number of primary endpoint events, which we estimate will be approximately four years following full enrollment. Based on the magnitude of the increase in blood bicarbonate observed in our pivotal Phase 3 trial, TRCA-301, and the inverse relationship between blood bicarbonate and risk of renal events described by the Predictive MA Model, we have determined that randomizing 1,600 subjects to TRC101 or placebo in a 1:1 ratio will result in 90% power to show a 30% to 35% reduction in renal events in the VALOR-CKD trial. 
The VALOR-CKD protocol specifies that an interim analysis may be performed when at least half the planned number of primary endpoint events have occurred. At such time, the trial may be stopped early for efficacy, the sample size may be increased, or the trial may continue without changes. We estimate that the interim analysis may occur when all patients have been on treatment for approximately two to three years. 
The FDA has requested that the VALOR-CKD trial should be completely enrolled, or nearly completely enrolled, prior to submission of our NDA for TRC101.
Commercial Opportunity and Commercialization Plan
The commercial opportunity for TRC101, as potentially the first and only FDA-approved therapy for the chronic treatment of CKD patients with metabolic acidosis is rooted in its distinctive value proposition. TRC101 has the potential for disease modification by slowing the progression of CKD by treating metabolic acidosis.
CKD patients suffering from metabolic acidosis frequently present with diabetes, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease leading to progressive kidney disease. These patients are managed by multiple physician specialties and are generally referred to a nephrologist as their kidney disease progresses to Stage 3 or 4. Nephrologists have few treatment options beyond renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, or RAAS, inhibitors to slow the progression of CKD and typically manage common symptoms and complications of kidney disease, such as hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia and anemia.
We have identified nephrologist-treated CKD patients with metabolic acidosis as our initial target patient population for TRC101, if approved. We estimate that metabolic acidosis affects 3 million of the approximately 22 million CKD patients in the United States, but that only 35% of those patients are currently diagnosed. Of those CKD patients that are diagnosed with metabolic acidosis, we believe that approximately 50%, or 600,000, are treated by a nephrologist. We plan to initially commercialize TRC101 in the United States with a specialty sales force of approximately 80 to 100 individuals focused on the highest prescribing subset of the approximately 9,000 practicing nephrologists who we believe are currently treating our target patient population.
We estimate that approximately 90% of patients with Stage 3 to 5 CKD have one or more sodium sensitive comorbidities. Therefore, we believe that approximately 10% of our 600,000 patient target population are candidates for oral alkali supplementation. The remaining 540,000 patients with metabolic acidosis are the initial target population for TRC101.
Our pre-launch activities are focused on physician education and ensuring optimal market access. We have initiated a campaign to deliver comprehensive disease awareness and education to nephrology specialists. These disease education efforts will communicate the existing evidence that increasing blood bicarbonate in CKD patients with metabolic acidosis slows the progression of CKD and reduces kidney failure events. We believe the broad understanding of this evidence will help to establish and increase the urgency to treat patients with TRC101 and support our rapid launch uptake following FDA approval, if achieved. As part of our disease awareness and education activities, we have developed and launched a mobile app, Neph+, educational videos and two nephrology-oriented websites, NephPlus.com and MetabolicAcidosisInsights.com, to provide ready access to the Neph+ app and to expand awareness of the complications of metabolic acidosis in CKD patients, including the link between metabolic acidosis and the progression of CKD. Over time, due to the disease modification potential of TRC101, we intend to address the broader CKD patient population who receive care from cardiologists, endocrinologists, diabetologists and a subset of primary care physicians, either on our own or with a partner.
18

In late 2018, we completed a retrospective health economic study of pre-dialysis patients with Stage 3 to 5 CKD which showed that the presence of metabolic acidosis in these patients was associated with significantly higher patient costs independent of CKD stage, sex, age, diabetes, hypertension, and occurrence of a renal outcome event defined as death, chronic dialysis, renal transplant, or an eGFR decline ≥ 40%. The study queried electronic health records, or EHR, from a national de-identified electronic medical record dataset from 2007 to 2017 to identify non-dialysis patients with Stage 3 to 5 CKD and that were followed for 2 years for the renal outcome event. The results of the analyses from 10,725 persons less than 65 years of age showed a mean total per patient per year healthcare cost of approximately $90 thousand for patients with metabolic acidosis versus approximately $53 thousand for patients with a 4 mEq/L higher blood bicarbonate level, resulting in an estimated per patient per year healthcare cost savings of approximately $37 thousand. The study also showed that metabolic acidosis was a strong independent predictor of costs at each CKD stage. Due to the absence of an FDA-approved product for metabolic acidosis, we cannot model a treated versus untreated population for this health economic study. Rather we relied on matching similar patient populations, one with metabolic acidosis and one with 4 mEq/L higher blood bicarbonate level, based on the assumption that the population with 4 mEq/L higher blood bicarbonate level accurately mimics a treated population.
We presented information about the design and results of our health economic study to 15 payers covering over 200 million patient lives and also shared with them our TRCA-301 trial data. Health insurers surveyed have indicated their perception of the likelihood of TRC101 coverage is influenced by the following potential attributes of TRC101: first in class treatment, disease modifying, safe and efficacious and significant direct healthcare cost savings. Based on the payers’ responses, we believe that the pricing for TRC101 can be supported above the current pricing for other polymer therapeutics marketed for treating conditions related to kidney disease, but which are not disease modifying. Notably, we estimate that approximately 25% to 30% of our target patient population is commercially-insured and may be eligible for co-pay assistance programs to help them access TRC101.
To address markets outside of the United States, we plan to seek one or more partners with international sales expertise who can sell TRC101 in target markets. We anticipate that in certain markets additional clinical trials of TRC101 may be required to obtain regulatory approval and/or ensure market access.
Manufacturing
TRC101 drug substance is a room-temperature stable, free flowing powder, composed of low-swelling, polymeric beads, approximately 100 micrometers in diameter. As a non-absorbed polymeric drug, TRC101 is designed to be insoluble in all solvents, including water, and is characterized by its desired function, including high binding capacity and selectivity, physical properties, such as minimal swelling, and impurities. Characterization of isolated intermediates and careful control of each step of the process, such as rate and amount of incorporation of starting materials, define the structure of the polymer. Because the process to manufacture TRC101 fundamentally defines the key polymer attributes for safety and efficacy, the same process that was originally developed by us during the discovery and early development phase, is still closely followed at larger scales.
TRC101 is manufactured using an efficient, scalable, two-step process. This two-step approach enables, in step one, the preparation of a crosslinked polymer having a high binding capacity, and in step two, further crosslinking for low swelling and selectivity for hydrochloric acid.
The resulting TRC101 drug substance is converted into drug product by filling it into sachets without the addition of excipients. TRC101 drug product is stored at room temperature. Ongoing stability studies demonstrate that TRC101 is stable at room temperature for at least 12 months, and we are conducting registration stability studies that we anticipate will enable us to indicate on our label, if approved, that TRC101 is stable at room temperature for up to 24 months.
We contract with third-party service providers to manufacture TRC101 drug substance, TRC101 drug product and to perform analytical testing services. We currently have no manufacturing facilities and limited personnel with manufacturing experience. We developed the process to manufacture TRC101 drug substance in-house and have successfully transferred it to three manufacturers. We believe that there are a limited number of experienced contract manufacturers in the world capable of manufacturing a polymeric drug substance such as TRC101. We currently rely on Patheon Austria GmbH & Co KG, or Patheon, as our sole supplier for drug substance manufacturing and we have two suppliers for drug product manufacturing. We intend to initially commercialize with a single supplier for drug substance and a single supplier for drug product. Nevertheless, we plan to establish a diverse and volume-appropriate portfolio of third-party manufacturers to reduce our dependency on single suppliers for drug substance 
19

and drug product in the future. We plan to continue to rely upon contract manufacturers and commercial suppliers of raw materials for the commercial manufacture of TRC101 if it is approved by regulatory authorities.
In May 2018, we entered into a Master Development/Validation Services and Clinical/Launch Supply Agreement, or the Patheon Agreement, with Patheon. Pursuant to the Patheon Agreement, Patheon has agreed to manufacture and supply to us, and we have agreed to purchase from Patheon, on a project basis, TRC101 drug substance in amounts necessary to satisfy our currently projected demand for our confirmatory postmarketing trial, VALOR-CKD, manufacturing process validation to satisfy FDA requirements, and the initial commercial supply for our TRC101 launch, assuming approval, through at least 2020. The Patheon Agreement has an initial term of three years or such time as there has been a period of 12 months without any statement of work outstanding absent earlier termination. Thereafter, the Patheon Agreement will continue for consecutive one-year renewal terms unless terminated earlier. Either party may terminate the Patheon Agreement after the initial term, at any time, by providing the other party at least three months written notice of termination prior to the end of the then current term. Either party may terminate the Patheon Agreement for the other party’s material breach or bankruptcy.
We have completed manufacturing of TRC101 drug substance for our ongoing registration stability studies. TRC101 drug product registration stability studies began in mid-2018 and are scheduled to be completed in mid-2019. Ongoing TRC101 drug substance and drug product manufacturing campaigns have produced the initial quantities to support the anticipated demand for the first 12 months of our confirmatory postmarketing trial, VALOR-CKD.
Manufacturing commercial quantities of TRC101 will require larger scale production than we have been using to produce TRC101 for use in our clinical trials. We believe that our current production methods can be scaled to meet our anticipated commercial needs without introducing changes to key TRC101 properties, including binding capacity, selectivity for hydrochloric acid and non-absorption. We use acid binding, competitive anion binding and particle size measurement assays to confirm these properties. The scale of the first step in our drug substance manufacturing process, step one, is being increased to approximately 640 kg, and the scale of the second step in our drug substance manufacturing process, step two, is being increased to approximately 700 kg.
Our third-party service providers, their facilities and the TRC101 used in our clinical trials or for commercial sale are required to be in compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMP. The cGMP regulations include requirements relating to organization of personnel, buildings and facilities, equipment, control of components and packaging containers and closures, production and process controls, packaging and labeling controls, holding and distribution, laboratory controls, records and reports, and returned or salvaged products. The facilities manufacturing and testing our products must meet cGMP requirements and satisfy FDA or other authorities before any product is approved and before we can manufacture commercial products. Our third-party manufacturers are also subject to periodic inspections of facilities by the FDA and other authorities, including procedures and operations used in the testing and manufacture of TRC101 to assess compliance with applicable regulations. Failure to comply with statutory and regulatory requirements subjects a manufacturer to possible legal or regulatory action, including warning letters, the seizure or recall of products, injunctions, consent decrees placing significant restrictions on or suspending manufacturing operations and civil and criminal penalties. These actions could have a material impact on the availability of TRC101. Contract manufacturers at times encounter difficulties involving production yields, quality control and quality assurance, as well as shortages of qualified personnel.
Summaries of Key Prospective Studies
In multiple prospective studies it has been observed that increasing blood bicarbonate results in improved renal outcomes in CKD patients. In particular, four prospective studies (Garneata et al., 2016, de Brito-Ashurst et al., 2009; Phisitkul et al., 2010, Dubey et al., 2018) ranging from 6 months to 2 years in duration, demonstrated slowing of CKD progression following an increase in blood bicarbonate in patients with Stage 3 to 5 CKD and metabolic acidosis. Clinical observations included fewer cases of rapid kidney function decline, and fewer patients who developed ESRD requiring dialysis in CKD patients who received interventional therapy in order to increase their blood bicarbonate.
The following are summaries of these four prospective studies:
20

Prospective Study #1: Ketoanalogue-Supplemented Vegetarian Very Low-Protein Diet and CKD Progression, Garneata et al., 2016
In this single-center, open-label, prospective, parallel-group study, 207 CKD patients with metabolic acidosis were studied for 15 months. One hundred four (104) patients were randomized to receive a vegetarian, ketoanalogue-supplemented very low protein diet (0.3 g/kg/day; N = 104) and the remaining 103 patients served as the control group and received a typical low protein diet (0.6 g/kg/day; N = 103). The patient population had a baseline average eGFR of approximately 18 mL/min/1.73m2 and an average blood bicarbonate of approximately 16.7 mEq/L. Patients with hypertension (BP ≥ 145/85 mmHg), diabetes, or heart failure were not allowed to enroll in the trial; only 14% of the screened patients met all the eligibility criteria and agreed to adhere to the dietary requirements and could, therefore, be randomized in this study.
At the end of the 15-month treatment period, blood bicarbonate levels in the treated patients increased by 6.8 mEq/L compared to the control group; these results were clinically meaningful and statistically significant (p < 0.01).
Kidney function decline over the treatment period was significantly slower (-4.2 mL/min/1.73 m2; p < 0.01) in the patients on the very low protein diet compared to controls. Patients treated with the very low protein diet were also significantly less likely (p < 0.001) than control patients to meet the primary endpoint of renal replacement therapy or a decrease in eGFR of > 50% (13% vs 42%) over the 15-month treatment period.

Prospective Study #2: Bicarbonate Supplementation Slows Progression of CKD and Improves Nutritional Status, de Brito-Ashurst et al., 2009
In this single-center, open-label, prospective, parallel-group study, 134 CKD patients with mild metabolic acidosis were randomized to intervention with oral sodium bicarbonate or standard of care with no intervention (67 patients in each group) for 2 years. The patient population had a baseline average eGFR of approximately 20 mL/min/1.73 m2 and an average blood bicarbonate of approximately 20 mEq/L. Patients with poorly controlled hypertension or overt congestive heart failure were not allowed to enroll in the trial.
21

At the end of the 2-year study, blood bicarbonate levels in the treated patients increased by approximately 4 mEq/L compared to the control group; these results were clinically meaningful and statistically significant (p < 0.001).
Kidney function decline over the 2-year treatment period was significantly slower (-4.0 mL/min/1.73 m2; p < 0.0001) in the sodium bicarbonate treated patients compared to controls. Patients who received treatment for their metabolic acidosis were also significantly less likely than untreated patients to experience rapid progression of kidney failure (9% vs 45%; p < 0.0001) or to develop ESRD (6.5% vs 33%; p < 0.001) over the 2-year treatment period.

Prospective Study #3: Amelioration of Metabolic Acidosis in Patients with Low GFR Reduced Kidney Endothelin Production and Kidney Injury, and Better Preserved GFR, Phisitkul et al., 2010
In this single-center, open-label, prospective, parallel-group study, 59 patients with hypertensive nephropathy and mild metabolic acidosis were studied. Thirty patients were treated with oral sodium citrate for 2 years, and the remaining 29 patients, who were unable or unwilling to take sodium citrate, served as controls. The patient population had a baseline average eGFR of approximately 32.5 mL/min/1.73 m2 and an average blood bicarbonate of approximately 20.5 mEq/L. Patients with diabetes, heart failure or edema were not allowed to enroll in the trial, and blood pressure was controlled to recommended levels in all patients prior to and during the treatment period.
At the end of the 2-year study, blood bicarbonate levels in the treated patients increased by 4.2 mEq/L compared to the control group; these results were clinically meaningful and statistically significant (p < 0.0001). Kidney function decline over the 2-year treatment period was 4.4 mL/min/1.73 m2 slower in the sodium citrate treated patients compared to controls, but the difference between groups in eGFR at the end of this small study did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.066).
Prospective Study #4: Correction of Metabolic Acidosis Improves Muscle Mass and Renal Function in Chronic Kidney Disease Stages 3 and 4: a Randomized Controlled Trial, Dubey et al., 2018
In a recent prospective, randomized, single-center, open-label study, the clinical benefits of oral sodium bicarbonate supplementation were demonstrated after only a 6-month treatment period. This trial enrolled 188 patients with Stage 3 to 4 CKD and metabolic acidosis with baseline mean eGFR approximately 30 mL/min/1.73 m2
22

and mean blood bicarbonate approximately 18 mEq/L. Patients with decompensated heart failure, morbid obesity or decompensated chronic liver disease were excluded from the study. Patients received standard of care plus oral sodium bicarbonate at a dose to achieve a blood bicarbonate level between 24 and 26 mEq/L (mean dose approximately 2.3 g/day; N = 94;) or standard of care only (N = 94).
After 6-months of treatment, mean blood bicarbonate increased significantly (5.4 mEq/L) in treated patients but decreased (-0.3 mEq/L) in untreated patients. The sodium bicarbonate-treated group had an increase in eGFR of 2.4 mL/min/1.73 m2, while eGFR in the control group decreased by -2.3 mL/min/1.73 m2. A rapid decline in eGFR (defined as >3 mL/min/1.73 m2) was observed in 41.5% of the control patients vs. 20.2% of the sodium bicarbonate-treated patients (p = 0.001). Furthermore, the intervention group showed significantly increased lean body mass index and mid-arm muscle circumference compared to the control group.
The study authors noted that the clinical benefits achieved with oral sodium bicarbonate treatment in this study came at a significant health cost. Overall, adverse effects were significantly higher in the sodium bicarbonate group than the control group. Treatment was associated with increasing edema and worsening hypertension requiring diuretics beginning within two months of initiation of sodium bicarbonate. 35.1% of patients in the intervention group had a significantly increased requirement for diuretics versus 18.1% of patients in the control group (p = 0.008).

Intellectual Property
Our commercial success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain proprietary protection for our drug candidates, manufacturing and process discoveries, and other know-how, to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others and to prevent others from infringing our proprietary rights. Our policy is to seek to protect our proprietary position by, among other methods, filing U.S. and foreign patent applications related to our proprietary technology, inventions and improvements that are important to the development and implementation of our business. We also rely on trade secrets, know-how, continuing technological innovation and potential in-licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our proprietary position.
TRC101 was discovered by us utilizing our proprietary technology. We have filed several non-provisional and provisional patent applications, all owned by us, relating to TRC101 in the United States, certain foreign countries, and the World Intellectual Property Organization that are directed to compositions-of-matter, dosage unit forms, methods-of-treatment, medical use, and methods of manufacture.
Our patent portfolio, which is solely owned by us, includes two issued U.S. composition of matter patents (U.S. Patent No. 9,205,107B2 and No. 9,925,214B2), an issued U.S. method of treatment patent (U.S. Patent No. 9,993,500B2), an issued European medical use patent (EP3 003 327B1); and an issued Japanese medical use patent (JP6,453,860) each of these patents is expected to expire in 2034, excluding any additional term resulting from patent term extension if the appropriate maintenance fees are paid. In addition, we expect that U.S., European and Japanese patents and the patent applications in this portfolio, if issued, would expire between 2034 and 2038, 
23

excluding any additional term from patent term adjustment or patent term extension if appropriate maintenance and other governmental fees are paid. Additional patent term for the presently-issued or later issued U.S. patents may be awarded as a result of the patent term extension provision of the Hatch-Waxman Amendments of 1984, or the Hatch-Waxman Act. In the European Union member countries, a supplementary protection certificate, if obtained, provides a maximum five years of market exclusivity. For example, in Japan, the term of a patent may be extended by a maximum of five years in certain circumstances.
In other jurisdictions (currently, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Hong Kong, India, Israel, Mexico, Republic of Korea, and Russia), the term and patent applications relating to TRC101, including composition of matter and various other patents, including dosage unit form, method-of-treatment, medical use and method of manufacture patents, where applicable, are expected to expire between 2034 and 2038, if the appropriate maintenance, renewal, annuity, and other government fees are paid. These patents and patent applications (if applicable), depending on the national laws, may benefit from extension of patent term in individual countries if regulatory approval of TRC101 is obtained in those countries.
Individual patents extend for varying periods depending on the date of filing of the patent application or the date of patent issuance and the legal term of patents in the countries in which they are obtained. Generally, patents issued for regularly filed applications in the United States are effective for 20 years from the earliest effective filing date. In addition, in certain instances, a patent term can be extended to recapture a portion of the USPTO delay in issuing the patent as well as a portion of the term effectively lost as a result of the FDA regulatory review period. However, as to the FDA component, the restoration period cannot be longer than five years and the total patent term including the restoration period must not exceed 14 years following FDA approval. The duration of foreign patents varies in accordance with provisions of applicable local law, but typically is also 20 years from the earliest effective filing date. The actual protection afforded by a patent varies on a product by product basis, from country to country and depends upon many factors, including the type of patent, the scope of its coverage, the availability of regulatory-related extensions, the availability of legal remedies in a particular country and the validity and enforceability of the patent.
We also protect our proprietary technology and processes, in part, by confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees, consultants, scientific advisors and other contractors. These agreements may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors. To the extent that our employees, consultants, scientific advisors or other contractors use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions.
Our commercial success will also depend in part on not infringing the proprietary rights of third parties. It is uncertain whether the issuance of any third-party patent would require us to alter our development or commercial strategies, alter our drugs or processes, obtain licenses or cease certain activities. Our breach of any license agreements or failure to obtain a license to proprietary rights that we may require to develop or commercialize our future drugs may have a material adverse impact on us.
Research and Development
We are conducting clinical trials and other development activities to support submission of our NDA for TRC101 and manufacturing of commercial supply of TRC101. We invested $85.6 million, $35.9 million and $21.8 million in research and development for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. 
Competition
Our industry is highly competitive and subject to rapid and significant technological change. While we believe that our development experience, commercialization expertise and scientific knowledge provide us with competitive advantages, we may face competition from large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, smaller pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, specialty pharmaceutical companies, academic institutions, government agencies and research institutions and others.
Many of our competitors may have significantly greater financial, technical and human resources than we have. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if competitors develop or market products or other novel technologies that are more effective, safer or 
24

less costly than TRC101, or they may obtain regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours.
There are no therapies approved by the FDA for the chronic treatment of metabolic acidosis, and we are not aware of any active clinical development programs other than ours for a treatment in the United States. The FDA has approved generic intravenous sodium bicarbonate solutions for the treatment of acute metabolic acidosis which may occur in severe renal disease, uncontrolled diabetes, and certain other disorders accompanied by a significant loss of bicarbonate; however, those therapies are used for short-term hospital-based treatments and are not used in clinical practice to treat metabolic acidosis. Metabolic acidosis in CKD patients is currently most commonly treated using oral alkali supplementations, such as sodium bicarbonate, sodium citrate or, less frequently, potassium citrate. These treatments have not been approved by the FDA for the treatment of metabolic acidosis.
Government Regulation
Government Regulation and Product Approval
Government authorities in the United States, at the federal, state and local level, and in other countries and jurisdictions, including the European Union, extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, packaging, storage, recordkeeping, labeling, advertising, promotion, distribution, marketing, postmarketing monitoring and reporting, and import and export of drug products. The processes for obtaining regulatory approvals in the United States and in foreign countries and jurisdictions, along with subsequent compliance with applicable statutes and regulations and other regulatory authorities, require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources.
FDA Approval Process
In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FFDCA, and implementing regulations. These laws and other federal and state statutes and regulations, govern, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, storage, recordkeeping, approval, labeling, promotion and marketing, distribution, postmarketing monitoring and reporting, sampling, and import and export of drug products. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with applicable federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with applicable U.S. requirements may subject a company to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as clinical hold, FDA refusal to approve pending regulatory applications, warning or untitled letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, civil penalties, and criminal prosecution.
The process required by the FDA before a drug may be marketed in the United States generally includes the following:

• | completion of nonclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies according to Good Laboratory Practices, or GLP, or other applicable regulations;


• | submission to the FDA of an investigational new drug application, or IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin in the United States;


• | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials according to Good Clinical Practices, or GCP, to establish the safety and efficacy of the product candidate for its intended use;


• | submission to the FDA of a New Drug Application, or NDA, for a new product;


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection, if conducted, of the facility or facilities where the product candidate is manufactured to assess compliance with the FDA’s current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMP, to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the drug product candidate’s identity, strength, quality, purity, and potency;


• | potential FDA inspection of the nonclinical and clinical trial sites;


• | potential FDA inspection of us and vendors involved in the generation of the data in support of the NDA; and


• | FDA review and approval of the NDA.

25

Satisfaction of FDA pre-market approval requirements typically takes many years and the actual time required may vary substantially based upon the type, complexity, and novelty of the product candidate or disease. A clinical hold may occur at any time during the life of an IND and may affect one or more specific trials or all trials conducted under the IND.
Nonclinical tests include laboratory evaluation of the product candidate’s chemistry, formulation, and toxicity, as well as animal studies to assess the characteristics and potential safety and efficacy of the product candidate. The conduct of the nonclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements, including GLP. The results of nonclinical testing are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND along with other information, including information about product candidate’s chemistry, manufacturing and controls, and a proposed clinical trial protocol. Long-term nonclinical tests, such as animal tests of reproductive toxicity and carcinogenicity, may continue after the IND is submitted. A 30-day waiting period after the submission of each IND is required prior to the commencement of clinical testing in humans. If the FDA has neither commented on nor questioned the IND within this 30-day period, the clinical trial proposed in the IND may begin. Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational product to healthy volunteers or subjects under the supervision of a qualified investigator. Clinical trials must be conducted: (i) in compliance with federal regulations; (ii) in compliance with GCP, an international standard meant to protect the rights and health of subjects and to define the roles of clinical trial sponsors, administrators, and monitors; as well as (iii) under protocols detailing the objectives of the trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety, and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. Each protocol involving testing on U.S. subjects and subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND.
The FDA may order the temporary or permanent discontinuation of a clinical trial at any time or impose other sanctions if it believes that the clinical trial either is not being conducted in accordance with FDA requirements or presents an unacceptable risk to the clinical trial subjects. The trial protocol and informed consent information for subjects in clinical trials must also be submitted to an ethics committee/institutional review board, or IRB, for approval. An ethics committee/IRB may also require the clinical trial at the site to be halted, either temporarily or permanently, for failure to comply with the ethics committee/IRB’s requirements, or may impose other conditions. The study sponsor may also suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a determination that the subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk.
Clinical trials to support NDAs for marketing approval are typically conducted in three sequential phases, but the phases may overlap. In Phase 1, the initial introduction of the product candidate is usually into healthy human subjects, and the product candidate is tested to assess metabolism, pharmacokinetics, pharmacological actions, side effects associated with increasing doses, and, if possible, early evidence on effectiveness. Phase 2 usually involves trials in a limited patient population to determine the effectiveness of the product candidate for a particular indication, dosage tolerance, and optimal dosage, and to identify common adverse effects and safety risks. If a product candidate demonstrates evidence of effectiveness and an acceptable safety profile in Phase 2 evaluations, Phase 3 trials are undertaken to obtain additional information about clinical efficacy and safety in a larger number of subjects, typically at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, to permit the FDA to evaluate the overall benefit-risk relationship of the product candidate and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the product candidate. In most cases, the FDA requires two adequate and well-controlled Phase 3 clinical trials to demonstrate the efficacy of the product candidate. A single Phase 3 trial may be sufficient in certain circumstances.
A drug product candidate being studied in clinical trials may be made available for treatment of individual patients, in certain circumstances. Pursuant to the 21st Century Cures Act, or Cures Act, which was signed into law in December 2016, the manufacturer of an investigational product for a serious disease or condition is required to make available, such as by posting on its website, its policy on evaluating and responding to requests for individual patient access to such investigational product.
During the development of a new product candidate, sponsors are given opportunities to meet with the FDA at certain points; specifically, prior to the submission of an IND, at the end of Phase 2 and before an NDA is submitted. Meetings at other times may be requested. These meetings can provide an opportunity for the sponsor to share information about the data gathered to date and for the FDA to provide advice on the next phase of development. Sponsors typically use the meeting at the end of Phase 2 to discuss their Phase 2 clinical results and present their plans for the pivotal Phase 3 clinical trials that they believe will support the approval of the new product candidate.
Concurrent with clinical trials, sponsors usually complete additional animal safety studies and also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the product candidate and finalize a process for manufacturing commercial quantities of the product candidate in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and 
26

the manufacturer must develop methods for testing the quality, purity and potency of the product candidate. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its proposed shelf life. After completion of the required clinical testing, an NDA is prepared and submitted to the FDA. FDA approval of the NDA is required before marketing of the product may begin in the United States. The NDA must include the results of all nonclinical, clinical, and other testing and a compilation of data relating to the product candidate’s pharmacology, chemistry, manufacture, and controls. The cost of preparing and submitting an NDA is substantial. The submission of most NDAs is additionally subject to a substantial application user fee, and the applicant under an approved NDA is also subject to annual prescription drug program fees. These fees are typically increased annually. On August 3, 2017, Congress passed the FDA Reauthorization Act of 2017, or FDARA, which reauthorizes the various user fees to facilitate the FDA’s product review and oversight.
The FDA has 60 days from its receipt of an NDA to determine whether the application will be accepted for filing based on the agency’s threshold determination that it is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. The FDA may refuse to file any NDA that it deems incomplete or not properly reviewable at the time of submission and may request additional information. In this event, the NDA must be resubmitted with the additional information and the resubmitted application also is subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review. The FDA has agreed to certain performance goals in the review of NDAs. Most such applications for standard review product candidates are reviewed within ten months of the date the FDA files the NDA; most applications for priority review product candidates are reviewed within six months of the date the FDA files the NDA. Priority review can be applied to a product candidate that the FDA determines has the potential to treat a serious or life-threatening condition and, if approved, would be a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness compared to available therapies. The review process for both standard and priority review may be extended by the FDA for three additional months to consider certain late-submitted information, or information intended to clarify information already provided in the submission. This late-submitted information is typically requested by FDA.
Among other things, the FDA reviews an NDA to determine whether the product is safe and effective for its intended use and whether the product candidate is being manufactured in accordance with cGMP. The FDA may also refer applications for novel product candidates, or product candidates that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy, to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts for review, evaluation, and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it generally follows such recommendations.
Before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP. Additionally, the FDA may inspect the facility or the facilities at which the product candidate is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the product candidate unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. To assure GCP and cGMP compliance, an applicant must incur significant expenditures of time, money and effort in the areas of training, record keeping, production, and quality control.
Notwithstanding the submission of relevant data and information, the FDA may ultimately decide that the NDA does not satisfy the criteria for approval and deny approval. Data obtained from clinical trials are not always conclusive. The FDA may disagree with our trial design or interpret data from nonclinical studies and clinical trials differently than we interpret the same data. If the agency decides not to approve the NDA in its present form, the FDA will issue a complete response letter that describes all of the specific deficiencies in the application identified by the FDA. The deficiencies identified may be minor, for example, requiring labeling changes, or major, for example, requiring additional clinical trials. If a complete response letter is issued, the applicant may either resubmit the NDA, addressing the deficiencies identified in the letter, or withdraw the application. If, or when, those deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA’s satisfaction in a resubmission of the NDA, the FDA will issue an approval letter. The FDA has committed to reviewing such resubmissions in two or six months depending on the type of information included. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug in the United States with specific prescribing information for specific indications.
Even if a product candidate receives regulatory approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific indications and dosages or the indications for use may otherwise be limited, which could restrict the commercial value of the product. Further, the FDA may require that certain contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling. The FDA may impose restrictions and conditions on product distribution, prescribing, or dispensing in the form of a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or REMS, or otherwise limit the 
27

scope of any approval. REMS can include medication guides, communication plans for healthcare professionals, and elements to assure safe use, or ETASU. ETASU can include, but are not limited to, special training or certification for prescribing or dispensing, dispensing only under certain circumstances, special monitoring, and the use of patient registries. The requirement for a REMS can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the product. In addition, the FDA may require confirmatory postmarketing trials, sometimes referred to as “Phase 4” clinical trials, designed to further assess a product’s safety and effectiveness, and testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products that have been commercialized.
Foreign Clinical Studies to Support an IND or NDA
The FDA will accept as support for an IND or NDA a well-designed, well-conducted, non-IND foreign clinical trial if it was conducted in accordance with GCP and the FDA is able to validate the data from the trial through an on-site inspection, if necessary. A sponsor or applicant who wishes to rely on a non-IND foreign clinical trial must submit supporting information to the FDA to demonstrate that the trial conformed to GCP.
Regulatory applications based solely on foreign clinical data meeting these criteria may be approved if the foreign data are applicable to the U.S. population and U.S. medical practice, the trials have been performed by clinical investigators of recognized competence, and the data may be considered valid without the need for an on-site inspection by FDA or, if FDA considers such an inspection to be necessary, FDA is able to validate the data through an on-site inspection or other appropriate means. Failure of an application to meet any of these criteria may result in the application not being approvable based on the foreign data alone.
Disclosure of Clinical Trial Information
Sponsors of clinical trials of FDA-regulated products are required to register and disclose certain clinical trial information. Information related to the product, patient population, phase of investigation, trial sites and investigators, and other aspects of the clinical trial is then made public as part of the registration. Sponsors are also obligated to disclose the results of their clinical trials after completion. Disclosure of the results of these trials can be delayed in certain circumstances for up to two years after the date of completion of the trial. Competitors may use this publicly available information to gain knowledge regarding the progress of development programs.
Expedited Development and Review Programs
The FDA has various programs, including Fast Track Designation, Priority Review Designation, Accelerated Approval Program and Breakthrough Therapy Designation, which are intended to expedite or simplify the process for reviewing product candidates. Even if a product candidate qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the product candidate no longer meets the conditions for qualification or that the time period for FDA review or approval will be lengthened. Generally, product candidates that are eligible for these programs are those for serious or life-threatening conditions, those with the potential to address unmet medical needs and those that offer meaningful benefits over existing treatments. For example, Fast Track Designation is a process designed to facilitate the development and expedite the review of product candidates to treat serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions and fill unmet medical needs. Priority Review Designation is designed to give a product candidate that treats a serious condition and, if approved, would provide a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness, an initial review within six months as compared to a standard review time of within ten months of the date the FDA files the NDA.
Although Fast Track Designation and Priority Review Designation do not affect the standards for approval, the FDA will attempt to facilitate early and frequent meetings with a sponsor of a Fast Track Designation product candidate and expedite review of the application for a Priority Review Designation product candidate.
In the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act, or FDASIA, which was signed into law in July 2012, the U.S. Congress encouraged the FDA to utilize innovative and flexible approaches to the assessment of product candidates under the Accelerated Approval Program. The law required the FDA to issue related guidance and also promulgate confirming regulatory changes. In May 2014, the FDA published a final Guidance for Industry titled “Expedited Programs for Serious Conditions-Drugs and Biologics,” which provides guidance on the FDA programs that are intended to facilitate and expedite development and review of new product candidates as well as threshold criteria generally applicable to concluding that a product candidate is a candidate for these expedited development and review programs.
28

In addition to the Fast Track Designation and Priority Review Designation Programs discussed above, the FDA also provided guidance on a new program for Breakthrough Therapy Designation, established by FDASIA to subject a new category of product candidates to expedited approval. A sponsor may seek Breakthrough Therapy Designation of a product candidate if the product candidate is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other therapeutics, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product candidate may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. A request for Breakthrough Therapy Designation should be submitted concurrently with, or as an amendment to, an IND, but ideally no later than the End-of-Phase 2 meeting.
Accelerated Approval Program
Under the accelerated approval provisions of the FFDCA and the FDA’s implementing regulations, the FDA may grant accelerated approval to a product for a serious or life-threatening disease or condition that provides meaningful therapeutic advantage to patients over existing treatments based upon a determination that the product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit. Products approved under the Accelerated Approval Program must meet the same statutory standards for safety and effectiveness as those granted traditional approval.
The Accelerated Approval Program is most often used in settings in which the course of a disease is long and an extended period of time is required to measure the intended clinical benefit of a product, while the effect on the surrogate endpoint occurs more rapidly. The FDA will not grant approval under the Accelerated Approval Program to products that meet standards for traditional approval.
The evidence to support the determination that an endpoint is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit may include epidemiological, pathophysiological, therapeutic, pharmacologic, or other evidence developed using biomarkers, for example, or other scientific methods or tools. The FDA considers all relevant evidence and may consult external experts, as needed. Important factors for the agency’s consideration include the disease process and the relationship between the drug’s effect and the disease process.
Approval under the Accelerated Approval Program is subject, however, to the requirement that the applicant conduct additional postmarketing clinical trials to verify and describe the drug’s clinical benefit, where there is uncertainty as to the relationship of the surrogate endpoint to the clinical benefit, or of the observed clinical endpoint to ultimate outcome. Typically, clinical benefit is verified when postmarketing clinical trials show that the drug provides a clinically meaningful positive therapeutic effect, that is, an effect on how a patient feels, functions, or survives. The FDA may require that any confirmatory postmarketing trial be initiated or substantially underway prior to the submission of an application under the Accelerated Approval Program. And, if such confirmatory postmarketing trial fails to confirm the drug’s clinical profile or risks and benefits, the FDA may withdraw its approval of the drug. The FDA may also withdraw the approval if other evidence demonstrates that the product is not safe or effective. All promotional materials for product candidates approved under the Accelerated Approval Program are subject to prior review by the FDA. The FDA has issued labeling instructions specific to the program. For example, if a drug is approved based on a surrogate endpoint under the program, its labeling should include a succinct description of the limitations of usefulness of the drug and any uncertainty about anticipated clinical benefits. False or misleading promotional materials may also lead to expedited withdrawal of approval.
Patent Term Restoration and Marketing Exclusivity
After approval, owners of relevant drug patents may apply for up to a five-year patent extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, referred to as the Hatch- Waxman Act. The allowable patent term extension is calculated as half of the product’s testing phase-the time between IND and NDA submission-and all of the review phase-the time between NDA submission and approval, up to a maximum of five years. The time can be shortened if the FDA determines that the applicant did not pursue approval with due diligence. The total patent term after the extension may not exceed 14 years.
For patents that might expire during the application phase, the patent owner may request an interim patent extension. An interim patent extension increases the patent term by one year and may be renewed up to four times. For each interim patent extension granted, the post-approval patent extension is reduced by one year. The director of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office must determine that approval of the product candidate covered by the patent for which a patent extension is being sought is likely. Interim patent extensions are not available for a product candidate for which an NDA has not been submitted.
29

Market exclusivity provisions under the FFDCA also can delay the submission or the approval of certain applications. The FFDCA provides a five-year period of non-patent marketing exclusivity within the United States to the first applicant to gain approval of an NDA for a new chemical entity. A product candidate is a new chemical entity if the FDA has not previously approved any other new product candidate containing the same active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the action of the product candidate substance. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not accept for review an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA, or a 505(b)(2) NDA submitted by another company for another version of such product candidate where the applicant does not own or have a legal right of reference to all the data required for approval. However, an application may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement. The FFDCA also provides three years of marketing exclusivity for an NDA, 505(b)(2) NDA or supplement to an approved NDA if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application, for example, for new indications, dosages or strengths of an existing product candidate. This three-year exclusivity covers only the conditions associated with the new clinical investigations and does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs for product candidates containing the original active agent. Five-year and three-year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a full NDA. However, an applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to all of the nonclinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness.
Postmarketing Requirements
Once an approval is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory requirements is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product may result in restrictions on the product or even complete withdrawal of the product from the market. After approval, some types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes and additional labeling claims, are subject to further FDA review and approval. In addition, the FDA may under some circumstances require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the effect of approved products that have been commercialized, and the FDA under some circumstances has the power to prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of these postmarketing programs.
TRC101, which will be manufactured or distributed by us or our collaborators pursuant to FDA approvals, is subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things:

• | record-keeping requirements;


• | reporting of adverse experiences associated with the product;


• | providing the FDA with updated safety and efficacy information;


• | therapeutic sampling and distribution requirements;


• | notifying the FDA and gaining its approval of specified manufacturing or labeling changes;


• | registration and listing requirements; and


• | complying with FDA promotion and advertising requirements, which include, among other things, standards for direct-to-consumer advertising, restrictions on promoting products for uses or in patient populations that are not described in the product’s approved labeling, limitations on industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities and requirements for promotional activities involving the internet.

Manufacturers, their subcontractors, and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of TRC101, if approved, are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and some state agencies for compliance with cGMP, including data integrity requirements, and other laws. The FDA periodically inspects manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with ongoing regulatory requirements, including cGMP, which impose extensive procedural, substantive and record-keeping requirements upon us and third-party manufacturers engaged by us if TRC101 is approved. In addition, changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated, and, depending on the significance of the change, may require FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations would also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon us and our third-party manufacturers. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMP and other aspects of regulatory compliance. Failure to comply 
30

with the statutory and regulatory requirements can subject a manufacturer to possible legal or regulatory actions, such as warning letters, suspension of manufacturing, seizures of products, injunctive actions or other civil penalties.
In addition, drug manufacturers in the United States must comply with applicable provisions of the Drug Supply Chain Security Act and provide and receive product tracing information, maintain appropriate licenses, ensure they only work with other properly licensed entities, and have procedures in place to identify and properly handle suspect and illegitimate product.
New Legislation and Regulations
From time to time, legislation is drafted, introduced and passed in Congress that could significantly change the statutory provisions governing the testing, approval, manufacturing and marketing of products regulated by the FDA. In addition to new legislation, FDA regulations and policies are often revised or interpreted by the agency in ways that may significantly affect our business and TRC101. It is impossible to predict whether further legislative changes will be enacted or whether FDA regulations, guidance, policies or interpretations will be changed or what the effect of such changes, if any, may be.
Other U.S. Healthcare Laws and Compliance Requirements
In the United States, our activities are potentially subject to regulation by various federal, state and local authorities in addition to the FDA, including but not limited to, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, other divisions of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (such as the Office of Inspector General and the Health Resources and Service Administration), the U.S. Department of Justice, or the DOJ, and individual U.S. Attorney offices within the DOJ, and state and local governments. For example, sales, marketing and scientific/educational grant programs may have to comply with the anti-fraud and abuse provisions of the Social Security Act, the false claims laws, the privacy and security provisions of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, or HIPAA, and similar state laws, each as amended, as applicable.
The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, any person or entity, from knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving any remuneration, directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, to induce or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for the purchase, lease or order of any item or service reimbursable, in whole or in part, under Medicare, Medicaid or other federal healthcare programs. The term remuneration has been interpreted broadly to include anything of value. The Anti-Kickback Statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between therapeutic product manufacturers on one hand and prescribers, purchasers, and formulary managers on the other. There are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting some common activities from prosecution. The exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly and practices that involve remuneration that may be alleged to be intended to induce prescribing, purchasing or recommending may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exception or safe harbor. Failure to meet all of the requirements of a particular applicable statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor does not make the conduct per se illegal under the Anti-Kickback Statute. Instead, the legality of the arrangement will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis based on a cumulative review of all of its facts and circumstances. Our practices may not in all cases meet all of the criteria for protection under a statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor.
Additionally, the intent standard under the Anti-Kickback Statute was amended by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, or the PPACA , to a stricter standard such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. In addition, the PPACA codified case law that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal False Claims Act, or FCA (discussed below).
The federal false claims and civil monetary penalty laws, including the FCA, which imposes significant penalties and can be enforced by private citizens through civil qui tam actions, prohibit any person or entity from, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment to, or approval by, the federal healthcare programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, or knowingly making, using, or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to the federal government. A claim includes “any request or demand” for money or property presented to the U.S. government. For instance, historically, pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have been prosecuted under these laws for allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product. Other companies have been prosecuted for causing false claims to be submitted because of the companies’ marketing of the product for unapproved, off-label, and thus generally non-reimbursable, uses.
31

HIPAA created additional federal criminal statutes that prohibit, among other things, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud or to obtain, by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations or promises, any money or property owned by, or under the control or custody of, any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payers, willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a healthcare offense, and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up by trick, scheme or device, a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Like the Anti-Kickback Statute, the PPACA amended the intent standard for certain healthcare fraud statutes under HIPAA such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation.
Also, many states have similar, and typically more prohibitive, fraud and abuse statutes or regulations that apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payer. Additionally, to the extent that TRC101 may in the future be sold in a foreign country, we may be subject to similar foreign laws.
We may be subject to data privacy and security regulations by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, and its implementing regulations, imposes requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. Among other things, HITECH makes HIPAA’s privacy and security standards directly applicable to business associates, independent contractors, or agents of covered entities that receive or obtain protected health information in connection with providing a service on behalf of a covered entity. HITECH also created four new tiers of civil monetary penalties, amended HIPAA to make civil and criminal penalties directly applicable to business associates, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce HIPAA and seek attorneys’ fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. In addition, many state laws govern the privacy and security of health information in specified circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways, are often not pre-empted by HIPAA, and may have a more prohibitive effect than HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts.
We expect that TRC101, if approved, may be eligible for coverage under Medicare, the federal health care program that provides health care benefits to the aged and disabled, and covers outpatient services and supplies, including certain pharmaceutical products, that are medically necessary to treat a beneficiary’s health condition. In addition, TRC101 may be covered and reimbursed under other government programs, such as Medicaid and the 340B Drug Pricing Program. The Medicaid Drug Rebate Program requires pharmaceutical manufacturers to enter into and have in effect a national rebate agreement with the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services as a condition for states to receive federal matching funds for the manufacturer’s outpatient drugs furnished to Medicaid patients. Under the 340B Drug Pricing Program, the manufacturer must extend discounts to entities that participate in the program. As part of the requirements to participate in these government programs, many pharmaceutical manufacturers must calculate and report certain price reporting metrics to the government, such as average manufacturer price, or AMP, and best price.
Additionally, the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act, or the Sunshine Act, within the PPACA, and its implementing regulations, require that certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biological and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program (with certain exceptions) report annually to CMS information related to certain payments or other transfers of value made or distributed to physicians and teaching hospitals, or to entities or individuals at the request of, or designated on behalf of, the physicians and teaching hospitals and to report annually certain ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. In addition, many states also govern the reporting of payments or other transfers of value, many of which differ from each other in significant ways, are often not pre-empted, and may have a more prohibitive effect than the Sunshine Act, thus further complicating compliance efforts.
In order to distribute products commercially, we must comply with state laws that require the registration of manufacturers and wholesale distributors of drug and biological products in a state, including, in certain states, manufacturers and distributors who ship products into the state even if such manufacturers or distributors have no place of business within the state. Some states also impose requirements on manufacturers and distributors to establish the pedigree of product in the chain of distribution, including some states that require manufacturers and others to adopt new technology capable of tracking and tracing product as it moves through the distribution chain. Several states have enacted legislation requiring pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to establish marketing compliance programs, file periodic reports with the state, make periodic public disclosures on sales, marketing, pricing, clinical trials and other activities, and/or register their sales representatives, as well as to prohibit 
32

pharmacies and other healthcare entities from providing certain physician prescribing data to pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for use in sales and marketing, and to prohibit certain other sales and marketing practices. All of our activities are potentially subject to federal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws.
Ensuring business arrangements with third parties comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations is a costly endeavor. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the federal and state healthcare laws described above or any other current or future governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including without limitation, civil, criminal and/or administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, individual imprisonment, exclusion from participation in government programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, injunctions, private “qui tam” actions brought by individual whistleblowers in the name of the government, or refusal to allow us to enter into government contracts, contractual damages, reputational harm, administrative burdens, diminished profits and future earnings, additional reporting obligations and oversight if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or other agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations.
Coverage, Pricing and Reimbursement
Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of TRC101, if approved. In the United States and in foreign markets, sales of TRC101, if and when we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale, will depend, in part, on the extent to which third-party payers provide coverage and establish adequate reimbursement levels for such products. In the United States, third-party payers include federal and state healthcare programs, private managed care providers, health insurers and other organizations. Adequate coverage and reimbursement from governmental healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid in the United States, and commercial payers are critical to new product acceptance.
Our ability to commercialize TRC101 successfully also will depend in part on the extent to which coverage and reimbursement for these products and related treatments will be available from government health administration authorities, private health insurers and other organizations. Government authorities and third-party payers, such as private health insurers and health maintenance organizations, decide which therapeutics they will pay for and establish reimbursement levels. Coverage and reimbursement by a third-party payer may depend upon a number of factors, including the third-party payer’s determination that use of a therapeutic is:

• | a covered benefit under its health plan;


• | safe, effective and medically necessary;


• | appropriate for the specific patient;


• | cost-effective; and


• | neither experimental nor investigational.

We cannot be sure that reimbursement will be available for TRC101 and, if coverage and reimbursement are available, what the level of reimbursement will be. Coverage may also be more limited than the indications for which the product is approved by the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities. Reimbursement may impact the demand for, or the price of, TRC101, if approved.
Third-party payers are increasingly challenging the price, examining the medical necessity, and reviewing the cost effectiveness of medical products, therapies and services, in addition to questioning their safety and efficacy. Obtaining reimbursement for TRC101 may be particularly difficult because of the higher prices often associated with branded drugs and drugs administered under the supervision of a physician. We may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost effectiveness of TRC101, in addition to the costs required to obtain FDA approvals. TRC101 may not be considered medically necessary or cost-effective. Obtaining coverage and reimbursement approval of a product from a government or other third-party payer is a time-consuming and costly process that could require us to provide to each payer supporting scientific, clinical and cost-effectiveness data for the use of TRC101 on a payer-by-payer basis, with no assurance that coverage and adequate reimbursement will be obtained. A payer’s decision to provide coverage for a product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Further, one payer’s determination to provide coverage for a 
33

product does not assure that other payers will also provide coverage for the product. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development. In addition, prices for drugs may be reduced by mandatory discounts or rebates required by government healthcare programs or private payers and by any future relaxation of laws that presently restrict imports of drugs from countries where they may be sold at lower prices than in the United States. It is difficult to predict how Medicare coverage and reimbursement policies will be applied to TRC101 in the future and coverage and reimbursement under different federal healthcare programs are not always consistent. If reimbursement is not available or is available only at limited levels, we may not be able to successfully commercialize TRC101.
Different pricing and reimbursement schemes exist in other countries. In the European Union, governments influence the price of pharmaceutical products through their pricing and reimbursement rules and control of national health care systems that fund a large part of the cost of those products to consumers. Some jurisdictions operate positive and negative list systems under which products may only be marketed once a reimbursement price has been agreed. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval, some of these countries may require the completion of clinical trials that compare the cost effectiveness of a particular product candidate to currently available therapies. Other member states allow companies to fix their own prices for medicines but monitor and control company profits. The downward pressure on health care costs has become intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. In addition, in some countries, cross- border imports from low-priced markets exert a commercial pressure on pricing within a country.
The marketability of TRC101, if approved, for commercial sale may suffer if the government and third-party payers fail to provide adequate coverage and reimbursement. In addition, emphasis on managed care, the increasing influence of health maintenance organizations, and additional legislative changes in the United States has increased, and we expect will continue to increase, the pressure on healthcare pricing. The downward pressure on the rise in healthcare costs in general, particularly prescription medicines, medical devices and surgical procedures and other treatments, has become very intense. Coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which we receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.
Healthcare Reform
In the United States and some foreign jurisdictions, there have been, and continue to be, several legislative and regulatory changes and proposed changes regarding the healthcare system that could prevent or delay marketing approval of product candidates, restrict or regulate post-approval activities, and affect the ability to profitably sell product candidates for which marketing approval is obtained. Among policy makers and payers in the United States and elsewhere, there is significant interest in promoting changes in healthcare systems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs, improving quality and/or expanding access. In the United States, the pharmaceutical industry has been a particular focus of these efforts and has been significantly affected by major legislative initiatives.
For example, the PPACA has substantially changed healthcare financing and delivery by both governmental and private insurers. Among the PPACA provisions of importance to the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries, in addition to those otherwise described above, are the following:

• | an annual, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports certain specified branded prescription drugs and biologic agents apportioned among these entities according to their market share in some government healthcare programs that began in 2011;


• | an increase in the statutory minimum rebates a manufacturer must pay under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, retroactive to January 1, 2010, to 23.1% and 13% of the average manufacturer price for most branded and generic drugs, respectively, and capped the total rebate amount for innovator drugs at 100% of the Average Manufacturer Price, or AMP;


• | a new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program, in which manufacturers must currently agree to offer 50%, which will change to 70% starting in 2019, point-of-sale discounts off negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition for the manufacturers’ outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D;

34


• | extension of manufacturers’ Medicaid rebate liability to covered drugs dispensed to individuals who are enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations;


• | expansion of eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs by, among other things, allowing states to offer Medicaid coverage to additional individuals beginning in 2014 and by adding new mandatory eligibility categories for individuals with income at or below 133% of the federal poverty level, thereby potentially increasing manufacturers’ Medicaid rebate liability;


• | expansion of the entities eligible for discounts under the 340B Drug Discount Program;


• | a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research;


• | expansion of healthcare fraud and abuse laws, including the FCA and the Anti-Kickback Statute, new government investigative powers, and enhanced penalties for noncompliance;


• | a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted, or injected;


• | requirements to report certain financial arrangements with physicians and teaching hospitals;


• | a requirement to annually report certain information regarding drug samples that manufacturers and distributors provide to physicians;


• | establishment of a Center for Medicare Innovation at CMS to test innovative payment and service delivery models to lower Medicare and Medicaid spending, potentially including prescription drug spending that began on January 1, 2011; and


• | a licensure framework for follow on biologic products.

There have been legal and judicial, Congressional, and political challenges to certain aspects of the PPACA, as well as recent efforts by the Trump administration to repeal and replace certain aspects of the PPACA. Since January 2017, President Trump has signed two executive orders and other directives designed to delay, circumvent, or loosen certain requirements mandated by the PPACA. Furthermore, each chamber of Congress has put forth multiple bills designed to repeal or repeal and replace portions of the PPACA. The newly enacted federal income tax law includes a provision repealing, effective January 1, 2019, the tax-based shared responsibility payment imposed by the PPACA on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year that is commonly referred to as the “individual mandate.” Additionally, on January 22, 2018, President Trump signed a continuing resolution on appropriations for fiscal year 2018 that delayed the implementation of certain PPACA-mandated fees, including the so called “Cadillac” tax on certain high cost employer-sponsored insurance plans, the annual fee imposed on certain health insurance providers based on market share, and the medical device excise tax on nonexempt medical devices. Further, the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 among other things, amends the PPACA, effective January 1, 2019, to close the coverage gap in most Medicare drug plans, commonly referred to as the “donut hole.” Congress may consider other legislation that would alter other aspects of the PPACA.
On December 14, 2018, a federal district court in Texas ruled the individual mandate was unconstitutional and inseverable from the PPACA. As a result, the court ruled the remaining provisions of the PPACA were also invalid, though the court declined to issue a preliminary injunction with respect to the PPACA. The court subsequently stayed its ruling on December 31, 2018, pending the outcome of appeals. The court’s ruling has been appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit (the “Fifth Circuit”). On March 25, 2019, the DOJ stated in a legal filing with the Fifth Circuit that the district court’s ruling that the PPACA was invalid should be upheld. It remains unclear whether the district court’s ruling will be upheld by appellate courts.
We anticipate that the PPACA, if substantially maintained in its current form, will continue to result in additional downward pressure on coverage and the price that we receive for TRC101, and could seriously harm our business. Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare and other government programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payers. The implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may prevent us from being able to generate revenue, attain profitability, or commercialize TRC101. Such reforms could have an adverse effect on anticipated revenue from product candidates that we may successfully develop and for which we may obtain regulatory approval and may affect our overall financial condition and ability to develop product candidates.
35

Further legislation or regulation could be passed that could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the PPACA was enacted. For example, in August 2011, President Obama signed into law the Budget Control Act of 2011, which, among other things, created the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction to recommend to Congress proposals in spending reductions. The Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction did not achieve a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for fiscal years 2012 through 2021, triggering the legislation’s automatic reduction to several government programs. This includes aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect beginning on April 1, 2013 and will stay in effect through 2027 unless additional Congressional action is taken. 
Additionally, there has been increasing legislative and enforcement interest in the United States with respect to specialty drug pricing practices. Specifically, there have been several recent U.S. Congressional inquiries and proposed federal legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, reduce the cost of prescription drugs under Medicare, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drugs. At the federal level, the Trump administration’s budget proposal for fiscal year 2019 contains further drug price control measures that could be enacted during the 2019 budget process or in other future legislation, including, for example, measures to permit Medicare Part D plans to negotiate the price of certain drugs under Medicare Part B, to allow some states to negotiate drug prices under Medicaid, and to eliminate cost sharing for generic drugs for low-income patients. While any proposed measures will require authorization through additional legislation to become effective, Congress and the Trump administration have each indicated that it will continue to seek new legislative and/or administrative measures to control drug costs. At the state level, individual states in the United States are increasingly passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures. For example, in September 2017, the California State Assembly approved SB17, which requires pharmaceutical companies to notify health insurers and government health plans at least 60 days before any scheduled increases in the prices of their products if they exceed certain thresholds over a two-year period, and further requiring pharmaceutical companies to explain the reasons for such increase. Effective in 2016, Vermont passed a law requiring certain manufacturer identified by the state to justify their price increases.
The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act
The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or the FCPA, prohibits any U.S. individual or business from paying, offering, or authorizing payment or offering of anything of value, directly or indirectly, to any foreign official, political party or candidate for the purpose of influencing any act or decision of the foreign entity in order to assist the individual or business in obtaining or retaining business. The FCPA also obligates companies whose securities are listed in the United States to comply with accounting provisions requiring us to maintain books and records that accurately and fairly reflect all transactions of the corporation, and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls for international operations.
Additional Regulation
In addition to the foregoing, state and federal laws regarding environmental protection and hazardous substances, including the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Resource Conservancy and Recovery Act and the Toxic Substances Control Act, affect our business. These and other laws govern our use, handling and disposal of various biological, chemical and radioactive substances used in, and wastes generated by, our operations. If our operations result in contamination of the environment or expose individuals to hazardous substances, we could be liable for damages and governmental fines. We believe that we are in material compliance with applicable environmental laws and that continued compliance therewith will not have a material adverse effect on our business. We cannot predict, however, how changes in these laws may affect our future operations.
Other Regulations
We are also subject to numerous federal, state and local laws relating to such matters as safe working conditions, manufacturing practices, environmental protection, fire hazard control, and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances. We may incur significant costs to comply with such laws and regulations now or in the future.
36

European Union / Rest of World Government Regulation
In addition to regulations in the United States, we will be subject to a variety of regulations in other jurisdictions governing, among other things, clinical trials and any future commercial sales and distribution of TRC101. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval to market TRC101, we must obtain the requisite approvals from regulatory authorities in foreign jurisdictions prior to the commencement of clinical trials or marketing of the products in those countries.
Even if a product obtains FDA marketing approval, most foreign jurisdiction require that the investigational product undergo national requirements related to clinical trials and authorization processes, similar to those in the United States. With respect to clinical trials, certain countries outside of the United States have a similar process that requires the submission of a clinical trial application, much like the IND, prior to the commencement of human clinical trials. In the European Union, for example, before starting a clinical trial, a valid request for authorization must be submitted by the sponsor to the competent authority of the EU Member State(s) in which the sponsor plans to conduct the clinical trial, as well as to independent Ethics Committee(s). A clinical trial may commence only once the relevant Ethics Committee(s) has (have) issued a favorable opinion and the competent authority of the EU Member State(s) concerned has (have) not informed the sponsor of any grounds for non-acceptance. Failure to comply with the EU requirements may subject a company to the rejection of the request and the prohibition to start a clinical trial. Clinical trials conducted in the European Union (or used for marketing authorization application in the European Union) must be conducted in accordance with applicable laws, GCP and GMP rules, International Conference on Harmonization of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use, or ICH, guidelines and be consistent with ethical principles. EU Member State inspections are regularly conducted to verify the sponsor’s compliance with applicable rules. The sponsor is required to record and report to the relevant national competent authorities (and to the Ethics Committee) information about suspected serious unexpected adverse reactions.
The authorization of a clinical trial may be suspended or revoked by EU Member States in their territory if the conditions in the request for an authorization are no longer met, or if an EU Member State has information raising doubts about the safety or scientific validity of the clinical trial. Various penalties exist in EU Member States for non-compliance with the clinical trial rules and related requirements, for example with respect to data protection and privacy. If we or our potential collaborators fail to comply with applicable EU regulatory requirements, we may also be subject to damage compensation and civil and criminal liability. The way clinical trials are conducted in the European Union will undergo a major change when the new EU Clinical Trial Regulation (Regulation 536/2014) comes into application in 2019.
As in the United States, no medicinal product may be placed on the EU market unless a marketing authorization has been issued. Medicinal products may be authorized in different ways in the EU, depending on certain criteria: the national authorization procedure (i.e., via the EU Member States’ national authorization procedure, which later allows for application via the mutual-recognition procedure), the centralized authorization procedure (i.e., at EU level), or the decentralized authorization procedure (i.e., authorization of a product that is not yet authorized in the EU, which can simultaneously be authorized in several EU Member States). Products submitted for approval via the national procedure must follow the national authorization procedures, which vary from Member State to Member State. Products submitted for approval via the centralized procedure (only available for certain products and indications) are assessed by the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, or CHMP, a committee within the European Medicines Agency, or EMA. The CHMP assesses, inter alia, whether a medicine meets the necessary quality, safety and efficacy requirements and whether it has a positive risk-benefit balance. Products submitted for approval via the decentralized procedure, as for the mutual-recognition procedure, must first undergo an assessment performed by one Member State, or reference Member State, which another Member State may approve.
Various penalties and sanctions exist in different EU Member States for non-compliance with the EU marketing authorization procedure. In addition, for centrally authorized products the European Commission may also impose financial penalties on the holders of marketing authorizations if they fail to comply with certain obligations in connection with the authorizations as well as pharmacovigilance rules. If we or our potential collaborators fail to comply with applicable EU or other foreign regulatory requirements, we may be subject to, among other things, fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution.
Coverage and reimbursement status of TRC101, if approved, are provided for by the national laws of EU Member States. The requirements may differ across the EU Member States. Also, at EU Member State level, actions

have been taken to enact transparency laws regarding payments between pharmaceutical companies and health care professionals, or HCPs.
We are subject to European data protection laws, including the new EU General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679, or GDPR. The GDPR which came into effect on May 25, 2018, establishes new requirements applicable to the processing of personal data (i.e., data which identifies an individual or from which an individual is identifiable), affords new data protection rights to individuals (e.g., the right to erasure of personal data) and imposes penalties for serious breaches of up to 4% annual worldwide turnover or €20 million, whichever is greater. Individuals (e.g., study subjects) also have a right to compensation for financial or non-financial losses (e.g., distress). The Regulation will increase our responsibility and liability in relation to personal data that we process, and we may be required to put in place additional mechanisms to ensure compliance with the new EU data protection rules.
For other countries outside of the European Union, such as countries in Eastern Europe, Latin America or Asia, the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. In all cases, again, the clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with GCP and the applicable regulatory requirements. The requirements and process governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement also vary from country to country.
