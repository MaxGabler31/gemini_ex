ITEM 1—BUSINESS
Overview
 
Wabash National Corporation (together with its subsidiaries, “Wabash,” “Wabash National,” “the Company,” “us,” “we,” or “our”) was founded in 1985 as a start-up company in Lafayette, Indiana. We are now a diversified industrial manufacturer and a leading producer of semi-trailers, truck bodies, specialized commercial vehicles, and liquid transportation systems.

Operating Segments
 
Previously, we managed our business in two segments: Commercial Trailer Products and Diversified Products. In the third quarter of 2017, we completed the acquisition of Supreme Industries, Inc. (“Supreme”). As a result, we created a new reporting segment in the fourth quarter referred to as the Final Mile Products segment, which includes the Supreme operations and certain other truck body operations which were previously included in our Commercial Trailer Products segment. Certain corporate-related administrative costs, interest and income taxes are not allocated to these segments, but are reported in our Corporate and Eliminations segment. Financial results by operating segment, including information about revenue, measures of profit and loss, and financial information regarding geographic areas and export sales are discussed in Note 13, Segments, of the accompanying consolidated financial statements. By operating segment, net sales, prior to the elimination of intersegment sales, were as follows (dollars in thousands):

   Industry and Competition
 
Trucking in the U.S., according to the American Trucking Association (ATA), was estimated to be a $676 billion industry in 2016, representing approximately 80% of the total U.S. transportation industry revenue. Furthermore, ATA estimates that approximately 71% of all freight tonnage in 2016 was carried by trucks. Trailer demand is directly impacted by the amount of freight to be transported. ATA estimates that total freight tonnage carried by trucks will grow 34% by 2028. To meet this continued high demand for freight, truck carriers will need to replace and expand their fleets, which typically results in increased trailer orders.
 
Transportation in the U.S., including trucking, is a cyclical industry that has experienced three cycles over the last 20 years. In each of the last three cycles the decline in freight tonnage preceded the general U.S. economic downturn by approximately two and one-half years and the recovery has generally preceded that of the economy as a whole. The trailer industry generally follows the transportation industry, experiencing cycles in the early and late 90’s lasting approximately 58 and 67 months, respectively. Truck freight tonnage, according to ATA statistics, started declining year-over-year in 2006 and remained at depressed levels through 2009. The most recent cycle concluded in 2009, lasting a total of 89 months. After three consecutive years with total trailer demand well below normal replacement demand levels estimated to be approximately 220,000 trailers, the period ending December 2017 demonstrated five consecutive years of healthy demand in which it is estimated there were total trailer shipments of approximately 234,000, 269,000, 308,000, 286,000, and 287,000 for the years ended 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016 and 2017, respectively. We expect to see continued strong demand for new trailer equipment as the economic and industry specific indicators we track, including ATA’s truck tonnage index, employment growth, housing and auto sectors, as well as the overall gross domestic product, appear to be trending in a positive direction.
 
Wabash, Great Dane, Utility and Hyundai Translead, are generally viewed as the top manufacturers in U.S. trailer shipments by volume. Our share of U.S. total trailer shipments in 2017 was approximately 19%. Trailer manufacturers compete primarily through the quality of their products, customer relationships, innovative technology, and price. We have seen others in the industry also pursue the development and use of composite sidewalls that compete directly with our DuraPlateâ products. Our product development is focused on maintaining a leading position with respect to these products and on development of new products and markets, leveraging our proprietary DuraPlate® product, as well as our expertise in the engineering and design of customized products.
 
The table below sets forth new trailers shipped for Wabash and, as provided by Trailer Body Builders Magazine, the principal producers within North America. The data represents all segments of the industry, except containers and chassis. For the years included below, we have participated primarily in the van, platform, and tank trailer segments. Van trailer demand, the largest segment within the trailer industry, has recovered from a low of approximately 52,000 trailers in 2009 to an estimated 223,000 van trailers in 2017.

Our Diversified Products segment, in most cases, participates in markets different than our traditional van and platform trailer product offerings. The end markets that our Diversified Products segment serve are broader and more diverse than the trailer industry, including environmental, pharmaceutical, biotech, oil and gas, moving and storage, and specialty vehicle markets. In addition, our diversification efforts pertain to new and emerging markets and many of the products are driven by regulatory requirements or, in most cases, customer-specific needs. However, some of our diversification efforts are considered to be in the early growth stages and future success is largely dependent on continued customer adoption of our product solutions and general expansion of our customer base and distribution channels.

Our Final Mile Products segment competes in the specialized vehicle industry, which is highly competitive with only a few national competitors and many smaller, regional companies. As a result of this broad competition, we are often faced with competitive pricing pressures. Other competitive factors include quality of product, lead times, geographic proximity to customers, and the ability to manufacture a product customized to customer specifications. With our national presence and diverse product offerings, we believe that we are well positioned to meet the competitive challenges presented.
 
Competitive Strengths
 
We believe our core competitive strengths include:
 

· | Long-Term Core Customer Relationships – We are the leading provider of trailers to a significant number of top tier trucking companies, generating a revenue base that has helped to sustain us as one of the market leaders. Our van products are preferred by many of the industry’s leading carriers. We are also a leading provider of liquid-transportation systems and engineered products and we have a strong customer base, consisting of mostly private fleets, and have earned a leading market position across many of the markets we serve. In addition, we are a leading manufacturer of truck bodies, and we have a strong customer base of large national fleet leasing companies.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Technology and Innovation – We continue to be recognized by the trucking industry as a leader in developing technology to provide value-added solutions for our customers that reduce trailer operating costs, improve revenue opportunities, and solve unique transportation problems. Throughout our history, we have been and we expect we will continue to be a leading innovator in the design and production of trailers and related products. Recent new trailer introductions and value-added options include the introduction of the Molded Structural Composite (MSCt) Refrigerated Van, the commercial launch of the Cold Chain Series Refrigerated Truck Body with molded structural composite technology, both offering advanced thermal and operational performance; Lean Duplex tank trailer, a stainless steel option that reduces weight while providing enhanced performance characteristics over typical chemical tank trailers; Trustlock Plus®, a proprietary single-lock rear door mechanism; and the DuraPlate® AeroSkirt®, Ventix DRSTM, AeroFinTM and AeroSkirt CXTM, durable aerodynamic solutions that, based on verified laboratory and track testing, provides improved fuel efficiencies of 9% or greater when used in specific combinations.

Our DuraPlateâ proprietary technology offers what we believe to be a superior trailer, which customers value. A DuraPlateâ trailer is a composite plate trailer using material that contains a high-density polyethylene core bonded between high-strength steel skins. We believe that the competitive advantages of our DuraPlateâ trailers compared to standard trailers include providing a lower total cost of ownership through the following:
 
-       Extended Service Life – operate three to five years longer;
 
-       Lower Operating and Maintenance Costs – greater durability and performance;
 
-       Less Downtime – higher utilization for fleets;
 
-       Extended Warranty – warranty period for DuraPlateâ panels is ten years; and
 
-       Improved Resale Value – higher trade-in and resale values.
 
We have been manufacturing DuraPlateâ trailers for over 22 years and through December 2017 have sold approximately 700,000 DuraPlate® trailers. We believe that this proven experience, combined with ownership and knowledge of the DuraPlateâ panel technology, will help ensure continued industry leadership in the future.

We have also focused on a customer-centered approach in developing product enhancements for other industries we serve. Some of the more recent innovations include: the development of mobile clean rooms, or self-contained laboratories, which are configured to provide isolation and containment solutions into a rapidly deployable and flexible manufacturing facility for pharmaceutical and other technology applications; the development of a Refined Fuel truck with integrated Auxiliary Power Unit designed to improve fuel efficiency and prolong the useful operating life of fuel delivery vehicles; introduction of a prototype Side Impact Guard (SIG) designed to prevent passenger car under ride in side collisions, introduction of advanced materials to remove over 300 pounds from the standard Dry Van; introduction of RIG-16 offset rear under ride guard, and the introduction of the Truck Body line leveraging our fleet-proven DuraPlate® technology for dry truck bodies as well as the introduction of a revolutionary proprietary composite designed to improve weight and thermal efficiency in refrigerated truck body applications. We will also be introducing a new modified core DuraPlate to remove 300 pounds from a dry van trailer in 2018. This will allow us to continue providing unrivaled value to our customers and differentiate Wabash from our competitors.
 

· | Significant Market Share and Brand Recognition – We have been one of the three largest manufacturers of trailers in North America since 1994, with one of the most widely recognized brands in the industry. We are currently one of the largest producers of van trailers in North America and, according to data published by Trailer Body Builders Magazine, our Transcraft subsidiary is one of the leading producers of platform trailers. We are also the largest manufacturer of liquid stainless steel and aluminum tank trailers in North America through our Walker Transport, Brenner® Tank, Bulk International and Beall® brands. In addition, we are the second largest manufacturer of truck bodies in North America through our Supreme, Iner-City®, Spartan, and Kold King® brands.

--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Regulation 
 
Truck trailer length, height, width, maximum weight capacity and other specifications are regulated by individual states. The federal government also regulates certain safety and environmental sustainability features incorporated in the design and use of truck and tank trailers, as well as truck bodies. These regulations include, requirements to install Electronic Logging Devices, the use of aerodynamic devices and fuel saving technologies, as well as operator restrictions as to hours of service and minimum driver safety standards (see the section on “Industry Trends” in Item 7 for more details on these regulations). In addition, most tank trailers we manufacture have specific federal regulations and restrictions that dictate tank design, material type and thickness. Manufacturing operations are subject to environmental laws enforced by federal, state and local agencies (see "Environmental Matters").

Marketing and Distribution 
 
We market and distribute our products through the following channels:
 

· | Factory direct accounts; and
--+-----------------------------


· | Independent dealerships.
--+-------------------------

 
Factory direct accounts are generally large fleets that are high volume purchasers. Historically, we have focused on the factory direct market in which customers are highly knowledgeable of the life-cycle costs of equipment and, therefore, are best equipped to appreciate the innovative design and value-added features of our products, as well as the value proposition for lower total cost of ownership over the lifecycle of our products.
 
We also sell our van trailers through a network of 27 independent dealers with approximately 73 locations throughout North America. Our platform trailers are sold through 75 independent dealers with approximately 124 locations throughout North America. Our tank trailers are distributed through a network of 58 independent dealers with 59 locations throughout North America. Additionally, our truck body dealer network consists of more than 1,000 commercial dealers. Our dealers primarily serve mid-market and smaller sized carriers and private fleets in the geographic region where the dealer is located and occasionally may sell to large fleets. The dealers may also perform service and warranty work for our customers.
 
Raw Materials
 
We utilize a variety of raw materials and components including, specialty steel coil, stainless steel, plastic, aluminum, lumber, tires, landing gear, axles and suspensions, which we purchase from a limited number of suppliers. Costs of raw materials and component parts represented approximately 61%, 59%, and 63% of our consolidated net sales in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Raw material costs as a percentage of our consolidated net sales realized throughout 2017 are up compared to prior year as we have seen some increasing raw material costs. Significant price fluctuations or shortages in raw materials or finished components have had, and could have further, adverse effects on our results of operations. In 2018 and for the foreseeable future, we expect that the raw materials used in the greatest quantity will be steel, aluminum, plastic and wood. We will endeavor to pass along any raw material and component cost increases and, to minimize the effect of price fluctuations, we hedge certain commodities that have the potential to significantly impact our operations.

Certain U.S. patents relating to the combined use of DuraPlate® panels and logistics systems within the sidewalls of our dry van trailers will not expire until 2027 or after; several other issued U.S. patents and pending patent applications relating to the use of DuraPlate® panels, or other composite materials, within aerodynamic-related products as well as modular storage and shipping containers will not begin to expire until after 2030. Additionally, we also believe that our proprietary DuraPlate® production process, which has been developed and refined since 1995, offers us a significant competitive advantage in the industry – above and beyond the benefits provided by any patent protection concerning the use and/or design of our DuraPlate® products. We believe the proprietary knowledge of this process and the significant intellectual and capital hurdles in creating a similar production process provide us with an advantage over others in the industry who utilize composite sandwich panel technology.
 
Our intellectual property portfolio further includes a number of patent applications related to the manufacture of truck bodies and trailers using polymer composite component parts. These patent applications cover the polymer composite component structure and method of manufacturing the same. We believe the intellectual property related to this emerging use of polymer composite technology in our industry will offer us a significant market advantage to create proprietary products exploiting this technology. These patent applications will not begin to expire until 2036. Additionally, our intellectual property portfolio includes patent applications related to the rear impact guard (RIG) and to a side impact guard (SIG) of a trailer. The RIG patent applications include new RIG designs which surpass the current and proposed federal regulatory RIG standards for the U.S. and Canada while the SIG patent applications include new and innovative designs for effectively protecting against side underride.
 
In addition, our intellectual property portfolio includes patents and patent applications covering many of our engineered products, including our containment and isolation systems, as well as many trailer industry components. These products have become highly desirable and are recognized for their innovation in the markets we serve. The engineered products patents and patent applications relate to our industry leading isolation systems, sold under the Extract Technologies® brand name. These patents will not begin to expire until 2021. The patents and patent applications relating to our proprietary trailer-industry componentry include, for example, those covering the Trust Lock Plus® door locking mechanism, the Max Clearance® Overhead Door System, which provides additional overhead clearance when an overhead-style rear door is in the opened position that would be comparable to that of swing-door models, the use of bonded intermediate logistics strips, the bonded D-ring hold-down device, bonded skylights, and the DuraPlate® arched roof. The patents covering these products will not expire before 2029. Further, another patented product sold by the Diversified Products segment includes the ShakerTank® trailer, a vibrating bulk tank trailer used in transporting viscous materials, whose patents will not expire before 2026. We believe all of these proprietary products offer us a competitive market advantage in the industries in which we compete.
