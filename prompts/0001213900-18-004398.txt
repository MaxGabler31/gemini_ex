Micronet’s customers consist primarily of Application Service Providers, or ASPs, and solution providers specializing in the MRM market. These companies sell Micronet’s products as part of their MRM systems and solutions. Currently, Micronet does not sell directly to end users. Micronet customers are generally MRM solution and service providers, ASP providers in the transportation market, including long haul, local fleets’ student transportation (yellow busses) and fleet and field management systems for constructions and heavy equipment. Micronet products are used by customers worldwide. The United States currently constitutes its largest market, representing approximately 78% and 74% of revenue for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, Micronet’s three largest customers represented approximately 30%, 20% and 12% of Micronet’s revenues and 23%, 20% and 10% of the Company’s total revenues, respectively.
 
During 2017, no other customer accounted for more than 10% of Micronet’s revenue.
 
Enertec operates in the Aerospace & Defense markets and designs, develops, manufactures and supplies various customized military computer-based systems, simulators, automatic test equipment and electronic instruments. Enertec’s solutions and systems are designed according to major aerospace integrators’ requirements and market technological needs and are integrated by them into critical systems such as command and control, missile fire control, maintenance of military aircraft and missiles for use by the Israeli Air Force, Israeli Navy and by foreign defense entities.
 
On December 31, 2017, we, Enertec and our wholly owned subsidiary, Enertec Management Ltd., entered into a Share Purchase Agreement, or the Share Purchase Agreement, with Coolisys Technologies Inc., or Coolisys, a subsidiary of DPW Holdings, Inc., or DPW, pursuant to which we agreed to sell the entire share capital of Enertec to Coolisys. As consideration for the sale of Enertec’ entire share capital, Coolisys has agreed to pay at the closing of the transaction a purchase price of $5.25 million, of which $525,000 will be held in escrow for up to 14 months after the closing to satisfy certain potential indemnification claims, as well as assume up to $4 million of Enertec debt which consideration may be subject to certain adjustments set forth in the Share Purchase Agreement. Upon the signing of the Share Purchase Agreement, Coolisys agreed to deposit a termination fee of $300,000 into escrow to secure its obligations for closing. The parties’ obligations to consummate the closing are subject to the satisfaction of customary conditions precedent set forth in the Share Purchase Agreement on or before the later of (i) 60 days after the signing of the Share Purchase Agreement or (ii) 15 days after we deliver to Coolisys the audited balance sheet and the related audited consolidated cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2017 for Enertec, unless extended automatically by 30 days in accordance with the Share Purchase Agreement. We or Coolisys may terminate the Share Purchase Agreement if such conditions precedent were not completed within the aforementioned period. The Share Purchase Agreement contains customary representations and warranties by the parties.
 
In conjunction with, and as a condition to, the closing, we, Enertec, Coolisys, DPW and Mr. David Lucatz, our Chief Executive Officer, agreed to execute a consulting agreement, or the Consulting Agreement, whereby we, via Mr. Lucatz, will provide Enertec with certain consulting and transitional services over a 3 year period as necessary and requested by Coolisys (but in no event to exceed 20% of Mr. Lucatz’s time). Coolisys (via Enertec Systems) will pay us an annual consulting fee of $150,000 as well as issue us 150,000 restricted shares of DPW Class A common stock, or the DPW Equity, for such services, to be vested and released from restriction in three equal installments, with the initial installment vesting the day after the closing and the remaining installments vesting on each of the first 2 anniversaries of the closing. In the event of a change of control of the Company, or if Mr. Lucatz shall no longer be employed by us, the rights and obligations under the Consulting Agreement shall be assigned to Mr. Lucatz along with the DPW Equity.
 
To date, no closing for the sale of Enertec has taken place and we continue to operate Enertec in the normal course pending the closing of the Share Purchase Agreement.
 
Approximately 71% and 81% of Enertec’s revenues for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, were from independent business units or groups within Israeli Aerospace Industries Ltd., or IAI, the leading Israeli defense system integrator, and approximately 12% and 6%, respectively, were from Biosense Webster Ltd., a multi-national medical device company. We believe that these leading Israeli systems integrators (which consist of various and distinct business units or groups, each of which is a different potential customer) and the multi-national medical device company, diversify our business, markets and revenue streams. The system integrators that are our primary customers market their solutions throughout the world and across the full spectrum of military applications (land, sea and air). Command and control systems represented approximately 52% and 52% of Enertec’s revenues for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Management believes that the demand for our products, systems and solutions is not affected significantly by fluctuations in any particular geographic market outside the State of Israel because our products, systems and solutions can be tailored to fit the needs of these different disciplines and are not limited to any specific geographic region.
 
Our overall strategy focuses on continued internal growth through diligent efforts in our traditional growing markets with new technologies and innovative systems and products in the MRM market, as well as the development of new potential segments and markets. To enhance our growth, we also look for appropriate acquisitions to complement and expand our offerings, as well as support our goals and increase our competitive strengths. Currently, we concentrate the majority of our resources, including our marketing and sales efforts, in the United States and, Israeli and European markets.

Developments in the communication market in recent years have enabled Micronet to integrate its products into new standard technologies, which have reduced communication costs and extended availability, thereby increasing the demand for Micronet’s products and solutions. Micronet has made significant investments in its facilities, infrastructures and manufacturing capabilities and has made product enhancements and strengthened functionality.
 
On February 23, 2017, Micronet filed an immediate report with the TASE announcing that it had closed on a public offering of its ordinary shares and sold an aggregate of 6,100,000 shares of its ordinary shares for aggregate gross proceeds of 9,844,020 million NIS. As a result of the public offering, the Company’s ownership interest in Micronet was diluted from 62.9% to 49.31%. In order to maintain a controlling interest of Micronet, on February 27, 2017, the Company purchased an additional 140,000 shares of Micronet in a separate transaction with a shareholder of Micronet. In addition, on February 28, 2017, Mr. David Lucatz, our President and Chief Executive Officer, executed an irrevocable proxy assigning his voting power over 45,000 shares of Micronet for our benefit. As a result, our voting interest of Micronet was increased to 50.07% of the issued and outstanding shares of Micronet.
 
Market opportunity
 
We believe that Micronet is well positioned to pursue a substantial market opportunity. The MRM market, in which we operate through Micronet, is growing and is expected to continue its growth in the coming years. As indicated in market research reports, in the United States, which historically has been Micronet’s largest market, there are currently approximately 10 million units in service with MRM systems, and this number was projected to grow to approximately 12  million by the end of 2017. In 2016, the global penetration rate of MRM systems was approximately 13% and the global penetration rate was forecasted to grow to approximately 15% by the end of 2017. In the United States, market penetration was projected to grow from 27% in 2016 to almost 32% by the end of 2017. The U.S. Department of Transportation’s Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration, or the FMCSA, announced the adoption of the final rules and implementation schedule of its Electronic Logging Device mandate, or ELD mandate. The ELD mandate enables professional truck drivers and commercial motor carriers to track HOS compliance easily and efficiently. By 2019, truck drivers and carriers subject to the ELD mandate rules are required to use certified, registered Electronic Logging Devices (ELDs) that comply with the requirements of the ELD mandate. The ELD mandate requires interstate commercial truck and bus companies to use ELDs in their vehicles to record their compliance with the safety rules that govern the number of hours a driver can work. Full enforcement of the regulations commenced in 2017. With full implementation of the rules, we estimate the demand for our products will increase accordingly.

The ELD mandate is intended to help create a safer work environment for drivers, and make it easier, faster to accurately track, manage, and share records of duty status, or RODS, data. For carriers using automatic onboard recording devices, or AOBRDs, before the rule compliance date of December 18, 2017, the rule will replace AOBRDs with ELDs over a four-year implementation period. An ELD, among other things, synchronizes with a vehicle engine to automatically record driving time, for easier, more accurate HOS recording.
 
According to market estimations known to us, the number of electronic devices similar to those manufactured and marketed by Micronet which (i) are specifically intended for trucks use only and (ii) were installed following implementation of the first stage of the ELD mandate, amounted to 700,000 devices at the end of 2017. This reflects only 41% of the total estimated potential for that period which was approximately 1,700,000 devices.
 
Products and Services
 
Micronet currently offers various mobile and fix mounted computing tablets to the market, running on both Android and Microsoft operating systems. Micronet currently generates revenues primarily through the sale of its hardware products to service providers who sell those to end users.
 
Micronet continuously upgrades, enhances and improves its products and/or services. In 2016, Micronet launched the screenless SmartHub (formerly known as “TREQr5”), based on the Android operation system, which marks the entry into the car “black box” computer market and which Micronet believes may provide it with certain competitive advantages over the alternative offerings in the market in view of the fact that such products and services are based on the open platform that allows customers flexible integration with other software and services.
 
Also, during 2016, Micronet commenced an integration process with a certain a TSP according to which Micronet intends to provide third party telematics services such as HOS and commence evaluation of integrations with other TSPs, which will allow Micronet to provide its consumers with services such as driver recognition, identifying and preventing driver fatigue, recognizing driver behavior, preventive maintenance, fuel efficiency and an advance driver assistance system.
 
At the beginning of 2018, Micronet launched its new device under the SmarTab brand, which is a rugged tablet suitable for use under extreme environment conditions. This launch marks Micronet’s entry into the rugged tablet market, which is designed to provide customers a solution fit for the functional purpose of a mobile rugged product designed specifically for the vehicle environment and for continuous work outside the vehicle. This product will enable users to use various applications such as receipt of customers signatures on merchandise delivered, performance of activities outside of the vehicle by the technician using designated software, together with the use of the device for fleet management purposes.
 
Strategy
 
Micronet’s strategy focuses on three major vertical markets: (1) traditional long haul, (2) local fleets and (3) heavy equipment. In each vertical market, we implement the delivery of a comprehensive product offering that satisfies the particular needs of that market, and target potentially larger scale transactions that we expect could result in higher revenue as well as increased gross margin and overall profitability. Micronet continuously analyzes the needs of the markets in which it operates in order to best serve its customers’ needs. Micronet’s strategy is driven by, and focused on, both continued internal growth of its business through gaining a larger market share and the development of new potential markets, new technologies and innovative systems and products as well as through acquisitions.
 
Key elements of Micronet’s strategy include:
 

● | Continuing to invest efforts in its technology and product development, through collaborations with its partners, customers and potential customers;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Following certain enhancements in its manufacturing and production capabilities, Micronet has excess manufacturing capacity and has the ability to meet current or foreseeable manufacturing needs without making any significant investments. Implemented enhancements include:
 

● | upgraded production and assembly line and purchased new machinery with significant higher component implementation scale;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | increased factory facilities and upgraded various infrastructures;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------


● | entered into agreements with subcontractors in the field that operate additional manufacturing facilities, and have significant procurement and manufacturing capabilities and resources that are available to Micronet;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Certified subcontractors to perform manufacturing process to ensure flexible manufacturing infrastructures and deployment that can be used for disaster recovery scenarios or rapid increase in production needs.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
If additional manufacturing resources are needed to meet increased demand for Micronet’s products, manufacturing capacity can be enhanced by outsourcing manufacturing processes, recruiting and training additional employees, adding shifts to the labor cycle and purchasing additional manufacturing equipment and machinery or other required infrastructures.
 
Intellectual Property
 
Proprietary rights are important to Micronet’s business because its ability to remain competitive in the market is dependent to a significant degree on its proprietary solutions and products and the technology on which they are based. To protect its proprietary rights, Micronet primarily relies on a combination of copyright and trade secret laws, internal know-how, and agreements with third parties, such as license agreements. In addition, Micronet employs internal controls such as the use of confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements. Micronet believes its proprietary technology incorporates processes, know-how, methods, algorithms, hardware and software that are the result of more than 20 years of experience and in-house expertise and thus are not easily copied.

There is a significant amount of litigation with respect to intellectual property in the industry in which Micronet operates. Micronet has not, to date, been the subject of any claims or proceedings with regards to infringement of third party’s proprietary rights and it believes that its products, solutions and services do not violate or infringe any third party’s intellectual property rights. In light of the strong competition in the industry and the innovative solutions and technologies incorporated by Micronet into its recent products, Micronet has been exploring the use of patent applications and is in the process of filing certain patent applications related to its products in the United States, solutions and proprietary technologies. These patents, to the extent granted, are expected to assist Micronet to maintain its technological and competitive position in the market.
 
Micronet’s management, together with its research and development team, monitor closely and continuously all technological developments in the market. Micronet considers and evaluates on an ad hoc basis whether technology and proprietary assets should be acquired through independent in-house development or through the purchase of patents or other technological licenses. Where the purchase of third party proprietary technology, solution or products is required and can be of advantage to its business, Micronet would purchase a license and pay appropriate royalties or license fees. Micronet currently has all third-party licenses or is in the process of acquiring licenses that it believes are necessary to maintain and develop its business.
 
Government Regulation
 
Micronet’s business is subject to certain international standards such as U.S. Federal Communications Commission, or FCC, Part 15B, FCC ID, CE and Restriction of Hazardous Substances, or RoHS, which define compatibility of interface and telecommunications standards to those implemented in Europe by the European Commission and in the United States by the FCC. Its solutions and products also comply with the E-Mark European standard, which is the standard that defines the compatibility of interface and telecommunications to all appliances installed in and around an automobile.

Marketing strategies
 
Our sales and marketing efforts are focused on developing new business opportunities as well as generating follow-on sales from our existing customers. Our sales efforts in view of our products,  solutions and services are generated primarily through our internal sales team, although we also retain third-party global selling agents from time to time. Various members of our senior management also serve as effective sales representatives who contribute to the generation of military and corporate business due to their long-standing customer relationships with leading industry integrators and knowledge of our customers’ mission-critical technologies, requirements and needed solutions. We continue to explore various Israeli and international business partnerships to increase our sales and market penetration. We actively participate in trade shows involving technology and electronics defense operations.  Additionally, our business development efforts include our website, preparation and distribution of marketing materials, advertising directed toward the defense and homeland security market and product demonstrations.
 
Our strategy is to anticipate the needs of our clients, the relevant demand and needs in our market niches, to make investments in research and development (including developing know-how, capable manpower) and initiate the development of those products and solutions that we believe will meet the market and customers’ needs best. By doing so, we shorten our time to market, improve our market position from a technology perspective, and gain an edge on our competition. Furthermore, we have been able to identify those current and potential clients that we believe are likely to place large orders, and we focus our attention on developing our relationship with them. When successful, we are in an excellent position to offer both basic and advanced, sophisticated products enabling us to expand our relationship with these clients and resulting in additional revenue streams. In these cases, deepening our relationship with our clients creates the opportunity to incorporate our solutions into our customers’ core components and critical systems.
 
By continuously diversifying into new and more complex products and fully scaled systems, we have been able to set Enertec apart from its competition. We also continue to increase our suite of custom products based on our proprietary designs and technologies. These products are core components of several long-term military programs spearheaded by our customers, which historically have expected purchase lifecycles over periods of up to 10 years. In addition, we have been recognized as a certified supplier for the U.S. Department of Defense and for the North Atlantic Treaty Organization alliance countries. We are currently in the midst of our marketing and sales efforts to promote our product offerings with major U.S. defense organizations.
 
Enertec’s strategy is driven and focused on continued internal growth through diligent efforts in its traditional growing markets with new technologies and innovative systems and products as well as the development of new potential segments and markets. Concurrent with its efforts to grow organically and in line with its strategy, it may seek acquisitions that will complement and expand Enertec’s product offerings and markets and increase its competitiveness. 
 
To help achieve its internal growth, Enertec has expanded its production capacity and facilities and continually improved and upgraded its workforce. The main current segments of the markets in which Enertec focuses its resources are the aerospace and defense and medical instruments fields. Territory-wise most of the activities exist in the Israeli domestic defense market which exports its systems worldwide.
 
Customers
 
Enertec’s customers are primarily leading Israeli defense system integrators. The system integrators’ customers are the Israeli Ministry of Defense and other ministries of defense worldwide. The balance of our sales is made directly to the Israeli defense and armed forces (mainly the IDF) that place direct orders.
 
As of December 31, 2017, approximately 75% of Enertec’s annual revenues were from independent business units or groups within Rafael and the IAI, the two leading Israeli defense system integrators, as compared to 86% at December 31, 2016. These leading Israeli system integrators (which consist of various and distinct business units or groups, each of which is a different potential customer) create diversity to our business, markets and revenue streams In addition, during 2017, Enertec also continued to expand its offering of fully automated testing system for the calibration of medical devices, with such sales accounting for 12% of Enertec’s revenues for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to 3% for the year ended December 31, 2016.
 
The system integrators that are our primary customers market their solutions throughout the world and across the full spectrum of military applications (land, sea and air). Management believes that the demand for our products, systems and solutions is not affected significantly by fluctuations in any particular geographic market outside the State of Israel because our products, systems and solutions can be tailored to fit the needs of these different disciplines and are not limited to any specific geographic region.

Backlog
 
As of December 31, 2017, Enertec had a backlog of orders for our systems, products and services in the amount of approximately $8.4 million, which are orders that can be exercised from time to time but are an obligation of ours for the entire amount). As of December 31, 2016, Enertec had a backlog of orders for our systems, products and services in the amount of approximately $7.9 million (including $1.5 million in framework orders).
Competition
 
The defense market in which we operate through Enertec is fractured, intensely competitive and our main competition comes from customers’  internal development and manufacturing divisions and a number of relatively small private Israeli companies that specialize in electronic systems. This intensely competitive market is characterized by rapidly changing technologies, evolving industry standards, frequent new product introductions and changes in customer requirements. In order to maintain our competitive strength, we must continue to develop and introduce on a timely and cost-effective basis, new products and product features which are in line with the technological developments and emerging industry standards.
Suppliers
 
Our suppliers are diversified, and we are not dependent upon a limited number of suppliers for essential raw materials, components, services or other items. In order for us to maintain the standards required by our customers, we require that our suppliers be well-established, with facilities and manufacturing capabilities that comply with our relevant standards. Although we are not dependent on any one supplier, disruptions in normal business arrangements due to the loss of one or a few suppliers could adversely affect us. Disruptions also may be experienced if our existing suppliers are no longer able to meet our requirements or if there is an industry shortage of electronic or mechanical components. Not only could these disruptions limit our production capacity, but also, if there is a shortage of components, such disruption could result in higher costs. The raw materials we use are either electronic components purchased from suppliers, or mechanical components primarily manufactured by local subcontractors.
Employees
 
As of December 31, 2017, we had approximately 82 full-time employees at Enertec and 4 full-time employees at Enertec Electronics. Of these employees, 70 are employed in engineering and manufacturing positions, and the remainder are employed in sales, management and administrative positions. Our employees are not represented by any collective bargaining agreement, and we have never experienced a work stoppage. We believe we have good relations with our employees.
 
Israeli labor laws and regulations apply to all employees based in Israel. The laws principally cover matters such as paid vacation, paid sick days, length of the workday, payment for overtime and severance payments upon the retirement or death of an employee or termination of employment under specified circumstances. The severance payments may be funded, in whole or in part, through a managers’ insurance fund or a pension fund. The payments to the managers’ insurance fund or pension fund toward severance amount to 8.3% of wages. Furthermore, Israeli employees and employers are required to pay predetermined sums to the National Insurance Institute of Israel. Since January 1, 1995, these amounts also include payments for health insurance.
 
Research and development expenditures
 
Research and development costs totaled approximately $672,000 and $518,000 for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, which equates to approximately 10% and 5% of Enertec’s revenues during these years, respectively. These expenditures have adequately satisfied our research and development requirements. We are using our engineering resources to research and design new technologies, products and solutions that we expect to implement into the new projects and large military programs of our core customers.

Intellectual property
 
Although we are not dependent on patents or trademark protection with regard to Enertec’s business and do not expect to be at any time in the future, proprietary rights and unique know-how are important to Enertec’s business because its ability to remain competitive in the market is dependent to a significant degree on its proprietary solutions and the technologies on which they are based. Enertec develops systems, products and solutions for its clients on a “work for hire” basis. Although, Enertec does not claim any rights in the products or services that it provides, its proprietary modules and subsystems play an integral and significant part in the development of the solutions, systems, products and services that it ultimately delivers. To protect its proprietary rights in these modules and subsystems, Enertec primarily relies on a combination of copyright and trade secret laws, internal knowledge and know-how, technological innovations and agreements with third parties, such as license agreements. In addition, Enertec employs internal controls such as the use of confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements. Enertec believes its proprietary technology incorporates processes, know-how, methods, algorithms, hardware and software that are the result of more than ten years of experience resulting in in-house expertise and thus are not easily copied. Further, most of the production process is performed in-house with the exception of certain components that are manufactured by subcontractors. This limited outsourcing process allows Enertec to maintain the majority of its proprietary information and know-how within the Company and lowers its exposure to the risk of its technology solutions being copied or used by any third parties.
 
Enertec’s management, together with its research and development team, closely and continuously monitors the technological developments in the market. Enertec considers and evaluates on an ad hoc basis whether technology and proprietary assets should be acquired through independent in-house development or through the purchase of patent or other technology licenses.
 
Regulation
 
Enertec’s electronic products must comply with the Underwriters Laboratories, or UL, standards, of the United States and the Conformité Européenne, or CE, standards of Europe to be eligible for sale in the respective countries subject to these standards. Each system must be tested, qualified and labeled under the relevant standards. This is a complicated and expensive process and once completed, the approved product may not be altered for sale.
