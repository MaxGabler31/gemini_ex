 Overview of Chapter 11 Bankruptcy of the Debtors and Liquidating Trust Agreement 
 On September 26, 2008 (the Petition Date), the Debtors filed voluntary petitions for relief under chapter 11 of title 11 of the United States Code (the Bankruptcy Code) in the Bankruptcy Court (Case No.08-12229 (MFW)) after the Director of the Office of Thrift Supervision appointed the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the FDIC) as receiver for Washington Mutual Bank (WMB), a subsidiary of WMI, and advised WMI that the receiver was immediately taking possession of WMBs assets. Immediately after its appointment as receiver, the FDIC sold substantially all the assets of WMB, including the stock of WMB fsb, to JPMorgan Chase Bank, National Association (JPMC), pursuant to that certain Purchase and Assumption Agreement, Whole Bank, dated September 25, 2008 (as amended, modified or supplemented, the Purchase and Assumption Agreement). 
 On December 12, 2011, the Debtors filed with the Bankruptcy Court the Seventh Amended Joint Plan of Affiliated Debtors Pursuant to Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code (the Filed Plan) and a related disclosure statement (the Disclosure Statement). The Filed Plan was subsequently amended by the Modification of Seventh Amended Plan, dated January 9, 2012, the Second Modification of Seventh Amended Plan, dated January 12, 2012, and the Third Modification of Seventh Amended Plan, dated February 16, 2012 (the Filed Plan, along with all modifications, the Plan). The Plan provides for, among other things, the formation of the Trust. 
 On February 24, 2012, the Bankruptcy Court entered an order confirming the Plan (the Confirmation Order). The Plan, the Disclosure Statement and the Confirmation Order have previously been filed with the SEC and are incorporated herein by reference. 
 On March 6, 2012, (a) the Trust was formed when, pursuant to the Plan, the Debtors entered into the Trust Agreement with the Liquidating Trustee and the Resident Trustee, and (b) the initial members of the Trusts advisory board (the Trust Advisory Board or TAB) were appointed. The TAB is responsible for approving certain decisions of the Liquidating Trustee subject to and as further described in the Trust Agreement. The Trust Agreement has previously been filed with the SEC and is incorporated herein by reference. 
 On the Effective Date, the Plan became effective and a notice of the Effective Date of the Plan was filed with the Bankruptcy Court. Reorganized WMI, as a successor of WMI, filed a Form 8-K with the SEC on March 23, 2012 disclosing, among other things, (a) the occurrence of the Effective Date and the emergence of Reorganized WMI from the Debtors chapter 11 case, (b) the transfer of certain of the Debtors assets to the Trust, as further described below (which assets are referred to herein as the Liquidating Trust Assets), (c) the cancellation of WMIs existing equity interests, (d) the amendment of Reorganized WMIs articles of incorporation and bylaws, and (e) the issuance by Reorganized WMI of 200,000,000 shares of new common stock to (A) holders of certain allowed claims against, or former equity interests in, the Debtors, and (B) a disputed equity escrow that is administered by the Liquidating Trustee as escrow agent (the Disputed Equity Escrow). 
 The Trust is a successor-in-interest to the Debtors for certain limited purposes and, as such, is responsible for future reporting to the Bankruptcy Court with respect to the Debtors chapter 11 cases. Such reporting obligations include the filing of QSRs with the Bankruptcy Court, which reports are prepared by the Trust for the purpose of complying with the quarterly operating guidelines as described in the Chapter 11 Trustee Handbook, United States Department of Justice, May 2004, in accordance with 28 U.S.C. §1746(2). The QSRs are also filed by the Trust with the SEC under cover of Form 8-K. In addition to the foregoing, from and after the Effective Date, the Trust has reported other material events on a timely basis as they occurred pursuant to Form 8-Ks filed with the SEC. 
 On or shortly after the Effective Date, the Liquidating Trust Assets were transferred to the Trust pursuant to the Plan for the benefit of certain holders of claims against, or equity interests in, the Debtors (the Trust Beneficiaries). Trust Beneficiaries who were projected to receive value on account of their Allowed Claims (as defined in the Plan) against the Debtors have been issued LTIs evidencing 
 
2 


  their right to receive distributions from the Trust if and to the extent sufficient cash is available with respect thereto. If and when distributions from the Trust become available to Trust Beneficiaries who have not received LTIs to date, additional LTIs will be issued to such Trust Beneficiaries in accordance with the Plan and the distribution priorities that are summarized in Annex C of the Trust Agreement. 
 The Liquidating Trust Assets consisted of all of the assets of the Debtors as of the Effective Date (for a current description of the assets, see Part II, Item 7, Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included herein), other than: 
 

 | assets distributed to JPMC pursuant to that certain Second Amended and Restated Settlement Agreement, dated February 7, 2011, by and among the Debtors, the FDIC, JPMC, and the other parties thereto (the Global Settlement Agreement or GSA);

 | WMIs equity interests in (i) Investment (all the assets of which were contributed to the Trust or were transferred to JPMC pursuant to the Global Settlement Agreement), (ii) WM Mortgage Reinsurance Company, Inc. (WMMRC), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Reorganized WMI, and (iii) WMB (substantially all of whose assets were sold to JPMC on September 25, 2008, pursuant to the Purchase and Assumption Agreement, and whose stock was abandoned by WMI shortly before the Effective Date);
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | $4.7 billion (as of the Effective Date) of net operating losses of the Debtors;

--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | cash necessary to pay the fees and expenses owed to certain creditors professionals;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | cash necessary to reimburse the Debtors for fees and expenses incurred in connection with initial distributions made by the Debtors as disbursing agent under the Plan;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | the economic interest retained by the Debtors in certain litigation proceeds; and

 Unless stated otherwise, any financial information contained in this Form 10-K uses approximate dollar amounts due to rounding. 
 The sole purpose of the Trust is to hold, manage and administer the Liquidating Trust Assets and distribute the proceeds thereof, if any, to LTI holders. The Trust will not, at any time, engage in the conduct of any trade or business other than the liquidation and distribution of the Liquidating Trust Assets, and is intended to qualify as a liquidating trust for U.S. federal income tax purposes as further discussed below under U.S. Federal Income Tax Treatment. 
 Pursuant to an order of the Bankruptcy Court dated, January 23, 2015, the Trusts initial term of three (3) years was extended for up to three (3) additional years. However, administration of the Trust was not complete, with claims remaining to be reconciled and certain assets remaining to be collected. Accordingly, the Trust filed a request with the Internal Revenue Service and on November 21, 2017, the IRS notified the Trust that extension of the Trusts term will not adversely affect the determination that the Trust is a liquidating trust and ruled that the term of the Trust may be extended up to an additional three (3) years. As a result, the term of the Trust may run through March 19, 2021 (unless dissolved earlier or otherwise extended). Thereupon the Trust filed a corresponding motion with the Bankruptcy Court to extend the term of the Trust to such date. On December 20, 2017, and without objection from any party, the Bankruptcy Court approved the motion to extend the term of the Trust. 
 LTIs are not transferable except by will, intestate succession or operation of law. 
 Period from Effective Date through December 31, 2018 and Recent Developments 
 Initial Distribution 
 The Plan and Global Settlement Agreement became effective on the Effective Date. On or about the Effective Date, the Debtors distributed $6.5 billion of cash to creditors with Allowed Claims (Initial Distribution). The assets transferred to the Trust on or about the Effective Date included $725.8 million of cash and cash equivalents for the Disputed Claims Reserve (as defined below), which represented cash that would have been distributed to holders of claims as part of the Initial Distribution had such claims been allowed as of the Effective Date.

 Distributions 
 The proceeds in excess of expenses and liabilities that are obtained during the life of the Trust will be distributed to LTI holders in accordance with the distribution procedures and priorities set forth in the Plan and Annex C of the Trust Agreement. These distribution procedures include a reserve mechanism (the Disputed Claims Reserve or DCR) to allow for the resolution of claims that are disputed, in whole or in part, as of the Effective Date (or as amended and reinstated after the Effective Date by order of the Bankruptcy Court) and the issuance of LTIs in respect thereof if and when such claims are allowed. 
 Subject to certain limited exceptions as set forth in the Trust Agreement, the Liquidating Trustee is required to distribute to LTI holders on account of their LTIs, on each Distribution Date (as defined below), all cash then on hand, except (i) an amount of the Liquidating Trust Assets set aside to fund the Trusts activities (the Funding), which amount was $60 million as of the Effective Date, and, out of which, $20 million as of the Effective Date (the Litigation Funding) was allocated to, and set aside in a reserve (the Litigation Reserve), the Litigation Subcommittee (the Litigation Subcommittee), a subcommittee of the TAB, to be used for the prosecution of Recovery Claims (as defined below), (ii) such other amounts as are retained on account of any remaining disputed claims in the Disputed Claims Reserve, and (iii) after taking into account the Funding, such additional amounts (A) as are reasonably necessary to meet contingent liabilities and to maintain the value of the Liquidating Trust Assets pending their liquidation during the term of the Trust, (B) as are necessary to pay reasonably incurred or anticipated expenses (including, but not limited to, any taxes imposed on or payable by the Debtors or the Trust or in respect of the Liquidating Trust Assets), or (C) as are necessary to satisfy other liabilities incurred or anticipated by the Trust in accordance with the Plan, the Global Settlement Agreement, or the Trust Agreement. Provided the applicable conditions as set forth in the Trust Agreement with respect to the making of a distribution have been satisfied, Distribution Date is defined in the Trust Agreement to mean the first day of the second month in each fiscal quarter during the term of the Trust or such other dates that the Liquidating Trustee determines, in consultation with the TAB, are appropriate from time to time provided that there is at least one such date in each fiscal quarter during the term of the Trust. Subject to the exculpation and release provisions of the Plan, the term Recovery Claims is defined collectively in the Trust Agreement to mean (x) claims against present and former officers and directors of the Debtors for actions arising during the period prior to the Petition Date, (y) claims against professionals and representatives retained by the Debtors with respect to conduct that occurred prior to the Petition Date, and (z) claims based on conduct that occurred prior to the Petition Date against third-parties for any non-contractual breach of duty to WMI, including, but not limited to, antitrust claims and business tort claims. For a discussion of current legal proceedings, see Part I, Item 3 (a) Material Legal Proceedings. 1

U.S. Federal Income Tax Treatment 
 The Trust, as a liquidating trust, is intended to qualify as a grantor trust for U.S. federal income tax purposes other than as discussed below with respect to the DCR portion of the Trust. A grantor trust, as a pass-through entity, is generally not treated as a separate taxpaying entity and, as such, it is not anticipated that the Trust will be subject to U.S. federal income taxation other than as discussed below with respect to the DCR portion of the Trust. 
 Instead, each LTI holder is treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a direct owner of an indivisible portion of the underlying assets of the Trust (other than those held on account of disputed claims in the DCR) reflective of its relative economic interest in the Trust. Accordingly, each LTI holder is taxed as if directly receiving any income, gain, deduction or loss with respect to its portion of the underlying assets of the Trust, regardless of whether a contemporaneous or commensurate cash distribution is made to the holder by the Trust. 
 The Trust will provide a beneficiary tax information letter to LTI holders with tax information for their 2018 tax returns on or about April 1, 2019. LTI holders are urged to consult their own tax advisors as to their own filing requirements and the appropriate tax reporting of this information on their returns. 
 Pursuant to the Plan and the Trust Agreement, the Liquidating Trustee (A) treats the DCR as a disputed ownership fund governed by Treasury Regulation section 1.468B-9, and (B) to the extent permitted by applicable law, reports consistently with the foregoing for state and local income tax purposes. Accordingly, the DCR is a separate taxable entity for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and all distributions from such reserve are taxable to such reserve as if sold at fair market value. Any distributions from the DCR will be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as if received directly by the recipient from the Debtors on the original claim or equity interest of such recipient. 
 Pursuant to an order of the Bankruptcy Court dated, January 23, 2015, the Trusts initial term of three (3) years was extended for up to three (3) additional years. However, administration of the Trust was not complete, with claims remaining to be reconciled and certain assets remaining to be collected. Accordingly, the Trust filed a request with the Internal Revenue Service and on November 21, 2017, the IRS notified the Trust that extension of the Trusts term will not adversely affect the determination that the Trust is a liquidating trust and ruled that the term of the Trust may be extended up to an additional three years. As a result, the term of the Trust may run through March 19, 2021 (unless dissolved earlier or otherwise extended). Thereupon the Trust filed a corresponding motion with the Bankruptcy Court to extend the term of the Trust to such date. On December 20, 2017, and without objection from any party, the Bankruptcy Court approved the motion to extend the term of the Trust. 
 Further information regarding certain U.S. federal income tax considerations associated with the Liquidating Trust and the implementation of the Plan is set forth in Part IX of the Disclosure Statement.
