ITEM 1. BUSINESS
 
GAN Limited is a Bermuda exempted holding company and through its subsidiaries, consists of two lines of business. We are a business-to-business (“B2B”) supplier of enterprise Software-as-a-Service (“SaaS”) solutions for online casino gaming, commonly referred to as iGaming, and online sports betting applications. Beginning with our acquisition of Coolbet in January 2021, we are also a business-to-consumer (“B2C”) developer and operator of an online sports betting and casino platform, which offers individuals located in select markets in Northern Europe, Latin America and Canada access to a digital portal for engaging in sports betting, online casino games and poker.
 
In our B2B segment, we feature our technology platform, which we market as the GameSTACK™ internet gaming platform (“GameSTACK”). Our GameSTACK platform and related support services are geared towards casino operators, with an emphasis on land-based commercial and tribal casinos in the United States, although we have deployed our platform in other geographies such as the United Kingdom, Italy, and Australia and are currently preparing to deploy in Canada. We also market our platform to gaming partners, such as online sportsbooks and gaming content developers, who provide us with an indirect channel into casino operators. This segment is primarily focused on enabling the U.S. casino industry’s ongoing digital transformation, which is accelerating following the repeal of a federal ban on sports betting in May 2018. Our customers rely on our platform to run their online casinos and sportsbooks legally, profitably and with engaging content. GameSTACK enables us to offer a turnkey technology solution for regulated real money internet gambling (“real money iGaming” or “RMiG”), online sports betting and virtual simulated gaming (“simulated gaming” or “SIM”). In addition, we believe that our acquisition of Coolbet provides us with the opportunity to integrate proprietary online sports betting technology to enable us to offer a turnkey technology solution.
 
Our B2C segment commenced on January 1, 2021, when we completed the acquisition of Vincent Group p.l.c., a Malta public limited company doing business as “Coolbet.” This acquisition enabled us to operate a B2C casino and sports betting platform that is accessible for gambling through the website www.coolbet.com in markets across Northern Europe, Latin America and Canada. Coolbet.com launched in May 2016 and as of January 1, 2022, had over 790,000 registered customers. Coolbet holds gambling licenses in Estonia, Malta, Sweden, and Canada. The majority of Coolbet’s website traffic comes from mobile customers and each region features customized interfaces with localized product offerings and local language support teams. For 2021, our total B2C revenue was generated 53% from online casino games, 43% from online sports betting and 4% from online peer-to-peer poker. B2C revenue increased 121% from $35.5 million in 2020 to $78.6 million in 2021. Coolbet’s results of operations are included in our financial results beginning on January 1, 2021. In addition to providing complementary technology to our B2B segment, we believe our B2C segment provides diversification of revenue streams and growth opportunities in international markets.
 
Corporate History
 
We were an early pioneer of online gaming. We commenced operations in 2002 in the United Kingdom and first generated revenue in December 2002. Our initial product allowed end user residents of the United Kingdom to create an online account, deposit money into that account and to compete against each other online in competitions of skill. We offered online games of skill to residents of the United Kingdom under the operation of the United Kingdom’s applicable legislation, the Lotteries & Amusements Act 1976 (s.14), which permitted competitions of skill.
 
Beginning in 2004, we secured our first major customers in the United Kingdom and subsequently launched our first real money casino gambling games through a license procured from the United Kingdom Gambling Commission following the passage of the Gambling Act 2005 which permitted companies in the United Kingdom to develop software intended for enabling internet gambling. In 2008 we began securing our first major customers in Italy and deployed our technology platform in Rome, Italy and served internet gaming content to several major Italian operators of regulated internet sports betting and gaming.
 
In 2010 we released the first version of our GameSTACK enterprise software platform for our first platform customer to launch a new internet gambling business in Europe as a complement to existing retail bingo gaming business, and following the launch of an internet casino for a casino operator customer operating on the GameSTACK platform in the State of New Jersey in 2013, we were the first technology platform provider to accept and process a deposit online in the State of New Jersey and processed the first legal online bet on our proprietary blackjack game. Our casino operators have continued to rely on GameSTACK to launch their online casinos in new and existing U.S. states following applicable legislation.
 
In May 2020, GAN Limited completed a reorganization and share exchange pursuant to which we acquired all of the outstanding ordinary shares of GAN plc and became the parent company of GAN plc. Subsequently, GAN plc changed its name to GAN (UK) Limited. Additionally, in May 2020, we completed our U.S. initial public offering through which we sold an aggregate of 7,337,000 ordinary shares at a price per share of $8.50 and received gross proceeds of $62.4 million.

In November 2020, we entered into a share exchange agreement (the “Share Exchange Agreement”), pursuant to which we agreed to acquire all of the outstanding equity in Vincent Group p.l.c., a Malta public limited company doing business as “Coolbet” in exchange for cash and ordinary shares. In December 2020, we completed a secondary public offering, issuing 6,790,956 ordinary shares in exchange for net proceeds of $98.5 million after underwriting discounts and commissions, and other offering expenses. We used the proceeds from this offering to fund the cash portion of the purchase price payable to the former Coolbet shareholders. On January 1, 2021, we completed the acquisition of Coolbet for a total purchase price of $218.1 million, comprised of a cash payment of $111.1 million, the issuance of 5,260,516 ordinary shares (valued at $106.7 million) and the issuance of replacement equity awards (valued at $0.3 million).
 
iGaming and Online Sportsbook Industry and Background
 
On May 14, 2018, the Supreme Court of the United States overturned the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act (“PASPA”), which since 1992 had prevented U.S. states, aside from Nevada, Delaware and Oregon from engaging in the regulation and taxation of sports betting activities at the intrastate level. The ruling paved the way for U.S. states to elect individually whether to allow for regulated sports betting and, by extension, real money iGaming within their borders. Prior to the Supreme Court of the United States overturning PASPA, U.S. casino operators were largely limited to retail slot and table gaming operations and, in the online channel, to simulated gaming operations offering no prospect for real money winnings.
 
As of December 31, 2021, 32 U.S. states have approved legalized sports betting: Arizona, Arkansas, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Louisiana, Maryland, Michigan, Mississippi, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, North Dakota, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Tennessee, Virginia, Washington, West Virginia, Wisconsin and Wyoming, along with Washington D.C. Real money iGaming is also presently legal in seven states: Connecticut, Delaware, Michigan, Nevada, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and West Virginia. Each state has unique regulatory and licensure requirements, and our ability to rapidly customize deployments and submit expeditiously for individual state gaming licensure has been a vital contributor to our success in the U.S. market. We enable our customers to deploy iGaming and online sportsbook offerings to their end users quickly, capturing valuable early-mover advantages in their relevant markets, such as the January 2021 launch in Michigan. We are presently licensed or approved to operate our RMiG platform in New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Indiana, West Virginia, Colorado, Michigan, Tennessee, and Connecticut. We plan to continue to evaluate new opportunities to provide services in additional U.S. states and expect to expand in Canada and additional U.S. states, consisting of Mississippi and Arkansas in 2022 and beyond.
 
Online sports betting deployment models can vary widely due to state-specific regulatory and licensing mandates. However, licensed casino operators with land-based retail facilities tend to partner with online sportsbook operators in order to accelerate online customer acquisition. These operators generally rely on a technology platform, such as GameSTACK, for player onboarding, player account management, payment processing and various back-office tools designed to maintain regulatory compliance and real-time reporting. Additionally, our technology for online sportsbooks incorporates a sports betting engine for pricing, trade execution and risk management.
 
In order to monetize online and offline players in a coherent manner, casino operators pursue omnichannel marketing strategies that require deep integration of hardware and software elements, including computing infrastructure, customer relationship management, casino management system and loyalty program management. Because of the complexity in deploying and maintaining iGaming and online sports betting infrastructures, casino operators may rely on third-party service providers to operate and maintain all or part of the technology infrastructure on their behalf.

Our Operating Models
 
B2B
 
Our product strategy for GameSTACK is to provide a unified, flexible and highly scalable platform that can be rapidly deployed for SIM, RMiG, and online sports betting. In addition to our platform, we offer a range of development, marketing and customer support services designed to fast-track deployments and provide ongoing operational support following commercial launch.
 
Our GameSTACK platform and related support services are designed to help our customers rapidly launch and scale their iGaming and online sportsbook operations. Our iGaming offerings support both social, or “freemium,” simulated online casino gaming in regulated and unregulated markets as well as RMiG for deployment in regulated markets. We measure the level of player engagement through key performance measures including Gross Operator Revenue, which we define as the sum of our B2B corporate customers’ gross revenue from SIM, gross gaming revenue from RMiG, and gross sports win from sportsbook offerings, which we track for both SIM and RMiG operations. 
 
Our GameSTACK customer base in the United States includes large regional operators as well as individual tribal casino operators that, combined, operate over 100 retail casino properties, racetracks and online sportsbooks. Our customers in the United States that are outside of the states with regulated online casino or sports betting markets generally operate on our social casino or simulated gambling applications. The largest portion of our U.S. business is in real money internet gambling with operators in the U.S. states where either (or both) internet casino gaming and sports betting are permitted by regulation.
 
We believe there is a large and growing number of additional potential new customers for GameSTACK in selected U.S. states that have formally passed online sports betting but have not yet implemented a regulatory framework for governing online real money iGaming in these states. Also, we believe that as newly regulated U.S. states such as Michigan generate real tax revenue for their respective state treasuries that more states will evaluate, develop, and pass online gaming legislation. The Company has the unique ability to absorb and support this expansion. For example, in January 2021, we simultaneously launched three operators online in Michigan, including our existing customer, FanDuel Group Inc.’s (“FanDuel”) online casino and two new customers, Churchill Downs’ brand TwinSpires and Wynn Resorts’ WynnBET.
 
As of December 31, 2021, we have instances of GameSTACK deployed inside data centers located in Nevada, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Connecticut, West Virginia, Guernsey (U.K. Channel Islands) and Italy.
 
B2C
 
Our principal B2C offerings are real-money online sports betting, online casino and peer-to-peer poker. We offer these products directly to the end customer through our website, which is also available on tablet and mobile devices in markets predominantly across Northern Europe and Latin America. In order to attract and retain customers, we seek to provide a high-quality customer experience through a high speed mobile website, excellent customer service and attractive odds. With our own technology and sportsbook software, and in cooperation with recognized providers for odds data and game content, we strive to provide the best online sportsbook and iGaming offering available, and believe that positive word of mouth referrals allowed us to increase our revenues and acquire customers at a lower cost than our competitors.

Our Products and Service Offerings
 
B2B GameSTACK Platform, Development and Support Services
 
GameSTACK is a turnkey platform comprising proprietary enterprise software, computer hardware and specific proprietary software components such as our iSight Back Office tool (“iSight”) and the iBridge Framework. GameSTACK is a comprehensive proprietary software platform providing our customers with account set-up, customer services facilitation, comprehensive player marketing tools, and the ability to deliver converged gambling across land-based retail casinos and the internet. GameSTACK supports both real money and social casino offerings through a common code base and user interface, providing our SIM customers a path to rapid market entry into real money gambling. Our operator customers’ players also experience a consistent user experience throughout the evolution to permitted real money gambling. While SIM implementations of GameSTACK generate revenue for our customers, the SIM application is predominantly employed as a marketing platform by operators in anticipation of rolling out an RMiG offering.
 
While developing GameSTACK, we remained fully committed to building an evergreen and agile software architecture forged from a single code base, ensuring that developments in game mechanics, new back-office functionalities and integrations with leading third-party software could be capitalized on by our customers across all gameplay modalities. Importantly, we developed our code to operate in multiple jurisdictions and under different regulatory requirements, giving us the ability to leverage different configurations quickly to comply with newly regulated markets.
 
GameSTACK serves as the technical hub of our customers’ online gaming presence. The platform provides the foundational technology and back-office tools necessary for a successful consumer experience, including intuitive player account activation, sophisticated payment services, geolocation, marketing, loyalty club linking and real-time analytics and reporting. The core of the GameSTACK platform is its player account management system, in which highly sensitive consumer and player activity data is stored and processed. This information is the layer of any casino operator’s online technology deployment that becomes the focal point of regulatory licensure since it is the fortified vault of player data and privacy. We are the trusted custodian of player transactional data and provide direct visibility into wagering activity, which allows us to deploy proprietary player analysis models to assist our casino operator customers in predicting and identifying, over time, their highest-value players. Our casino operator customers can rely on our data models to best direct their retention marketing investments towards specific customer profiles, thereby optimizing player loyalty and therefore player value. GameSTACK also relies on a flexible integration services layer in order to integrate easily with other essential third-party systems such as casino management systems, remote gaming servers, sports betting engines, and marketing services applications.
 
Real Money iGaming
 
Our RMiG instances of GameSTACK incorporate comprehensive player registration, account funding and back-office accounting and management tools that enable our casino operator customers to efficiently, confidently and effectively extend their presence online. For the individual players, our software enables them to create a regulatory-compliant iGaming account online, have their credentials properly validated in order to activate their account, deposit money into their account and proceed to wager that money on any content we provide on the relevant casino operator’s website or mobile app. The online content may comprise a casino game such as roulette, blackjack or a casino slot machine game. Content may also comprise a myriad of sporting events on which the diverse outcomes can be wagered on.
 
We have optimized GameSTACK for RMiG, and in particular, U.S. internet casino gaming with geolocation tracking, Know-Your-Customer processes and a market-leading U.S. payments platform. Payment aggregation services within GameSTACK integrate with a wide range of third-party payment processors while simultaneously allowing our casino operators to accept cash deposits onsite within their retail casino properties, which are credited to the players’ online account.

Our RMiG instances of GameSTACK augment our SIM product to further incorporate more comprehensive player registration, account funding and back-office accounting and management tools. In the United States, real money iGaming applications must comply with the Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act of 2006 and with the federal Wire Act of 1961. Consequently, our RMiG customers must physically deploy our platform within their state’s borders, typically inside their retail casino premises in order to comply with intrastate regulatory mandates. Our customers generally procure the computer hardware on which our software is deployed inside of our customers’ data centers.
 
Simulated Gaming
 
Our SIM product is custom-designed for the U.S. casino operators seeking to bring their retail brand online and create a new internet gaming experience delivered as an amenity to their players and leveraging their on-property rewards program.
 
For SIM implementations, we design the casino operator’s mobile application and website with a branded experience that is consistent with the casino operator’s brand and market positioning. Our iSight technology provides management tools and streamlines player registration and account funding. We generally host our customers’ SIM operations on a combination of proprietary and cloud servers. GameSTACK features a gaming content engine that serves both internally developed slot and table games as well as third-party gaming content through a technical ‘abstraction layer’ that permits third-party games to be published to end user players through GameSTACK. SIM deployments of GameSTACK allow casino operators to put their offers, games and unique brand experience in their players’ hands 24/7. GameSTACK incorporates our proprietary iSight technology, which captures online player activity, giving marketers the equivalent visibility of 100% rated play.
 
Online Sportsbook
 
For online sports betting applications, we integrate our RMiG version of GameSTACK with third-party services such as sports betting engines and the sportsbook operator’s user interface and user experience. To date, we have integrated sports betting engines for customers at their request, including IGT Sports, Kambi and Amelco.
 
GAN Sports
 
GAN Sports, our newest product offering following the acquisition of Coolbet, will be offered as an online and retail solution to U.S. casino operators as a complete turnkey solution across future regulated states, or as a replacement to existing sports betting technology currently relied on by operators. The GAN Sports retail solution will allow our customers to launch and operate their sportsbooks on their properties, with the ability to add an on-premise mobile platform delivered through self-service kiosk technology to prepare for statewide mobile sports betting.
 
Super Remote Gaming Server
 
GameSTACK may also be configured as a “super” remote gaming server (“Super RGS”), otherwise known as a remote gaming server aggregator, which can be deployed on behalf of existing internet casino operators in various U.S. states that are operating on their own proprietary or third-party platform. Super RGS provides these operators with access to all of our proprietary games, our current (and all future) remote gaming server integrations, as well as our content library of more than 1,000 internet casino games. Super RGS creates a technical and commercial vehicle for us to deliver our proprietary casino content and third-party game content across the entirety of the relevant U.S. intrastate markets. Our Super RGS provides for a cost and time savings for new and existing market operators to more efficiently manage their game content.

iSight Back Office
 
GameSTACK provides operators with a range of day-to-day back-office management tools along with integration application program interfaces for third-party casino management systems. With the iSight management tool, our casino operators have complete control over their content selection, player communications, website layout, process automation and real-time analytics.
 
iBridge Framework
 
Our proprietary iBridge Framework is a core feature of our platform, enabling operators to engage online players with innovative loyalty offers. iBridge provides our operator customers the ability to automatically verify whether a new online player is part of an existing offline loyalty database. iBridge allows operators to unite in-casino complimentary items and services, loyalty points and other offers with online play. This enables casino operators to engage their customers online, reinforcing brand loyalty, as well as encouraging online players to visit retail properties. Our platform integrates with a variety of third-party casino management systems, eliminating the need for operators to create and maintain two disparate databases as their online businesses grows.
 
Data Analytics
 
Because we are the trusted custodian of our customers’ end user players’ aggregated and anonymized transactional data originated and stored within our platform, we have direct visibility into a players’ activity and can predict which characteristics will contribute to a player becoming amongst the highest-value players of our customers over time. This helps our customers to direct their retention marketing investments to specific player profiles. Over the course of our history, we have accumulated large data sets from which we have extracted substantial analytical insights for the benefit of our customers, who rely on our reporting and analytics capabilities to help them to optimize their marketing spend as well as to maximize the value of their loyalty programs.
Development Services
 
We develop custom games for use on our RMiG and SIM platforms. Additionally, we provide platform development services, which consist of initial deployment of gaming hosting facilities and ongoing development services to provide updates to the software for enhanced functionality or customization.
Customer Support Services
 
We provide a range of term-based operational services to support our customers’ online gaming activities. Our premier offering is a full turnkey combination of marketing services and customer support services. Our managed services teams provide user acquisition, customer retention management, and customer functions for our operator customers to help them in acquiring and retaining players. These services are designed to fast-track deployments and provide ongoing operational support following commercial launch for our customers. We offer marketing and customer services to our casino operator customers to support their deployment of our RMiG and SIM solutions. Our tailored customer support services include player customer support across email, phone and live chat, marketing agency services and network management with 24/7 uptime guarantee.
 
Non-U.S. B2C
 
B2C Product Offerings
 
Since our acquisition of Coolbet in January 2021, we have operated the B2C gaming site www.coolbet.com, which predominantly operates in select Northern Europe and Latin America markets. The site offers sports betting, poker, casino, live casino and virtual sports. Coolbet.com is built on proprietary software, including a proprietary sportsbook engine and risk management tools, enabling us to offer a highly differentiated entertainment experience when compared to other B2C gaming sites who rely on third-party technology stacks. Because we predominantly rely on in-house technology, we can rapidly enter new international markets with deeply local and tailor made content. Our B2C product offerings include:

Sports Betting
 
We manage an award-winning online sportsbook allowing customers to place various types of wagers on the outcome of sporting events around the world. We operate as the bookmaker and offer a large variety of betting types in a given event, including both pre-match and in-play (placed after a sports event has begun) betting types. We offer all major sports including soccer, basketball, baseball, American football, ice hockey and tennis, as well as emerging sports such as eSports and smaller sports. Coolbet’s proprietary sportsbook features specialist odds compiled by in-house product experts, which leads to more attractive odds and offers on local sports events and a higher value proposition for customers.
Online Casino
 
We offer thousands of digital and live dealer casino games provided by recognized game content creators, integrated into our proprietary technology. The casino product features many proprietary features and functionalities driving customer engagement. Live Casino, through its digital online casino offering in selected markets, allows customers to place wagers and play games through a real-time streaming video solution. Coolbet.com offers customers a catalog of over 2,700 third-party iGaming titles across skill-based games such as Poker and chance-based games, such as digital slot machines and table games such as Blackjack and Roulette.
Poker
 
Poker allows registered customers to play poker against each other in cash games and tournaments directly on the website www.coolbet.com in real-time.
 
Growth Strategy
 
Key elements of our growth strategy include:
 
Supporting our existing B2B customers as they continue to scale their respective iGaming and online sportsbook and retail gaming operations. Gross Operator Revenue generated on our platform in 2021 increased by 69% to $921.1 million in 2021, up from $545.2 million in 2020. As our customers’ online businesses continue to grow, we intend to deploy the necessary additional internal resources to support their omnichannel requirements. We will, for instance, continue to invest in our GameSTACK platform’s functionality by expanding the gaming content library and third-party integrations, and will move expeditiously to obtain regulatory approvals to operate in new U.S. states. In 2022, we anticipate introducing two new B2B product offerings in GAN Sports, which will allow us to compete as a full enterprise solution. Furthermore, we will continue to engage our SIM installed base in pursuit of opportunities to upgrade these customers to RMiG customers as the regulatory environment develops.
 
Continue to grow our B2C revenues. Coolbet’s revenue was $78.6 million in 2021. We intend to further augment this growth by increasing market share in our existing markets through increased brand building and marketing efficiencies while continuing to add: (i) new and increasingly popular wagering options, (ii) more localized sporting event content in our existing jurisdictions, and (iii) innovative and popular games in our casino library.
 
Securing new B2B casino operator customers in existing and new regulated markets. We continuously engage with new casino operators, whether in existing U.S. states or U.S. states that have yet to adopt regulated forms of RMiG and online sports betting. We intend to engage these new customers with the relevant opportunities within our enterprise solution, currently our Super RGS or SIM offerings, creating a path to RMiG deployments over time. In U.S. states with regulated online wagering markets, we are investing in sales and marketing initiatives to aggressively pursue new deployment opportunities, including the Super RGS content offering. This offering creates a technical and commercial vehicle for us to deliver our proprietary casino games across the entirety of the relevant U.S. intrastate markets, and not just to the websites and mobile applications of GameSTACK customers. We believe that the Super RGS will generate additional Gross Operator Revenue and yield high margin content licensing revenues.

Growing our international business. In addition to our focus on the U.S. market, we intend to expand primarily in regulated markets in Canada and Latin America through both B2B and B2C opportunities. The acquisition of Coolbet in January 2021, which has operated a B2C model at scale primarily in Northern Europe and Latin America, provides us with a fast-growing international strategy incremental to our existing international market presence. Additionally, we are exploring select Latin American markets for potential expansion. With the addition of European, Latin American and Canadian B2C activities, we expect to continue to grow our international business.
 
Expanding our gaming content development capabilities. In addition to distributing online third-party content, consisting of slot machines and table games, through GameSTACK, we offer proprietary casino games that we display in both our SIM and RMiG online environments. We will continue to invest in our development of game content in order to expand our library of high-quality, in-house content, which will strategically fit within GameSTACK. The acquisition of Silverback Gaming in December 2021 will bolster our Super RGS offering in the coming months and years with an exclusive portfolio of online casino gaming experiences, which the Company expects will include 50 unique new games in the next three years. Silverback Gaming’s existing portfolio of online games recently launched within our Super RGS content suite in Europe, and will launch in the U.S. commencing in the first half of 2022.
 
Integration of Coolbet. We continue to expect that our combination with Coolbet should drive significant value for our customers and our shareholders. We believe that the integration of our GameSTACK and Coolbet platforms should be done efficiently, and that the combination should result in one of the most comprehensive, best-in-class product offerings in the iGaming space. We are now in the position to offer to U.S. customers an omnichannel enterprise solution, enabling iGaming and sports betting in retail and online channels. This combination of platforms should also result in a diversification of revenue streams, customer bases and markets. We intend to continue to operate in the United States solely as a B2B provider to casino operators. The addition of a proprietary sports betting engine will give us the ability to offer a “one-stop” solution to our U.S. retail casino operators, while at the same time preserving the flexibility to incorporate third-party solutions when specified.
 
Executing a selective merger and acquisition and commercial licensing strategy. We intend to pursue a prudent inorganic growth strategy aimed at strengthening and expanding our competitive position in the markets where we compete. Our U.S. B2B product offerings will be complete following the integration of Coolbet’s sportsbook into the B2B platform. However, we will continue to pursue opportunities to acquire selective elements of the industrial ecosystem as well as a myriad of content to bolster our product offerings, both through commercial licensing as well as through acquisition.
 
Competition 
 
We operate in a global and dynamic market and compete with a variety of organizations that offer services similar to those that we offer. Our B2B operations face competition primarily from: (i) online casino operators that provide competing content direct to consumers; (ii) retail casino operators that develop their own proprietary online gaming capabilities; and (iii) other similar existing or developing technology providers that develop competing platforms.
 
We believe the principal competitive factors in our B2B operations include rapid deployment, ease of integration with existing and future content and gaming, ease of user registration and conversion, regulatory compliance, data security, back office management systems, reliability, and platform extensibility.
 
Our B2C operations compete against a variety of online sportsbook and casino operators, which range from large international organizations with greater advertising and marketing resources to local players that provide specific opportunities in local markets.
 
We believe the principal competitive factors in our B2C operations include the overall customer mobile and online experience, better and more reliable oddsmaking, ease of use and our customer service.

Customers and Ecosystem
 
Our principal B2B customers are retail casino operators who require a regulatory compliant and complete technology solution provider for setting up, launching and operating an internet gaming business to drive incremental and complementary revenues to their existing retail gaming business.
 
When a U.S. casino needs to move online, there is a small group of potential technology vendors available to serve their needs, and an even smaller subset of companies which are B2B-only business and fully licensed for U.S. internet gaming. We believe we are one of the few companies whose operational know-how and proven track record of excellence represent a substantial competitive advantage together with our strategic U.S. patent governing the important linkage of an iGaming account with a land-based casino rewards account.
 
The GAN family of casino operator customers represents leading U.S. gaming groups, both online and retail. Our customer base is comprised of casino operators, which contract with us for our ability to deliver RMiG and social casino gaming as well as provide dedicated services pre and post-product launch. These casino operators span over 100 retail locations. Today, the GAN family of casino operator customers operate tens of thousands of slot machine units on their casino gaming floors and possess millions of dedicated loyalty club card holding players within their loyalty program databases.
 
In addition to customer relationships with retail casino operators, we have assembled a wide range of relationships with casino equipment manufacturers seeking to bring their machine-based casino slot games online and distribute them into permitted U.S. markets and into selected regulated markets internationally.
 
For sports betting content, we proactively integrated three third-party sports betting systems into our platform. We remain capable of integrating any third-party sports betting system nominated by an existing or future customer, in order to publish sports betting content alongside gaming content on our customers’ operating websites and mobile applications. Beyond content, we have brought together leading service providers spanning payment processing, pre-paid card services, age and identity verification, geolocation, and fraud detection.
 
For the year ended December 31, 2021, one of our customers, FanDuel, accounted for 14.8% of our total revenue. Beginning in 2013, we partnered with FanDuel’s majority shareholder, Flutter Entertainment plc (formerly known as PaddyPower Betfair plc), to support FanDuel’s rapid deployment of online sports betting sites in selected states that had legalized single-game sports betting. Under our current commercial agreements, we provide access to the GameSTACK platform and provide development and support services to FanDuel.
 
Our agreement with FanDuel provides that FanDuel, upon notice and payment of certain fees, can migrate user accounts from our digital wallet technology to its own proprietary solution. FanDuel exercised its option in 2020 and migrated its New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Indiana wallets from us to its own proprietary solution. We stopped generating revenue from FanDuel’s sports betting operations on August 31, 2020. We continue to generate revenue from FanDuel’s RMiG operations.
 
Additionally, our agreement with FanDuel provides that we are the exclusive provider of their casino gaming operations for the initial three years following a launch date, which exclusivity period will end in January 2023. Following that exclusivity period, FanDuel will have the right to use other casino gaming solutions, subject to a requirement to pay us revenue calculated as a certain percentage of their net gaming revenue from RMiG operations. Upon the expiration of exclusivity, we could experience a significant decline in our revenue. We currently support FanDuel’s RMiG casino operations in the U.S. states of Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Michigan, West Virginia and Connecticut. Our current contract with FanDuel expires in January 2025.
 
Additionally, beginning January 2021, we operate a B2C casino and sports betting platform that is accessible for wagering through the website www.coolbet.com in markets across Northern Europe, Latin America and Canada. Coolbet.com originally launched May 2016 and as of January 1, 2022, had over 790,000 registered customers. The majority of website traffic comes from mobile customers and each region features customized interfaces with localized product offerings and local language support teams.

Seasonality
 
Our online sports betting operations experience seasonality based on the relative popularity of certain sporting events, in particular with respect to local and international football seasons and high-profile international and regional tournaments. This seasonality could be exacerbated by cancellation of sporting events due to the COVID-19 pandemic or other adverse health events but can also provide increased volume during high-volume events such as the World Cup.
Intellectual Property Rights
 
We rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws in the United States and other jurisdictions, as well as license agreements and other contractual protections, to protect our proprietary technology. We also rely on a number of registered and unregistered trademarks to protect our brand.
 
As of December 31, 2021, we had one registered patent in the United States and two registered trademarks in the United Kingdom relating to our proprietary technology. We hold a U.S. patent, which expires in 2034, that covers the integration of a retail casino’s on-property rewards and loyalty program with an internet wagering experience, whether offered for real money or virtual-based social casino gaming. Because of the tendency for non-licensed states to implement social casino gaming as an alternative or precursor to RMiG, and our ability to legitimately and comprehensively integrate the unique ability to connect existing retail rewards program with an online gaming experience, we believe that our intellectual property provides a key competitive advantage.
 
We seek to protect our intellectual property rights by implementing a policy that requires our employees and independent contractors involved in development of intellectual property to enter into agreements acknowledging that all intellectual property generated or conceived by them on our behalf are our property, and assigning to us any rights that they may claim or otherwise have in those works or property, to the extent allowable under applicable law. Despite our efforts to protect our technology and proprietary rights through intellectual property registrations, licenses and contractual protections, unauthorized parties may still copy or otherwise obtain and use our software and technology. We may also face allegations in the future that we have infringed the intellectual property rights of third parties, including our competitors and non-practicing entities.
 
Government Regulation
 
We are subject to various U.S. and foreign laws and regulations that affect our ability to operate in the gaming and entertainment industry, in particular in the online gaming industry. These industries are generally subject to extensive and evolving regulations that could change based on political and social norms and that could be interpreted or enforced in ways that could negatively impact our business. Regulatory agencies in each of our operating markets continue to examine a wide variety of issues impacting the iGaming and sports betting industries, and consequently the laws and regulations governing our business could be modified or could be interpreted differently in the future, or new laws and regulations could be enacted. Material changes, new laws or regulations, or material differences in interpretations by courts or governmental authorities could cause us to incur substantial additional compliance costs and adversely affect our operating results. The primary means of enforcement of such regulations is through regulatory licenses.
 
Our B2B operations are licensed and regulated by the United Kingdom (“U.K.”) Gambling Commission, the Amministrazione autonoma dei monopoli di Stato (Autonomous Administration of State Monopolies) in Italy, the Alcohol and Gaming Commission of Ontario in Canada, the New Jersey Division of Gaming Enforcement, the Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board, the Indiana Gaming Commission, the West Virginia Lottery, the Michigan Gaming Control Board, the Tennessee Education Lottery Corporation, the Colorado Department of Revenue Division of Gaming, and the Arizona Department of Gaming, the Connecticut Department of Consumer Protection — Gaming Division. Entry into new geographies will require us to engage with additional regulatory authorities.

Our B2C operations are also required to hold licenses in several jurisdictions. We hold gaming licenses in Estonia, Malta, Sweden, and Ontario, Canada. Our B2C sportsbook technology and technical platform is certified by an accredited third-party according to the licensing requirements of the regulatory authorities of Estonia, Malta and Sweden. We also have customers in jurisdictions that currently do not have a local licensing scheme. A number of these jurisdictions are evaluating the adoption of a local licensing scheme for the online sports betting and gaming operations that we currently offer. If regulations requiring licensure are adopted in those jurisdictions, we intend to apply for licensing, but we cannot be assured that we will receive licenses in each instance or that changes in regulation will not adversely impact our business.
 
Licensing Process
 
We are required to secure licenses to operate in each new jurisdiction where we conduct business and will need to secure additional licenses in order to expand operations to new markets. In newly regulated markets, new licensing regimes may impose licensing conditions, such as the requirement to locate significant technical infrastructure within the relevant territory or establish real-time data interfaces with the regulator that present operational challenges or may stop the licensee from being able to offer the full range of our products. Certain jurisdictions require us to hold a distributor license, while in other jurisdictions we need to qualify for a vendor license to supply our licensed customers. The licensing process can be burdensome and lengthy, depending on the local jurisdiction and their relative ability to move quickly, which is outside our control. Some jurisdictions will allow us to operate on a provisional license while the regulators process our applications. Other jurisdictions require full licensure prior to commencing operations. Accordingly, even as new regulated markets emerge, it is difficult to predict how quickly we will be able to derive revenues in such jurisdictions.
Data Protection and Privacy
 
As part of our operations, we establish player accounts and receive personal and financial information. Accordingly, our operations are subject to privacy and data protection regulation in the United States, the U.K., the European Union, Asia Pacific, and elsewhere. These laws are rapidly developing and changing. The European Union adopted a comprehensive General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), which came into effect in May 2018, as supplemented by any national laws (such as the Data Protection Act 2018 in the U.K.) and further implemented through binding guidance from the European Data Protection Board. In the United States, several states have adopted revised legislation to expand data breach notification rules and to mirror some of the protections provided by the GDPR. Some states, including California, have adopted data protection legislation that requires companies to make significant changes in their data processing operations.
Compliance
 
We have developed and implemented an internal compliance program designed to ensure that we comply with legal and regulatory requirements imposed on us in connection with our gaming operations. Our internal compliance program focuses, among other things, on ensuring we comply with applicable licensing requirements and local gaming regulations. In addition, we plan to introduce a dedicated data protection officer and compliance officer to strengthen the overall compliance capabilities of the organization.
 
Additionally, we use various methods and tools across our operations such as geolocation blocking, which restricts access based on a user’s geographical location determined through a series of data points such as mobile devices and Wi-Fi networks; age verification to ensure our users are of a certain age to participate; routine monitoring of user activity; and risk-based user due diligence to ensure player funds are legitimately derived. We have a zero-tolerance approach to money laundering, terrorist financing, fraud and collusion. All of our games and platforms are certified and tested by various private accreditation organizations, such as, the New Jersey Division of Gaming Enforcement’s technical testing laboratory and the Gaming Laboratories International, which is a leading industry provider for online gaming testing and certification.

While we are firmly committed to full compliance with all applicable laws and have developed appropriate policies and procedures to comply with the requirements of the evolving regulatory regimes, we cannot provide assurance that our compliance program will prevent all violations of applicable laws or regulations, or that a violation by us or our personnel will not result in a monetary fine or suspension or revocation of one or more of our licenses.
 
Social Responsibility
 
We maintain an open, honest and responsible approach towards our stakeholders, which include our employees, suppliers, customers, investors and the wider community. As both a B2B provider of games of skill and chance in regulated intrastate internet gaming markets, we have placed our responsible gaming policies and tools at the core of our vision to provide industry-leading entertainment in a socially responsible fashion. Our GameSTACK software platform has a myriad of features for detection and prevention of problem gambling as well as offering tools to end user players to limit their gaming activities online, in compliance with the challenging technical requirements of the U.S. states we are licensed in, as well as the U.K. and other jurisdictions.
 
Our platform services enable our casino operators to offer their players an array of tools to control their spending, including deposit limits, wagering value limits, wagering frequency limits, time limits, definable self-exclusion and/or cooling-off periods. This, coupled with sophisticated reporting and analytics, allows operators to identify potentially compulsive behavior and take the required action to ensure the protection of any vulnerable players in line with their operating requirements in the relevant intrastate gaming market. Our teams are extensively trained in the area of responsible gaming, to assist end user players displaying signs of gambling addiction and guide them in the correct direction to seek assistance. We also, in conjunction with our customers and third-party service partners, provide robust age verification processes to ensure that no minors can access the gaming opportunities provided on our customer’s websites.
 
Human Capital Resources
 
We are committed to investing in our employees while nurturing an innovative and vibrant work environment. Our leadership team actively works to attract, develop, and retain talent from a range of backgrounds and experiences in order to benefit from diverse perspectives. 
Our Global Workforce
 
As of December 31, 2021, we had 682 total employees, of which approximately 82% of these employees were located outside the United States. The majority of our employees are working within the operations function, which includes the majority of the technical and product employees. The charts below show our global employee population by region and operational function.

Attracting, developing and retaining a pool of diverse and highly skilled talent is critical to our ability to continue achieving sustainable growth. As we continue to build out the Human Capital function, learning and development will be created to provide ongoing support and resources to our teams worldwide to ensure that the skills of our employees evolve with our business needs, industry trends, and human capital management best practices. Additionally, the Human Capital function is working on tools and processes to enable increased productivity, peak performance, and career growth.
 
Diversity and Inclusion
 
A diverse global workforce and an equality, inclusive, and belonging culture is our commitment to the current and future employees. We are committed to promote diversity and inclusion in all our policies, practices, and actions such as hiring, purchasing, and general business practices. We seek to establish an environment of respect and understanding in the workplace and a culture that values and reflects the diverse components of our employees and the communities in which we operate. We also work to ensure that a welcoming and professional environment is maintained in the workplace for all of our employees.
Pay and Benefits
 
With our recent growth and success, we continue to update our compensation philosophy to offer market-based, competitive wages and benefits in all markets where we compete for talent. The pay structure has evolved to be positioned around the market median within each market, with variances based on knowledge, skills, years of experience, and performance. We regularly evaluate pay equity, expanding our review to include race/ethnicity in addition to gender.
 
In addition to base wages, our compensation and benefit programs, which vary by country, include short-term incentives, long-term incentives (e.g., cash and share-based awards), employee savings plans with providers for Company matching, healthcare and insurance benefits (in the United States), health savings spending accounts with providers for Company matching (in the United States), paid time off, leave options, flexible work arrangements, and employee assistance programs.
 
Furthermore, we implemented tools and programs to support our employees through the COVID-19 pandemic. These offerings focus on supporting mental wellness, intellectual wellness, physical wellness, and social wellness through activities, blogs, and training. In particular, we instituted a day of wellness, where employees worldwide may choose a day to focus on their physical and mental well-being. All employees are also provided with a free subscription to the Calm app, which provides assistance with finding ways to de-stress. We further provide a monthly reimbursement for fitness related expenses, and in 2022 we anticipate expanding this benefit to include wellness related expenses. 
 
We also respect our employees’ needs for flexibility and balance between work and life. We support a flexible working model where employees may work from the office or from home. Recently, we implemented a reimbursement policy for work related expenses, which provides employees an allowance to purchase office equipment when working from home.
 
Workforce Health and Safety
 
When the COVID-19 pandemic occurred, we worked to ensure all our offices were following the strict protocols of local, federal, country-specific, and global requirements. We quickly closed all our offices and required our entire workforce to work remotely for the majority of 2020. The health and safety of our employees is the upmost importance now and in the future. Throughout 2020, we continued to review the safety protocols to determine when it would be safe to reopen our offices. We eventually reopened our offices in 2021. We continue to be diligent in our safety protocols as well as re-closing the offices, when necessary, when it was no longer safe to remain open. We maintain open lines of communication with employees on safety procedures when working in our offices.

Employee Engagement
 
With the majority of 2020 forcing closures and stay at home orders, it was important for us to find ways to engage and support our employees even when we could no longer be together. We know how important an engaged workforce is to the health of the organization as well as our employee population. Engaged employees provides a more innovative, productive, and satisfied workforce and promotes retention while minimizing employee turnover.
 
Throughout 2021, we conducted global employee engagement surveys to ensure our employees had what they needed to do their job remotely, obtain the support of their teams and management, and receive the communication and guidance they needed from the Company, as well as attend their own well-being and the well-being of those who may be living with them.
 
While employee engagement is the result of many factors, we believe the changes we have implemented in 2021 and plans for the future should help us grow a more engaged workforce. Our goal is to provide an environment where our employees can be the best versions of themselves and have the support they need to deliver extraordinary results for themselves and our Company.
