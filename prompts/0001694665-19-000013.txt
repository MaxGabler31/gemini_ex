Overview
Evelo Biosciences is discovering and developing potential therapies designed to engage immune cells in the small intestine to drive therapeutic immune effects throughout the body for the treatment of inflammatory diseases and cancers. The action of our therapies is based upon the observation that immune cells in the small intestine have a central role in controlling immune and biological activity throughout the body. We refer to this relationship as the gut-body network, which represents the connections of the gut to all organs and tissues. The centrality of the gut-body network to the immune system has only recently become appreciated, and modern medicine and research have largely overlooked the potential role of the gut-body network in treating disease. We believe that we have the potential to use the unexplored biology of the gut-body network to develop novel therapies that could transform the treatment of many major diseases, potentially driving profound benefits to patients and society.
The gut, and specifically the small intestine, is the largest part of the immune system. The small intestine is networked to almost all parts of the body by the lymphatic and nervous systems. As part of this connected network, which we call the gut-body network, the body’s immune cells regularly traffic through the small intestine. The natural biology of the small intestine acts as an important regulator of the human immune system. Specific types of immune cells, such as dendritic cells and macrophages, are resident in the tissue of the small intestine. They sample specific contents in the interior of the small intestine, which is called the lumen. These immune cells then migrate to lymph nodes where they condition other important immune cells, including T-cells. These conditioned T-cells then travel throughout the body via the lymphatic system to impact disease. Microbes, in particular, have the ability to condition immune cells in the small intestine.
We are developing monoclonal microbials, a potential new modality of oral biologic medicines. Monoclonal microbials are orally-delivered pharmaceutical compositions of naturally-occurring, specific single strains of microbes. Our monoclonal microbials engage immune cells in the small intestine and drive changes in systemic biology without systemic exposure and without colonizing the gut in preclinical models. We and our collaborators have observed in preclinical studies that specific monoclonal microbials can downregulate or upregulate immune responses throughout the body by acting on the gut-body network with naturally-evolved pharmacology. We believe that monoclonal microbials exert their effects through interactions with immune cells in the small intestine. Based on our preclinical studies, we believe that our product candidates could improve the treatment of many diseases.
We have built a proprietary platform designed to develop monoclonal microbials as therapeutics. Our platform integrates tools and capabilities necessary to source, select, formulate, develop and manufacture monoclonal microbials as therapies. The efficiency of our platform has, in a relatively short period of time, allowed us to advance three product candidates into clinical trials for a range of inflammatory diseases and cancers. 
We believe that monoclonal microbials have the potential to address patient need at all stages of disease. We believe this is due to their potentially superior characteristics over current therapies and the advantages of our platform, specifically:

• | We have observed activity in preclinical animal models for each of our lead product candidates. Each of our monoclonal microbials acts through multiple clinically relevant and validated biological pathways. By acting on multiple pathways simultaneously, we believe monoclonal microbials can impact disease in ways that are not addressable with current single-target therapies.


• | We believe our monoclonal microbials are likely to be well tolerated given that they are naturally occurring, specific single strains of human microbes that engage immune cells in the small intestine and drive changes in systemic biology without systemic exposure and without colonizing the gut. If we validate this profile in clinical trials, we believe monoclonal microbials have the potential to be used at all stages of disease and in many more patients than current immunomodulatory drugs.


• | Our development of monoclonal microbials has the potential to be more efficient than those of other therapeutic classes such as cell therapy, monoclonal antibodies and small molecules. We believe that monoclonal microbials do not require the lengthy target validation and compound discovery requirements of conventional drug discovery. Additionally, we believe the manufacture of monoclonal microbials is meaningfully faster than that of certain other biologics and can further accelerate our path to clinical testing and commercialization.

Our product development strategy is to evaluate a range of monoclonal microbials with different pharmacology in clinical trials across multiple diseases. The initial trials for our product candidates are expected to provide information on safety, tolerability, biomarkers of immune response at and beyond the site of disease and activity on exploratory clinical endpoints. This data may enable expansion into a broad range of clinical indications. 
1

We initiated a clinical trial of our first monoclonal microbial candidate in inflammatory diseases, EDP1066, in April 2018, and initiated a clinical trial for our second inflammation candidate, EDP1815, in November 2018. We expect initial safety and tolerability data in the second quarter of 2019 for EDP1066 and the second half of 2019 for EDP1815. These trials are also evaluating exploratory endpoints of biomarkers of immune response and multiple clinical measures of disease. 
We are also developing monoclonal microbial therapies in oncology. Our first oncology product candidate is EDP1503. We initiated our clinical trial of EDP1503 in combination with KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab) in multiple oncology indications in December 2018 and we expect to obtain initial clinical data during the first half of 2020. The University of Chicago is conducting a clinical trial with EDP1503 in combination with KEYTRUDA in patients with metastatic melanoma who are previously untreated or who have relapsed following treatment with an anti-PD-1 inhibitor. This trial dosed its first patient in January 2019 and initial clinical data is anticipated in the second half of 2020.
Our ongoing and planned clinical trials for our current product candidates are illustrated below.
Notes:
(1) We expect to advance EDP1815 and EDP1066 into additional inflammatory disease indications in the second half of 2019. We intend to finalize the indication selection decisions after data from the ongoing EDP1066 and EDP1815 clinical trials have been analyzed. Potential indications include asthma, psoriatic arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease. 
(2) The Phase 1/2 study of EDP1503 in combination with KEYTRUDA is being conducted in a clinical collaboration with Merck & Co, Inc, or Merck.
(3) The Phase 2a study of EDP1503 in combination with KEYTRUDA in melanoma is being conducted as an investigator-sponsored study by the University of Chicago.
Beyond our first set of product candidates, we have identified several other potential candidates from our discovery program, and we are continuing to invest in the discovery of additional potential candidates. We believe monoclonal microbials and our platform have broad potential utility beyond our initial therapeutic focus areas of inflammatory diseases and oncology, and we plan to explore many opportunities in which our platform has the potential to transform the treatment of disease.

Our Strategy
Our goal is to create and develop a new class of therapies that has the potential to transform the treatment of a broad range of diseases by focusing on the gut-body network. 
Key elements of our strategy to achieve this goal are to:

• | Explore the full potential of the gut-body network to create an expansive and diversified product portfolio. We believe the gut-body network has applicability across a range of disease areas and we are committed to pursuing the many opportunities in which our platform has the potential to transform the treatment of a broad range of diseases. Our initial focus is on inflammatory diseases and oncology, and we intend to expand into other disease areas, such as autoimmune diseases, respiratory diseases, neuro-inflammation and degeneration, liver diseases, type I diabetes, food allergy, neurobehavior, cardiovascular disease and diseases of metabolism.


• | Develop best-in-class therapies to improve outcomes across various stages of disease. We intend to develop best-in-class orally-delivered therapies and intend to explore the potential of monoclonal microbials across the full spectrum of disease severity, not only in patients with severe or advanced disease. We intend to pursue what we believe to be the inherent advantages of monoclonal microbials to enable use in all stages of disease.


• | Generate early clinical readouts with biomarker-driven validation to efficiently advance our product candidates. We have prioritized indications with ease of accessibility to tissue biopsies for biomarker analysis. We intend to use these biomarkers to clinically validate the immunological activity and dose of our monoclonal microbials and to guide subsequent clinical expansion and patient selection.


• | Industrialize monoclonal microbials to advance and scale our platform. We plan to continue to invest in our platform, which integrates microbiology, immunology and computational biology capabilities. We intend to expand the diversity of our monoclonal microbial library and enhance our proprietary in vitro and in vivo models to optimize selection of our future product candidates. Our manufacturing processes are designed to ensure the quality and scalability of our products. We plan to continue to invest in novel methods for process development, manufacturing and formulation for our monoclonal microbials. Future plans include investment in clinical and commercial scale manufacturing. We plan to leverage the efficiency of our integrated capabilities to accelerate the clinical development of many product candidates.


• | Strengthen and expand our intellectual property to protect our platform. We have exclusive rights to our technologies including issued composition of matter and method of use patents in the United States for our product candidates. We intend to diligently pursue patent protection for our scientific innovations and to maintain a strong and broad estate of patents and trade secrets in the United States and other geographies.


• | Collaborate to realize the potential of the gut-body network and monoclonal microbials. We intend to continue to seek collaborations with academic groups, biotech and pharmaceutical companies to realize the value of our broad platform and extend the range of our development activities and disease areas in a timely and cost-effective manner. We plan to commercialize products in multiple geographies both on our own and with collaborators.

The Immune System and the Use of Immunotherapy in Disease
Immunology and Current Immunotherapy
The immune system consists of many different cell types that act together as a coordinated system constantly scanning for, identifying and responding to both human and microbial signals. Immune cells, including different types of T-cells, circulate throughout the body via the lymphatic system searching for signs of disease or infection. When this immune surveillance is functioning correctly, immune cells recognize and destroy both pathogens and cancer cells. However, when the immune system responds excessively, diseases such as psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, asthma, inflammatory bowel disease and multiple sclerosis can result. Conversely, an inadequate immune system response may allow various types of cancer to progress unchecked.
Advances in our understanding of how the immune system affects a broad spectrum of disease has resulted in the development of immunotherapies, which are medicines that reduce, suppress, elicit or amplify specific immune responses. Antibody-based immunotherapies for inflammatory diseases and oncology have fundamentally changed the treatment landscape for patients. For example, anti-TNFa antibodies are widely used to treat moderate to severe stages of many inflammatory diseases. In 2017, three of the five top selling drugs worldwide were anti-TNFa antibodies, with HUMIRA alone generating worldwide annual net sales of $18.4 billion. In oncology, checkpoint inhibitor antibodies, including those targeting the programmed cell death protein/ligand 1, or PD-1/PD-L1 pathways, block the tumor’s ability to suppress the immune response. They have improved the treatment of many cancers and are expected as a class to reach peak annual net sales of $30 billion by 2025. While existing immunotherapies have been successful in treating inflammatory diseases and oncology, there remains a substantial unmet need for a majority of patients.

Emergence of a New Paradigm in Immunotherapy
Until recently, immunotherapeutic approaches have largely ignored one of the body’s naturally-evolved routine immunological processes and its associated immune organ—the gut, and specifically the small intestine. Immunomodulation through the small intestine has the potential to address certain limitations of current immunotherapies by acting on multiple naturally-evolved and clinically relevant pathways. We believe this novel approach presents advantages, including potentially minimizing adverse events, enhancing patient convenience and targeting multiple immune pathways simultaneously. We believe that a novel class of therapeutics with these attributes has the potential to be transformative in treating a broad range of immune-mediated diseases. Furthermore, we believe this approach could also expand the use of immunotherapies for the treatment of patients with earlier stages of disease.
The Gut-Body Network is Central to Human Biology and Immunology
The gut, and specifically the small intestine, is the largest part of the immune system. The small intestine is networked to almost all parts of the body by the lymphatic and nervous systems. As part of this connected network, which we call the gut-body network, the body’s immune cells regularly traffic through the small intestine. The natural biology of the small intestine acts as an important regulator of the human immune system. Specific types of immune cells, such as dendritic cells and macrophages, are resident in the tissue of the small intestine. They sample specific contents in the interior of the small intestine, which is called the lumen. These immune cells then migrate to lymph nodes where they condition other important immune cells, including T-cells. These conditioned T-cells then travel throughout the body via the lymphatic system to impact disease. We believe the gut-body network provides an opportunity for gut-mediated immunomodulation throughout the body after oral delivery of products that remain physically restricted to the lumen and lymphoid tissues of the gut. As such, immunomodulation via the gut-body network may represent an underappreciated opportunity to condition T-cells to drive therapeutically relevant immune responses throughout the body.
The Gut-Body Network and Microbes
Microbes are single-cell organisms that have co-evolved with the human immune system throughout evolutionary history. Many human immune cells are programmed to sense and respond to microbes that they contact in the gut. Research in mucosal immunology has revealed that microbial interactions in the small intestine can drive activity on the gut-body network.
Multiple mechanisms for direct interactions between microbes and immune cells in the gut have been demonstrated. We believe that dendritic cells and macrophages in the lymphoid tissues of the gut are key target cells of immunomodulatory microbes, especially in the small intestine where the large gut surface area and thin and diffuse mucus layer allow for close contact between microbes and immune cells. Dendritic cells are a specialized type of immune cell that survey the body’s tissues and present antigens to T-cells. Macrophages can take on many functional forms depending on the conditioning of their environment in the body and are important for both anti-inflammatory and anti-tumor immunity. Immune cells, such as dendritic cells and macrophages, can extend protrusions through junctions between epithelial cells in the lining of the small intestine. These protrusions come into direct contact with and sample the microbial contents of the gut lumen. These immune cells then migrate to mesenteric lymph nodes where they come into contact with T-cells. Dendritic cells and macrophages that have been primed by exposure to microbes in the gut condition T-cells and push them towards inflammatory or immunoregulatory activities depending on the specific strain of the original microbe. Conditioned T-cells continue to move through the body via the lymphatic system to other parts of the body where they may act in local tissue to modulate an immune response.

Figure 1: The small intestine and microbes. The small intestine is connected to many other parts of the body via the lymphatic system in green. The cross-section of the small intestine depicts (1) sampling of microbes in the gut by dendritic cells and macrophages, (2) conditioning of T-cells by dendritic cells and macrophages in the lymph node, and (3) migration of conditioned T-cells to other areas of the body.
Several of our academic collaborators have explored the functional consequences of the interactions between immune cells and single strains of microbes in the gut. Veena Taneja, Ph.D. and Joseph Murray M.D. of Mayo Clinic showed that an orally-administered strain of Prevotella histicola modulated immune function in mouse models of rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis. In the field of immuno-oncology, Thomas Gajewski, M.D., Ph.D. and his group at the University of Chicago conducted an experiment in which a single strain of orally-administered Bifidobacterium had equivalent activity to an anti-PD-L1 antibody and additive activity in combination in a mouse model of melanoma. We believe these and other examples from the academic literature support our theory that single strains of microbes can act on the gut-body network to suppress or activate immune responses throughout the body.
Monoclonal Microbials as a Potential New Class of Oral Biologic Medicines
Evelo was founded to discover and develop therapies that act on the gut-body network. We aim to develop therapies based on our observations on the central role of the small intestine in modulating immune activity throughout the body and the equally important role of microbes as key modulators of the gut-body network.
We believe that now is an opportune time to translate observations from the naturally-evolved gut-body network into immunotherapies to treat many diseases. While microbes have evolved with humans throughout evolutionary history, until recently, the scientific community lacked the necessary tools to deconstruct and analyze the complex interactions between microbes, the immune system, and the gut-body network. Advances in next-generation sequencing, immunology and computational analyses of large microbial datasets have led to a better understanding of the microbes that live on and inside humans and have provided critical insights into their specific functions and mechanisms. In turn, these insights have allowed us to develop the tools necessary to isolate, select, and develop specific microbes that have historically been difficult to culture. This extends from the initial stages of microbial isolation to the final stages of monoclonal microbial manufacturing. We have developed proprietary insights and tools that enhance our ability to produce pharmaceutical compositions of monoclonal microbials at scale. This allows us to deliver potentially therapeutic doses of our appropriately formulated select strain.
We are developing monoclonal microbials to engage immune cells in the small intestine and drive changes in systemic biology by either downregulating or upregulating immune responses for the treatment of disease. Monoclonal microbials are orally-delivered pharmaceutical compositions of specific strains of microbes derived from a single clone of naturally-occurring microbes that we believe can interact with and modulate the human immune system.

We believe key features and advantages of our monoclonal microbial product candidates are:

• | Single strain. Our product candidates are pharmaceutical compositions of single strain monoclonal microbials that we have selected for their specific pharmacology. Our preclinical data suggests that various strains of microbes within the same genus or species can have vastly different immunomodulatory properties. We extensively characterize the ability of our product candidates to elicit a desired immunomodulatory effect. We also believe monoclonal microbials have manufacturing advantages over biologics.


• | Orally-administered formulation. We intend to deliver our initial product candidates orally in formulations designed for targeted release of the monoclonal microbials in the small intestine. Patients typically prefer oral administration to intravenous infusion, subcutaneous injection, and topical administration, which we believe will facilitate the adoption of our product candidates, if approved.


• | Limited systemic exposure. In preclinical studies, we observed that monoclonal microbials had limited systemic exposure, that they cleared from the gut within 24 to 48 hours and that colonization was not required for beneficial activity. We believe that these factors suggest that monoclonal microbials may have limited systemic off-target side-effects.


• | Action on multiple clinically relevant and validated pathways. Our preclinical data has shown that monoclonal microbials may act simultaneously on multiple clinically relevant and validated biological pathways. The diseases we intend to treat are multifactorial, and we believe that our potential therapies will be advantageous over single-target treatments.


• | Manufacturing capabilities. Although manufacturing of monoclonal microbials is complex, we believe that we have developed capabilities that will accelerate the process from strain identification to clinical supply. We have been able to manufacture monoclonal microbials in a relatively short timeframe compared to other biologic therapies, which we believe may accelerate our speed into the clinic. Additionally, we believe that we may be able to cost-effectively manufacture monoclonal microbials.

Given these expected features, we believe that monoclonal microbial therapies may have a number of advantages in comparison to other immunotherapies such as antibodies, cell therapies and small molecules.
Our Monoclonal Microbial Platform
We have developed an integrated platform designed to identify individual strains of microbes capable of modulating the immune system by acting on the gut-body network when administered at pharmacologically active doses. We use the process development and formulation capabilities of our platform to develop selected microbes as product candidates.
Our proprietary monoclonal microbial platform is comprised of the following four key areas:
Monoclonal microbial library. We have assembled a proprietary library of diverse strains of microbes. Microbes in our library are isolated from natural sources, including samples from healthy and diseased humans, in order to benefit from the co-evolution of microbes and the human immune system. To increase our probability of finding microbes with potent immunomodulatory activity, we sample from body sites where microbes interact with the immune system, such as gut tissues. We also have bolstered and continue to add to our library through selective licensing agreements and collaborations with academic partners.
6

Assays and biology. The proprietary tools within our platform are designed to efficiently identify and extensively characterize our monoclonal microbials through a series of in vitro, in vivo and ex vivo assays. We have constructed our proprietary in vitro assays to simulate the complex interactions between microbes and the human immune system, allowing us to evaluate the immunological activity of each microbe in a relevant experimental system. Our in vitro assays are capable of screening hundreds of microbes in parallel and producing more than 150 data points per strain, including levels of pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. This assists our comprehensive selection process to identify select candidates for testing in disease-relevant animal models. By conducting our in vitro assays in both mouse and human immune cells, we add to our mechanistic understanding. We believe this increases the probability of translation of preclinical in vivo results to the clinic.
Process development and manufacturing. Process development and manufacturing are critical for the translation of monoclonal microbials into therapies. Our expertise and investments in pilot scale manufacturing have allowed us to mitigate challenges inherent to monoclonal microbial manufacturing at clinical scale. Major challenges include: limited understanding and characterization of applicable microbes; strict anaerobic growth conditions required by certain microbes, many of which have never before been fermented; and temperature and oxygen sensitivities that affect downstream processing. We believe that our approach to these challenges may enable us to accelerate the process from strain identification to clinical supply.
Process development is integrated into our research activities, combining discovery and downstream development. We have achieved control of quality, identity, purity, and potency throughout the process of strain selection, fermentation, formulation, and pharmacology, with high yield. Importantly, our manufacturing processes enable us to produce a drug substance that is pharmacologically active in the form of a lyophilized powder, which is suitable for cGMP production. For each of our three initial clinical product candidates, we have observed therapeutic activity in lyophilized powder form in relevant preclinical mouse models.
Non-replicating monoclonal microbials. The activity of our monoclonal microbials observed in preclinical studies has been driven by engagement with and modification of immune cells in the small intestine. This activity has not been reliant on engraftment (or colonization) as we have observed that our monoclonal microbials passed through the gut and did not distribute around the body or engraft in the gut. Furthermore, the observed preclinical activity of our monoclonal microbials has been independent of their ability to replicate. From this significant observation, we believe that monoclonal microbial activity is likely driven by recognition of structural motifs by immune cells in the small intestine. Our candidate selection process may include an additional manufacturing step for our monoclonal microbial candidates to develop them as non-replicating product candidates. 
Formulation. Our first clinical product candidates are formulated as capsules containing lyophilized powder for targeted release in the gut. We aim to provide patients with oral therapies with limited off-target effects that preserve the therapeutic activity observed in preclinical studies. We intend to continuously invest in formulation to evaluate optimal delivery of our product candidates and enhance their ability to act on the gut-body network.
Product Development Strategy and Portfolio
We are advancing monoclonal microbials to potentially treat a spectrum of immune-mediated diseases with an initial focus on inflammatory diseases and oncology. We expect our initial clinical trials for our product candidates to provide information on safety, tolerability and biomarkers of immune response in multiple indications with different pathologies and sites of disease. This may allow for expansion into a broad range of clinical indications, which could enable us to capture the breadth of clinical value.
Beyond our first wave of product candidates in inflammatory diseases and oncology, we are continuing to invest in the discovery of new candidates to build a deep pipeline across a wide range of diseases and tissue types to leverage the broad potential of our platform. We also intend to opportunistically collaborate to expand indications and accelerate development of programs where collaborators can contribute further disease-specific expertise to our platform.

Our ongoing and planned clinical trials for our current product candidates are illustrated below.
Notes:
(1) We expect to advance EDP1815 and EDP1066 into additional inflammatory disease indications in the second half of 2019. We intend to finalize the indication selection decisions after data from the ongoing EDP1066 and EDP1815 clinical trials have been analyzed. Potential indications include asthma, psoriatic arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease.
(2) The Phase 1/2 study of EDP1503 in combination with KEYTRUDA is being conducted in a clinical collaboration with Merck.
(3) The Phase 2a study of EDP1503 in combination with KEYTRUDA in melanoma is being conducted as an investigator-sponsored study by the University of Chicago.
Inflammatory Diseases Portfolio
We have advanced two monoclonal microbials, EDP1066 and EDP1815, into the clinic for treatment of inflammatory diseases. In December 2018, we nominated a third monoclonal microbial candidate for inflammatory diseases, EDP1867. EDP1867 is the first non-replicating monoclonal microbial in Evelo's pipeline. 
Clinical Studies - EDP1066
EDP1066-001 is a Phase 1b placebo-controlled dose-escalating safety and tolerability clinical study of EDP1066 in approximately 36 healthy volunteers and up to 96 patients with psoriasis or atopic dermatitis. It will test a range of daily doses in healthy volunteers over 14 days and in patients over 28 days. We are evaluating safety and tolerability as the primary endpoint, as well as a variety of exploratory endpoints including multiple clinical measures of disease and pharmacodynamic markers, including biomarker signals from paired biopsies of affected skin in patients. We initiated this clinical study in April 2018 and we expect that initial clinical data will be available in the second quarter of 2019.
Dosing of EDP1066 in healthy volunteer cohorts of the Phase 1b trial has been completed, data has been reviewed by the trial's safety review committee and we have proceeded as planned into cohorts of patients with psoriasis or atopic dermatitis. 
We plan to initiate an immuno-pharmacology clinical study in healthy volunteers in the first half of 2019. This study is designed to explore additional doses and formulations ahead of potential later stage clinical trials. 
Clinical Studies - EDP1815
EDP1815-101 is a similar Phase 1b placebo-controlled dose-escalating safety and tolerability clinical study of our second inflammatory disease candidate, EDP1815, in approximately 24 healthy volunteers and up to 108 patients with mild-to-moderate psoriasis and atopic dermatitis. We are evaluating safety and tolerability as the primary endpoint, as well as a variety of exploratory endpoints including clinical measures of disease and pharmacodynamic markers, including biomarker signals

from paired biopsies of affected skin in patients. We initiated this clinical study in November 2018 and we expect initial clinical data will be available for this trial in the second half of 2019. 
We expect that data from these initial studies of EDP1066 and EDP1815, which are both being conducted in the United Kingdom, will be accepted by regulatory agencies in major regions, including the United States, according to guidance from the International Conference on Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use, or ICH. We intend to initiate future additional trials in the United States and other countries.
Inflammation Development Strategy
We selected mild-to-moderate psoriasis and atopic dermatitis as indications for first-in-human studies based upon our preclinical data, need in large patient populations, the ease of access to patient tissue for biomarker analysis and the speed of clinical data readout. Patients with mild-to-moderate disease represent between 80% and 90% of the patient population, which is estimated to represent more than 25 million people in the United States. We believe these patients are underserved by current treatments, including steroids, which either inadequately control inflammation or are not safe for long-term use. The majority of novel therapies, including next generation biologics targeting IL-17, IL-23 or IL4RA, two anti-inflammatory cytokines and a cytokine receptor, are only approved for patients with moderate-to-severe disease. Even in the moderate to severe setting, a large proportion of eligible patients do not receive biologics, instead opting for topicals or oral systemic therapies. These factors suggest a need for a novel therapeutic option that is well tolerated, effective and convenient.
We believe the potential profiles of our monoclonal microbial product candidates may be well suited to treat pediatric patients as well as patients at earlier stages of inflammatory diseases than current therapies. Particularly in atopic dermatitis, many patients are infants or young children who have fewer therapy options than adult patients. If our product candidates demonstrate safety and tolerability and limited adverse events in clinical trials, they could open up a larger market than the one currently treated by biologics. If proof-of-concept in mild-to-moderate patients is established, we also intend to broaden our studies to treat patients with moderate-to-severe inflammation, potentially expanding this market opportunity further.
In preclinical mouse models, our inflammatory disease product candidates reduced systemic inflammation with equal or better activity than current standard of care therapies. We believe that this observation may translate to broad activity across a variety of inflammatory diseases. We have produced preclinical data in distinct mouse models that are representative of different biologies, suggesting that single monoclonal microbials may impact multiple immune pathways.
T-cells of the Th1 or Th17 type are implicated in psoriasis, joint inflammatory diseases and neuroinflammation, while T-cells of the Th2 type are more important for atopies and allergic diseases. With current cytokine-directed therapies, agents are targeted towards a specific cytokine to influence one or more of these pathways. For instance, Th1-driven inflammation can be controlled by TNFa or IL-6 inhibition, Th17-driven inflammation can be controlled by IL-17 or IL-23 inhibition, and Th-2 driven inflammation can be controlled by IL-4 or IL-13 inhibition.
Each of our inflammatory disease monoclonal microbial candidates, EDP1066 and EDP1815, have demonstrated the ability to simultaneously impact multiple of these pathways and associated cytokines in preclinical assays, suggesting that they may have broader applicability than individual cytokine-directed therapies. Separately, there are additional anti-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-10 and IL-27 that can inhibit the production of certain pro-inflammatory cytokines. Certain of our product candidates induced increased production of IL-10 and IL-27 in preclinical assays.
Based on the results of the ongoing Phase 1b clinical trials of EDP1066 and EDP1815 we may advance these product candidates into later stage trials in atopic dermatitis or psoriasis and also expand into new inflammatory disease indications in the second half of 2019. Biomarker data from these initial clinical studies may support expansion to mechanistically similar inflammatory diseases. For example, early proof-of-concept in atopic dermatitis could support expansion to other atopies and Th2-driven diseases, including asthma and food allergy and early proof-of-concept in psoriasis could support expansion into other Th17-driven diseases such as psoriatic arthritis and axial spondylarthritis. We may also study EDP1066 and EDP1815 in diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease.
EDP1066 Preclinical Data
EDP1066 is a monoclonal microbial product candidate being developed to treat inflammatory diseases. We selected EDP1066 for its in vitro profile in human immune cell assays combined with its anti-inflammatory activity in a range of mouse inflammation models. In preclinical studies, orally-administered EDP1066 acted on the gut-body network to modulate systemic immune responses in multiple mechanistically and anatomically varied in vivo models, including the Th1-mediated delayed type hypersensitivity, or DTH, model, which measures skin inflammation after antigen challenge, the Th2-mediated 2,4-dinitrofluorobenzene, or DNFB, skin inflammation model, and the dextran-sodium sulfate, or DSS, model of immune-cell mediated gut inflammation.

In Vitro Assays
Our in vitro assays measure the effects of individual strains of bacteria on human immune cells and test several dozen immunomodulatory characteristics. A representative example of a human in vitro assay data for EDP1066 is shown in Figure 3. Plotted to show IL-10 and IL-27 cytokines produced, each circle on the plot represents a different individual strain from our microbial library. The size of each circle represents the magnitude of pro-inflammatory chemokine CXCL10. Each strain was co-cultured with human macrophages, an immune cell type that is abundant in the gut and is a known controller of inflammation. In the assay, EDP1066 was a high inducer of anti-inflammatory cytokines, IL-10 and IL-27. Conversely, EDP1066 did not significantly induce CXCL10, a pro-inflammatory mediator, in the assay. We believe these characteristics could be suitable for an anti-inflammatory agent.
Figure 3: Production of cytokines by human macrophages after co-culture with monoclonal microbials. Macrophages purified from human peripheral blood mononuclear cells were co-cultured with 95 individual monoclonal microbials (each represented by a circle). Cytokines produced by macrophages were measured. EDP1066 induced higher levels of IL-10 and IL-27, relative to other monoclonal microbials screened. EDP1066 also induced relatively lower levels of pro-inflammatory chemokine, CXCL10 (represented by the size of the circle).
Preclinical DTH Mouse Models
DTH in a mouse is a well-established model of Th1-driven inflammation resulting from pro-inflammatory antigen-specific T-cells. In the mouse model depicted in Figure 4, daily oral administration of EDP1066 reduced skin inflammation in response to antigen challenge. In the model, immunomodulation by EDP1066 on the gut-body network was as active as a therapeutic dose of the steroid, dexamethasone. The DTH model also suggests that individual monoclonal microbials may exert differentiated effects on the immune system. For example, a control monoclonal microbial, from the same species as EDP1066 did not reduce inflammation. In the model, orally-delivered and gut-restricted EDP1066 was able to induce certain systemic effects in a mouse as depicted below. We believe this data supports our development of EDP1066 in human diseases with Th1-driven systemic inflammation, starting with psoriasis and arthritides.
P-value is a conventional statistical method for measuring the statistical significance of experimental results. A p-value of less than 0.05 is generally considered to represent statistical significance, meaning that there is a less than five percent likelihood that the observed results occurred by chance. In the figure below and all subsequent figures where p-values are included, a p-value of less than 0.05 is represented by “*”. P-values of less than 0.01 or less than 0.001 are represented by “**” 
10

or “***,” respectively, and are considered to have higher statistical significance. Unless otherwise specified, the p-values shown represent a comparison of each treatment group to the vehicle or control group.
Figure 4: EDP1066 reduced skin inflammation in a DTH mouse model. Mice were sensitized with a foreign antigen, chicken ovalbumin, and Complete Freund’s Adjuvant subcutaneously at day zero. Mice were orally-dosed for 10 days from sensitization on day zero with either vehicle, dexamethasone (1 mg/kg), EDP1066, or a microbe control. Eight days after sensitization, mice were given an intradermal ear challenge with ovalbumin. Change in ear thickness, a measure of skin inflammation, was evaluated 48 hours post-challenge. Treatment with EDP1066 resulted in greater reduction in inflammation relative to all other groups. (Significance relative to vehicle: ** = p<0.01, * = p<0.05, ns = not significant)
In a separate preclinical DTH study, we dosed mice with EDP1066 across a range of doses. In this experiment, the activity of EDP1066 was dose-dependent within a 100-fold dose range. Ascending doses varied by a factor of 10. At the two higher doses, change in ear thickness, a measure of skin inflammation, was comparable to treatment with dexamethasone. Because therapeutic activity is not further increased between these two higher doses, we believe that we are at a dose plateau indicative of maximum therapeutic activity in mice. We have used this information to determine the dosing range for our first-in-human clinical study.
Preclinical DNFB Mouse Model
We assessed the therapeutic activity of EDP1066 in an in vivo mouse model using DNFB skin challenge. DNFB causes a chronic T-cell and cytokine-dependent skin inflammation resembling atopic dermatitis in human patients. This model is dependent on the Th2 class of T-cells, which is associated with atopic and allergic conditions. In the study, we compared daily oral administration of EDP1066 to daily topical administration of clobetasol, a highly potent steroid cream applied to the skin in patients with atopic dermatitis and psoriasis. In the model, we observed no inflammation in the EDP1066 group eight days after the DNFB challenge, whereas there was not a significant difference between clobetasol and the control. At day 15, inflammation scores for clobetasol and EDP1066 were similar. We believe this activity supports our plan to target Th2-mediated diseases with initial clinical testing in atopic dermatitis.
Preclinical DSS Mouse Model
We also tested EDP1066 in a mouse model of gut inflammation. Dextran sodium sulfate, or DSS, was administered in the drinking water of mice, resulting in immune-mediated gut inflammation and significant weight loss. Anti-IL-12/23 antibodies are often used as a positive control in this model. Daily oral administration of EDP1066 reduced weight loss and signs of inflammation in this model, as shown in Figure 5. Additionally, EDP1066 was more active than anti-IL-12/23, which is a mouse analog that acts on the same pathway as ustekinumab (STELARA), an approved therapy for inflammatory bowel disease. A closely related strain from the same species as EDP1066 was used as a microbe control and demonstrated no therapeutic benefit in this model. We believe the data observed in this model suggests the potential role of EDP1066 in controlling gut inflammation, which is important for IBD.
11

Figure 5: EDP1066 reduced weight loss in a mouse model of colitis. Dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) was administered to mice in drinking water from days 0-5. Mice were dosed daily with oral vehicle, oral EDP1066, oral microbe control, or anti-IL-12/23 (twice weekly intra-peritoneally). Mice treated with EDP1066 exhibited less weight loss compared to mice in vehicle, anti-IL-12/23 and microbe control groups.
EDP1815 Preclinical Data
EDP1815 is our second monoclonal microbial product candidate that is being developed to treat inflammatory diseases. In preclinical testing, EDP1815 has exhibited a different set of biological activities than EDP1066. In preclinical studies, EDP1815 has shown immunomodulatory activity on human immune cells and anti-inflammatory activity in many discrete tissues, including skin, joints, gut and the central nervous system after oral delivery in mouse models.

In Vitro Assays
Data from a representative example of a human in vitro assay for EDP1815 are shown in Figure 6. In the in vitro assay, human macrophages were pre-conditioned with lipopolysaccharide, or LPS, and interferon gamma, or IFNg, for 24 hours to put them into a strongly pro-inflammatory state. These pre-conditioned human macrophages were then co-cultured with various microbes for another 24 hours to determine their effects on macrophage inflammatory activity. EDP1815 induced production of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10.

Figure 6: EDP1815 stimulated IL-10 production by human macrophages. Human macrophages were purified from peripheral blood mononuclear cells and pre-conditioned to a pro-inflammatory state with LPS and IFNg. Pre-conditioned macrophages co-cultured with EDP1815 produced significantly higher levels of IL-10 compared to a pre-conditioned control alone (** = p<0.01).
Preclinical DTH Mouse Model
We also tested EDP1815 in a DTH mouse model of Th1-driven skin inflammation relative to dexamethasone, a steroid, and fingolimod (GILENYA), a potent inhibitor of T-cell trafficking which is an approved therapy for multiple sclerosis. Results of the study, represented in Figure 7, show that suppression of inflammation by EDP1815 was comparable to dexamethasone and fingolimod. The dose of fingolimod used in this study was higher than the equivalent dose level in humans that would be used for treatment. Moreover, doses of EDP1815 within a 10-fold range were comparable to fingolimod. Because higher doses of EDP1815 did not further increase therapeutic effect, we believe we achieved a dose plateau for maximum therapeutic activity in mice. We plan to use this information to calculate the dosing range for our first-in-human clinical study. We believe the data from this preclinical study may be supportive of development efforts in human diseases with Th1-driven inflammation, starting with psoriasis and arthritides.
13

Figure 7: EDP1815 reduced skin inflammation in DTH mouse models. Mice were sensitized with a foreign antigen, keyhole limpet hemocyanin, and Complete Freund’s Adjuvant subcutaneously at day zero. Mice were orally-dosed for 10 days from sensitization on day zero with (A) vehicle, dexamethasone (one mg/kg), or EDP1815, or (B) vehicle, fingolimod (supratherapeutic. dose of three mg/kg), or doses of EDP1815 within a 10-fold range. Eight days after sensitization, mice were given an intradermal ear challenge with KLH. Change in ear thickness, a measure of skin inflammation, was evaluated 24 hours post-challenge. Treatment with EDP1815 resulted in greater reduction in inflammation relative to all other groups. (Significance relative to vehicle: *** = p<0.001, ** = p<0.01, * = p<0.05)
Preclinical CIA Mouse Model
Our collaborators at Mayo Clinic observed therapeutic activity of EDP1815 in a mouse model of collagen-induced arthritis, or CIA, which is driven by a Th17 inflammatory response. In this model, CIA mice were conditioned to have autoimmune responses to their own collagen. This is intended to result in the destruction of the joints and mimic human arthritides, including rheumatoid arthritis. In the study, both therapeutic and prophylactic oral administration of EDP1815 significantly reduced disease incidence and severity, as shown in Figure 8 from our collaborators at Mayo Clinic.
Figure 8: EDP1815 reduced arthritis incidence and severity in a mouse model of rheumatoid arthritis. Inflammatory arthritis was induced in DQ8 mice by immunization with type II collagen, or CII. Mice were treated with 100 microliters of EDP1815 every other day either before or after arthritis induction. Treatment was initiated either 10 days prior (EDP1815 + CII – prophylactic) or two weeks after CIA induction (CII + EDP1815 – therapeutic), and continued for six weeks post-immunization. (A) Both prophylactic and therapeutic dosing of EDP1815 resulted in a lower percentage of arthritis incidence compared to treatment with vehicle. A control using EDP1815 alone, without immunization with CII, showed no arthritis. (B) Arthritis severity score was also measured over time. Therapeutic treatment with EDP1815 (CII + EDP1815) significantly reduced (p<0.05) arthritis severity score relative to control (CII + vehicle). A separate control with a microbe from the same genus as EDP1815 was used (CII + genus control) and did not improve arthritis severity score. Reprinted from Marietta et al. 2016.

Although EDP1815 remained physically restricted to the gut and associated lymphoid tissue in our biodistribution studies, our collaborators at Mayo Clinic observed its immunomodulatory activity throughout the body in mouse models. Blood samples were taken from CIA mice to determine the effects of treatment on circulating levels of immune biomarkers. As shown in Figure 9 from our collaborators at Mayo Clinic, cytokine profiling from serum of treated mice revealed that oral administration of EDP1815 resulted in reduced levels of IL-13 and IL-17, which are relevant to diseases of Th2 and Th17 inflammation, respectively. We believe the data suggests that EDP1815 may be able to treat inflammatory diseases driven by both of these pathways.
Figure 9: Oral administration of EDP1815 reduced levels of inflammatory serum cytokines. Levels of serum cytokines were evaluated in DQ8 mice immunized with type II collagen and treated with either EDP1815 or with vehicle. IL-13 and IL-17 cytokine levels were significantly reduced in the serum of EDP1815-treated mice compared to mice treated with vehicle. (Significance relevant to vehicle: * = p<0.05) Reprinted from Marietta et al. 2016. Arthritis and Rheumatology 68(12): 2878-2888 with permission from Wiley.
Preclinical EAE Mouse Model
In addition, our collaborators at Mayo Clinic tested EDP1815 in a mouse model of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, or EAE. This is a model of antigen-specific Th17-driven neuro-inflammation. In the study, mice were immunized with myelin peptide. Clinical inflammation was then monitored and scored for a 30-day period. The data from the EAE model in Figure 10 from our collaborators at Mayo Clinic show that oral administration of EDP1815 significantly suppressed disease scores, which is the standard measurement for severity of paralysis in this model. These results were strain dependent—a genus control and two Gram-negative bacterial controls did not result in lower clinical disease scores.
15

Figure 10: EDP1815 reduced disease scores in a mouse model of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, or EAE. HLA-DR3.DQ8 mice were immunized with myelin peptide PLP91-110 at day zero and were orally-dosed with either vehicle, EDP1815, or other microbe controls starting on day seven. Treatment was continued every other day for a total of seven doses. EDP1815-treated mice exhibited lower daily mean clinical scores compared with mice treated with vehicle or microbe controls.
We believe that data in the above model suggests that EDP1815 anti-inflammatory activity is mediated through the Th17 pathway. Spleen cells were extracted from animals in the study and restimulated ex vivo with myelin to recapitulate the inflammatory response that causes disease. The results shown in Figure 11 from our collaborators at Mayo Clinic suggest that EDP1815 treatment induced an anti-inflammatory response in immune cells outside the gut, marked by downregulated IL-17 and IFNg and upregulated IL-10. We believe this further substantiates the potential role of EDP1815 in controlling Th17-driven neuroinflammation, which is relevant to multiple sclerosis. We believe this ability to impact systemic inflammation and inhibit IL-17 outside of the gut may be relevant to other Th17-driven human diseases, such as psoriasis.
Figure 11: Splenocytes from EAE mice treated with EDP1815 produced an anti-inflammatory cytokine profile. Splenocytes from EDP1815-treated HLA-DR3.DQ8 EAE mice re-stimulated with PLP91-110 had reduced levels of inflammatory cytokines IL-17 and IFNg and increased levels of anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10, compared with splenocytes from medium-treated mice. Similar observations were noted when compared to mice treated with a microbe control (E. coli). (Significance relative to medium: ** = p<0.01, ns = not significant) Reprinted from Mangalam et al. 2017. Cell Reports 20: 1269-1277 with permission from Elsevier.
Preclinical DSS Mouse Model
We also tested EDP1815 in the DSS model of gut inflammation. In this preclinical study, we observed better activity of EDP1815 compared to anti-IL-12/23 with respect to weight loss, as well as bloody stool score and tissue damage as measured by endoscopy. Anti-IL-12/23 is a mouse analog that acts through the same pathway as ustekinumab (STELARA), an approved therapy for inflammatory bowel disease. A microbe control demonstrated no therapeutic benefit in this model. We believe that the observed activity of EDP1815 in this model suggests the potential role of EDP1815 in IBD.

Oncology Portfolio
We have advanced one monoclonal microbial candidate, EDP1503, into two clinical trials in patients with multiple cancer types. 
Clinical Studies - EDP1503
In December 2018 we dosed the first patient in our Phase 1/2 trial of EDP1503 in combination with Merck’s PD-1 inhibitor KEYTRUDA to evaluate the safety, tolerability, immune response markers and overall response rates achieved in up to 120 patients across three groups: microsatellite stable colorectal cancer; triple-negative breast cancer; and patients across multiple tumor types who have relapsed on prior PD-1/L1 inhibitor treatment. Patients will receive daily EDP1503 monotherapy for two weeks followed by treatment with daily EDP1503 in combination with KEYTRUDA. We will evaluate biomarkers identified from paired biopsies taken before and after the two-week run-in, as well as clinical outcomes observed over the course of this trial. We expect initial clinical data from this trial to be available in the first half of 2020.
In January 2019, the University of Chicago dosed the first patient in its Phase 2a investigator-sponsored clinical study for EDP1503 in metastatic melanoma to evaluate EDP1503 in combination with KEYTRUDA. Both PD-1-naïve and PD-1-relapsed melanoma patients will be recruited into the study. Up to 70 patients will receive daily EDP1503 monotherapy for two weeks followed by treatment with daily EDP1503 in combination with KEYTRUDA. The University of Chicago is evaluating safety, tolerability and overall response rates. In addition, we will evaluate immune response markers from paired biopsies taken before and at the conclusion of the 2-week run in. Initial clinical data is anticipated in the second half of 2020.
EDP1503 Preclinical Data
We have advanced EDP1503 into clinical trials based on our preclinical data, which suggests that EDP1503 is active through different immune mechanisms beyond those targeted by checkpoint inhibitors, such as PD-1/PD-L1, or cytotoxic T-lymphocyte associated protein 4, or CTLA-4, inhibitors. Research suggests that checkpoint inhibition prevents the downregulation of the immune system induced by tumors. In preclinical models, we observed that EDP1503 stimulated upregulation of the immune response to tumors. Oral administration of EDP1503 in preclinical mouse models appeared to delay tumor progression to a similar extent as checkpoint inhibitors using different immune mechanisms. In mouse models, EDP1503 had additive effects when combined with a checkpoint inhibitor.
Multiple clinical studies have demonstrated that checkpoint inhibitor activity is dependent on underlying T-cell infiltration and tumor mutational burden. Consequently, checkpoint inhibitors alone are typically ineffective in tumors without sufficient immune cell infiltration. Furthermore, resistance to checkpoint inhibitors can arise through multiple pathways of immune escape, including downregulation of antigen-presentation pathways (e.g., MHC I, TAP, LMP2, LMP7 proteins), loss of tumor antigens recognized by effector T-cells, upregulation of immunosuppressive cytokines and increased resistance of tumor cells to apoptosis.
We believe that our existing and potential monoclonal microbial product candidates have the potential to broaden the base of cancer immunotherapy. The preclinical data of EDP1503 suggests a variety of effects in mouse tumor models, including upregulation of CD8+ T-cell infiltration, increased intratumoral pro-inflammatory chemokines, upregulation of MHC Class I expression and augmentation of NK cell infiltration. We believe that the ability of a monoclonal microbial to induce these effects across multiple pathways makes it an attractive combination candidate for checkpoint inhibitors relative to other immunotherapies in development that target a single pathway.
Checkpoint inhibitors are projected to generate $30 billion in revenue by 2025. However, efficacy of these therapies has thus far been limited to a subset of patients within select indications. Even in melanoma, where checkpoint inhibition is considered the frontline standard of care, almost half of the patients do not respond to PD-1 + CTLA-4 inhibitor combination and at least a third of responders relapse within two years. Given few additional therapy options, we believe there is high unmet need for the growing population of patients who relapse on PD-1/L1 inhibitors. In approved indications other than melanoma, the majority of patients do not benefit, with response rates ranging from only 10% to 30%. In renal cell carcinoma, PD-1 + CTLA-4 inhibitor combination only demonstrated benefit in a subset of frontline patients with poor to intermediate risk. Lastly, several other tumor types are not responsive to checkpoint inhibition alone. For example, in colorectal cancer, generic chemotherapy continues to be standard-of-care and PD-1 inhibitors have only shown benefit in a small proportion of late-line patients with high microsatellite instability or those who are mismatch repair-deficient. Approximately 95% of colorectal cancer patients are microsatellite stable and do not benefit from checkpoint inhibition alone. These factors suggest a substantial need for non-cytotoxic therapy options.
In all these indications, agents with differentiated immune mechanisms of action may be complementary to checkpoint inhibitors by both augmenting existing effects and testing alternative pathways of immunotherapy in checkpoint inhibitor non-responsive tumor types and patients. However, some combination approaches in oncology have been limited by the toxicity caused by dosing multiple agents concurrently. Because monoclonal microbials may work through differentiated pathways to 
17

modulate systemic immune responses without systemic exposure, we believe they may be well-suited for combination with immuno-oncology agents or other standard-of-care therapies.
In Vitro Assay
Macrophages play an important role in cancer immunity, through both direct and indirect effects on other cells, including T-cells, in the tumor microenvironment. There are two broad classes of macrophages: (1) M1, which are pro-inflammatory and have anti-tumor effects; and (2) M2, which primarily have a tissue repair function and tend to block inflammation and promote tumor growth. Data from an in vitro screening assay, depicted in Figure 12, shows the result of co-culture of 37 distinct microbe strains with human macrophages. We assessed the strains based on their ability to polarize macrophages to an M1 or M2 type. We created an M1 control by pre-conditioning macrophages with LPS and IFNg, putting them into a strongly pro-inflammatory state. We created an M2 control by pre-conditioning macrophages with IL-4 and IL-13, inducing an anti-inflammatory, pro-repair state. The aggregate production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, which are characteristic of M1 macrophages, is mapped on the y-axis. EDP1503 is the most M1-polarizing strain in this figure, suggesting that it has the strongest pro-inflammatory properties of the strains evaluated, which we believe is a favorable attribute of an oncology candidate.
Figure 12: Induction of human macrophage inflammatory responses by EDP1503. Monoclonal microbials candidates and controls were co-cultured with macrophages purified from human peripheral blood mononuclear cells for 24 hours. Controls included LPS and IFNg to push macrophages into a strongly pro-inflammatory state (M1 ctrl) and IL-4 and IL-13 to induce an anti-inflammatory state (M2 ctrl). Cytokine levels were evaluated at the end of the co-culture period. Of all monoclonal microbials tested, EDP1503 induced the highest aggregate level of pro-inflammatory cytokines.
We also tested these strains for their ability to drive antigen-dependent activation of human T-cells. In a separate in vitro assay, we co-cultured human dendritic cells with different microbes from our library for 24 hours. We then removed the microbes and tested the ability of respective microbe-conditioned dendritic cells to enhance the inflammatory response of human CD8 T-cells. T-cell response was evaluated through production of IFNg by human CD8 T-cells stimulated by a MHC Class I peptide pool, a marker of T-cell activation. EDP1503 was one of the highest inducers of antigen-specific CD8 T-cell IFNg responses, which we believe suggests it may have the ability to enhance inflammatory T-cell responses in humans.
18

Preclinical Melanoma and Colon Cancer Mouse Models
We also tested EDP1503 in mouse models of melanoma and colon cancer, as shown in Figure 13. In a melanoma model, we administered EDP1503 daily beginning eight days after tumor implantation in mice, as depicted in Figure 13A below. Reduction in tumor volume was similar to that observed with an anti-PD-L1 antibody, a mouse analog of the current standard of care in melanoma. Furthermore, EDP1503 showed an additive effect with an anti-PD-L1 antibody, further reducing tumor volume. We observed similar results in a colon cancer model shown in Figure 13B. EDP1503 activity was comparable to an anti-PD-1 antibody and showed additive activity in combination with an anti-PD-1 antibody. We believe these models suggest that orally-delivered EDP1503 is able to induce systemic anti-tumor effects in mice, which may support clinical development in a range of solid tumors. Multiple experiments conducted by a variety of contract research organizations reproduced these results, suggesting that the results were not dependent on specific experimental conditions or on the background microbiota of the mice.
Figure 13: EDP1503 slowed progression of tumors in syngeneic tumor models. (A) B16.F10 melanoma cells were implanted subcutaneously in mice. Treatment was initiated at day nine when tumors reached a volume of 100 mm3. (B) CT26 colon cancer cells were implanted subcutaneously in mice. Treatment was initiated at day seven when tumors reached a volume of 100 mm3. In both models, vehicle and EDP1503 were given orally daily and anti-PD-1/L1 antibodies were administered intra-peritoneally every four days. Mean tumor volumes were recorded at multiple timepoints. EDP1503 demonstrated anti-tumor activity as a monotherapy and in combination with anti-PD-1/L1 antibodies in both tumor models.
Additional testing in the colon cancer model suggested that the anti-tumor activity of EDP1503 was dose-dependent over a 100-fold range. Ascending doses varied by a factor of 10. When we assessed mean tumor volume 12 days post-treatment, activity at higher doses of EDP1503 was comparable to an anti-PD-1 antibody. By showing that the highest dose we evaluated did not significantly increase therapeutic effect over a slightly lower dose, we gained a better understanding of the maximum therapeutic activity in mice. We used this information to calculate the dose for our first-in-human clinical study.
Ex Vivo Analyses of Colon Cancer Mouse Model
Research suggests that T-cell infiltration into tumors is important for immunotherapeutic responses in oncology patients. In an ex vivo analysis of a CT26 mouse tumor study, we used a CD3 cell surface marker on dissected tumor sections to identify all T-cells as shown on the left in Figure 14 below. The graphs depicted on the right in Figure 14 plot the total number of CD3 positive T-cells in a defined microscopic view of tumors, treated with EDP1503 or vehicle, respectively. The tumors in mice treated with EDP1503 had increased T-cell infiltration relative to vehicle-treated mice. The increases correlated with therapeutic activity on tumor growth. We have observed in separate preclinical experiments that the majority of these infiltrating T-cells are positive for the T-cell marker CD8, which identifies T-cells thought to be particularly important for killing tumor cells in patients.
19

Figure 14: EDP1503 induced T-cell infiltration into tumors. Microscopy images show CD3+ T-cell infiltration in defined microscopic fields of CT26 mouse tumors treated with EDP1503 or vehicle (left). Quantitation of CD3+ T-cell infiltration was plotted against tumor volume. EDP1503 treated mice show greater T-cell infiltration in tumors, with the extent of infiltration being greater in smaller tumors (right).
CXCL10 is a protein hormone of the immune system, or a chemokine, which is produced in response to IFNg. CXCL9 is also produced under similar conditions. Clinical research has demonstrated that melanoma patients that have a high concentration of CXCL10 in their tumors have a significantly better prognosis.
As depicted in Figure 15, we removed colon tumor tissue from a mouse model following treatment with vehicle, anti-PD-1 antibody, EDP1503 or a combination of EDP1503 and anti-PD-1 antibody, and then extracted lymphocytes that had infiltrated the treated tumor. We then tested these lymphocytes for their ability to produce CXCL9 and CXCL10. Lymphocytes from EDP1503-treated tumors induced CXCL9, while those from anti-PD-1 antibody-treated tumors did not. However, we did observe a synergistic effect in combination treated tumors. Lymphocytes from EDP1503-treated tumors more highly induced CXCL10 than those treated with anti-PD-1 antibody and the effect of EDP1503 was greater when used in combination with anti-PD-1.
20

Figure 15: EDP1503 induced production of CXCL9 and CXCL10 in tumors. Secretion of pro-inflammatory chemokines, CXCL9 and CXCL10, by CD8+ T-cells recovered from explanted CT26 tumors in mice treated with anti-PD-1 antibody, EDP1503, or the combination. Compared to anti-PD-1 antibody alone, both EDP1503 monotherapy and combination resulted in greater CXCL9 and CXCL10 secretion by tumor infiltrating lymphocytes. (Significance relative to EDP1503 or anti-PD-1 antibody: ** = p<0.01; * = p<0.05)
In other ex vivo analyses of CT26 mouse tumor studies, we have observed that treatment with EDP1503 upregulates MHC Class I expression and augments NK cell infiltration, which are both understood to correlate with improved immune response in cancer patients. Lower MHC Class I expression reduces antigen presentation to immune cells and has been observed in patients with either primary or acquired resistance to checkpoint inhibitors. We believe these data suggest that the action of EDP1503 on the gut-body network enables different immune mechanisms that match the anti-tumor effect of and are potentially complementary to checkpoint inhibitors. We believe this profile offers a range of potential opportunities for improved immuno-oncology treatments.
Biodistribution and Pharmacokinetics
We have used two techniques to determine the pharmacokinetics and biodistribution of EDP1503 in vivo in mice: fluorescence microscopy and strain-specific PCR primers.
First, using fluorescence microscopy, we have shown in Figure 16 that labeled EDP1503 reaches the small intestine epithelium, which we believe is the site of action of the gut-body network.
21

Figure 16: Fluorescence microscopy showing distribution of EDP1503 in the small intestine of a mouse. Mice were treated with a single oral administration of EDP1503, which was covalently labeled with DIBAC-Cy5 (red). A section of small intestine was stained with anti-MUC2 (green), which stains mucus, and DNA-containing epithelial cells were stained with DAPI (blue). EDP1503 (red) is found both free within the lumen, as well as penetrating the mucus layer to the cells of the gut epithelium where it interacts with the gut-body network.
We believe that EDP1503 has an ability to engage with target immune cells in vivo. In the experiment plotted in Figure 17, we gave mice oral doses of 108 or 109 fluorescently labeled EDP1503. After three hours, we removed mesenteric lymph nodes. Mesenteric lymph nodes are the lymph nodes that monitor immune activity in the gut. We broke down the lymph nodes into single cells and then assayed them on a fluorescence activated cell analyzer to determine the level of physical engagement between EDP1503 and antigen-presenting cells, or APCs, such as macrophages (CX3CR1+) and dendritic cells (CD103+). Our observations suggest a dose-dependent association of EDP1503 with the target immune cells above the background of vehicle control. We believe this is consistent with the proposed mechanism of action of EDP1503 and its dose-dependent activity in a colon cancer model.
22

Figure 17: EDP1503 associated with antigen-presenting cells, or APCs, in the mesenteric lymph nodes. Mice were treated with vehicle or 108 or 109 DIBAC-Cy5 labeled EDP1503. Mesenteric lymph nodes were collected and sorted by flow cytometry, with the proportion of Cy5+ events recorded for each cell type. Increasing proportions of macrophages and dendritic cells show association with EDP1503 with increasing oral dose.
Second, we also used PCR primer pairs specific for EDP1503 to track the passage of EDP1503 through the gut of mice and detected its presence in other tissues. After a single oral dose, EDP1503 cleared from the small intestine within 16 hours and from the colon and stool within 24 to 48 hours. There was no evidence of persistence or colonization either in this model or in the longer-term multi-dose tumor models. The exposure of EDP1503 in other body sites was negligible.
Manufacturing
We have developed proprietary methods for the manufacture of pharmacologically active monoclonal microbials that are scalable and transferable to cGMP manufacturing facilities. Monoclonal microbials are isolated, proliferated and purified in a manner analogous to the manufacture of pharmaceutical drugs. Monoclonal microbials maintain their therapeutic effect through the manufacturing process, which produces drug substance in a powder form that makes our candidates suitable for oral administration, for instance in the form of a capsule, tablet or powder. Additionally, we believe we have established robust analytical methods to assess the identity, strength and purity of monoclonal microbials. We expect that these controlled manufacturing processes and analytical methods will allow us to produce and release cGMP batches of material with consistent quality.
Our internal manufacturing capabilities include production of non-GMP materials for in vitro and in vivo preclinical assessment of product candidates. We currently rely on third-party manufacturers for the production of materials for clinical studies. Our internal personnel have extensive cGMP manufacturing experience to ensure efficient technology transfer and oversee the development and manufacturing activities conducted by third-party manufacturers. Our agreements with third-party manufacturers include confidentiality and intellectual property provisions to protect our proprietary rights to our monoclonal microbial candidates.
We expect our third-party manufacturers will be able to meet manufacturing requirements and drug supply required by our clinical studies. In some instances, we have reserved resources from third-party manufacturers
for the development and manufacture of our monoclonal microbial candidates for near-term clinical programs. We believe that these relationships are integral to ensuring reliable, high-quality drug supply for clinical development.
While we do not have a current need for commercial manufacturing capacity, we intend to evaluate both building internal capabilities and contracting with third-party manufacturers at the appropriate time.
Process development and manufacturing are critical for translation of monoclonal microbials. We believe our internal expertise and external partnerships have allowed us to address unique challenges associated with monoclonal microbial manufacturing. Some of these major challenges include: limited prior know-how in the field for novel microbes; strict anaerobic growth conditions required by many commensal microbes; and temperature and oxygen sensitivities that affect downstream processing.
23

Our proprietary methods for the manufacture of pharmacologically active monoclonal microbials address these three major challenges. Many human commensals are strict anaerobes with no prior development precedent. Process development of commensal microbes requires strong technical expertise in microbiology and anaerobic fermentation. We are pioneering strict anaerobic bioprocessing technologies that can allow for rapid development of reproducible manufacturing processes. We continue to optimize our processes across a wide range of parameters including media, temperature, pH, and harvest conditions. By modifying these parameters, we were able to develop a fermentation process for EDP1815, which is an anaerobic microbe with sensitive growth requirements. As depicted in Figure 19, our proprietary fermentation process increased yield, or production of EDP1815 biomass, by 10,000-fold compared to production of EDP1815 biomass produced from an industry standard fermentation process.
Figure 19. Our process development defines fermentation parameters for EDP1815. Fermentation profile for EDP1815 when grown according to an industry standard fermentation process (orange) and our proprietary process (blue).
Our monoclonal microbial manufacturing processes consist of drug substance and drug product manufacturing. We have established expertise across all aspects of drug substance manufacturing unit operations including cell banking, fermentation, cell separation and lyophilization. We have also advanced knowledge related to drug product manufacturing and our drug product has demonstrated stability under long-term storage conditions. We will continue to advance novel formulation technologies for enhanced delivery and activity in future trials.
Non-replicating Monoclonal Microbials 
Our research has shown that the preclinical activity of many monoclonal microbials is independent of their viability - they need to be intact, but growth and cell division are not required. From this observation, we believe that monoclonal microbial activity is likely driven by recognition of structural motifs by immune cells in the small intestine and that this is a formal demonstration that monoclonal microbial activity is not dependent on engraftment or colonization. 
As depicted in Figure 20, oral administration of non-replicating EDP1066 reduced inflammation in the preclinical DTH model to the same extent as replication-competent EDP1066. In addition to EDP1066, we have observed that non-replicating forms of EDP1815 and EDP1867 show comparable activity to replication-competent forms.

Figure 20. Non-replicating EDP1066 reduced skin inflammation in a DTH mouse model. Mice were sensitized with a foreign antigen, keyhole limpet hemocyanin, and Complete Freund’s Adjuvant subcutaneously at day zero. Mice were orally-dosed for 10 days from sensitization on day zero with vehicle, replication-competent EDP1066, or non-replicating EDP1066. Eight days after sensitization, mice were given an intradermal ear challenge with KLH. Change in ear thickness, a measure of skin inflammation, was evaluated 24 hours post-challenge. (Significance relative to vehicle: **** = p<0.0001)
Our candidate selection process may include an additional manufacturing step for our monoclonal microbial candidates to develop them as non-replicating product candidates. EDP1867 is the first non-replicating monoclonal microbial in Evelo's pipeline.
Sales and Marketing
Given the current developmental stage of our product candidates and platform, we have not yet established a commercial organization. We intend to commercialize our products globally and in multiple disease areas. We
intend to do this both through selectively building our own sales and marketing team and partnering or collaborating with third parties.
Intellectual Property
We strive to protect the proprietary technology that we believe is important to our business, including seeking and maintaining patents intended to cover both our broad platform and individual product candidates. We seek to obtain domestic and international patent protection, and endeavor to promptly file patent applications for new commercially valuable inventions. We also rely on trade secrets to protect aspects of our business that are not amenable to, or that we do not consider appropriate for, patent protection.
We plan to continue to expand our intellectual property estate by filing patent applications directed to pharmaceutical compositions, methods of treatment, methods of manufacture, methods for patient selection created or identified from our ongoing development of our product candidates, as well as discovery based on our proprietary platform. Our success will depend on our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other proprietary protection for commercially important technology, inventions and know-how related to our business, defend and enforce any patents that we may obtain, preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets and operate without infringing the valid and enforceable patents and proprietary rights of third parties. We also rely on know-how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our proprietary position and, in the future, may rely on or leverage in-licensing opportunities.
The patent positions of biopharmaceutical companies like us are generally uncertain and involve complex legal, scientific and factual questions. In addition, the coverage claimed in a patent may be challenged in courts after issuance. Moreover, many jurisdictions permit third parties to challenge issued patents in administrative proceedings, which may result in further narrowing or even cancellation of patent claims. We cannot predict whether the patent applications we are currently pursuing will issue as patents in any particular jurisdiction or at all, whether the claims of any patent applications, should they issue, will cover our product candidates, or whether the claims of any issued patents will provide sufficient protection from competitors or 
25

otherwise provide any competitive advantage, or, if challenged, in courts or administrative proceedings, be determined to be invalid or unenforceable.
Because patent applications in the United States and certain other jurisdictions are maintained in secrecy for 18 months or potentially even longer, and because publication of discoveries in the scientific or patent literature often lags behind actual discoveries and patent application filings, we cannot be certain of the priority of inventions covered by pending patent applications. Accordingly, we may not have been the first to invent the subject matter disclosed in some of our patent applications or the first to file patent applications covering such subject matter, and we may have to participate in interference proceedings or derivation proceedings declared by the United States Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO, to determine priority of invention.
Patent Portfolio
Our patent portfolio includes patent applications in varying stages of prosecution in the United States and selected jurisdictions outside of the United States. As of January 31, 2019, our patent portfolio consisted of seven issued patents and 96 pending applications, which include compositions, methods of use, and manufacturing process claims. Of the patents in our portfolio, two are owned by us, four are exclusively licensed from Mayo Clinic and one is exclusively licensed from the University of Chicago. Of the pending applications in our portfolio, 72 are owned by us, 23 are exclusively licensed to us from the University of Chicago and one is exclusively licensed to us from Mayo Clinic. The patent portfolio includes patents and applications covering the following:

• | An oral oncology platform exclusively licensed from the University of Chicago, consisting of one issued patent and 23 pending applications. Patents in this family are expected to expire in 2036.


• | A translational in vitro assay platform developed by us, consisting of one pending provisional application. Any applications claiming priority to this provisional application that issue as patents are expected to expire in 2038.


• | A formulation platform consisting of one pending provisional application. Any applications claiming priority to this provisional application that issue as a patent are expected to expire in 2038.


• | A modality platform consisting of two pending provisional applications. Any applications claiming priority to these provisional applications that issue as a patent are expected to expire in 2038.


• | Inflammation portfolio:


• | EDP1815, consisting of four issued patents in-licensed from Mayo Clinic, covering compositions and methods of use, one pending application in-licensed from Mayo Clinic (the patents and application from Mayo Clinic expected to expire in 2030) and twelve (12) Evelo-owned pending applications directed to compositions and methods of use. Any applications claiming priority to these applications that issue as patents are expected to expire in 2038; and


• | EDP1066, consisting of seven (7) pending applications directed to compositions and methods of use. Any applications claiming priority to these applications that issue as patents are expected to expire in 2038.


• | Oncology portfolio:


• | EDP1503, consisting of protection under the oral oncology platform exclusively licensed from the University of Chicago covering methods of use and four (4) Evelo-owned pending applications directed to compositions and methods of use. Any applications claiming priority to these applications that issue as patents are expected to expire in 2038.

Patent Term
The base term of a U.S. patent is 20 years from the filing date of the earliest-filed non-provisional, patent application from which the patent claims priority. The term of a U.S. patent can be lengthened by patent term adjustment, which compensates the owner of the patent for administrative delays at the USPTO. In some cases, the term of a U.S. patent is shortened by terminal disclaimer that reduces its term to that of an earlier-expiring patent.
The term of a U.S. patent may be eligible for patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Act, to account for at least some of the time the drug is under development and regulatory review after the patent is granted. With regard to a drug for which FDA approval is the first permitted marketing of the active ingredient, the Hatch-Waxman Act allows for extension of the term of one U.S. patent that includes at least one claim covering the composition of matter of such an FDA-approved drug, an FDA-approved method of treatment using the drug and/or a method of manufacturing the FDA-approved drug. The extended patent term cannot exceed the shorter of five years beyond the non-extended expiration of the patent or fourteen years from the date of the FDA approval of the drug, and a patent cannot be extended more than once or for more than a single product. During the period of extension, 
26

if granted, the scope of exclusivity is limited to the approved product for approved uses. Some foreign jurisdictions, including Europe and Japan, have analogous patent term extension provisions, which allow for extension of the term of a patent that covers a drug approved by the applicable foreign regulatory agency. In the future, if and when our product candidates receive FDA approval, we expect to apply, if appropriate, for patent term extension on patents covering those product candidates, their methods of use and/or methods of manufacture.
Trade Secrets
In addition to patents, we rely on trade secrets and know-how to develop and maintain our competitive position. We typically rely on trade secrets to protect aspects of our business that are not amenable to, or that we do not consider appropriate for, patent protection. We protect trade secrets and know-how by establishing confidentiality agreements and intellectual property assignment agreements with our employees, consultants, scientific advisors, contractors and collaborators. These agreements provide that all confidential information developed or made known during the course of an individual or entities’ relationship with us must be kept confidential during and after the relationship. These agreements also provide that all inventions resulting from work performed for us or relating to our business and conceived or completed during the period of employment or assignment, as applicable, shall be our exclusive property. In addition, we take other appropriate precautions, such as physical and technological security measures, to guard against misappropriation of our proprietary information by third parties.
License and Manufacturing Agreements 
We are a party to several license agreements under which we license patents, patent applications and other intellectual property. The licensed intellectual property includes composition of matter and methods of using monoclonal microbials. In some cases, licenses cover physical material in the form of microbial strains. Certain diligence and financial obligations are tied to these agreements. Additionally, we are a party to a manufacturing agreement for committed resources and exclusivity. We consider the following agreements to be material to our business.
University of Chicago License Agreement
In March 2016, we entered into an exclusive license agreement with the University of Chicago. This agreement gives us an exclusive, worldwide, sublicensable license to patent rights related to administration of microbes to treat cancer. Under this agreement, we may make, have made, use, import, have sold, offer to sell, and sell microbial products to treat cancer in combination with checkpoint inhibitors. Many microbial genera are covered by these patent rights, including Bifidobacterium, which encompasses our lead oncology candidate, EDP1503. In addition, we have a non-exclusive, worldwide license to use technical information disclosed to us by the University of Chicago for the development and commercialization of microbial products to treat cancer in combination with checkpoint inhibitors. Under this agreement, we must use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and market licensed products. Commercially reasonable efforts can be demonstrated by achieving specific milestones by specific dates.
Pursuant to the terms of the license agreement, we paid the University of Chicago an upfront fee of an amount less than $500,000 and are required to make low five-digit license maintenance fees on an annual basis, creditable against royalties owed in that given year. In addition, we may owe the University of Chicago future milestone payments totaling an aggregate of approximately $60.9 million upon achievement of specific milestones, the vast majority of which are associated with specific regulatory and commercial milestones.
The University of Chicago is entitled to receive low single-digit percentage royalties on annual net sales of products that fall under the licensed patent rights on a country-by-country and product-by-product basis. The royalty percentage depends on the amount of annual net sales and whether the product is covered by valid patent claims, un-published technical information, or published technical information. Our valid claims royalty obligations to the University of Chicago will expire upon the later of (a) expiration of the last-to-expire valid claim covering the product, or (b) the expirations of regulatory exclusivity of a product covered by the patent rights. Technical information royalty obligations will expire upon the earlier of (a) fifteen years from first commercial sale of the applicable product, or (b) when a substantially similar product comes onto the market.
Under the license agreement, we have the right to sublicense licensed rights to third parties, provided that the sublicense agreement is consistent with the terms of the original license and that we hold any sublicensees compliant. Should we enter a sublicense under these patent rights, we are required to pay the University of Chicago a percentage of our sublicense revenue. The University of Chicago is entitled to percentages of sublicense revenue in the low- to mid-teens depending on the stage of development of licensed products at the time the sublicense is entered.
The University of Chicago maintains control of patent prosecution, defense and maintenance on their patent rights. We are responsible for reimbursing the University of Chicago for patent costs incurred. If we cease payment for patent prosecution, our patent rights will terminate and revert to the University of Chicago. We have the first right, but not obligation, to control any post grant proceedings and to take action in the prosecution or prevention of any infringement by a third party to patent rights.
27

The license granted by the University of Chicago is subject to any retained rights of the U.S. government in the patent rights and to retained rights of the University of Chicago to use the patent rights for non-commercial research purposes. The license agreement will expire on a country-by-country and product-by-product basis on the later of (a) expiration date of the last to expire licensed patents, or (b) a set number of years in the mid-teens from first commercial sale of a licensed product. Prior to the expiration date, we may terminate the license with written notification to the University of Chicago. Prior to the expiration date, the University of Chicago may terminate the agreement in whole or in part if we fail to make payments within thirty days of receiving a written notice of missed payment, if we breach any material obligation of the agreement and do not cure such breach within thirty days, if we become bankrupt or insolvent, or if we are dissolved or liquidated. The University of Chicago may also terminate the license if we fail to show commercially reasonable efforts in meeting diligence milestones.
License Agreement with Mayo Clinic
In August 2017, we entered into an agreement with the Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research, an affiliate of Mayo Clinic, or Mayo Clinic, to license intellectual property and microbial strains. This agreement gives us an exclusive, worldwide, sublicensable license to patent rights related to compositions of matter and methods of using microbes from a specific species to treat autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. In addition to patent rights, this agreement also includes an exclusive, worldwide, sublicensable license to an immuno-modulatory microbial strain isolated from a human small intestinal sample by Mayo Clinic. Under the licensed patent rights and/or using the licensed microbial strain, we may make, have made, use, offer for sale, sell, and import products containing microbes of a specific species to treat autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. In addition, we have a non-exclusive, worldwide license to use know-how disclosed to us by Mayo Clinic related to the development and commercialization of products containing microbes of a specific species to treat autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. The licensed patents include four issued U.S. patents and one pending U.S. patent application. Issued claims cover compositions containing microbes from a specified species and methods of using these compositions to treat all autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. EDP1815, one of our lead candidates in the inflammation program, contains the microbial strain licensed from Mayo Clinic and is covered by these patent rights. Under this agreement, we must use commercially reasonable efforts to bring licensed products to the market.
In consideration for the licenses, we paid Mayo Clinic an upfront payment of $225,000. Beginning on the second anniversary of the effective date, we owe Mayo Clinic escalating annual license maintenance fees in the low- to mid–five digits. Annual license maintenance fees count towards milestones and royalties owed in a given year. Mayo Clinic is entitled to future clinical, approval and sales milestones. In addition, we have agreed to pay Mayo Clinic future milestone payments totaling a maximum of $960,000 upon achievement of specific development milestones and $56 million upon achievement of specific regulatory and commercial milestones.
Mayo Clinic is entitled to receive low single-digit percentage royalties on annual net sales of products that fall under the licensed patent rights or contain the licensed microbial strain on a country-by-country and product-by-product basis. The royalty percentage depends on the amount of annual net sales and whether the product is covered by valid patent claims or contains the licensed microbial strain. Royalties on products containing the licensed microbial strain will only be due in countries where licensed products are not covered by valid claims. Our valid claims royalty obligations to Mayo Clinic will terminate on expiration of the last-to-expire valid claim covering the product. Royalty obligations on products containing the licensed microbial strain will expire 15 years from the first commercial sale of the licensed product.
Under the license agreement, we have the right to sublicense licensed patent rights and the licensed microbial strain to third parties through multiple tiers, provided that the sublicense agreement is on substantially the same terms as the original license and that we are responsible for the performance of its sublicensees. We must obtain Mayo Clinic’s permission to grant any fully paid-up, royalty-free or exclusive sublicenses. We have no financial obligations to Mayo Clinic related to sublicenses.
Mayo Clinic has the responsibility to prepare, file, prosecute or abandon its patent rights. We may provide prior comment and advice to Mayo Clinic and we are responsible for reimbursing Mayo Clinic for past and future patent costs. If we cease payment for patent preparation, filing or prosecution, our patent rights will terminate and revert to Mayo Clinic. We have the first right, but not obligation, to control any post grant proceedings and to take action in the prosecution or prevention of any infringement by a third party to patent rights.
The license granted by Mayo Clinic is subject to any retained rights of the US government in the patent rights and to retained rights of Mayo Clinic to use the patent rights and licensed microbial strain for non-commercial research purposes, which excludes human use. The license to patent rights will expire on a country-by-country and product-by-product basis upon the expiration date of the last to expire licensed patents. The license to Mayo Clinic’s microbial strain will expire 15 years from first commercial sale of a product containing the licensed microbial strain. Prior to the expiration date, Mayo Clinic may terminate the license if we fail to make payments within thirty days of receiving a written notice of missed payment, if we breach any material obligation of the agreement and do not cure such breach within thirty days, if we become bankrupt or insolvent, or if we or any sublicensee directly or indirectly brings suit against Mayo Clinic. Upon early termination of our 
28

license, any sublicensee that is not in material breach of the agreement will have the right to retain its sublicense to the patent rights and microbial strain. We do not have the right to terminate the agreement prior to the expiration date.
Biose Committed Resource and Exclusivity Agreement
Effective February 2018, we entered into an exclusivity and commitment agreement with Biose Industrie, or Biose. Under this agreement, Biose reserves sufficient manufacturing resources for the manufacture of our drug substance according to a specified schedule of manufacturing runs over a three-year period. We are required to pay Biose fees in the high five digits to low six digits for each run depending on the type of run being conducted. If we do not use committed manufacturing resources, we are required to pay Biose for these resources unless Biose is able to re-sell unused runs.
In addition to manufacturing resources, this agreement includes exclusivity provisions, which ensure that we are Biose’s exclusive customer for the manufacture of certain microbial biotherapeutic products. We are required to pay annual fees in the mid six digits to Biose in consideration for these exclusivity provisions.
The term of the agreement is three years from the effective date. We may terminate at any time with prior notice within a specified period to Biose, or if there is a change of control of Biose that may adversely affect our interest. In the event that we terminate at will, we are obligated to pay Biose a mid-range percentage of the committed manufacturing resource fees for a specified period less than one year following the effective date of termination. In addition, both parties may terminate if the other party materially breaches the agreement and does not cure such breach within a specified period or if either party becomes bankrupt or insolvent, or is dissolved or liquidated.
Collaboration
Merck-MSD International GmbH
In November 2018, we entered into a clinical trial collaboration agreement with MSD International GmbH, an affiliate of Merck, under which we will sponsor and conduct a clinical trial evaluating EDP1503 in combination with KEYTRUDA, Merck's anti-PD-1 therapy, in patients with advanced metastatic colorectal carcinoma, triple-negative breast cancer, and checkpoint inhibitor relapsed tumors. Under the agreement, we retain sole ownership of all rights to EDP1503, and there are no material financial terms or commitments required of either party. 
Competition
The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by rapid growth and a dynamic landscape of proprietary therapeutic candidates. While we believe that our monoclonal microbial platform and candidates, coupled with our resources and industry expertise, give us a competitive advantage in the field, we face competition from a variety of institutions, including larger pharmaceutical companies with more resources.
Specialty biotechnology companies, academic research institutions, governmental agencies, as well as public and private institutions are also potential sources of competitive products and technologies.
In both inflammatory diseases and oncology, we anticipate intensifying competition as new therapies are approved and advanced technologies become available. Many of our competitors, either alone or with strategic partners, have considerably greater financial, technical, and human resources than we do. Competitors may also have more experience developing, obtaining approval for, and marketing novel treatments in the indications we are pursuing. These factors could give our competitors an advantage over us in recruiting and retaining qualified personnel, completing clinical development, and commercializing their products. Competitors that are able to obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we can for our products may also establish a stronger market position, diminishing our commercial opportunity. Key considerations that would impact our capacity to effectively compete include the efficacy, safety, ease of use, as well as pricing and reimbursement of our products.
Significant competition exists in the immuno-oncology field, where we are developing our first product candidates in oncology. Although our monoclonal microbial approach is unique from most other existing or investigational therapies in immuno-oncology, we will need to compete with all currently or imminently available therapies within the indications where our development is focused. Although there is a wide range of potentially competitive mechanisms, possible synergies between these and monoclonal microbials will also be evaluated.
The main classes of immunotherapy that are available or are being evaluated by our competitors include:

• | Checkpoint inhibitors: Agenus Inc., AstraZeneca plc, Bristol-Myers Squibb, F. Hoffmann-La Roche A.G., Incyte Corporation, Merck, Pfizer Inc., Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc.; and


• | Cell therapy: Celgene Corporation, Gilead Sciences, Inc., and Novartis International A.G.

In autoimmune or inflammatory diseases, there is also a wide range of competitors that we will be challenged by. In later stages of disease, the majority of competition will stem from companies marketing or developing biologics and novel small 
29

molecule therapies, such as AbbVie Inc., Johnson & Johnson, Pfizer Inc, Novartis International A.G., Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and Sanofi S.A. Potentially competing mechanisms of action include TNF, IL-4, IL-17, and JAK inhibitors. Novel delivery of biologics, particularly via oral administration, and the entry of biosimilars will also add to competition within the therapeutic area.
Government Regulation
The FDA and other regulatory authorities at federal, state and local levels, as well as in foreign countries, extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, import, export, safety, effectiveness, labeling, packaging, storage, distribution, record keeping, approval, advertising, promotion, marketing, post-approval monitoring and post-approval reporting of drugs and biologics such as those we are developing. We, along with our contract manufacturers, will be required to navigate the various preclinical, clinical and commercial approval requirements of the governing regulatory agencies of the countries in which we wish to conduct studies or seek approval for our product candidates. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and ensuring subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources.
In the United States, the FDA regulates drug and biologic products under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, its implementing regulations and other laws, including, in the case of biologics, the Public Health Service Act. Our product candidates are subject to regulation by the FDA as biologics. Biologics require the submission of a biologics license application, or BLA, and licensure, which constitutes approval, by the FDA before being marketed in the United States. None of our product candidates has been approved by the FDA for marketing in the United States, and we currently have no BLAs pending. If we fail to comply with applicable FDA or other requirements at any time during product development, clinical testing, the approval process or after approval, we may become subject to administrative or judicial sanctions. These sanctions could include the FDA’s refusal to approve pending applications, suspension or revocation of approved applications, warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspensions of manufacturing or distribution, injunctions, fines, civil penalties or criminal prosecution. Any FDA enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us.
The process required by the FDA before our biologic product candidates may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:

• | completion of preclinical laboratory tests and animal studies performed in accordance with the FDA’s good laboratory practice, or GLP, regulations;


• | submission to the FDA of an investigational new drug application, or IND, which must become effective before clinical trials in the United States may begin;


• | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the product candidate for each proposed indication, conducted in accordance with the FDA’s good clinical practice, or GCP, regulations;


• | submission to the FDA of a BLA; 


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the product is produced to assess compliance with cGMP regulations; and


• | FDA review and approval of the BLA prior to any commercial marketing, sale or shipment of the product.

The testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, and we cannot be certain that any approvals for our product candidates will be granted on a timely basis, if at all.
Preclinical and Clinical Trials
Once a product candidate is identified for development, it enters the preclinical testing stage. Preclinical studies include laboratory evaluations of drug chemistry, formulation and stability, as well as studies to evaluate toxicity in animals, which must be conducted in accordance with GLP requirements. The results of the preclinical studies, together with manufacturing information and analytical data, are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30-day time period, raises concerns or questions about the conduct of the clinical trial, including concerns that human research subjects will be exposed to unreasonable health risks, and imposes a clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. Submission of an IND may result in the FDA not allowing clinical trials to commence or not allowing clinical trials to commence on the terms originally specified in the IND. A separate submission to an existing IND must also be made for each successive clinical trial conducted during product development, and the FDA must grant permission, either explicitly or implicitly by not objecting, before each clinical trial can begin.
Clinical trials involve the administration of the product candidate to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial and 
30

the parameters and criteria to be used in monitoring safety and evaluating effectiveness. Each protocol must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. An independent institutional review board, or IRB, for each investigator site proposing to participate in a clinical trial must also review and approve the clinical trial before it can begin at that site, and the IRB must monitor the clinical trial until it is completed. The FDA, the IRB, or the sponsor may suspend or discontinue a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Clinical testing also must satisfy extensive GCP requirements, including requirements for informed consent.
For purposes of BLA approval, clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases, which may overlap or be combined.

• | Phase 1—Phase 1 clinical trials involve initial introduction of the investigational product into healthy human subjects or patients with the target disease or condition. These studies are typically designed to test the safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism and distribution of the investigational product in humans, the side effects associated with increasing doses, and, if possible, to gain early evidence of effectiveness.


• | Phase 2—Phase 2 clinical trials typically involve administration of the investigational product to a limited patient population with a specified disease or condition to evaluate the preliminary efficacy, optimal dosages and dosing schedule and to identify possible adverse side effects and safety risks.


• | Phase 3—Phase 3 clinical trials typically involve administration of the investigational product to an expanded patient population to further evaluate dosage, to provide statistically significant evidence of clinical efficacy and to further test for safety, generally at multiple geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. These clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit ratio of the investigational product and to provide an adequate basis for product approval and physician labeling.

In some cases, the FDA may condition approval of a BLA on the sponsor’s agreement to conduct additional clinical trials to further assess the biologic’s safety and effectiveness after BLA approval. Such post-approval clinical trials are typically referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials.
Although most clinical research performed in the United States in support of a BLA must be authorized in advance by the FDA, under the IND regulations and procedures described above, there are certain circumstances under which clinical trials can be conducted without submission of an IND. For example, a sponsor who wishes to conduct a clinical trial outside the United States may, but need not, obtain FDA authorization to conduct the clinical trial under an IND.
Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials, among other information, must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and written IND safety reports must be submitted to the FDA and the investigators for serious and unexpected suspected adverse events, findings from other studies or animal or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk for human subjects and any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure.
Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the biologic and finalize a process for manufacturing the biologic in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and manufacturers must develop, among other things, methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final biological product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
BLA Submission and FDA Review
The results of preclinical studies and clinical trials, together with other detailed information, including extensive manufacturing information and information on the composition of the biologic, are submitted to the FDA in the form of a BLA requesting approval to market the biologic for one or more specified indications. The submission of a BLA requires payment of a substantial user fee unless a waiver is granted. Each BLA submitted to the FDA is reviewed for administrative completeness and reviewability within 60 days of the FDA’s receipt of the application. If the BLA is found to be complete, the FDA will file the BLA, triggering a full substantive review of the application. The FDA may refuse to file any BLA that it deems incomplete or not properly reviewable at the time of submission.
Once a BLA has been accepted for filing, by law the FDA has 180 days to review the application and respond to the applicant. However, the review process is often significantly extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification. Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, the FDA has a goal of reviewing BLAs within ten months of the 60-day filing date for standard review or six months for priority review, but the overall timeframe is often extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification. The FDA reviews a BLA to determine, among other things, whether the biological product is safe, pure and potent and whether the facility or facilities in which it is manufactured meet standards 
31

designed to assure the product’s continued safety, purity and potency. The FDA may refer the application to an advisory committee for review, evaluation and recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it generally follows such recommendations.
Before approving a BLA, the FDA will inspect the facility or the facilities at which the biologic product is manufactured, and will not license the product unless cGMP compliance is satisfactory. The FDA may also inspect the sites at which the clinical trials were conducted to assess their compliance with GCP requirements, and will not license the biologic unless compliance with such requirements is satisfactory.
The FDA may deny approval of a BLA if the applicable statutory and regulatory criteria are not satisfied, or it may require additional preclinical or clinical data. Even if such data are submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the BLA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. Data from clinical trials are not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret data differently than sponsors. Once the FDA approves a BLA, such approval defines the indicated uses for which the biologic may be marketed. The FDA may also require implementation of a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, which can include a medication guide, communication plan, or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, physician training, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. The FDA also may condition approval on, among other things, changes to proposed labeling claims or the development of adequate controls and specifications. Once approved, the FDA may withdraw the product approval if compliance with pre- and post-marketing regulatory standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. The FDA may require one or more Phase 4 post-market studies and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product’s safety and effectiveness after commercialization, and may limit further marketing based on the results of these post-marketing studies. After approval, certain changes to the approved biologic, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes or additional labeling claims, are subject to further FDA review and approval. Depending on the nature of the change proposed, a BLA supplement must be filed and approved before the change may be implemented.
Expedited Development and Review Programs
The FDA maintains several programs intended to facilitate and expedite development and review of new drugs and biologics to address unmet medical needs in the treatment of serious or life- threatening diseases or conditions. These programs include Fast Track designation, Breakthrough Therapy designation, Priority Review designation and Accelerated Approval, and the purpose of these programs is to provide important new drugs to patients earlier than under standard FDA review procedures.
A new drug or biologic is eligible for fast track designation if it is intended to treat a serious or life- threatening disease or condition and demonstrates the potential to address unmet medical needs for such disease or condition. Fast Track designation provides increased opportunities for sponsor meetings with the FDA during preclinical and clinical development, in addition to the potential for rolling review once a marketing application is filed, meaning that the agency may review portions of the marketing application before the sponsor submits the complete application, as well as Priority Review, discussed below. In addition, a new drug or biologic may be eligible for breakthrough therapy designation if it is intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. Breakthrough Therapy designation provides all the features of Fast Track designation in addition to intensive guidance on an efficient drug development program beginning as early as
Phase 1, and FDA organizational commitment to expedited development, including involvement of senior managers and experienced review staff in a cross-disciplinary review, where appropriate.
Any product submitted to the FDA for approval, including a product with Fast Track or Breakthrough Therapy designation, may also be eligible for additional FDA programs intended to expedite the review process, including Priority Review designation and accelerated approval. A product is eligible for Priority Review if it has the potential to provide a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness in the treatment, diagnosis or prevention of a serious disease or condition. Additionally, products are eligible for accelerated approval if they can be shown to have an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or an effect on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality which is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. Accelerated approval is usually contingent on a sponsor’s agreement to conduct additional post-approval studies to verify and describe the product’s clinical benefit. In addition, unless otherwise informed by the FDA, the FDA currently requires, as a condition for accelerated approval, that all advertising and promotional materials that are intended for dissemination or publication within 120 days following marketing approval be submitted to the agency for review during the pre-approval review period, and that after 120 days following marketing approval, all advertising and promotional materials must be submitted at least 30 days prior to the intended time of initial dissemination or publication.

Fast Track designation, Breakthrough Therapy designation, Priority Review designation and Accelerated Approval do not change the standards for approval but may expedite the development or review process.
Post-Approval Requirements
Licensed biologics that are manufactured or distributed in the United States are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to recordkeeping, periodic reporting, product distribution, advertising and promotion and reporting of adverse experiences with the product. There is also a continuing, annual prescription drug product program user fee.
Any biologics manufactured or distributed by us or our contract manufactures pursuant to FDA approvals would be subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including recordkeeping requirements and reporting of adverse experiences associated with the product. Manufacturers and their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with ongoing regulatory requirements, including cGMP, which impose certain procedural and documentation requirements upon us and our contract manufacturers. Failure to comply with statutory and regulatory requirements can subject a manufacturer to possible legal or regulatory action, such as warning letters, suspension of manufacturing, product seizures, injunctions, civil penalties or criminal prosecution.
Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information, requirements for post-market studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks, or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a REMS. Other potential consequences include, among other things:

• | restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;


• | fines, warning letters or holds on post-approval clinical trials;


• | refusal of the FDA to approve applications or supplements to approved applications, or suspension or revocation of product approvals;


• | product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; or


• | injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.

The FDA closely regulates the post-approval marketing and promotion of biologics, including standards and regulations for direct-to-consumer advertising, off-label promotion, industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities, and promotional activities involving the internet and social media. A company can make only those claims relating to safety and efficacy that are approved by the FDA. Physicians may prescribe legally available biologics for uses that are not described in the product’s labeling and that differ from those tested by us and approved by the FDA. The FDA does not regulate the behavior of physicians in their choice of treatments. The FDA does, however, impose stringent restrictions on manufacturers’ communications regarding off-label use. Failure to comply with these requirements can result in adverse publicity, warning letters, corrective advertising and potential civil and criminal penalties.
Biosimilars and Regulatory Exclusivity
As part of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act enacted in 2010, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, collectively the Affordable Care Act, the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act, or BPCIA established an abbreviated pathway for the approval of biosimilar and interchangeable biological products. The abbreviated regulatory pathway provides legal authority for the FDA to review and approve biosimilar biologics based on their similarity to an existing brand product, referred to as a reference product, including the possible designation of a biosimilar as interchangeable with a brand product. Under the BPCIA the approval of a biosimilar product may not be made effective by the FDA until 12 years from the date on which the reference product was first licensed. Moreover, the extent to which a biosimilar, once approved, will be substituted for any one of our reference products in a way that is similar to traditional generic substitution for non-biological drug products is not yet clear, and will depend on a number of marketplace and regulatory factors that are still developing. The BPCIA is complex and continues to be interpreted and implemented by the FDA. As a result, its ultimate impact, implementation and meaning are subject to uncertainty. In addition, the period of exclusivity provided by the BPCIA only operates against third parties seeking approval via the abbreviated pathway, but would not prevent third parties from pursuing approval via the traditional approval pathway. In addition, foreign regulatory authorities may also provide for exclusivity periods for approved biological products. For example, biological products in the EU may be eligible for at least a ten-year period of exclusivity.

Orphan Drug Designation
Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a drug or biologic intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or if it affects more than 200,000 individuals in the United States, there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making the product available in the United States for the disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product. Orphan designation must be requested before submitting a BLA. Orphan designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process, though companies developing orphan products are eligible for certain incentives, including tax credits for qualified clinical testing and waiver of application fees.
If a product that has orphan designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to a seven-year period of marketing exclusivity during which the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same therapeutic agent for the same indication, except in limited circumstances, such as a subsequent product’s showing of clinical superiority over the product with orphan exclusivity or where the original applicant cannot produce sufficient quantities of product. Competitors, however, may receive approval of different therapeutic agents for the indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity or obtain approval for the same therapeutic agent for a different indication than that for which the orphan product has exclusivity. Orphan product exclusivity could block the approval of one of our products for seven years if a competitor obtains approval for the same therapeutic agent for the same indication before we do, unless we are able to demonstrate that our product is clinically superior. Furthermore, if a designated orphan product receives marketing approval for an indication broader than the rare disease or condition for which it received orphan designation, it may not be entitled to orphan exclusivity.
Government Regulation Outside of the United States
To market any product outside of the United States, we would need to comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other countries regarding safety and efficacy and governing, among other things, clinical trials, marketing authorization, manufacturing, commercial sales and distribution of our products. For instance, in the European Economic Area, or EEA (comprised of the 28 EU Member States plus Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway) medicinal products must be authorized for marketing by using either the centralized authorization procedure or national authorization procedures.
Centralized procedure—Under the centralized procedure, following the opining of the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, or, CHMP, the European Commission issues a single marketing authorization valid across the EEA. The centralized procedure is compulsory for human medicines derived from biotechnology processes or advanced therapy medicinal products (such as gene therapy, somatic cell therapy and tissue engineered products), products that contain a new active substance indicated for the treatment of certain diseases, such as HIV/AIDS, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, diabetes, autoimmune diseases and other immune dysfunctions, viral diseases, and officially designated orphan medicines. For medicines that do not fall within these categories, an applicant has the option of submitting an application for a centralized marketing authorization to the EMA, as long as the medicine concerned contains a new active substance not yet authorized in the EEA, is a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation, or if its authorization would be in the interest of public health in the EEA. Under the centralized procedure the maximum timeframe for the evaluation of a marketing authorization application, or MAA, by the EMA is 210 days, excluding clock stops, when additional written or oral information is to be provided by the applicant in response to questions asked by the CHMP. Accelerated assessment might be granted by the CHMP in exceptional cases, when a medicinal product is expected to be of a major public health interest, particularly from the point of view of therapeutic innovation. The timeframe for the evaluation of an MAA under the accelerated assessment procedure is 150 days, excluding clock stops.
National authorization procedures—There are also two other possible routes to authorize medicinal products in several countries, which are available for products that fall outside the scope of the centralized procedure:

• | Decentralized procedure. Using the decentralized procedure, an applicant may apply for simultaneous authorization in more than one EU country of medicinal products that have not yet been authorized in any EU country and that do not fall within the mandatory scope of the centralized procedure.


• | Mutual recognition procedure. In the mutual recognition procedure, a medicine is first authorized in one EU Member State, in accordance with the national procedures of that country. Following this, additional marketing authorizations can be sought from other EU countries in a procedure whereby the countries concerned recognize the validity of the original, national marketing authorization.

In the EEA, new products authorized for marketing (i.e., reference products) qualify for eight years of data exclusivity and an additional two years of market exclusivity upon marketing authorization. The data exclusivity period prevents generic or biosimilar applicants from relying on the preclinical and clinical trial data contained in the dossier of the reference product when applying for a generic or biosimilar marketing authorization in the EU during a period of eight years from the date on which the reference product was first authorized in the EU. The market exclusivity period prevents a successful generic or 
34

biosimilar applicant from commercializing its product in the EU until ten years have elapsed from the initial authorization of the reference product in the EU. The ten-year market exclusivity period can be extended to a maximum of eleven years if, during the first eight years of those ten years, the marketing authorization holder obtains an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications which, during the scientific evaluation prior to their authorization, are held to bring a significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies.
The criteria for designating an “orphan medicinal product” in the EEA are similar in principle to those in the United States. In the EEA a medicinal product may be designated as orphan if (1) it is intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of a life-threatening or chronically debilitating condition; (2) either (a) such condition affects no more than five in 10,000 persons in the EU when the application is made, or (b) the product, without the benefits derived from orphan status, would not generate sufficient return in the EU to justify investment; and (3) there exists no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention or treatment of such condition authorized for marketing in the EU, or if such a method exists, the product will be of significant benefit to those affected by the condition. Orphan medicinal products are eligible for financial incentives such as reduction of fees or fee waivers and are, upon grant of a marketing authorization, entitled to ten years of market exclusivity for the approved therapeutic indication. During this ten year orphan market exclusivity period, no marketing authorization application shall be accepted and no marketing authorization shall be granted for a similar medicinal product for the same indication. An orphan product can also obtain an additional two years of market exclusivity in the EU for pediatric studies. The ten year market exclusivity may be reduced to six years if, at the end of the fifth year, it is established that the product no longer meets the criteria for orphan designation, for example, if the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity. Additionally, marketing authorization may be granted to a similar product for the same indication at any time if (i) the second applicant can establish that its product, although similar, is safer, more effective or otherwise clinically superior; (ii) the applicant consents to a second orphan medicinal product application; or (iii) the applicant cannot supply enough orphan medicinal product.
Similar to the United States, the various phases of non-clinical and clinical research in the European Union are subject to significant regulatory controls.
The Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC, the Directive 2005/28/EC on Good Clinical Practice, or GCP, and the related national implementing provisions of the individual EU Member States govern the system for the approval of clinical trials in the European Union. Under this system, an applicant must obtain prior approval from the competent national authority of the EU Member States in which the clinical trial is to be conducted. Furthermore, the applicant may only start a clinical trial at a specific study site after the competent ethics committee has issued a favorable opinion. The clinical trial application must be accompanied by, among other documents, an investigational medicinal product dossier (the Common Technical Document) with supporting information prescribed by Directive 2001/20/EC, Directive 2005/28/EC, where relevant the implementing national provisions of the individual EU Member States and further detailed in applicable guidance documents.
In April 2014, the new Clinical Trials Regulation, (EU) No 536/2014 (Clinical Trials Regulation) was adopted. The Regulation is anticipated to come into application in 2019. The Clinical Trials Regulation will be directly applicable in all the EU Member States, repealing the current Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC. Conduct of all clinical trials performed in the European Union will continue to be bound by currently applicable provisions until the new Clinical Trials Regulation becomes applicable. The extent to which ongoing clinical trials will be governed by the Clinical Trials Regulation will depend on when the Clinical Trials Regulation becomes applicable and on the duration of the individual clinical trial. If a clinical trial continues for more than three years from the day on which the Clinical Trials Regulation becomes applicable the Clinical Trials Regulation will at that time begin to apply to the clinical trial. The new Clinical Trials Regulation aims to simplify and streamline the approval of clinical trials in the European Union. The main characteristics of the regulation include: a streamlined application procedure via a single entry point, the “EU portal”; a single set of documents to be prepared and submitted for the application as well as simplified reporting procedures for clinical trial sponsors; and a harmonized procedure for the assessment of applications for clinical trials, which is divided in two parts. Part I is assessed by the competent authorities of all EU Member States in which an application for authorization of a clinical trial has been submitted (Member States concerned). Part II is assessed separately by each Member State concerned. Strict deadlines have been established for the assessment of clinical trial applications. The role of the relevant ethics committees in the assessment procedure will continue to be governed by the national law of the concerned EU Member State. However, overall related timelines will be defined by the Clinical Trials Regulation.
Coverage and Reimbursement
Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any product candidates for which we obtain regulatory approval. In the United States and markets in other countries, sales of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale will depend, in part, on the extent to that third-party payors provide coverage, and establish adequate reimbursement levels for such products.
35

In the United States, third-party payors include federal and state healthcare programs, private managed care providers, health insurers and other organizations. The process for determining whether a third-party payor will provide coverage for a product may be separate from the process for setting the price of a product or for establishing the reimbursement rate that such a payor will pay for the product. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific products on an approved list, also known as a formulary, which might not include all of the FDA-approved products for a particular indication. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the price, examining the medical necessity and reviewing the cost-effectiveness of medical products, therapies and services, in addition to questioning their safety and efficacy. We may need to conduct expensive pharmaco-economic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of our products, in addition to the costs required to obtain the FDA approvals. Our product candidates may not be considered medically necessary or cost-effective. A payor’s decision to provide coverage for a product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Furthermore, one payor’s determination to provide coverage for a product does not assure that other payors will also provide coverage for the product. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development.
Different pricing and reimbursement schemes exist in other countries. In the EU, governments influence the price of pharmaceutical products through their pricing and reimbursement rules and control of national health care systems that fund a large part of the cost of those products to consumers. Some jurisdictions operate positive and negative list systems under which products may only be marketed once a reimbursement price has been agreed. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval, some of these countries may require the completion of clinical trials that compare the cost-effectiveness of a particular product candidate to currently available therapies. Other member states allow companies to fix their own prices for medicines, but monitor and control company profits. The downward pressure on health care costs has become very intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. In addition, in some countries, cross-border imports from low-priced markets exert a commercial pressure on pricing within a country.
The marketability of any product candidates for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale may suffer if the government and third- party payors fail to provide adequate coverage and reimbursement. In addition, emphasis on managed care in the United States has increased and we expect will continue to increase the pressure on healthcare pricing. Coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which we receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.
Research and Development
We have dedicated a significant portion of our resources to our efforts to develop our product candidates.  We incurred research and development expenses of $39.9 million, $20.0 million and $9.1 million during the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.  We anticipate that a significant portion of our operating expenses will continue to be related to research and development in 2019 as we continue to advance our product candidates through clinical development.
Employees
As of February 8, 2019 we have 75 full-time employees, including 34 with M.D. or Ph.D. degrees. Of those full-time employees, 59 are engaged in research and development. None of our employees is represented by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good.
