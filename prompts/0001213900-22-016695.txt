ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Introduction



Viveon Health Acquisition Corp. (“Viveon,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) is a Delaware company incorporated on August 7, 2020 as a blank check company for the purpose of entering into a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, recapitalization, reorganization or other similar business combination, with one or more target businesses.



On December 28, 2020, Viveon consummated its initial public offering (the “IPO”) of 17,500,000 units (the “Units”), each Unit consisting of one share of common stock of the Company, par value $0.0001 per share (the “Common Stock”) and one redeemable warrant (“Warrant”), entitling the holder thereof to purchase one-half of a share of Common Stock at a price of $11.50 per whole share, and one right to receive one-twentieth (1/20) of a share of Common Stock. The Units were sold at a price of $10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds to the Company of $175,000,000. On December 28, 2020, the underwriters exercised the over-allotment option in full, and the closing occurred on December 30, 2020 when Viveon sold 2,625,000 Over-Allotment Option Units at a price of $10.00 per unit, generating additional gross proceeds of $26,250,000.



On December 28, 2020, simultaneously with the consummation of the IPO, we consummated a private placement (“Private Placement”) with Viveon Health, LLC (the “Sponsor”) of 18,000,000 warrants (the “Private Warrants”) at a price of $0.50 per Private Warrant, generating total proceeds of $9,000,000. The Private Warrants are identical to the Warrants (as defined below) sold in the IPO except that the Private Warrants are non-redeemable and may be exercised on a cashless basis, in each case so long as they continue to be held by the Sponsor, or its permitted transferees. Additionally, our Sponsor agreed not to transfer, assign, or sell any of the Private Warrants or underlying securities (except in limited circumstances, as described in the Private Placement Warrants Subscription Statement) until the date we complete our initial business combination. The Sponsor was granted certain demand and piggyback registration rights in connection with the purchase of the Private Warrants.



A total of $203,262,500 of the net proceeds from the sale of Units in the IPO and the private placement were placed in a trust account established for the benefit of the Company’s public stockholders at J.P. Morgan Chase Bank, N.A. maintained by Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, acting as trustee. None of the funds held in trust will be released from the trust account, other than interest income to pay any tax obligations, until the earlier of (i) the consummation of the Company’s initial business combination, (ii) the Company’s failure to consummate a business combination by the Extended Date (as defined below) or the Additional Extension Date (as defined below), if applicable, (iii) the redemption of any public shares properly submitted in connection with a stockholder vote to amend Viveon’s amended and restated certificate of incorporation (a) to modify the substance or timing of the ability of holders of Viveon’s public shares to seek redemption in connection with Viveon’s initial business combination or Viveon’s obligation to redeem 100% of its public shares if Viveon does not complete its initial business combination by March 28, 2022 or (b) with respect to any other provision relating to stockholders’ rights or pre-business combination activity.



Recent Developments 



Entry into Merger Agreement 



On January 12, 2022, we entered into a Merger Agreement (the “Merger Agreement”) by and among us, VHAC Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and our wholly owned subsidiary (“Merger Sub”), and Suneva Medical, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Suneva”). Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, a business combination between Viveon and Suneva will be effected through the merger of Merger Sub with and into Suneva, with Suneva surviving the merger as our wholly owned subsidiary (the “Merger”). Our board of directors has (i) approved and declared advisable the Merger Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated thereby and (ii) resolved to recommend approval of the Merger Agreement and related transactions by our stockholders. The total consideration to be paid at closing (the “Initial Consideration”) by us to Suneva security holders will be an amount equal to $250 Million (plus the aggregate exercise price for all Suneva options and warrants). The Initial Consideration will be payable in 25 million shares of our Common Stock, valued at $10 per share.

Extension of Date to Consummation a Business Combination



On March 18, 2022, Viveon held its Annual Meeting of Stockholders to vote on a number of proposals, including, a proposal to approve an amendment to the Viveon’s amended and certificate of incorporation (the “charter”) to (i) extend the date by which Viveon has to consummate a business combination for three months, from March 28, 2022 (the “Original Termination Date”) to June 28, 2022 (the “Extended Date”), and (ii) allow Viveon, without another stockholder vote, to elect to extend the date to consummate a business combination on a monthly basis for up to six times by an additional one month each time after the Extended Date, upon five days’ advance notice prior to the applicable deadline, for a total of up to nine months after the Original Termination Date, unless the closing of the proposed business combination with Suneva Medical, Inc. or any potential alternative initial business combination shall have occurred (the “Additional Extension Date”). The proposal was approved by the stockholders. In connection with the filing of the amendment to extend the date to consummate a business combination, Viveon deposited $720,000 in the trust account. After the Extended Date, if Viveon elects to continue to extend such date until December 28, 2022, Viveon shall make a monthly deposit of $240,000 into the trust account each month for each monthly period, or portion thereof, until December 28, 2022.



As a result of the proposal to amend the charter to extend the date, public stockholders holding 15,092,126 shares of Viveon common stock elected to redeem their shares. In connection with the redemptions, Viveon paid $152,451,819.49 from the trust account.

Funding for Extension and Working Capital



On March 21, 2022, we entered into subscription agreements with several lenders for a loan of up to $4,000,000, in the aggregate (the “Subscription Agreements”). Pursuant to the Subscription Agreement, we issued a series of unsecured senior promissory notes in the aggregate principal amount of up to $4,000,000 (the “Notes”) to the subscribers. The subscribers for the Notes are affiliated with our sponsor, Viveon Health LLC.



The Notes do not bear interest and mature upon the earlier of (i) the closing of our initial business combination, and (ii) December 31, 2022 (the “Maturity Date”). The Notes provide for a credit line up to the maximum amount of $4,000,000. We will not have the right to re-borrow any portion of any loans made under the Notes once repaid. A commitment fee in the amount of $400,000, equal to 10% of the maximum principal amount of the Note, shall be paid to the subscribers, on a pro rata basis, by us promptly following the initial funding. In the event that we do not consummate a business combination by the Maturity Date, the Notes will be repaid only from amounts remaining outside of our trust account, if any.



Pursuant to the terms of the Subscription Agreements, the subscribers shall receive warrants to purchase one share of our common stock for every $2.00 of the funded principal amount of the Notes up to 2,000,000 shares of the our common stock, in the aggregate, at an exercise price of $11.50 per share, subject to adjustment (the “Subscription Warrants”). The Subscription Warrant term commences on the Exercise Date (as hereinafter defined) for a period of 49 months. The Subscription Warrants are exercisable commencing on the date of the initial business combination (the “Exercise Date”) and have a cashless exercise feature that is available at any time on or after the Exercise Date. Commencing on the date 13 months following the Exercise Date, the subscribers have the right, but not the obligation, to put the Subscription Warrants to us at a purchase price of $5.00 per share. We have agreed to file, within thirty (30) calendar days after the consummation of an initial business combination, a registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission to register for resale the shares of common stock underlying the Subscription Warrants.



On March 21, 2022, an initial amount of $2,700,000 was drawn down from the Notes. $720,000 of the loan proceeds was deposited into our trust account in connection with extending the business combination completion window from March 28, 2022 until the Extended Date. After the Extended Date, if we elect to continue to extend such date until December 28, 2022 (the “Final Extension Date”), we shall make a monthly deposit of $240,000 into the trust account each month for each monthly period, or portion thereof, until the Final Extension Date.



The entry into the Subscription Agreement and the terms of the Notes and Subscription Warrants was approved by the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company at a meeting held on March 21, 2022.



The foregoing description of the Note, the Warrant and the Subscription Agreement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Note, the Warrant and the Subscription Agreement, which are incorporated by reference into this Annual Report as Exhibit 10.15, Exhibit 10.16 and Exhibit 10.17, respectively



Amendment to Viveon’s charter



On March 23, 2022, we filed an amendment to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation with the Delaware Secretary of State (the “Amendment”) The Amendment (i) extends the date by which we have to consummate a business combination for three months, from the Original Termination Date to the Extended Date and (ii) allows us, without another stockholder vote, to elect to extend the date to consummate a business combination on a monthly basis for up to six times by an additional one month each time after the Extended Date, upon five days’ advance notice and the deposit of $240,000 prior to the applicable deadline, for a total of up to nine months after the Original Termination Date, unless the closing of the proposed business combination with Suneva Medical, Inc. or any potential alternative initial business combination shall have occurred. A copy of the Amendment, as filed is incorporated by reference into this Annual Report as Exhibit 3.2.



As a result of the Amendment, on March 23, 2022, we entered into an amendment (the “IMTA Amendment”) to the Investment Management Trust Agreement, with Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, as trustee. The IMTA Amendment amends and restates Sections 1(i), 7(c) and 7(j) of the original Investment Management Trust Agreement, dated as of December 22, 2020, to reflect the extension of the date by which the Company must consummate an initial business combination. A copy of the IMTA Amendment, is incorporated by reference into this Annual Report as Exhibit 10.18.



General



We are a Delaware blank check company formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses or entities, which we refer to throughout this annual report as our initial business combination. Although we are not limited to a particular industry or geographic region for purposes of consummating an initial business combination, we intend to focus on businesses that have their primary operations located in North America in the healthcare industry, and specifically in the medical technology and medical device sectors. As disclosed in our prospectus, although our management has significant experience in the orthopedic and spine marketplace, they also have extensive operating and transaction experiences in the medical technology sector as managers, investors, acquirors, and sellers and will use that experience to consider target companies in emerging growth medical technology and medical device companies that may be focused in areas outside of orthopedics and spine.




2







Consistent with our strategy, we have identified the following criteria to evaluate prospective target businesses. Although we may decide to enter into our initial business combination with a target business that does not meet the criteria described below, it is our intention to acquire companies that we believe:




● | have a clinical or other competitive advantage in the markets in which they operate and which can benefit from access to additional capital as well as our industry relationships and expertise;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | will likely be well received by public investors and experience substantial increase in valuation as a result of a public listing and access to the public markets;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | are ready to be public, with strong management, corporate governance and reporting policies in place;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | have significant embedded and/or underexploited growth opportunities that will drive value;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | growing at or above industry market rates;
--+-------------------------------------------


● | will offer attractive risk-adjusted equity returns for our stockholders.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------




We may use other criteria as well. Any evaluation relating to the merits of a particular initial business combination may be based on these general criteria as well as other considerations, factors and criteria that our management may deem relevant.



We believe that emerging growth medical technology companies will realize a material benefit from being publicly-traded, including greater access to capital to support innovation and sales channel expansion, having available liquid securities which can be utilized for acquisitions, and increased market and customer awareness.



Many of these companies that are highly innovative and are experiencing high growth have few options to reach their full potential. While a traditional IPO could, in theory, provide a meaningful avenue for these companies to access capital and accelerate their growth, the relatively high risk and expense associated with a traditional initial public offering and the negative consequences of an unsuccessful public offering represent meaningful barriers to many companies in our target sector to pursuing a traditional IPO. Accordingly, we believe that the increased visibility and acceptance of going-public mergers with special purpose acquisition companies like us may enhance our ability to consummate an initial business combination.



We believe an acquisition by a special purpose acquisition company, like ours, can provide an efficient liquidity and capital-raising mechanism while materially reducing the risks and expenses associated with a traditional IPO. Furthermore, we believe our management team is well-known to, and respected by, the founders, management, and shareholders of private medical technology companies and that our leadership’s reputation will be a competitive advantage in attracting high quality targets for our business combination. Our management team and board of directors have an extensive operating and transaction experiences in the medical technology sector as manager, investors, acquirors, and sellers. We intend to leverage this experience and network to identify a target company and to deliver operational and economic benefit from a business combination.



Business Combination Agreement



On January 12, 2022, we entered into a Merger Agreement (the “Merger Agreement”) by and among us, VHAC Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and our wholly owned subsidiary (“Merger Sub”), and Suneva Medical, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Suneva”).



Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, a business combination between Viveon and Suneva will be effected through the merger of Merger Sub with and into Suneva, with Suneva surviving the merger as our wholly owned subsidiary (the “Merger”). Our board of directors has (i) approved and declared advisable the Merger Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated thereby and (ii) resolved to recommend approval of the Merger Agreement and related transactions by our stockholders.



The total consideration to be paid at closing (the “Initial Consideration”) by us to Suneva security holders will be an amount equal to $250 Million (plus the aggregate exercise price for all Suneva options and warrants). The Initial Consideration will be payable in 25 million shares of our Common Stock, valued at $10 per share.

We believe we will be able to capitalize on Dr. Gill’s experience and accomplishments in the orthopedic and spine markets, along with his relationships among executives in the target companies, their supply chains, and their customer networks, to successfully close a business combination.

Acquisition Strategy



We believe our management team is well positioned to identify unique opportunities within the healthcare industry, and more specifically in the medical technology and medical device industry. Our selection process will leverage our relationships within the industry particularly with leading venture capitalists and growth equity funds, executives of private and public companies, as well as leading investment banking firms, which we believe should provide us with a key competitive advantage in sourcing potential business combination targets. Furthermore, members of our board of directors will augment the selection process through their robust relationships. Given our profile and dedicated industry approach, we anticipate that target business candidates may be brought to our attention from various unaffiliated sources, and in particular investors in other private and public companies in our networks.



Our strategy is to utilize the experience and relationships of our management and board to identify target businesses that are exhibiting rapid growth, technology and service innovation, and positive income that would benefit from the opportunity for substantial revenue and profit expansion.



We believe that target companies under this indicative will experience a substantial increase in value as a result of a public listing which brings access to the public markets to capitalize innovation, achieve added public visibility that can help expand sales channels, and provide flexibility to support additional substantial acquisitions in the highly fragmented medical technology and medical device market.



We believe an acquisition by a special purpose acquisition company, like us, can provide an efficient liquidity and capital-raising mechanism while materially reducing the risks and expenses associated with a traditional IPO. Furthermore, we believe our management team is well-known to, and respected by, the founders, management, and shareholders of private medical technology companies and that our leadership’s reputations will be a competitive advantage in attracting high quality targets for our business combination. Our management team and board of directors have extensive operating and transaction experiences in the medical technology sector as manager, investors, acquirors, and sellers. We intend to leverage this experience and network to identify a target company and to deliver operational and economic benefit from a business combination.



Investment Criteria



Consistent with our strategy, we have identified the following criteria to evaluate prospective target businesses. Although we may decide to enter into our initial business combination with a target business that does not meet the criteria described below, it is our intention to acquire companies that we believe:

● | have a clinical or other competitive advantage in the markets in which they operate and which can benefit from access to additional capital as well as our industry relationships and expertise;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | will likely be well received by public investors and experience substantial increase in valuation as a result of a public listing and access to the public markets;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | are ready to be public, with strong management, corporate governance and reporting policies in place;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | will be able to take full advantage of the use of public securities as a means to engage in further substantial acquisitions in the highly fragmented medical technology and device industry;;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | have significant embedded and/or underexploited growth opportunities that will drive value;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | growing at or above industry market rates; and
--+-----------------------------------------------


● | will offer attractive risk-adjusted equity returns for our stockholders.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------




We may use other criteria as well. Any evaluation relating to the merits of a particular initial business combination may be based on these general criteria as well as other considerations, factors and criteria that our management may deem relevant.

Industry Opportunity



We believe the healthcare industry, particularly the life sciences and medical technology sectors, represents an enormous and growing target market with a large number of potential target acquisition opportunities. In 2018, total U.S. national health expenditures exceeded $3.6 trillion, and the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services estimated that total healthcare spending accounted for approximately 18% of total U.S. Gross Domestic Product.



While most of the companies in our target sector of medical technology companies are domiciled in the United States, many have also begun to expand their commercial footprint globally, which delivers an opportunity to further extend their commercial reach. The regional distribution of the global market is primarily divided into North America (44%), Asia/Pacific (23%), Western Europe (22%), and all other areas (11%), according to 2020 analysis by MarketResearch.com. Of these segments, the Asia/Pacific market is expected to grow most rapidly at more than 6% CAGR. The enhanced growth rate in the Asia/Pacific segment is attributed to the increase in healthcare facilities primarily in emerging markets as well as expansion by local medical technology companies serving the region that also have expansion plans to enter the North American and Western European markets. These regionally based medical technology companies will serve as targets for our business combination.



Effecting a Business Combination



General



We are not presently engaged in, and we will not engage in, any operations for an indefinite period of time. We intend to effectuate our initial business combination using cash from the proceeds of the IPO and the private placement of the private warrants, our shares, new debt, or a combination of these, as the consideration to be paid in our initial business combination. We may seek to consummate our initial business combination with a company or business that may be financially unstable or in its early stages of development or growth (such as a company that has begun operations but is not yet at the stage of commercial manufacturing and sales), which would subject us to the numerous risks inherent in such companies and businesses, although we will not be permitted to effectuate our initial business combination with another blank check company or a similar company with nominal operations.



If our initial business combination is paid for using shares or debt securities, or not all of the funds released from the trust account are used for payment of the purchase price in connection with our business combination or used for redemptions of purchases of our Common Stock, we may apply the cash released to us from the trust account that is not applied to the purchase price for general corporate purposes, including for maintenance or expansion of operations of acquired businesses, the payment of principal or interest due on indebtedness incurred in consummating our initial business combination, to fund the purchase of other companies or for working capital.



Since the consummation of the IPO, we have focused on identifying, doing due diligence on and speaking to management of potential target companies in a variety of markets within the medical technology sector of the healthcare industry in the United States and other developed countries. Subject to the requirement that our initial business combination must be with one or more target businesses or assets having an aggregate fair market value of at least 80% of the value of the trust account (excluding any taxes payable) at the time of the agreement to enter into such initial business combination, we have virtually unrestricted flexibility in identifying and selecting one or more prospective target businesses.



We may seek to raise additional funds through a private offering of debt or equity securities in connection with the consummation of our initial business combination, and we may effectuate our initial business combination using the proceeds of such offering rather than using the amounts held in the trust account. Subject to compliance with applicable securities laws, we would consummate such financing only simultaneously with the consummation of our business combination. In the case of an initial business combination funded with assets other than the trust account assets, our tender offer documents or proxy materials disclosing the business combination would disclose the terms of the financing and, only if required by law or the NYSE American stock exchange, we would seek stockholder approval of such financing. There are no prohibitions on our ability to raise funds privately or through loans in connection with our initial business combination.

Sources of Target Businesses



Our process of identifying acquisition targets leverages our management team’s unique industry experiences, proven deal sourcing capabilities and broad and deep network of relationships in numerous industries, including executives and management teams, private equity groups and other institutional investors, large business enterprises, lenders, investment bankers and other investment market participants, restructuring advisers, consultants, attorneys and accountants, which we believe should provide us with a number of business combination opportunities. We expect that the collective experience, capability and network of our founders, directors and officers, combined with their individual and collective reputations in the investment community, will help to create prospective business combination opportunities.



We anticipate that target business candidates will be brought to our attention from various unaffiliated sources, including investment bankers, venture capital funds, private equity groups, leveraged buyout funds, management buyout funds and other members of the financial community. Target businesses may be brought to our attention by such unaffiliated sources as a result of being solicited by us through calls or mailings. These sources also may introduce us to target businesses in which they think we may be interested on an unsolicited basis, since many of these sources will have read this annual report and know what types of businesses we are targeting. Our officers and directors, as well as their affiliates, also may bring to our attention target business candidates that they become aware of through their business contacts as a result of formal or informal inquiries or discussions they may have, as well as attending trade shows or conventions.



In addition, we expect to receive a number of proprietary deal flow opportunities that would not otherwise necessarily be available to us as a result of the business relationships of our officers and directors. While we do not presently anticipate engaging the services of professional firms or other individuals that specialize in business acquisitions on any formal basis, we may engage these firms or other individuals in the future, in which event we may pay a finder’s fee, consulting fee or other compensation to be determined in an arm’s length negotiation based on the terms of the transaction. We will engage a finder only to the extent our management determines that the use of a finder may bring opportunities to us that may not otherwise be available to us or if finders approach us on an unsolicited basis with a potential transaction that our management determines is in our best interest to pursue. Payment of finder’s fees is customarily tied to completion of a transaction, in which case any such fee will be paid out of the funds held in the trust account. Although some of our officers and directors may enter into employment or consulting agreements with the acquired business following our initial business combination, the presence or absence of any such arrangements will not be used as a criterion in our selection process of an acquisition candidate.



We are not prohibited from pursuing an initial business combination with a company that is affiliated with our sponsor, officers or directors. In the event we seek to complete our initial business combination with such a company, we, or a committee of independent directors, would obtain (i) an opinion from an independent investment banking firm or another independent entity that commonly renders valuation opinions on the type of target business we seek to acquire that such an initial business combination is fair to our unaffiliated stockholders from a financial point of view and (ii) the approval of a majority of our disinterested and of our independent directors.



Selection of a Target Business and Structuring of a Business Combination



Subject to the requirement that our initial business combination must be with one or more target businesses or assets having an aggregate fair market value of at least 80% of the value of the trust account (excluding any taxes payable) at the time of the agreement to enter into such initial business combination, our management will have virtually unrestricted flexibility in identifying and selecting one or more prospective target businesses. In any case, we will only consummate an initial business combination in which we become the majority shareholder of the target (or control the target through contractual arrangements in limited circumstances for regulatory compliance purposes as discussed below) or are otherwise not required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act or to the extent permitted by law we may acquire interests in a variable interest entity, in which we may have less than a majority of the voting rights in such entity, but in which we are the primary beneficiary. There is no basis for our stockholders to evaluate the possible merits or risks of any target business with which we may ultimately complete our initial business combination. To the extent we effect our initial business combination with a company or business that may be financially unstable or in its early stages of development or growth (such as a company that has begun operations but is not yet at the stage of commercial manufacturing and sales), we may be affected by numerous risks inherent in such company or business. Although our management will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in a particular target business, we may not properly ascertain or assess all significant risk factors.




11







In evaluating a prospective target business, we expect to conduct a thorough due diligence review that will encompass, among other things, meetings with incumbent management and employees, document reviews, interviews of customers and suppliers, inspection of facilities, as well as a review of financial and other information which will be made available to us.



The time required to select and evaluate a target business and to structure and complete our initial business combination, and the costs associated with this process, are not currently ascertainable with any degree of certainty. Any costs incurred with respect to the identification and evaluation of a prospective target business with which a business combination is not ultimately completed will result in our incurring losses and will reduce the funds we can use to complete another business combination. We will not pay any finders or consulting fees to members of our management team, or any of their respective affiliates, for services rendered to or in connection with our initial business combination.



Fair Market Value of Target Business or Businesses



The target business or businesses or assets with which we effect our initial business combination must have a collective fair market value equal to at least 80% of the value of the trust account (excluding any taxes payable) at the time of the agreement to enter into such initial business combination. If we acquire less than 100% of one or more target businesses in our initial business combination, the aggregate fair market value of the portion or portions we acquire must equal at least 80% of the value of the trust account (excluding taxes payable) at the time of the agreement to enter into such initial business combination. However, we will always acquire at least a controlling interest in a target business. The fair market value of a portion of a target business or assets will likely be calculated by multiplying the fair market value of the entire business by the percentage of the target we acquire. We may seek to consummate our initial business combination with an initial target business or businesses with a collective fair market value in excess of the balance in the trust account. In order to consummate such an initial business combination, we may issue a significant amount of debt, equity or other securities to the sellers of such business and/or seek to raise additional funds through a private offering of debt, equity or other securities. If we issue securities in order to consummate such an initial business combination, our stockholders could end up owning a minority of the combined company’s voting securities as there is no requirement that our stockholders own a certain percentage of our company (or, depending on the structure of the initial business combination, an ultimate parent company that may be formed) after our business combination. Because we have no specific business combination under consideration, we have not entered into any such arrangement to issue our debt or equity securities and have no current intention of doing so.



The fair market value of a target business or businesses or assets will be determined by our board of directors based upon standards generally accepted by the financial community, such as actual and potential gross margins, the values of comparable businesses, earnings and cash flow, book value, enterprise value and, where appropriate, upon the advice of appraisers or other professional consultants. Investors will be relying on the business judgment of our board of directors, which will have significant discretion in choosing the standard used to establish the fair market value of a particular target business. If our board of directors is not able to independently determine that the target business or assets has a sufficient fair market value to meet the threshold criterion, we will obtain an opinion from an unaffiliated, independent investment banking firm or another independent entity that commonly renders valuation opinions on the type of target business we seek to acquire with respect to the satisfaction of such criterion. Notwithstanding the foregoing, unless we consummate a business combination with an affiliated entity, we are not required to obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm, or another independent entity that commonly renders valuation opinions on the type of target business we seek to acquire, that the price we are paying is fair to our stockholders.



Competition



In identifying, evaluating and selecting a target business for our initial business combination, we may encounter intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours, including other blank check companies, private equity groups and leveraged buyout funds, and operating businesses seeking strategic acquisitions. Many of these entities are well established and have significant experience identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates. Moreover, many of these competitors possess greater financial, technical, human and other resources than us. Our ability to acquire larger target businesses will be limited by our available financial resources. This inherent limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the acquisition of a target business. Furthermore, the requirement that we acquire a target business or businesses having a fair market value equal to at least 80% of the value of the trust account (excluding any taxes payable) at the time of the agreement to enter into the business combination, our obligation to pay cash in connection with our public stockholders who exercise their redemption rights and the number of our outstanding warrants and the future dilution they potentially represent, may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses. Any of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating our initial business combination.





12







Management Operating and Investment Experience



We believe that our executive officers possess the experience, skills and contacts necessary to source, evaluate, and execute an attractive business combination. See the section titled “Management” for complete information on the experience of our officers and directors. Notwithstanding the foregoing, our officers and directors are not required to commit their full time to our affairs and will allocate their time to other businesses. We presently expect each of our employees to devote such amount of time as they reasonably believe is necessary to our business (which could range from only a few hours a week while we are trying to locate a potential target business to a majority of their time as we move into serious negotiations with a target business for a business combination). The past successes of our executive officers and directors do not guarantee that we will successfully consummate an initial business combination.



As more fully discussed in “Conflicts of Interest,” if any of our officers or directors becomes aware of a business combination opportunity that falls within the line of business of any entity to which he has pre-existing fiduciary or contractual obligations, he may be required to present such business combination opportunity to such entity, subject to his or her fiduciary duties under Delaware law, prior to presenting such business combination opportunity to us. Most of our officers and directors currently have certain pre-existing fiduciary duties or contractual obligations.



Emerging Growth Company Status and Other Information



We are an “emerging growth company,” as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act, as modified by the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act. As such, we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not “emerging growth companies” including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. If some investors find our securities less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our securities and the prices of our securities may be more volatile.



In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an “emerging growth company” can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an “emerging growth company” can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We intend to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period.



We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (1) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following the fifth anniversary of the completion of the IPO, (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.07 billion, or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our Common Stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the prior December 31, and (2) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt securities during the prior three-year period. References herein to “emerging growth company” shall have the meaning associated with it in the JOBS Act.



Employees



We currently have two executive officers. These individuals are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters but they intend to devote as much of their time as they deem necessary to our affairs until we have completed our initial business combination. The amount of time they will devote in any time period will vary based on whether a target business has been selected for our initial business combination and the stage of the business combination process we are in. We do not intend to have any full time employees prior to the consummation of our initial business combination.
