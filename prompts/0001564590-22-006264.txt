 STAAR Surgical Company designs, develops, manufactures, and sells implantable lenses for the eye and delivery systems used to deliver the lenses into the eye. We are the leading manufacturer of lenses used worldwide in corrective or “refractive” surgery. We have been dedicated solely to ophthalmic surgery for over 30 years.  Our goal is to position our refractive lenses throughout the world as primary and premium solutions for patients seeking visual freedom from wearing eyeglasses or contact lenses while achieving excellent visual acuity through refractive vision correction. We also make lenses for use in surgery that treats cataracts.  Unless the context indicates otherwise, “we,” “us,” the “Company,” and “STAAR” refer to STAAR Surgical Company and its consolidated subsidiaries.
 A glossary explaining many of the technical terms used in this report begins on page 14. The reader may also find it helpful to refer to the discussion of the structure and function of the human eye that begins on page 7.
 Operations
 STAAR has significant operations globally. Activities outside the United States (U.S.) accounted for 96% of our total sales in fiscal year 2021, primarily due to the pacing of product approvals and commercialization that tend to occur first outside the United States. STAAR sells its products in more than 75 countries, with direct distribution (i.e., via STAAR representatives) in Japan, Germany, Spain, the U.S., Canada, the U.K. and Singapore, with a combination of direct distribution and independent distribution (i.e., via distributors and STAAR representatives) in China, Korea, India, France, Benelux, and Italy, and with independent distribution in the remainder of the countries where we sell.
 STAAR maintains operational and administrative facilities in the U.S., Switzerland, and Japan. Its current global operations are as follows:
  
• | United States. STAAR operates its global administrative offices and principal manufacturing facility in Monrovia, California. The Monrovia manufacturing facility primarily makes the Visian implantable Collamer lens product family, including the EVO Visian ICL (collectively referred to as ICLs), preloaded silicone cataract intraocular lenses (IOLs), and injector systems. We manufacture the raw material for Collamer lenses in our facility in Aliso Viejo, California. STAAR also operates a Technology Center housing its Research & Development team and labs in Tustin, California. STAAR’s facility in Lake Forest, California serves as our corporate headquarters. It contains executive offices and operational facilities we expect to use for future manufacturing of STAAR’s Presbyopia lenses, EVO Viva.

 EVO Visian ICL, EVO Viva ICL, and Visian ICL.  Refractive surgery corrects visual disorders that eyeglasses or contact lenses have traditionally treated (myopia, hyperopia, astigmatism, and presbyopia). The field of refractive surgery includes both lens-based procedures, using products like our ICL, and laser-based procedures like LASIK. The ICL product line treats a wide range of refractive errors within commonly known vision disorders such as myopia (nearsightedness), hyperopia (farsightedness), astigmatism and presbyopia.
 The ICL folds for minimally invasive implantation behind the iris and in front of the natural crystalline lens, using techniques similar to those used to implant an IOL during cataract surgery, except that the natural lens remains intact in the eye. Lenses of this type are generically called “phakic IOLs” or “phakic implants” because they work along with the patient’s natural lens, or phakos, rather than replacing it. The surgeon typically implants the ICL using topical anesthesia on an outpatient basis. The patient usually experiences immediate vision improvement within a day.
 Our ICL is the only posterior chamber phakic IOL (PIOL) approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for marketing and sale in the U.S., and we believe it is the world’s largest selling phakic IOL. Our biocompatible Collamer material belongs to a family of materials known as collagen copolymers. Collagen copolymers are compounds formed by joining molecules of collagen derived from biological sources with synthetic monomer molecules. The proprietary Collamer material is exclusive to us. We believe that the biocompatibility of the Collamer material used for the ICL product line is a significant factor in the ability to place this lens safely in the posterior chamber of the eye. 
 The ICL has been implanted into more than 1,000,000 eyes worldwide. STAAR began selling the ICL for myopia for use outside the U.S. in 1997. U.S. sales commenced in 2006. In September 2011, STAAR launched the ICL with CentraFLOW technology, which uses a port in the center of the ICL optic in markets outside the U.S. The port is of a size intended to optimize the flow of fluid within the eye without affecting the quality of vision.  The central port also eliminates the need for the surgeon to perform a YAG peripheral iridotomy procedure days before the ICL implant. The CentraFLOW technology makes the visual outcomes of the ICL available through a simpler and more comfortable surgical implantation experience. We are authorized to sell the ICL with CentraFLOW technology in the following ex-U.S. regions:  the approximately 31 countries that require the European Union CE Mark, China, Canada, Korea, Japan, India, Argentina, Singapore, and several countries in the Middle East. In December 2015, we received the CE Mark for EVO+, an ICL with CentraFLOW technology and an expanded optical zone of up to 20%. We believe the expanded optical zone may further improve certain patients’ visual experience, thus making the ICL increasingly desirable for both patients and ophthalmic surgeons. We are authorized to sell the EVO+ in the following ex-U.S. regions:  the approximately 31 countries that require the European Union CE Mark, Korea, Japan, India, Canada, Hong Kong, Turkey, and several countries in the Middle East.  The Hyperopic ICL, which treats far-sightedness, is sold primarily in countries that require the European Union CE Mark. In July 2020, we received the CE Mark for EVO Viva, a presbyopia-correcting ICL with an aspheric EDOF optic. We commenced a limited launch of the EVO Viva lens in Spain, Belgium and Germany. The EVO Viva lens adds near and intermediate vision correction for patients with presbyopia. We believe the EVO Viva lens will assist certain patients with eliminating the burdens of reading glasses or frequent replacement contact lenses. Typically, ICL surgery is an elective procedure paid for or financed by the patient.
 Globally, the ICL is available for myopia and hyperopia and is available in multiple models, powers and lengths totaling hundreds of different types of inventoried lenses. This requires us to carry a significant amount of inventory to meet customer preference for rapid delivery.  The Toric ICL (TICL), which also corrects for astigmatism, is 
 3

available for myopia in the same powers and lengths and carries additional parameters of cylinder and axis. The EVO Viva lens is available for myopia in the same powers and lengths and carries additional parameters relating to presbyopia correction. 
According to Market Scope, LLC a publisher of ophthalmic industry data, approximately 4.2 million refractive procedures, primarily laser vision procedures, were performed worldwide in 2021. The incidence of myopia is growing globally, with high myopia becoming more common according to recently published articles, affecting nearly 5 billion and 1 billion people, respectively, by 2050 (Global Prevalence of Myopia and High Myopia and Temporal Trends from 2000 through 2050, Ophthalmology, Vol. 123, No. 5, May 2016; Global trends in myopia management attitudes and strategies in clinical practice, Contact Lens and anterior Eye, Vol. 39, 2016).  We believe this will result in a significantly increased number of patients seeking refractive procedures. We believe that over the past decade negative publicity regarding LASIK has reduced patient interest in the LASIK procedure. The ICL is a lens-based refractive procedure (unlike LASIK) with over 1,000,000 ICLs implanted to date. Surgeons have published over 100 peer-reviewed articles with clinical data regarding the safety, effectiveness, and visual quality of the ICL. We believe the ICL provides a safe and effective solution for the growing number of myopic patients who will seek visual freedom from eyeglasses and contact lenses.
 We plan to continue to develop and launch innovative products to support clinical needs and to address the increasing demands of our customers. As part of our sales and marketing efforts, we attend and participate in major ophthalmic conventions around the world and invest in market development, practice support, healthcare professional training and patient outreach. We have started working more closely with leading refractive clinics in the area of training, product awareness and practice development. Our marketing programs seek to position the ICL as a premium and primary option for appropriate patients at the clinic and via digital and social media.
 In September 2018, the FDA granted approval of our PMA Supplement for the Visian Toric ICL for the correction of myopia with astigmatism for marketing and sale in the United States.  In August 2019, the FDA notified us that it had determined that STAAR had provided sufficient data to support initiation of a human clinical study in the United States of the EVO/EVO+ VISIAN® Implantable Collamer® Lens for Myopia, and EVO/EVO+ VISIAN® Toric Implantable Collamer® Lens for Myopia with Astigmatism. In November 2020, we completed enrollment for the primary study analysis cohort of 300 subjects in our U.S. EVO clinical trial. In April 2021, we submitted clinical data to the FDA to support a marketing approval for our EVO family of myopia lenses. Our submission remains under interactive review with the FDA.    
 Sales of ICLs (including EVO+ and TICLs) accounted for approximately 92% of our total sales in fiscal 2021, 87% of our total sales in fiscal 2020 and 86% of our total sales in fiscal 2019.
 Other Products
 Intraocular Lenses (IOLs). We sell in parts of Asia and parts of Europe a “Preloaded Injector” with an acrylic IOL packaged and shipped in a pre-sterilized, disposable injector ready for use in cataract surgery. We also sell a silicone lens-based Preloaded Injector in Japan. We believe the Preloaded Injector offers surgeons improved convenience and reliability. The acrylic lens-based Preloaded Injector uses a lens supplied by a third party. The supplier also assembles and sells the acrylic Preloaded Injector under its own brand, using injector parts purchased from us. 
 The silicone lens-based Preloaded Injector uses a lens produced and marketed by STAAR. This line of foldable cataract IOLs is manufactured from silicone in a three-piece design with Polyimide loop haptics attached to the optic, they are largely aspheric cataract IOLs that use optical designs that produce a clearer image than traditional spherical lenses, especially in low light. 
 In most of the countries where STAAR sells cataract IOLs, government agencies reimburse most or all of the cost of cataract surgery and IOLs. Government agencies continue to reduce the reimbursement rates for cataract surgery and IOLs. In response, we continue to assess and rationalize our low margin cataract IOLs. For example, during the fourth quarter of 2019, we decided to phase out our nanoFLEX IOL, a single piece aspheric cataract IOL and to only sell our silicone lens-based Preloaded Injector in Japan.
 Sales of cataract IOLs accounted for approximately 6% of our total sales in fiscal 2021, 8% of our total sales in fiscal 2020 and 11% of our total sales in fiscal 2019.
 Other Surgical Products.  We sell injector parts to our acrylic lens supplier for their preloaded acrylic cataract IOL that they sell under their own brand. Also, we sell other related instruments and devices that we manufacture, or 
 4

that are manufactured by others. Generally, these products have lower overall gross profit margins relative to our ICLs and cataract IOLs. Sales of other surgical products accounted for approximately 2% of our total sales in fiscal 2021, 5% of our total sales in fiscal 2020 and 3% of our total sales in fiscal 2019.
 Sources and Availability of Raw Materials
 STAAR uses a wide range of raw materials in the production of its products. STAAR purchases most of the raw materials and components from external suppliers. Some of our raw materials are single-sourced due to regulatory constraints, cost effectiveness, availability, quality, and vendor reliability issues. Many of our components are standard parts or materials and are available from a variety of sources. We do not typically pursue regulatory and quality certification of multiple sources of supply.
Patents, Trademarks, and Licenses
 We strive to protect our investment in the research, development, manufacturing, and marketing of our products through the use of patents, trademarks, licenses, trade secrets, and copyrights. We own or have rights to a number of patents, licenses, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, know-how and other intellectual property related and important to our business. As of December 31, 2021, we owned approximately 65 United States and foreign patents and had 27 patent applications pending. We rely more on trade secrets than patents and believe that no particular patent is so important that its loss or expiration would materially adversely affect our operations as a whole. 
 Our intellectual property generally relates to the design, production, and manufacture of the Collamer lens material and related materials, ICLs and related lenses, cataract IOLs, and lens delivery systems for folding intraocular lenses (injectors and cartridges, both stand-alone and preloaded) used with ICLs and cataract IOLs. We believe it would require extensive time and effort for a competitor to duplicate our intellectual property and processes to develop a product with comparable capabilities to our ICL product lines.
 Worldwide, we sell all of our major products under trademarks we consider to be important to our business. STAAR®, EVO Visian ICL™, EVO Viva™, Evolution in Visual Freedom®, Visian®, Collamer®, CentraFLOW®, and AquaPORT®,  are trademarks or registered trademarks of STAAR in the U.S., the European Union, or other countries. The scope and duration of trademark protection varies widely throughout the world. In some countries, trademark protection continues only as long as the mark is used. Other countries require registration of trademarks and the payment of registration fees. Trademark registrations are generally for fixed but renewable terms.
 We protect our proprietary technology, in part, through confidentiality and nondisclosure agreements with employees, consultants, and other parties. Our confidentiality agreements with employees and consultants generally contain standard provisions requiring those individuals to assign to STAAR, without additional consideration, inventions conceived or reduced to practice by them while employed or retained by STAAR, subject to customary exceptions. We cannot provide any assurance that employees and consultants will abide by the confidentiality or other terms of their agreements. Despite measures taken to protect our intellectual property, unauthorized parties may copy aspects of our products or obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary.
 Seasonality
 While certain individual markets may be impacted by seasonal trends on a quarterly basis, in the aggregate, seasonality does not materially affect our sales.
 Working Capital Requirements
 There are no special inventory requirements or credit terms extended to customers that have a material adverse effect on our working capital.
 Distribution and Customers
 We market our products to a variety of health care providers, including ophthalmic surgeons, vision centers, surgical centers, hospitals, government facilities, and distributors. The primary user of our products is an ophthalmologist.
 We sell our products directly through our own sales representatives in Japan, Germany, Spain, the U.S., Canada, the U.K. and Singapore. We sell through a combination of our own representatives and independent distributors in China, Korea, India, France, Benelux, and Italy. We sell through independent distributors in other countries.  Our products are sold in more than 75 countries worldwide. We maintain a global marketing team, as well as regional marketing personnel to support the promotion and sale of our products. The global marketing 
 5

department supports selling efforts by developing and providing promotional materials, speakers’ programs, digital and social media sites, participation in trade shows and technical presentations. Where we distribute products directly, we rely on local sales representatives to help generate sales by promoting and demonstrating our products with physicians. In the U.S., we also rely on independent sales representatives to sell our products under the supervision of directly employed sales managers. Our clinical affairs personnel provide training and educational courses globally.
 One customer, Shanghai Lansheng, our China distributor who sells into China and Hong Kong, accounted for approximately 47% of our consolidated net sales during fiscal 2021.  Net sales to Shanghai Lansheng during each of the last three fiscal years were as follows: 
 
 
Net Sales to Shanghai Lansheng
------------------------------
Fiscal Year | Net Sales ($, in thousands) | | Net Sales as Percentage of Consolidated Net Sales
2021 | $ | 107,333 | | 46.6 | %
2020 | $ | 71,692 | | 43.9 | %
2019 | $ | 64,820 | | 43.2 | %

Backlog 
 We generally keep sufficient inventory on hand to ship product immediately or shortly after receipt of an order. The ICL is manufactured to address refractive prescriptions across a broad range of correction, resulting in a large number of Stock Keeping Units (SKUs).  The challenge of maintaining inventory in all models can result in a backlog in customer orders.  In 2021, COVID-19 related issues and production output challenges impacted us and resulted in backlog of over 20,000 lenses at the end of the fourth quarter.  We continue to focus on meeting the significant level of demand for our ICL lenses and achieving standard inventory level requirements in 2022.
Government Contracts
 No material portion of our business is subject to renegotiation of profits or termination of any particular contract or subcontract at the election of the U.S. Government.
Competition
 Competition in the ophthalmic surgical product market is intense and is primarily driven by technological innovation and the regulatory approval required to commercialize products in the key markets around the world. The development of new or improved products may make existing products less attractive, reduce them to commodity status or even make them obsolete. To remain competitive, companies such as STAAR must devote continued efforts and significant financial resources to enhance their existing products and to develop new products.
 In the refractive market, our ICL technology competes with other elective surgical procedures such as laser vision correction (e.g., LASIK) for those consumers who are looking for an alternative to eyeglasses or contact lenses to correct their vision. In the cataract surgery market, our IOLs primarily compete based on our technology’s quality and value.
 We believe our primary competition in selling the ICL to patients seeking surgery to correct refractive conditions lies not in similar products to the ICL, but in laser surgical procedures.  Alcon (formerly a part of Novartis), Johnson & Johnson (formerly Advanced Medical Optics or AMO), Bausch Health Companies (formerly Valeant, Bausch & Lomb or B+L), and Carl Zeiss Meditec AG, all market lasers for corneal refractive surgery and promote their sales worldwide.  
 Phakic implants that compete with the ICL are also available in the marketplace. The two principal types of phakic IOLs are (1) posterior chamber designs like the ICL, and (2) iris clip anterior chamber PIOLs like the Artisan® and Artiflex® lenses made by Ophtec. We believe the ICL has compelling clinical advantages over the other lenses, which are reflected in our strong market share of the global phakic IOL market. The ICL is the only foldable, minimally invasive PIOL approved for sale in the U.S. In addition, competitors from Asia are beginning to appear in the market with their low-cost version of a posterior chamber implantable contact lens, increasing the level of competition.

The global cataract IOL market is highly concentrated, with the top five competitors (Alcon, Johnson & Johnson, Hoya, Bausch & Lomb and Carl Zeiss Meditec) combined accounting for approximately % of total market revenue, according to a 202 report by Market Scope.
 The Human Eye
 The following discussion provides background information on the structure, function, and some of the disorders of the human eye to enhance the reader’s understanding of our products described in this report. The human eye is a specialized sensory organ capable of receiving visual images and transmitting them to the visual center in the brain. The eye has an anterior segment and a posterior segment that are separated by the natural crystalline lens.
 The anterior segment consists of the cornea, the iris and ciliary body and the trabecular meshwork. It is filled with a water-based fluid called aqueous humor and is divided, by the iris, into an anterior chamber and a posterior chamber. The cornea is a clear lens at the front of the eye through which light first passes and is focused towards the back of the eye. The interior surface of the cornea is lined with a single layer of flat, tile-like endothelial cells, whose function is to maintain the transparency of the cornea. The iris is a pigmented muscular curtain located behind the cornea which opens and closes to regulate the amount of light entering the eye through the pupil, an opening at the center of the iris. The crystalline lens, located behind the iris, completes the focusing of light and can change shape to focus objects at different distances onto the retina, located in the back of the eye. The trabecular meshwork, a drainage channel located between the iris and the surrounding white portion of the eye, maintains a normal pressure in the anterior chamber of the eye by draining excess aqueous humor.
 The posterior segment of the eye that is behind the natural lens is filled with a jelly-like material called the vitreous humor. The retina is a layer of nerve tissue in the back of the eye consisting of millions of light receptors called rods and cones, which receive the light image and transmit it to the brain via the optic nerve.
 Common visual disorders, disease or trauma can affect the eye. One of the most prevalent ocular disorders is cataracts. Cataract formation is generally an age-related disorder that involves the hardening and loss of transparency of the natural crystalline lens, impairing visual acuity.
 Refractive disorders, which generally are not age-related, include myopia, hyperopia, and astigmatism. A normal, well-functioning eye receives images of objects at varying distances from the eye and focuses the images on the retina. Refractive errors occur when the eye’s natural optical system does not properly focus an image on the retina. Myopia, also known as nearsightedness, occurs when the eye’s lens focuses images in front of the retina. Hyperopia, or farsightedness, occurs when the eye’s lens focuses images behind the plane of the retina. Individuals with myopia or hyperopia may also have astigmatism. Astigmatism is due to an irregular curvature of the cornea or defects in the natural lens that causes light to not focus at a single depth in the eye resulting in blurred vision. Presbyopia is an age-related refractive disorder that limits a person’s ability to see in the near and middle-distance range as the natural crystalline lens loses its elasticity, reducing the eye’s ability to accommodate or adjust its focus for varying distances.
 Regulatory Matters
 Nearly all countries where we sell our products have regulations requiring premarket clearance or approval of medical devices by governmental or regulatory authorities. Various federal, state, local and foreign laws also apply to our operations, including, among other things, working conditions, laboratory, clinical, advertising and promotions, and design and manufacturing practices, and the use and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances.
 The requirements for clearance or approval to market medical products vary widely by country. The requirements range from minimal requirements to rigorous requirements comparable to those established by the FDA. Obtaining clearance or approval to distribute medical products is complex, costly, and time-consuming in virtually all the major markets where we sell medical devices. We cannot give any assurance that any new medical devices we develop will be cleared or approved in any country where we propose to sell our medical devices or, if approved, whether such approvals will be granted in a timely or cost-effective manner, be as broad in scope as we seek, or be conditioned on post-market study requirements or restrictive labeling. We also cannot give any assurance that if our medical devices are approved for sale in a country, subsequent action will not be taken by the responsible regulatory authorities in the country with respect to our medical devices that might affect our ability to maintain the required approvals in the country or to continue to sell our medical devices in the country.  The regulatory requirements in our most important current markets, China, Europe, Japan, Korea and the U.S., are discussed below.

Regulatory Requirements in the United States.
 Under the United States Federal Food, Drug & Cosmetic Act, as amended (the Act), the FDA has the authority to regulate, among other things, the design, development, manufacturing, preclinical and clinical testing, labeling, product safety, marketing, sales, distribution, premarket clearance and approval, recordkeeping, reporting, advertising, promotion, post-market surveillance, and import and export of medical devices.
 Most of our products are classified as medical devices intended for human use within the meaning of the Act and, therefore, are subject to FDA regulation.
 Each medical device we seek to commercially distribute in the United States must first receive clearance to market under a notification submitted pursuant to Section 510(k) of the Act, known as the 510(k) premarket notification, or premarket approval (PMA) from the FDA, unless specifically exempted by the agency or subject to another form of FDA premarket review. The FDA classifies all medical devices into one of three classes. The FDA establishes procedures for compliance based upon the device’s classification as Class I (general controls, such as establishment registration and device listing with FDA, labeling and record-keeping requirements), Class II (performance standards in addition to general controls) or Class III (premarket approval (PMA) required before commercial marketing). Devices deemed to pose lower risk are categorized as either Class I (low risk) or II (moderate risk). Manufacturers of Class II devices are generally required to submit to the FDA a 510(k) premarket notification requesting clearance of the device for commercial distribution in the United States. Most low risk (Class I) devices and some Class II devices are exempt from this requirement. The FDA deems Class III devices to pose the greatest risk and are the most extensively regulated. These devices include life-supporting, life sustaining, or implantable devices, or devices deemed not substantially equivalent to a previously 510(k) cleared device. The effect of assigning a device to Class III is to require each manufacturer to submit to the FDA a PMA that includes information on the safety and effectiveness of the device. The FDA reviews device applications and notifications through its Office of Device Evaluation (ODE).
 510(k) Clearance. Our lens injector systems are Class I devices subject to the 510(k) premarket review and clearance process. A medical device that is substantially equivalent to either a previously-cleared medical device or a device that was in commercial distribution before May 28, 1976 for which the FDA has not yet called for the submission of a PMA, or is a device that has been reclassified from Class III to either Class II or I may be eligible for the FDA’s 510(k) premarket notification process. FDA clearance under Section 510(k) of the Act does not imply that the safety, reliability, and effectiveness of the medical device has been approved or validated by the FDA. The review period and FDA determination as to substantial equivalence generally takes from three to twelve months from the date the application is submitted and filed. However, the process may take significantly longer, and clearance is never assured. Although many 510(k) premarket notifications are cleared without clinical data, in some cases, the FDA requires significant clinical data to support substantial equivalence. In reviewing a premarket notification, the FDA may request additional information including clinical data, which may significantly prolong the review process.
 After a device receives 510(k) clearance, any modification that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a major change in its intended use, will require a new 510(k) clearance or could require premarket approval. The FDA requires each manufacturer to make its own initial determination as to whether a change meets this threshold. However, the FDA can review any such decision and can disagree with a manufacturer’s determination. If the FDA disagrees with a manufacturer’s determination, the FDA can require the manufacturer to cease marketing or recall the modified device until 510(k) clearance or a PMA is obtained. 
 Premarket Approval. Our ICLs and IOLs are Class III devices subject to the PMA approval process and not 510(k) clearance.  The more rigorous PMA process requires us to demonstrate that a new medical device is safe and effective for its intended use. The FDA may require that a PMA be supported by, among other things, extensive technical, pre-clinical, clinical testing, manufacturing, and labeling data to demonstrate to the FDA’s satisfaction, the safety and effectiveness of the device.
 After a PMA application is submitted and filed, the FDA begins an in-depth review of the submitted information, which typically takes between one and three years, but may take significantly longer. During the review period, the FDA may request additional information or clarification of information already provided. In addition to its own review, the FDA may organize an independent advisory panel of experts to review the PMA whenever a device is the first of its kind or the FDA otherwise determines panel review is warranted. The FDA holds panels on a regular basis, but the need to schedule panel review usually adds some weeks or months to the review process. In addition, the FDA will conduct a pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility to ensure compliance with Quality System Regulation (QSR) which imposes elaborate design, development, testing, control, validation, 
 8

documentation, complaint handling, supplier control, and other quality assurance procedures in the design and manufacturing process. The FDA may approve a PMA application with post-approval conditions intended to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device including, among other things, restrictions on labeling, promotion, sale and distribution and conduct of additional post-approval clinical studies or collection of long-term follow-up from patients in the clinical study that supported approval. Failure to comply with the conditions of approval can result in materially adverse enforcement action, including the loss or withdrawal of the approval.
 If a manufacturer plans to make significant modifications to the manufacturing process, labeling, or design of an approved PMA device, the manufacturer must submit an application called a “PMA Supplement” regarding the change. The FDA generally reviews PMA Supplements on a 180-day agency timetable, which may be extended if significant questions arise in review of the supplement. A manufacturer may implement limited changes prior to the FDA’s review of a PMA Supplement. The FDA designates some PMA Supplements as “panel-track” supplements, which means that the agency believes review by an advisory panel may be warranted. Designation as a panel-track supplement does not necessarily mean that panel review will occur.
 Clinical or Market Trials. A clinical trial is typically required to support a PMA application and is sometimes required for a 510(k) premarket notification. Clinical trials conducted to support premarket clearance or approval generally require submission of an application for an Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) to the FDA. Appropriate data must support the IDE application, such as animal and laboratory testing results, showing that it is safe to test the device in humans and that the investigational protocol is scientifically sound. The IDE application must be approved by the FDA for a specified number of patients, unless the product is deemed eligible for more abbreviated IDE requirements. Clinical trials for a significant risk device may begin once the FDA approves the IDE application. All FDA-regulated clinical studies, whether significant or non-significant risk, must be approved and overseen by the appropriate institutional review boards (IRBs) at the clinical trial sites, and informed consent of the patients participating in the clinical trial must be obtained. After a trial begins, the FDA may place it on hold or terminate it, if, among other reasons, it concludes that the clinical subjects are exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Any trials we conduct in the United States must be conducted in accordance with FDA regulations as well as other federal regulations and state laws concerning human subject protection and privacy. Moreover, the results of a clinical trial may not be sufficient to obtain clearance or approval of the product.
 Oversight of compliance with quality, medical device reporting, clinical study, and other regulations. Both before and after we receive premarket clearance or approval and release a product commercially, we have ongoing responsibilities under FDA regulations. The FDA reviews design and manufacturing practices, labeling and record keeping, product complaints and manufacturer’s required reports of adverse experiences, product corrections and removals, and other information to identify potential problems with marketed medical devices. We are also subject to periodic inspection by the FDA for compliance with the FDA’s QSR and other requirements, such as requirements for advertising and promotion. The Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) regulations for medical devices embodied in the QSR govern the methods used in, and the facilities and controls used for, the design, manufacture, packaging, labeling, and servicing of all finished medical devices intended for human use.
 The FDA’s Bioresearch Monitoring Program (BIMO), reviews our activities as a sponsor of clinical research. BIMO conducts facilities inspections as part of a program designed to ensure that data and information contained in requests for IDEs, PMA applications and 510(k) submissions are scientifically valid, reliable, and accurate. Another objective of the program is to ensure that human subjects are protected from undue hazard or risk during scientific investigations.
 If the FDA were to conclude that we are not in compliance with applicable laws or regulations, or that any of our medical devices are ineffective or pose an unreasonable health risk, the FDA could require us to notify health professionals and others that the devices present unreasonable risk or substantial harm to public health, order a recall, repair, replacement, or refund of the devices, detain, or seize adulterated or misbranded medical devices, or ban the medical devices. The FDA may also issue warning letters or untitled letters, refuse our request for 510(k) clearance or PMA approval, revoke existing 510(k) clearances or PMA approvals previously granted, impose operating restrictions, enjoin, and restrain certain violations of applicable law pertaining to medical devices and assess civil or criminal penalties against our officers, employees, or us. The FDA may also recommend prosecution to the Department of Justice. In the case of devices subject to pending premarket clearance or approval applications, FDA has broad authority to halt the review of applications and require significant additional data analyses, audits, and other corrective actions where clinical data contained in an application are deemed to be actually or potentially unreliable, inaccurate, or not in compliance with clinical study or good clinical practice requirements.

For example, on May 27, 2014, we received a warning letter from the FDA (2014 Warning Letter) citing alleged violations of current good manufacturing practice (cGMP) regulations that were identified by the FDA during an inspection of our manufacturing facility in Monrovia, California between February 10, 2014, and March 21, 2014. On November 14, 2014 and continuing through February 4, 2015, the FDA again inspected our Monrovia facility. On February 4, 2015, at the conclusion of the inspection, the FDA issued an FDA-483 with ten inspectional observations (2015 FDA-483). STAAR responded to the 2014 Warning Letter and the 2015 FDA-483 and implemented its corrective action plans relating to the 2014 Warning Letter and the 2015 FDA-483.  On June 19, 2018, we received a close-out letter from the FDA lifting the 2014 Warning Letter.
 Healthcare Fraud and Abuse Laws and Regulations.
 Even though we do not control referrals of healthcare services or bill directly to Medicare, Medicaid or other third-party payers, certain federal, state and international healthcare laws and regulations pertaining to fraud and abuse and patients’ rights may be applicable to our business. We may be subject to healthcare fraud and abuse and patient privacy regulation by the federal government, the states and the international jurisdictions in which we conduct our business. The regulations that may affect our ability to operate include, without limitation:

• | the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, any person from knowingly and willfully offering, soliciting, receiving, or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, to induce either the referral of an individual, for an item or service or the purchasing or ordering of a good or service, for which payment may be made under federal healthcare programs such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the federal False Claims Act, which prohibits, among other things, individuals, or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, false claims, or knowingly using false statements, to obtain payment from the federal government, and which may apply to entities that provide coding and billing advice to customers;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | federal criminal laws that prohibit executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or making false statements relating to healthcare matters;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the federal physician sunshine requirements under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, which requires manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics, and medical supplies to report annually to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services information related to payments and other transfers of value relating to certain drugs, devices, biologics, and medical supplies to physicians, other healthcare providers, and teaching hospitals, and ownership and investment interests held by physicians and other healthcare providers and their immediate family members;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009, which governs the conduct of certain electronic healthcare transactions and protects the security and privacy of protected health information; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | state and international law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws which may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payer, including commercial insurers; state laws that require device companies to comply with the industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the applicable compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government, or otherwise restrict payments that may be made to healthcare providers and other potential referral sources; state and international laws that require device manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures; and state and international laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, which may differ from each other and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Because of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of the statutory exceptions and safe harbors available, it is possible that some of our business activities could be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws. In addition, recent health care reform legislation has strengthened these laws. For example, the Health Care Reform Law, among other things, amends the intent requirement of the Federal Anti-Kickback Statute and criminal healthcare fraud statutes. A person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it. In addition, the Patient Protection Affordable Care Act provides that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the Federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the False Claims Act.

Regulatory Requirements Outside the United States.
 CE Marking. In the European Economic Area (EEA), which is comprised of the 27 Member States of the European Union plus Norway, Iceland, and Liechtenstein, medical devices must comply with the essential requirements of the EU Medical Devices Directive (Council Directive 93/42/EEC). Compliance with the essential requirements of the EU Medical Device Directive is a prerequisite to be able to affix a Conformité Européenne Mark (CE Mark), without which medical devices cannot be marketed or sold in the EEA. To demonstrate compliance with the essential requirements, medical device manufacturers must undergo a conformity assessment procedure, which varies according to the type of medical device and its classification.
 The method of assessing conformity varies depending on the class of the product, but normally involves a combination of self-assessment by the manufacturer and a third-party assessment by a “Notified Body.” Notified Bodies are a group of private quality-monitoring organizations that are accredited to review medical devices and to monitor quality systems and adverse event reporting. The independent Notified Bodies perform, on a privatized basis, functions similar to the FDA in the U.S. and the Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency (PMDA) in Japan. Our facilities in the United States and Switzerland are subject to regular inspection by a designated Notified Body. Other countries, such as Switzerland and the United Kingdom, have voluntarily adopted laws and regulations that mirror those of the European Union with respect to medical devices, and a number of countries outside of Europe permit importation of devices bearing the CE Mark.
 The European Union regulatory bodies finalized a new Medical Device Regulation (MDR) in 2017, which replaced the existing Directives and provided three years for transition and compliance. The MDR will change several aspects of the existing regulatory framework, such as updating clinical data requirements and introducing new ones, such as Unique Device Identification (UDI). We and the Notified Bodies who will oversee compliance to the new MDR face uncertainties and increased costs as the MDR is rolled out and enforced by the European Commission and EEA Competent Authorities, creating risks in several areas, including the CE Marking process and data transparency, in the upcoming years. In April 2020, the European Parliament postponed implementation of MDR to May 2021 due to the COVID pandemic. The exit of the UK from the European Union (BREXIT) has resulted in the requirement to re-certify our preloaded acrylic IOL under a non-UK Notified Body, and to separately register our CE Marked products for sale in the UK. The failure of Switzerland and the EU to enter into a Mutual Recognition Agreement resulted in a change of our EC Authorized Representative, discontinuance of the pre-loaded acrylic IOL for the Swiss market, and registration of our remaining products under Swiss law.
 We have affixed the CE Mark to all our principal products sold in CE Mark jurisdictions including ICLs, IOLs and injector systems. In July 2017, our Notified Body in the European Union, DEKRA, re-certified the CE Marking for all our currently certified and commercially available medical devices. In March 2018, DEKRA performed audits of our US and Swiss facilities certifying them to EN ISO 13485:2016 as well as to the “Medical Device Single Audit Program” (MDSAP). MDSAP provides for a single audit recognized by Australia, Brazil, Canada, Japan and the United States demonstrating routine compliance with QSR/GMP requirements. DEKRA performed an unannounced audit in December 2018, and surveillance audits in 2019. In 2020, DEKRA audited and approved our new facility in Brugg, Switzerland and completed surveillance audits of all our facilities, reconfirming our compliance to EN ISO 13485:2016 and MDSAP. In 2021, DEKRA conducted audits of our facilities and re-certified them under MDSAP and EN ISO 13485:2016.
 Medical Device Regulation in Japan. The Japanese Ministry of Health, Labor, and Welfare (MHLW) regulates the sale of medical devices under Japan’s Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Act (PMD Act). The Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency (PMDA), a quasi-governmental organization, performs many of the medical device review functions for MHLW. Medical devices generally must undergo thorough safety examinations and demonstrate medical efficacy before the MHLW grants shonin (premarket device approval) or ninsho (premarket certification). Manufacturers and resellers (referred to as Marketing Authorization Holders or MAHs) must also satisfy certain requirements before the MHLW grants a business license, or kyoka. Requirements for manufacturers and MAHs include compliance with Japanese regulations covering GQP (good quality practice) and GVP (good vigilance practice), which largely include conformity to the ISO 13485 standard and are similar to good manufacturing practice and post-market surveillance requirements in the United States, as well as the assignment of internal supervisors over marketing, quality assurance, and safety control.
 Approval for a new medical device that lacks a substantial equivalent in the Japanese market will generally require the submission of clinical trial data. Only a licensed MAH can apply for premarket device approval in Japan, and in most cases, the clinical trial data must include data gathered from Japanese subjects. For example, STAAR Japan conducted a separate clinical trial in Japan for the shonin application for the ICL. Also, approval for a new 
 11

medical device will require the manufacturer to undertake to reexamine the safety and efficacy of the device with a review of post-market data gathered within a certain period - normally four years - after approval. The specific post-market reexamination requirement for a medical device is announced at the time of approval.
 STAAR Japan currently holds shonin approval for the ICL products, preloaded injectors, and their associated lenses, and kyoka licensing as a manufacturer and MAH of medical devices. The sponsor of a clinical trial submitted to the PMDA must strictly follow Good Clinical Practice (GCP) standards, and must follow the trial with standard Good Post-Market Study Practice (GPSP) reporting and a follow-up program. MHLW and PMDA also assess the quality management systems of manufacturers and the conformity of products to the requirements of the PMD Act. STAAR is subject to inspection for compliance by these agencies. A company’s failure to comply with the PMD Act can result in severe penalties, including revocation or suspension of a company’s business license and possible criminal sanctions. If the PMDA were to conclude that we are not in compliance with applicable laws or regulations, or that any of our medical devices are ineffective or pose an unreasonable health risk, they could take a variety of regulatory or legal actions, similar to the FDA, which could have a material and negative impact on the Company.
 Medical Device Regulation in China and Korea. Sales of our products in China and Korea, as in other countries, are also subject to regulatory requirements.  
 In China, medical devices such as our ICLs are mainly regulated by Regulations on the Supervision and Administration of Medical Device (Decree No. 739) promulgated by the State Council. National Medical Products Administration (NMPA) is the governmental authority principally responsible for the supervision and administration of medical devices in China.  
 Each medical device intended for commercial distribution in China is subject to a mandatory filing or registration regime regulated by the NMPA. The classification of such devices mainly determines the filing pathways. China has a three-class classification system, from Class I (lowest risk) to Class III (highest risk). Most of STAAR’s medical devices are Class II and Class III devices and are subject to a restricted registration pathway. Applicants are required to submit a product technical requirements (PTR) document, which shall mainly include the performance indicators and testing methods of the medical device. Also, applicants must have samples of the device tested in a government-recognized lab or submit in-house or qualified third-party testing results. The PTR, test reports, quality system documents, labeling information, together with other registration documents, are submitted to the Center for Medical Device Evaluation (CMDE) division of the NMPA for technical evaluation. 
 If approved, NMPA issues the medical device a registration license valid for five years. The manufacturer submits a renewal application before the license expiration date to renew a medical device’s registration. 
 After approval, in case of substantial changes to the design, raw materials, manufacturing process, and indications, among other things, that may affect the medical device's safety and effectiveness, the manufacturer applies to NMPA for approval of such registration changes. In case of minor changes that do not affect the medical device's safety and effectiveness, the manufacturer submits a change notification to NMPA. 
 While STAAR Surgical AG and STAAR Surgical Company hold the licenses, STAAR China serves as a local agent. The local agent is authorized to submit the registration application materials to NMPA, and provides maintenance support and technical service, oversees the registration and clinical trial process. Under Decree 1, Medical Device Adverse Event Reporting and Reevaluation, the license holder bears the primary responsibility for monitoring medical device adverse events (AEs), and establishing an AE monitoring system. The local agent helps manage AEsin case of device malfunction.  
 The license holder and local agent are responsible for carrying out self-inspection of the quality management system periodically. They are also responsible for identifying, monitoring, and trending adverse events related to the medical device. 
 In Korea, a registration of medical devices such as our ICLs and IOLs is overseen by the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety (MFDS) pursuant to the Medical Device Act. The Medical Device Safety Bureau of the MFDS holds primary responsibility for medical device regulations, while departments within the National Institute of Food and Drug Safety (NIFDS) Evaluation oversee the evaluation and research of medical devices.  Medical devices require registration and/or approval prior to commercialization.  In Korea, medical device classification closely follows the Global Harmonization Task Force (GHTF) Classification guidelines, with Class I, II, III and IV designation ranked from low to high risk categorization. The registration review route depends on the risk classification of the device. Typically, the MFDS requires similar documentation as required to obtain a CE Mark.  Our distributor in Korea is contractually required to obtain, with our assistance, the necessary health registrations, governmental approvals, or 
 12

clearances to import, market and sell our products.  In Korea, we provide our distributor with information and data to obtain appropriate registrations and approvals, and the distributor obtains such registrations. In addition to the device registration, MFDS requires all devices Class II and above to comply with Korean Good Manufacturing Practice (KGMP) quality system standards in order to be marketed in Korea. KGMP standards are based on ISO 13485 quality system standards. However, they are not identical. Therefore, ISO 13485 certificates issued by a notified body in the EU will not be sufficient. To obtain KGMP certification, documents that pertain to all areas of compliance, including design, risk assessment, technical requirements and any other quality system requirements, need to be submitted to an MFDS-authorized third party. Our distributor in Korea submits the application on behalf of STAAR. After the application is submitted, the manufacturing site undergoes either a paper audit or an onsite inspection/audit by an authorized third party and MFDS. Medical device registration licenses do not expire, but the KGPM certificate must be renewed every three years.
 If the NMPA or MFDS were to conclude that we are not in compliance with applicable laws or regulations, or that any of our medical devices are ineffective or pose an unreasonable health risk, they could take a variety of regulatory or legal actions in their respective countries, similar to the FDA, which could have a material and negative impact on the Company.
Third Party Coverage and Reimbursement.
 Health care providers generally rely on third-party payers, including governmental payers such as Medicare and Medicaid, private insurance plans and workers’ compensation plans, to cover and reimburse the cost of medical devices and related services. These third-party payers may deny coverage or reimbursement for a medical device if they determine that the product or procedure using the product was not medically appropriate or necessary and are increasingly challenging the price of medical devices and services.
 Our ICL products generally are not covered by third-party payers, and patients incur out-of-pocket costs for these products and related procedures using our products. Our cataract IOL products used in cataract procedures generally are covered by third-party payers in whole or in part depending upon a variety of factors, including the specific product used and geographic location where the procedure using the covered product is performed. The market for some of our IOL products therefore is influenced by third-party payers’ policies.
  Reimbursement and healthcare payment systems vary significantly by country, and many countries have instituted cost containment initiatives similar to those in the United States. There can be no assurance that third-party coverage and reimbursement will be available or adequate, or that such policies or any future legislation or regulation will not adversely affect the demand for our cataract IOLs or our ability to sell these products at prices we consider adequate.
 Research and Development  
 We focus on furthering technological advancements in the ophthalmic products industry through the development of innovative premium ophthalmic products (lenses and companion delivery systems), materials and designs. We maintain active internal research and development programs. To achieve our business objectives, we will continue our investment in research and development.
 During 2022, we intend to continue our focus on research and development in the following areas:
  
• | Development of presbyopia-correcting ophthalmic medical devices, including models that correct cylinder (i.e., astigmatism), including clinical trials of the same;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Development of preloaded injector systems for ophthalmic medical devices; and

Environmental Matters
 We are subject to federal, state, local and foreign environmental laws, and regulations. We believe that our operations comply in all material respects with applicable environmental laws and regulations in each country where we do business. We do not expect compliance with these laws to affect materially our capital expenditures, earnings, or competitive position. We have no plans to invest in material capital expenditures for environmental control facilities for the remainder of our current fiscal year or for the next fiscal year. We are not aware of any pending actions, litigation or significant financial obligations arising from current or past environmental practices that are likely to have a material adverse impact on our financial position. However, environmental problems relating to our properties could develop in the future, and such problems could require significant expenditures. In addition, we 
 13

cannot predict changes in environmental legislation or regulations that may be adopted or enacted in the future and that may adversely affect us.
 Human Capital
 Our goal is to develop, manufacture and sell ophthalmic products throughout the world as primary and premium solutions for patients seeking visual freedom from wearing eyeglasses or contact lenses while achieving excellent visual acuity through refractive vision correction. To achieve our goal, we continually seek to attract, develop and retain talented people. We strive to make STAAR a diverse, inclusive, safe workplace, with opportunities for employees to grow and develop their careers. We offer competitive compensation and benefits.
 As of December 31, 2021, we had approximately 806 employees, of which 278 were employed outside the U.S.  Of the 806 employees, 692 were regular full-time, 9 were regular part-time and 105 were temporary. In fiscal year 2021, we added approximately 206 employees (including temporary employees) to help keep pace with the growth of our business. Our U.S. overall turnover rate in fiscal year 2021 was approximately 9% (excluding temporary employees), below the overall turnover rate of approximately 17% in the medical device industry. We seek employees who reflect the communities where we conduct operations. In the U.S., currently approximately 50% of our employees are female and approximately 50% are male. The gender ratio for our employees globally is approximately 48% female and 52% male. In the U.S., currently approximately 81% of our employees are from underrepresented populations. In 2021, we formalized a global ESG Steering Committee consisting of cross-functional employees to address environmental, social, and governance issue at STAAR. Among our Board of Directors, three directors are female and four directors are male. Two of the directors on our Board of Directors self-identify as members of underrepresented populations.  
 The health and safety of our employees is a top priority. We created and follow various safety policies and procedures. Also, we offer health insurance and wellness programs. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented numerous changes that we determined were in the best interest of our employees and other stakeholders, and which followed guidelines and regulations of the applicable health authorities. For example, the majority of our employees continue to work from home. We implemented additional safety measures for employees who continue critical on-site work such as health screening, implemented social distancing and personal protective equipment requirements, enhanced cleaning and sanitation procedures, and modified workspaces and break areas to reduce the potential for disease transmission.
 We invest in our employees by offering numerous training opportunities, such as to teach new skills, provide career development opportunities and communicate expectations regarding business conduct and ethics. In addition to salaries, we provide additional compensation and benefits programs (which vary by country) such as cash bonuses, stock awards, a 401(k) plan, health insurance benefits, health savings and flexible spending accounts, paid time off, family leave, and employee assistance programs, among others.
 Code of Ethics
 STAAR has adopted a revised Code of Business Conduct and Ethics that applies to all its directors, officers, and employees. The Code of Business Conduct and Ethics is posted on our website, www.staar.com — Investor Information: Corporate Governance.

 Glossary
 The following glossary is intended to help the reader understand some of the terms used in this Report.
 acrylic – a broadly used family of plastics. Acrylic materials used in IOLs have been both water repelling (hydrophobic) and water-absorbing (hydrophilic). The most popular IOLs in the U.S., Europe and Japan are made of a flexible, water-repellent acrylic material.
 14

aspheric – aspheric lenses are lenses that are designed in a shape that creates a more clearly focused image than traditional spheric lenses. By reducing spherical aberrations, IOLs that feature aspheric optics generally deliver better night vision and contrast sensitivity than spheric IOLs.
 collagen copolymer - compounds formed by joining molecules of collagen derived from biological sources with synthetic monomer molecules. STAAR’s Collamer® is a collagen copolymer engineered specifically for use in implantable lenses.
 contrast sensitivity - the ability to visually distinguish an object from its background.
 crystalline lens – the natural lens that is present in the eye at birth, which is a clear structure, located behind the iris that changes shape to focus light onto the retina.
 excimer laser – a specialized ultraviolet laser used in ophthalmology to cut or shape eye tissue. The excimer laser is used during LASIK and PRK surgery.
 foldable IOL – an intraocular lens made of flexible material, which can be inserted with an injector system through a small incision in minimally invasive cataract surgery.
 haptic – the part of an IOL that contacts the structures of the eye and holds the IOL in place. IOLs in which the haptic is also a part of the optic material is called a single-piece IOL, while IOLs in which the haptics are attached to the optic is called a three-piece IOL.
 hyperopia – the refractive disorder commonly known as farsightedness, which occurs when the eye’s lens focuses images behind the plane of the retina rather than on the retinal surface. An adult with moderate to high hyperopia cannot see close objects without eyeglasses or contact lenses. Because presbyopia often results in the need for reading glasses, it is sometimes confused with farsightedness.
 intraocular – within the eye.
 injector or injector system – a device in the form of a syringe that is used to deliver a foldable IOL into the eye through a slender nozzle in minimally invasive cataract surgery.
 iridotomy – a small hole created in the iris, usually made with a YAG laser. Prior to implantation of some ICL models a YAG peripheral iridotomy is made in an unobtrusive area at the periphery of the iris to ensure continued fluid flow in the eye after implantation. The ICL with CentraFLOW technology, marketed with the brand names EVO and EVO+, have a central port for fluid flow, which eliminates the need for an iridotomy or iridectomy.
 LASIK – an acronym for laser-assisted in-situ keratomileusis, a surgical operation that reshapes the cornea to correct nearsightedness, farsightedness, or astigmatism. LASIK involves first the cutting of a hinged flap to separate the surface layer of the cornea, using a microkeratome (a special blade) or a laser. An excimer laser is then used to ablate tissue and reshape the inner cornea, after which the flap is returned to position.
 myopia – the refractive disorder also known as nearsightedness, which occurs when the eye’s lens focuses images in front of the retina rather than on the retinal surface. A person with myopia cannot clearly see distant objects without eyeglasses or contact lenses.
 ophthalmologist – a surgeon who specializes in the diseases and disorders of the eye and the related visual pathway.
 ophthalmic – of or related to the eye.
 optic – the central part of an IOL or ICL, the part that functions as a lens and focuses images on the retina.
 PRK – an acronym for photorefractive keratectomy, the first type of laser surgical operation to correct nearsightedness, farsightedness, or astigmatism.
 preloaded injector - an IOL packaged and shipped in a pre-sterilized, disposable injector. This differs from the conventional method of packaging IOLs, which requires the surgeon or an assistant to manually load each lens into an injector before surgery.
 presbyopia – an age-related condition in which the crystalline lens loses its ability to focus on both near and far objects. People who have had normal vision will typically begin to need eyeglasses for reading or other close tasks at some point after age 40 due to presbyopia.
 15

QSR - the FDA’s Quality System Regulation, or current Good Manufacturing Practice (cGMP) regulation, includes requirements related to the methods used in, and the facilities and controls used for, designing, manufacturing, packaging, labeling, storing, installing, and servicing of medical devices intended for human use. The regulation sets forth the framework for medical device manufacturers to follow in achieving quality requirements, including requirements related to complaint handling and control of purchased or supplied services, components, and materials bearing on the quality of medical devices.
 RLE – refractive lens exchange, a refractive surgical procedure in which the natural crystalline lens is removed and replaced with an IOL (essentially the same as cataract surgery but performed primarily to address refractive issues not to remove a cataract).
 refractive market – as used in this report “refractive market” means the overall market volume for refractive surgical procedures of all kinds, including LASIK, PRK, RLE, the ICL product family and other phakic IOLs. As used in this report, the term does not include sales of non-surgical products like eyeglasses and contact lenses.
 silicone – a type of plastic often used in implantable devices that is inert, generally flexible and water-repelling.
 single-piece IOL – in a single piece IOL the haptics and the optic are fashioned from a single piece of lens material.
 spheric lenses – a spheric lens has surfaces that are shaped like sections of a sphere. 
 three-piece IOL – a three-piece IOL has a central, disk-shaped optic and two spring-like haptics attached at either side. The haptics are positioned against structures of the eye to hold the IOL in place.
 toric – refers to the shape of a lens designed to correct astigmatism, which has greater refractive power in some sections of the lens than others.
 YAG – an acronym for yttrium-aluminum-garnet, a mineral crystal. Lasers using neodymium-doped yttrium aluminum garnet crystals (Nd:YAG) generate a high-energy beam that can be used in a number of ophthalmic procedures, including creating iridotomies before implantation of some models of the ICL.
