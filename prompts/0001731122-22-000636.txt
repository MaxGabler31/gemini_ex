Item 1. Business.
General
 
Twin Vee PowerCats Co. (“Twin Vee” “we”, ‘us” or the “Company”) is a designer, manufacturer and marketer of recreational and commercial power catamaran boats. We believe our company, founded in 1996, has been an innovator in the recreational and commercial power catamaran industry. Our twin-hull catamaran running surface, known as a symmetrical catamaran hull design, adds to the Twin Vee ride quality by reducing drag, increasing fuel efficiency and offering users a stable riding boat. Twin Vee’s home base operations in Fort Pierce Florida is a 7.5-acre facility with several buildings totaling over 75,000 square feet. We currently employ approximately 143 people.
 
We have organized our business into three operating segments: (i) our gas-powered boat segment, which manufactures and distributes gas-powered boats; (ii) our electric-powered boat segment, which is developing fully electric boats, through our wholly owned subsidiary, Forza X1, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Forza”) and (iii) our franchise segment, which is developing a standard product offering and will be selling franchises across the United States through our wholly owned subsidiary, Fix My Boat, Inc., a Delaware corporation.
 
Our gas-powered boats allow consumers to use them for a wide range of recreational activities including fishing, diving and water skiing and commercial activities including transportation, eco tours, fishing and diving expeditions. We believe that the performance, quality and value of our boats position us to achieve our goal of increasing our market share and expanding the power catamaran boating market. We currently primarily sell our boats through a current network of 19 independent boat dealers in 23 locations across North America and the Caribbean who resell our boats to the end user Twin Vee customers. We continue recruiting efforts for high quality boat dealers and seek to establish new dealers and distributors domestically and internationally to distribute our boats as we grow our production and introduce new models. Our gas-powered boats are currently outfitted with gas-powered outboard combustion engines.
 
Due to the growing demand for sustainable, environmentally friendly electric and alternative fuel commercial and recreational vehicles, our wholly owned subsidiary, Forza, is designing and developing a line of electric-powered catamaran boats ranging in size from 18-feet to 28-feet. Forza’s initial two models, the FX1 Dual Console and FX1 Center Console, are being designed to be 24-foot in length, have an 8’ beam or width and utilize a catamaran hull surface to reduce drag and increase run times. The initial launch of FX1 will include our proprietary single electric outboard motor. Both FX1 models are being designed with advanced high-powered, liquid-cooled battery packs that will be provided by the third-party supplier with whom we have entered into a five year supply agreement and a vehicle control unit with proprietary control software all integrated into a 22” master control touch screen that will be used to control most functions of the boat. We have also filed three design and four utility patent applications with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office relating to, among other things, our propulsion system being developed and boat design.

Business of Our Segments
 
Gas-powered Boats
 
Our gas-powered boat segment, which accounted for 99% of our net revenue in the 2021 fiscal year and 100% of our net revenue in the 2020 fiscal year, is located in Fort Pierce, Florida. We believe our company has been an innovator in the recreational and commercial power catamaran industry. We currently have 14 gas-powered models in production ranging in size from our 24-foot, dual engine, center console to our newly designed 40-foot offshore 400 GFX. Our twin-hull catamaran running surface, known as a symmetrical catamaran hull design, adds to the Twin Vee ride quality by reducing drag, increasing fuel efficiency and offering users a stable riding boat. Twin Vee’s home base operations in Fort Pierce Florida is a 7.5-acre facility with several buildings totaling over 75,000 square feet. We currently employ approximately 143 people.
 
During the 2021 fiscal year, we brought our new 280 GFX and our new 340 GFX models to market. To further the development of our gas-powered boat segment, we have also designed a new 260 GFX and a 400 GFX. With the design complete we are now developing our tooling so we can begin production in 2022.

Twin Vee’s Hull Shape
 
Twin Vee boats are designed for a dry and smooth ride. As a Twin Vee moves through the water, the boat hull has lifting strakes on the side of each hull. Lifting strakes are known to produce lift at the bow of a boat by displacing water, allowing the boat to, in essence, glide above the water rather than lumber through it. Twin Vee’s lifting strakes work to not only create lift, but also to make the ride smoother. The forward motion of a catamaran boat lifts water up towards the top of the tunnel while pushing the water inward to form two counter-flowing vortexes. As these vortexes are being formed, the Twin Vee hull design aerates these vortexes with small air bubbles, which are then compressed at an increasing rate as the vortexes move down the tunnel. It is the kinetic energy stored in these compressed air bubbles, which creates \ a smooth and stable ride. As speed increases, the kinetic energy increases at a non-linear rate as more and more air is induced into the increasingly faster flowing vortexes. The trailing surfaces the Twin Vee hulls are specifically designed to facilitate propulsion efficiency by discharging the kinetic energy and air bubbles from the counter-flowing vortexes upon exiting astern, thus providing the propellers with a steady flow of super clean and highly ordered water.
 
This fact, combined with a catamaran’s soft ride, results in Twin Vee’s renowned efficiency and smooth, seaworthy safety. At speed, the Twin Vee’s displacement hull slices through the water, traveling with the shape of the seas rather than flying over them and experiencing reentry shock. This results in a stable and smooth ride. The following are some benefits of the catamaran, or Twin Vee’s, hull shape.
 
Power Catamaran Hull Benefits
 

● | Catamaran stability. Catamarans have parallel hulls on the outer edges of the boat rather than in the middle, providing superior stability. Twin Vee hulls travel with the wave shapes because the buoyancy is to the outside, resisting the snap roll pendulum motion of deep vee monohulls. A Twin Vee wider footprint negates the effects of rolling seas, making them less likely to capsize and reduce seasickness.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Shallow draft for travelling in “skinny” waters. The weight of the boat is distributed to two hulls for a shallower draft. The shallow draft of the Twin Vee design provides access to areas that conventional hulls cannot reach. With a Twin Vee, you can enjoy the beach and not have to wade in the water to get there.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | More usable deck space. The relatively rectangular design of the Twin Vee expanded deck area allows for more usable deck space than monohulls. Twin Vee boats are wider in the bows providing more open area in open models and bigger berths in cabins. Lounge in the front of a Twin Vee dual console and then jump into a similar-sized monohull.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Single engine get home capability. Twin Vee catamaran hulls do not need planning speed power to travel rapidly on a single engine. Minimum bow rise for greater visibility, a Twin Vee deck is parallel to the water at all speeds allowing you to maintain your line of sight and giving you greater fuel efficiency.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Docking and maneuverability. With the extra separation between the motors, over most mono hull boats, you can cross-clutch the motors and turn or spin the boat up to its own length. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Maintains a plane at lower speed for fuel efficiency. The catamaran hull can maintain a plane at lower speeds and catamaran boats create less drag in turn offering better fuel efficiency and a more economical boat to maintain. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Fish one side of a Twin Vee. Enjoy fishing without the extreme listing of a monohull.

Franchise
 
Our franchise segment is being developed and we plan to utilize a franchise model for marine mechanics across the country.
 
Electric-Powered Boats
 
The mission of Forza is to inspire the adoption of sustainable recreational boating by producing stylish electric sport boats. Forza is focused on the creation, implementation and sale of electric boats utilizing our electric vehicle (“EV”) technology to control and power its boats and proprietary outboard electric motor. Forza’s electric boats are being designed as fully integrated electric boats including the hull, outboard motor and control system.
 
We believe traditional marine manufacturers are at a crossroads and face significant industry-wide challenges. Much like in the automotive industry, the reliance on the gasoline-powered internal combustion engine as the principal marine powertrain technology has raised environmental concerns, created dependence among industrialized and developing nations on oil-primarily imported from foreign countries, exposed consumers to volatile fuel prices, and inhibited innovation in alternative fuel powertrain technologies.
 
To date, Forza has completed the design of two electric boat models and has begun tooling the molds which are required to build the physical fiberglass boat. In addition, Forza has completed the design and prototyping of the electric outboard motor that will be used as the initial propulsion source for its two models. Forza has completed the design and prototyping and has begun testing the boats’ integrated control system. It has also entered into a supply agreement for the supply of the lithium battery packs that it plans to use to power the electric boats. We expect to begin production of the two FX1 electric boats and commence selling to end user customers by the second quarter of 2023. Forza is currently sharing our factory for its production needs and is seeking to raise money in a public offering to invest in building a factory solely for the manufacture of Forza’s fully integrated electric boats.
 
We believe that the boating industry will follow in the footsteps of the electrification of the automotive industry by creating electric boats that meet or exceed the traditional boating consumer’s expectations of price, value and run times. In other words, electric boats must offer a similar experience when compared to traditional gas-powered boat in terms of size, capability and price point.
 
Our Strategy
 
Overall Strategy
 
We intend to capitalize on the thriving broader marine industry through the following strategies:
 
Develop New and Innovative Products in Our Core Market. As an innovator, designer, manufacturer, and marketer of catamaran powerboats, we strive to design new and inventive products that appeal to a broad customer base. We intend to launch a number of new products and features with best-in-class quality, with the goal of increasing sales and significant margin expansion. For example, we currently have 8 gas-powered models in production ranging in size from our 24-foot, dual engine, center console to our newly designed 40-foot offshore 400 GFX. Our twin-hull catamaran running surface, known as a symmetrical catamaran hull design, adds to the Twin Vee ride quality by reducing drag, increasing fuel efficiency, and offering users a stable riding boat. Furthermore, our unique new product development process enables us to renew our product portfolio with innovative offerings at a rate that we believe will be difficult for our competitors to match without significant additional capital investments. We intend to release new products and features multiple times during the year, which we believe enhances our reputation as a cutting-edge boat manufacturer and will drive consumer interest in our products.
 
Increase the Catamaran Power Boat Category Segment. Our near-term product development strategy is to expand our product line to reach underserved segments of the catamaran powerboat category that are distinct from our traditional customer base. With our existing supplier relationships, material agreements, and manufacturing processes, should allow us to offer this product line at an attractive price point for the consumer while sustaining our gross margins and the product attributes critical to the Twin Vee brand.
 
Capture Additional Share from Adjacent Boating Categories. Another focus is to grow our market share is to enhance our ability to introduce new products with increased versatility, functionality, and performance to a more expansive customer base that values boats for both water sports and general recreational boating purposes. We intend to launch several marketing campaigns that will focus on new product launches and help to educate the market on our value proposition to customers.
 
Effectively Manage Dealer Inventory and Further Strengthen Our Dealer Network. We view our dealers as our partners and product champions. Therefore, we will continue to devote significant time and resources to finding high quality dealers and developing and improving their performance over time. We believe the quality and trust in our dealer relationships are more beneficial to our long-term success than the quantity of dealers. We currently have a network of 19 independent boat dealers in 23 locations across North America, the Caribbean and Central America.

Increase Our Sales in International Markets. We believe we have a brand that will have natural growth in international markets. Catamaran powerboats have already been accepted as the norm in many international markets. For example, with catamaran powerboats currently being 5% of the US market, catamaran powerboats make up over 30%, as of 2020, of the Bahamian market. Based on our brand and product offering, as well as out potential distribution strengths, we believe we are well positioned to leverage our reputation and capture additional international sales. We believe that we will increase our international sales by promoting our products in developed markets where we have a dealer base and in international markets where rising consumer incomes are expected to increase demand for recreational products, such as Australia, Europe, Israel, Dubai, and Brazil. We are also developing new product offerings that will specifically target certain product demand from our international consumers and that we believe will drive further sales growth in international markets.
 
EV/Forza Specific Strategy 
 
Forza plans to operate in a fundamentally different manner and structure than traditional marine manufacturers and boat dealers by adopting a direct-to-consumer sales and delivery model. Forza has commenced the design of a dedicated web-based platform and intends to commence the design of a web-based app for sales, deliveries, and service operations to change the personal boat buying and marine service experience through technological innovation, ease of use, and flexibility. Forza plans to utilize the web-based and app platform to connect with customers for an end-to-end experience encompassing everything from buying, financing, delivery, servicing, and training Forza intends to employ an integrated, digital-first strategy that is convenient and transparent for our customers and efficient and scalable to support its growth. Forza believed its approach will enable it to operate more cost effectively, provide a better customer experience and incorporate customer feedback more quickly into our product development and manufacturing processes. Forza believes this strategy will allow it to deliver uncompromised and premium experiences well beyond what is available through the standard dealership model.
 
Forza’s plans for its electric boats include the following strategies:
 

● | Successfully Launch the FX1. Forza believes the successful launch of its first commercially available electric boat is critical to its ability to capitalize on the marine electric vehicle market opportunity and establish itself as leaders in the industry. Forza plans to complete the initial prototype boat by Q2 2022 and to commence commercial scale production in Q2 2023. Forza is currently executing a detailed plan to design, component source, engineer, and manufacture the FX1 and obtain the equipment to support its production.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Invest in Our Infrastructure. Forza is seeking to raise money in a public offering to invest in building a factory solely for the manufacture of Forza’s fully integrated electric boats. 
● | Use a Common Platform to Introduce New Models. Forza intends to design the FX1 with an adaptable platform architecture and common electric powertrain to provide the flexibility to use the FX1 platform to launch subsequent electric boat models cost-efficiently. 
● | Focus on Technological Advancements and Cost Improvement. Forza intends to constantly look for ways to improve upon and further develop our proprietary electric powertrain system while reducing its manufacturing cost. 
● | Build Forza’s Company-Owned Sales and Service Network. Forza X1 is programming and building its expansive and vertically integrated customer-centric web and app platform to connect with customers for an end-to-end experience encompassing everything from buying, financing, delivery, servicing, and training. This customer-centric approach to sales and service will simplify accessing necessary information for potential buyers and current owners in an easily accessible and streamlined online space. 
● | Leverage Industry Advancements in Battery Cells. Forza intends to leverage the substantial investments made globally by battery cell manufacturers to improve power and capacity. 
● | Build and Leverage Strategic Relationships. Forza intends to establish and develop strategic relationships with industry leaders to launch our planned electric boats and sell its electric boat powertrain components. Forza envisions significant inroads with boat manufacturers to retrofit various hull configurations, replacing traditional gas outboard motors and existing boat owners who could retrofit their boats with Forza X1’s outboard motors, controller, and battery packs.

Our Strengths and Competitive Advantages
 
We believe that the following are the key investment attributes of our company:
 
Recognized Brand. We believe the Twin Vee brand is well-known among boating enthusiasts for performance, quality, and value, and that the market recognizes Twin Vee as a brand in the twin hull sport boat category due to the value proposition that our boats deliver.
 
Diverse Product Offering. We are able to attract consumers across multiple categories within the recreational powerboat industry. We currently have eight (8) different catamaran models in production that range from 24-feet to 40-feet long offered at retail prices that start at approximately $65,000 and go up to $860,000.
 
Focus on Innovative Product Offerings. We are currently designing numerous new boat models to meet market demand and grow our business. We are also developing a large off-shore power catamarans with traditional gas-powered engines, the largest Twin Vee to date, the 400 GFX. The 400 GFX is being designed to have a range of over 800 miles and will have the option of being powered by dual or quad engines. In addition, our subsidiary is also designing and engineering an all-electric outboard propulsion system under the name “ELECTRA” for other makes and models of boats.
 
Price Point. Twin Vee has also made investments in infrastructure, and engineering. These investments have resulted in lower material waste, reduced labor hours per boat, reduced re-work, and increased production efficiencies. Therefore, we are able to offer favorable pricing while increasing margins by controlling costs through disciplined engineering and manufacturing processes.
 
Our Markets
 
According to the National Marine Manufacturer’s Association, or NMMA, more than 325,000 new powerboats were sold in 2021, levels the recreational boating industry has not seen since before the Great Recession in 2008. Our core market corresponds most directly to the outboard, twin hull, catamaran and open fisherman category, which we refer to as the sport powerboats category. We believe our addressable market also includes similar and adjacent powerboat categories identified by the NMMA, including center console boats, outboard boats, and all open sport fishing boats. For 2021, US sales of boats, marine products, and services are estimated to total $49 billion, up seven percent from 2020. Retail unit sales of new powerboats specifically increased last year by an estimated 7% compared to 2020. As a result, we believe that total annual addressable market for our products in the US alone is greater than $4.7 billion.
 
In North America, 100 million people go boating every year, according to the U.S. Coast Guard, with 11.9 million recreational vessels registered with the U.S. Coast Guard in 2019. The worldwide recreational boating market size is set to surpass $63 billion by 2026, according to a research report by Global Market Insights, Inc. Within the boating market, there is an outboard motor market and an electric boat market. Our products, including those of our subsidiaries, fall into each of those categories.
 
Outboard Motor Market
 
An outboard motor is a propulsion system for boats, consisting of a self-contained unit that includes engine, gearbox and propeller or jet drive, designed to be affixed to the outside of the boat. As well as providing propulsion, outboards provide steering control, as they are designed to pivot over their mountings and thus control the direction of thrust. Outboard motors tend to be found on smaller watercraft as it is more efficient for larger boats to have an inboard system. Although outboard engines powered by fossil fuels have traditionally dominated this market and continue to do so, electric outboard motors are a relatively new phenomenon that have been growing in step with the growth in the electric boat market. The boats that we sell and manufacture all have outboard motors.
 
According to the NMMA, sales of outboard engines in the United States (which includes outboard motors) increased to a twenty-year high of 329,500 units representing sales market of US $3.4 billion in 2020. Consumer demand for higher-performance engines continued to trend upward in 2020, with double digit gains in sales for engines with 200 and greater horsepower. Engines with over 200 horsepower accounted for a rise in 17.6% compared to 2019, amounting to over 89,000 units sold. Overall, the average horsepower of all outboard engines sold in 2020 reached 126.3 hp, up 48% from the average in 2010 of 85.1 horsepower according to the NMMA.
 
Although many recreational boats can be powered by outboard or inboard motors, many consumers prefer outboard motors. Among the reasons for their preference are that, unlike inboard motors, outboard motors can be easily removed for storage or repairs, they provide more room in the boat as they are attached to the transom outside of the boat, they tend to have a shallower draft and they can be more easily replaced in the event the motor no longer works or a desire to upgrade to a higher horsepower.

Electric Boat Market
 
Although electric boats have been available for over 100 years, interest in them was minimal until the 1990s when the first studies were conducted in the United States following the suspicion that motorboats contaminate aquatic environments significantly through loss of gas and lubrication oil. According to Andre Mele, recreational boats pollute as much as cars and trucks in the United States. In the early 2000’s, 8 million speedboats in the United States released 15 times more pollutants annually into the environment than the oil spill produced by the oil tanker Exxon Valdez in 1989. The sinking of this tanker in Alaska had released 11 million U.S. gallons of hydrocarbons into the environment. After conversion, this means that each boat releases an average of 78 L of hydrocarbons into aquatic environments each year. If that average is still current, we estimate that in 2019 oil losses in the environment via motorboats equaled 150,000 tons of hydrocarbon scaly leaks in Canada (based on 2 million vessels), 750,000 tons of hydrocarbon scaly leaks in the United States (based on 10 million vessels) and 450,000 tons of hydrocarbon scaly leaks in Europe (based on 6 million vessels).
 
This explains why some lakes and bodies of water have recently banned motorboats. The total elimination of gas immediately reduces a very large source of marine pollution, with immediate results that would impact beaches, swimming and the reduction of BOD (biochemical oxygen demand) and DCO (direct chemical oxidation) of ambient water. Specifically, hydrocarbons, similar to the dirt that clings to the walls of a bathtub, contaminate the shores and banks of lakes, rivers and bodies of water, where the development of many living organisms takes place. The ecosystem is then modified with the scarcity or disappearance of certain species.
 
In an effort to tackle air pollution, cities around the world are beginning to ban all gas and diesel fuel powered boats from the center of the city. One of the first cities to implement this change is Amsterdam, Netherlands. This movement to electrically powered boats has been implemented in Venice, where the city has restricted the movement of gas and diesel fuel powered boats, while exempting electrically powered boats.
 
We expect that shifting consumer preferences will result in significant growth in the market for electric boats, especially as the demand for recreational powerboats, in general, remains strong. We estimate many consumers are increasingly willing to consider buying electric-powered boats due to the environmental and economic consequences of using gasoline-powered vehicles, as demonstrated by the increased sales of hybrid and electric automobiles in recent years. In its Electric Vehicle Outlook 2021, Bloomberg NEF estimated that there are currently 12 million passenger electric vehicles on the road. The prevalence of electric-powered boats is likely to follow suit. In an August 2020 Boating Industry online article, the marine-focused magazine indicated that electric boat drives represented about 2% of the market, but hybrid and pure electric boats sales were expected to rise rapidly in the coming years. Specifically, the article cites a report from independent market research company IDTechEx where it examined the electric boat and ship sector. The report estimates that the market for hybrid and pure electric boats and ships would be greater than $20 billion worldwide by 2027, finding that recreational boats is the largest and fastest growing electric marine market in sales number.
 
Our initiative into sustainable marine technologies and products is well-timed. The prevalence of batteries necessary to sustain a marine EV model line is expected to rise and become cheaper. Bloomberg NEF’s Long-Term Electric Vehicle Outlook reports that annual lithium-battery demand has proliferated in recent years and meeting the demand will require unprecedented but achievable increases in materials, components, and cell production. Battery production capacity is expanding as more factories are brought online. Moreover, battery technology that improves power and capacity is being designed, developed, and adopted regularly. According to Bloomberg NEF’s report, it found that the volume-weighted average price of a lithium-ion battery pack fell 13% from 2019 to $137/kWh (kilowatt-hour) in 2020. The report estimates the volume-weighted average cost of battery packs will drop below $100/kW in 2024. The Company is establishing itself in the market at the right time to help keep production costs as low as possible and make our boats affordable for our customers.

Our Dealer Network
 
We primarily sell our gas-powered boats through a network of 19 independent dealers in 23 locations across North America, the Caribbean (one in the Bahamas, Puerto Rico and Cayman Islands) and Central America (Panama City, Panama). We have dealerships in Cape Canaveral, Crystal River, Eastpoint, Fort Myers, Islamorada, Palm Bay, Palm Harbor, Palmetto, Pompano Beach and Stuart, Florida. We also have dealerships in Gulf Shores, Alabama, Norwalk, Connecticut, Vermillion, Ohio, Grasonville, Maryland, Tuckerton, New Jersey, Cedar Point and Goldsboro, North Carolina, San Juan, Puerto Rico, Murrells Inlet, South Carolina and Freeport, Texas. We are always seeking to recruit and establish new dealers and distributors domestically and are striving to develop international distribution.
 
We establish performance criteria that our dealers must meet in order to be part of our network to ensure our dealer network remains strong, which include minimum annual purchase orders. As a member of our network, dealers in North America may qualify for floor plan financing programs, rebates, seasonal discounts, promotional co-op payments and other allowances. We expect this will strengthen our dealers’ ability to sell our products.
 
Approximately 22% of our dealer locations have been with us, for over ten years. For the year ended December 31, 2021, our top five dealers on a consolidated basis accounted for approximately 67% of our total units sold and each of those dealers accounted for over ten percent of the units sold.
 
We consistently review our distribution network to identify opportunities to expand our geographic footprint and improve our coverage of the market. We believe that our diverse product offering and strong market position in each region of the United States helped us capitalize on growth opportunities as our industry recovered from the economic downturn. We have the ability to opportunistically add new dealers and new dealer locations to previously underserved markets and use data and performance metrics to monitor dealer performance. We believe our outstanding dealer network allows us to distribute our products more efficiently than our smaller competitors.
 
We do not have written agreements with our dealers. Prior to the beginning of each year, we establish a minimum number of units that each dealer must acquire based upon indications of interest from the dealers. Payment for the units is made by the dealer or a third-party lender once the boat is manufactured and delivered to the dealer. Dealers are not contractually obligated to purchase any boats. Although to date most dealers have purchased boats for which they have provided indications of interest, we could experience excess inventory and costs if a dealer should choose not to purchase a boat for which it has provided an indication of interest.
 
Floor Plan Financing
 
Our North American dealers often purchase boats through floor plan financing programs with third-party floor plan financing providers. During the year ended December 31, 2021, all of our North American shipments were made pursuant to floor plan financing programs through which our dealers participate. These programs allow dealers across our brands to establish lines of credit with third-party lenders to purchase inventory. Under these programs, a dealer draws on the floor plan facility upon the purchase of our boats and the lender pays the invoice price of the boats. As is typical in our industry, we have entered into repurchase agreements with certain floor plan financing providers to our dealers. Under the terms of these arrangements, in the event a lender repossesses a boat from a dealer that has defaulted on its floor financing arrangement and is able to deliver the repossessed boat to us, we are obligated to repurchase the boat from the lender. Our obligation to repurchase such repossessed products for the unpaid balance of our original invoice price for the boat is subject to reduction or limitation based on the age and condition of the boat at the time of repurchase, and in certain cases by an aggregate cap on repurchase obligations associated with a particular floor financing program.
 
Our exposure under repurchase agreements with third-party lenders is mitigated by our ability to reposition inventory with a new dealer in the event that a repurchase event occurs. The primary cost to us of a repurchase event is any margin loss on the resale of a repurchased unit. To date, we have not been required to repurchase any boats under repurchase agreements.

Competition
 
The powerboat industry, including the performance sport boat category, is highly competitive for consumers and dealers. Competition affects our ability to succeed in the markets we currently serve and new markets that we may enter in the future. We compete with several large manufacturers that may have greater financial, marketing and other resources than we do. We compete with large manufacturers who are represented by dealers in the markets in which we now operate and into which we plan to expand. We also compete with a wide variety of small, independent manufactures. Competition in our industry is based primarily on brand name, price and product performance.
 
We also compete with other leisure activities. Our boats are not necessities and in times of economic hardship, consumers may cease purchasing non-essential items. Luxury items may not be used for recreational and sport purposes, and demand for our boats may be adversely affected by competition from other activities that occupy consumers’ leisure time and by changes in consumer lifestyle, usage pattern or taste.
 
We also face competition for employees. Competition for individuals with experience designing, manufacturing and servicing electric boats is intense, and we may not be able to attract, assimilate, train or retain additional highly qualified personnel in the future. The failure to attract, integrate, train, motivate and retain these additional employees could seriously harm our business and prospects.
 
Raw Materials, Principal Suppliers, and Customers
 
We purchase a number of our product parts and components from third-party suppliers, including the fiberglass we use to manufacture the fiberglass parts of our boats, hydrocarbon feedstocks and steel, as well as product parts and components, such as engines and electronic controls, through a sales order process. The most significant component used in manufacturing our gas-powered boats, based on cost, are engines. We maintain a strong and long-standing relationship with our sole supplier of engines, Suzuki Motor of America, Inc.
 
We do not maintain long-term contracts with preferred suppliers, but instead rely on informal arrangements and off-the-shelf purchases. Other than the 150-horsepower motors we obtain from Suzuki Motor of America, Inc., which historically have been used in approximately 15% of our boats, we have not experienced any material shortages in any of our product parts, or components. However, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic some of our third-party suppliers have experienced delays in delivering our product parts and components in a timely manner and fluctuations in price for these supplies is a possibility if raw material pricing increases. Temporary shortages, when they do occur, usually involve manufacturers of these products adjusting model mix, introducing new product lines, or limiting production in response to an industry-wide reduction in boat demand or, as recently experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic, in finding persons able to deliver the parts and components in a timely manner. In addition, we have experienced price increases from suppliers resulting from these supply chain shortages.
 
Semiconductor chips are a vital input component to the electrical architecture of our electric boats, controlling wide aspects of the boats’ operations. Many of the key semiconductor chips we intend to use in our boats come from limited or single sources of supply, and therefore a disruption with any one manufacturer or supplier in our supply chain would have an adverse effect on our ability to effectively manufacture and timely deliver our boats. We do not have any long-term supply contracts with any suppliers and purchase chips on a purchase order basis. Due to our reliance on these semiconductor chips, we are subject to the risk of shortages and long lead times in their supply. We are in the process of identifying alternative manufacturers for semiconductor chips. We have in the past experienced, and may in the future experience, semiconductor chip shortages, and the availability and cost of these components would be difficult to predict. For example, our manufacturers may experience temporary or permanent disruptions in their manufacturing operations due to equipment breakdowns, labor strikes or shortages, natural disasters, component or material shortages, cost increases, acquisitions, insolvency, changes in legal or regulatory requirements, or other similar problems.
 
Increased demand for semiconductor chips in 2020, due in part to the COVID-19 pandemic and increased demand for consumer electronics that use these chips, has resulted in a severe global shortage of chips in 2021. As a result, our ability to source semiconductor chips to be used in our boats has been adversely affected. This shortage may result in increased chip delivery lead times, delays in the production of our boats, and increased costs to source available semiconductor chips. To the extent this semiconductor chip shortage continues, and we are unable to mitigate the effects of this shortage, our ability to deliver sufficient quantities of our boats to fulfill our preorders and to support our growth through sales to new customers would be adversely affected.
 
While we believe that our relationships with our current suppliers are sufficient to provide the materials necessary to meet present production demand, we cannot assure you that these relationships will continue or that the quantity or quality of the materials available from these suppliers will be sufficient to meet our future needs. We expect that our need for raw materials and supplies will increase. Our suppliers must be prepared to ramp up operations and, in many cases, hire additional workers and/or expand capacity in order to fulfill those orders placed by us and other customers. Operational and financial difficulties that our suppliers may face in the future could adversely affect their ability to supply us with the parts and components we need, which could significantly disrupt our operations.
 
A few customers have in the past, and may in the future, account for a significant portion of our revenues in any one year or over a period of several consecutive years. For example, during the year end December 31, 2021 five dealers represented 67% of our sales. The loss of business from a significant customer could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

Intellectual Property
 
We have not protected our intellectual property rights for our gas-powered motor products through patents or formal copyright registration, and we do not currently have any patent applications pending related to our gas-powered boats.
 
As development of our electric powered boats continues, we are applying for patents. We have filed applications for three design and four utility patents with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office relating to, among other things, our propulsion system being developed and boat design. Below is a list of pending patent applications that Forza X1 is seeking approval from the United States Patent and Trademark Office. There can be no assurance that any patent will issue or if issued that the patent will protect our intellectual property. As a result, we may not be able to protect our intellectual property and trade secrets or prevent others from independently developing substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques or from otherwise gaining access to our intellectual property or trade secrets. In such an instance, our competitors could produce products that are nearly identical to ours resulting in us selling less products or generating less revenue from our sales.
 
The following table sets forth certain information regarding our current patent applications:

Insurance and Product Warranties
 
We carry various insurance policies, including policies to cover general products liability, directors and officers, workers’ compensation and other casualty and property risks, to protect against certain risks of loss consistent with the exposures associated with the nature and scope of our operations. Our policies are generally based on our safety record as well as market trends in the insurance industry and are subject to certain deductibles, limits and policy terms and conditions.
 
We provide limited product warranties, generally covering periods of ten years for the hull and the motors are under warranty by their manufacturer.
 
In addition, we provide a three-year limited fiberglass small parts warranty on some small fiberglass parts and components, such as consoles. Gelcoat is covered up to one year. Additionally, fiberglass lids, plastic lids, electrical panels, bilge pumps, aerator pumps or other electrical devices (excluding stereos, depth finders, radar, chart plotters except for installation if installed by Twin Vee PowerCats Co.), steering systems, electrical panels, and pumps are covered under a one-year basic limited systems warranty. Some materials, components or parts of the boat that are not covered by our limited product warranties are separately warranted by their manufacturers or suppliers. These other warranties include warranties covering engines purchased from suppliers and other components.
 
Environmental, Safety and Regulatory Matters
 
Certain materials used in our manufacturing, including the resins used in production of our boats, are toxic, flammable, corrosive or reactive and are classified by the federal and state governments as “hazardous materials.” Control of these substances is regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency (the “EPA”) and state pollution control agencies. The United States Clean Air Act (the “CAA”) and corresponding state and provincial rules regulate emissions of air pollutants. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (“OSHA”) standards limit the emissions to which an employee may be exposed without the need for respiratory protection or upgraded plant ventilation. Our facilities are regularly inspected by OSHA and by state and local inspection agencies and departments. We believe that our facility complies in all material aspects with these regulations. Although capital expenditures related to compliance with environmental laws are expected to increase, we do not currently anticipate any material expenditure will be required to continue to comply with existing environmental or safety regulations in connection with our existing manufacturing facilities.
 
Powerboats sold in the United States must be manufactured to meet the standards of certification required by the United States Coast Guard. In addition, boats manufactured for sale in the European Community must be certified to meet the European Community’s imported manufactured products standards. These certifications specify standards for the design and construction of powerboats. We believe that all of our boats meet these standards. In addition, safety of recreational boats is subject to federal regulation under the Boat Safety Act of 1971, which requires boat manufacturers to recall products for replacement of parts or components that have demonstrated defects affecting safety. We have instituted recalls for defective component parts produced by certain of our third-party suppliers. None of the recalls has had a material adverse effect on our company.
 
In addition to the regulation of our manufacturing operations, the EPA has adopted regulations stipulating that many marine propulsion engines meet certain air emission standards. The engines used in our products, all of which are manufactured by third parties, are warranted by the manufacturers to be in compliance with the EPA’s emission standards. Furthermore, the engines used in our products must comply with the applicable emission standards under the CEPA and corresponding provincial legislation. The additional cost of complying with these regulations has increased our cost to purchase the engines and, accordingly, has increased the cost to manufacture our products.
 
If we are not able to pass these additional costs along to our customers, it may have a negative impact on our business and financial condition.

Employees/Human Capital
 
As of December 31, 2021, we employed approximately 120 employees in our gas-powered boat segment, all of whom are full time employees. As of the same date, we had two full time employees in our franchise segment and Forza has five full time employees working on electric-powered boats. None of our employees are represented by a labor union and, since our founding in 1982, we have never experienced a labor-related work stoppage.
 
Competitive Pay and Benefits
 
Our compensation programs are designed to align the compensation of our employees with our performance and to provide the proper incentives to attract, retain and motivate employees to achieve superior results. The structure of our compensation programs balances incentive earnings for both short-term and long-term performance. Specifically:

● | we provide employee wages and benefits that are competitive and consistent with employee positions, skill levels, experience, knowledge and geographic location;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | we align our executives’ long-term equity compensation with our shareholders’ interests by linking realizable pay with stock performance; and 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | all employees are eligible for health insurance, paid and unpaid leaves, a retirement plan and life and disability/accident erage.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Health and Safety
 
The health and safety of our employees is our highest priority, and this is consistent with our operating philosophy. Accordingly, with the global spread of the ongoing novel coronavirus pandemic, we have implemented plans designed to address and mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the safety of our employees and our business, which include:

● | adding work from home flexibility; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Our Operations
 
The COVID-19 pandemic outbreak has offered challenges for all commercial enterprises. According to a Small Business Pulse Survey, 89.9% of businesses reported a moderate to large negative effect from COVID-19 on their business in April 2020, only reducing to approximately 75% in November 2020. Imposed restrictions, such as social distancing, regular temperature checks, enhanced cleaning measures, and the use of personal protective equipment placed on workplaces to increase the safety of employees was something many companies have never had to face before. Some companies and even entire industries have had to shut down due to COVID-19. Moreover, the potential collapse of demand from consumers is an ever-present concern right now with high unemployment rates and the unpredictable nature of living during a global pandemic.
 
We have adapted to these unprecedented times and believe we have successfully navigated the issues presented to our business by the global pandemic. Although sales decreased at the beginning of the summer and we had reduced staffing, we have operated with a full-time staff since the middle of the summer. The demand for our Classic and GFX models have been robust, our backlog is over 125 boats. Orders currently being placed for our boats are being scheduled for delivery into Q4 of 2022. With the influx of orders, we continue to hire seasoned and experienced production team members with years of production and scheduling experience, the team is aiding our efforts to streamline our manufacturing process.

Implications of Being an Emerging Growth Company
 
We are an “emerging growth company,” as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the “JOBS Act”), and therefore we intend to take advantage of certain exemptions from various public company reporting requirements, including not being required to have our internal controls over financial reporting audited by our independent registered public accounting firm pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the “Sarbanes-Oxley Act”), reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and any golden parachute payments. We may take advantage of these exemptions until we are no longer an “emerging growth company.” In addition, the JOBS Act provides that an “emerging growth company” can delay adopting new or revised accounting standards until such time as those standards apply to private companies. We have elected to use the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards under the JOBS Act. This election allows us to delay the adoption of new or revised accounting standards that have different effective dates for public and private companies until those standards apply to private companies. As a result of this election, our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with public company effective dates. We will remain an “emerging growth company” until the earlier of (1) the last day of the fiscal year: (a) following the fifth anniversary of the completion of our initial public offering; (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.07 billion; or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeded $700.0 million as of the prior June 30th, and (2) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt during the prior three-year period. References herein to “emerging growth company” have the meaning associated with that term in the JOBS Act.
