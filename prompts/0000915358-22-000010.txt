Overview 

SigmaTron is a Delaware corporation, which was organized on November 16, 1993, and commenced operations when it became the successor to all of the assets and liabilities of SigmaTron L.P., an Illinois limited partnership, through a reorganization on February 8, 1994 as part of going public.

The Company operates in two reportable segments as an independent provider of electronic manufacturing services (“EMS”), and as a provider of products to the pet technology (“Pet Tech”) market. The EMS segment 

 



includes printed circuit board assemblies, electro-mechanical subassemblies and completely assembled (box-build) electronic products. The Pet Tech segment offers electronic products such as the Freedom Smart Dog Collar, a wireless, geo-mapped fence, and wellness system, and apparel and accessories. 

The Company provides manufacturing and assembly services ranging from the assembly of individual components to the assembly and testing of box-build electronic products. The Company has the ability to produce assemblies requiring mechanical as well as electronic capabilities. The products assembled by the Company are then incorporated into finished products sold in various industries, particularly industrial electronics, consumer electronics and medical/life sciences. In some instances, the Company manufactures and assembles the completed finished product for its customers. 

In connection with the production of assembled products, the Company provides services to its customers, including (1) automatic and manual assembly and testing of products; (2) material sourcing and procurement; (3) manufacturing and test engineering support; (4) design services; (5) warehousing and distribution services; (6) assistance in obtaining product approval from governmental and other regulatory bodies and (7) compliance reporting. The Company provides these manufacturing services through an international network of facilities located in the United States, Mexico, China, Vietnam and Taiwan.

The Company began its Pet Technology operations after the December 2021 acquisition of Wagz, Inc., discussed below under “Recent Developments”.

The Company’s headquarters is in Elk Grove Village, Illinois, United States of America (“U.S.”) which also operates as a manufacturing facility. In addition, the Company has manufacturing facilities in Union City, California, U.S.; Acuna, Coahuila, Mexico (“MX”); Chihuahua, Chihuahua, MX; and Tijuana, Baja California, MX; Suzhou, Jiangsu Province, China; and Bien Hoa City, Dong Nai Province, Vietnam. In addition, the Company maintains an International Procurement Office and Compliance and Sustainability Center (“IPO”) in Taipei, Taiwan. The Company also provides design services in Elgin, Illinois, U.S. and Portsmouth, New Hampshire, U.S. and warehousing services in Del Rio, Texas, U.S.; El Paso, Texas, U.S.; Elk Grove Village, Illinois, U.S.; and San Diego, California, U.S.. The Company has an information technology office in Taichung, Taiwan. 

The Company’s international footprint provides our customers with flexibility within the Company to manufacture in China, Mexico, Vietnam or the U.S. We believe this strategy will continue to serve the Company well as its customers continuously evaluate their supply chain strategies.

For the fiscal year ended April, 30 2022, the Company reported pre-tax profit of approximately $14,000,000 and sales of approximately $379,000,000. The fiscal year end revenue results increased 36%, compared to the prior fiscal year. The higher sales related to both increased customer demand and price increases passed on to customers for raw material and other operating cost increases. These results were obtained despite unprecedented electronic component shortages in the marketplace, which continued from the prior fiscal year. This has led to lower productivity on occasion, rapidly growing inventory levels and pressure on working capital, as the marketplace has remained volatile.  

The Company’s backlog remains at an all-time high with demand staying strong across the vast majority of markets and customers the Company serves. The Company has several new customers that the Company expects to begin shipping to in the first half of fiscal year 2023. However, the electronic component marketplace remains volatile in terms of both supply and price. The continued shortages could impact the Company’s ability to ship the backlog on a timely basis.  This is a problem faced by almost every customer and competitor in the EMS industry, and the Company does not anticipate the situation improving through fiscal 2023.  The Company’s supply chain and operations teams face challenges which we believe will remain for fiscal year 2023.  The Company does not see any signs of weakening in semiconductor demand across all markets, nor does the Company see any additional semiconductor production capacity coming online anytime soon.  






Recent Developments 

On May 29, 2020, SigmaTron and Wagz, Inc. (“Wagz”), a Pet Tech company, entered into a Convertible Secured Promissory Note in the principal sum of up to $4,052,478.  Between January 27, 2021 and December 31, 2021, Wagz issued additional convertible secured promissory notes and secured promissory notes aggregating $7,947,522 and $1,380,705, respectively (collectively, the “Notes”) which were accounted for as Notes receivable in the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheet of Item 15(a) Exhibits and Financial Statement Schedules. The Notes were due (the “Maturity Date”) on the earliest to occur of (a) December 31, 2021 or, if the closing of the Company’s then proposed acquisition of Wagz (the “Closing”) did not occur due to the Company’s termination, that date which is twelve (12) months after the date of such termination, (b) upon the closing of a sale of all or substantially all of the assets or common stock of Wagz (other than the Closing), or (c) an Event of Default (as defined in the Notes). Interest was payable at the rate of four percent (4%) per annum and was payable on the Maturity Date. The Notes were collateralized by substantially all assets of Wagz. The Notes did not meet the accounting definition of a security and were accounted for under ASC 310, Receivables, at amortized cost.

Wagz has developed and brought to market a high tech pet collar and has multiple other products in development. Wagz is an Internet of Things (“IoT”) company which both owns intellectual property and secures recurring revenue through subscriptions for its services. 

On December 31, 2021, the Company acquired 100% of the stock of Wagz under the terms of the Agreement and Plan of Merger dated July 19, 2021, as amended by the First Amendment to Agreement and Plan of Merger dated December 7, 2021 (the “Merger Agreement”). Prior to the acquisition, the Company had an investment in Wagz of $600,000, Convertible Secured Promissory Notes issued by Wagz of $12,000,000 and Secured Promissory Notes issued by Wagz of $1,380,705. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, prior to the acquisition, the Convertible Secured Promissory Notes converted to 12,000,000 shares of Wagz common stock, resulting in a 25.5% ownership in Wagz. As described in Note F – Acquisition of Item 15(a) Exhibits and Financial Statement Schedules, the Company’s 25.5% equity interest in Wagz common stock was remeasured to fair value of $6,299,765, resulting in a non-cash impairment charge of $6,300,235. 

Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, 2,443,870 shares of common stock of the Company were issued in the merger for a value of $25,245,177, of which 1,546,592 shares are allocated to Wagz shareholders (excluding the Company) for a total value of $15,976,295, and 897,278 shares are allocated to the Company and treated as treasury stock for a total value of $9,268,881, recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Changes in Stockholders’ Equity of Item 15(a) Exhibits and Financial Statement Schedules under Issuance of stock for acquisition and Purchase of treasury stock related to acquisition, respectively. The treasury shares were retired as of April 30, 2022.

On July 18, 2022, SigmaTron, Wagz and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (“Lender”) amended the Credit Agreement dated as of January 29, 2021, by entering into the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the “Facility” or “Credit Agreement”). The Facility, as amended, allows the Company to borrow on a revolving basis up to the lesser of (i) $70,000,000 or (ii) an amount equal to a percentage of the eligible receivable borrowing base plus a percentage of the inventory borrowing base minus any reserves established by Lender. The Facility bears interest at the adjusted REVSOFR30 rate (as defined in the Credit Agreement). The interest rate per annum applicable to the Facility will be the Adjusted Term SOFR Rate (“SOFR”), plus the Applicable Margin of 2.0%. The maturity date of the Facility was extended to July 18, 2027.

In connection with the closing of the Credit Agreement, Lender and The Private Credit Group of TCW Asset Management Company LLC, as administrative agent (the “Agent”) under the Term Loan Agreement (as defined below), entered into the Intercreditor Agreement, dated July 18, 2022, and acknowledged by SigmaTron and Wagz (the “ICA”), to set forth and govern the lenders’ respective lien priorities, rights and remedies under the Credit Agreement and the Term Loan Agreement.

The Facility is secured by: (a) a first priority security interest in SigmaTron’s and Wagz’s: (i) accounts and inventory (excluding Term Priority Mexican Inventory (as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement (“ICA”)) and certain inventory in transit, (ii) deposit accounts, (iii) proceeds of business interruption insurance that constitute ABL BI Insurance Share (as defined in the ICA), (iv) certain other property, including payment intangibles, 

 



instruments, equipment, software and hardware and similar systems, books and records, to the extent related to the foregoing, and (v) all proceeds of the foregoing, in each case, now owned or hereafter acquired (collectively, the “ABL Priority Collateral”); and (b) a second priority security interest in Term Priority Collateral (as defined below) other than (i) real estate and (ii) unless Lender requests a pledge thereof following July 18, 2022, the equity interests of SigmaTron’s foreign subsidiaries. 

On July 18, 2022, SigmaTron, Wagz and The Private Credit Group of TCW Asset Management Company LLC, as administrative agent (the “Agent”), and other Lenders party thereto (collectively, “TCW”) entered into a Credit Agreement (the “Term Loan Agreement”) pursuant to which TCW made a term loan to the Company in the principal amount of $40,000,000 (the “TCW Term Loan”). The TCW Term Loan bears interest at a rate per annum applicable to the Term Loan Facility based on the Adjusted Term SOFR Rate (“SOFR”), plus the Applicable Margin of 7.50% (as defined in the Term Loan Agreement). The Term Loan will have a SOFR floor of 1.00%. The maturity date of the TCW Term Loan is July 18, 2027. 

The TCW Term Loan is secured by: (a) a first priority security interest in all property of SigmaTron and Wagz that does not constitute ABL Priority Collateral, which includes: (i) SigmaTron’s and Wagz’s real estate other than SigmaTron’s Del Rio, Texas, warehouses, (ii) SigmaTron’s and Wagz’s machinery, equipment and fixtures (but excluding ABL Priority Equipment (as defined in the ICA)), (iii) the Term Priority Mexican Inventory (as defined in the ICA), (iv) SigmaTron’s stock in its direct and indirect subsidiaries, (v) SigmaTron’s and Wagz’s general intangibles (excluding any that constitute ABL Priority Collateral), goodwill and intellectual property, (vi) the proceeds of business interruption insurance that constitute Term BI Insurance Share (as defined in the ICA), (vii) tax refunds, and (viii) all proceeds thereof, in each case, now owned or hereafter acquired (collectively, the “Term Priority Collateral”); and (b) a second priority security interest in all collateral that constitutes ABL Priority Collateral. Also, SigmaTron’s three Mexican subsidiaries pledged all of their assets as security for the TCW Term Loan.

A pandemic of respiratory diseases, including variants (commonly known as “COVID-19”) began to spread globally, including to the United States, in early 2020. The full impact of the COVID-19 outbreak is inherently uncertain at the time of this report. The COVID-19 outbreak has resulted in travel restrictions and in some cases, prohibitions of non-essential activities, disruption and shutdown of certain businesses and greater uncertainty in global financial markets. The Company cannot predict the extent to which the COVID-19 outbreak will continue to impact its business or operating results, which are highly dependent on inherently uncertain future developments, including the severity and duration of the COVID-19 outbreak and the actions taken by governments and businesses in relation to COVID-19 containment. The Company has adopted several measures in response to the COVID-19 outbreak. For more information on the potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors – Our financial condition and results of operations have been impacted and may in the future be adversely affected by the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak.”

Products and Services

The Company provides a broad range of electronic and electromechanical manufacturing related outsourcing solutions for its customers. These solutions incorporate the Company’s knowledge and expertise in the EMS industry to provide its customers with an international network of manufacturing facilities, advanced manufacturing technologies, complete supply chain management, responsive and flexible customer service, as well as product design, test and engineering support. The Company’s EMS solutions are available from inception of product concept through the ultimate delivery of a finished product. Such technologies and services include the following:

Manufacturing and Testing Services: The Company’s core business is the assembly and testing of all types of electronic printed circuit board assemblies (“PCBA”) and often incorporating these PCBAs into electronic modules used in all types of devices and products that depend on electronics for their operation. This assembly work utilizes state of the art manufacturing and test equipment to deliver highly reliable products to the Company’s customers. The Company supports new product introduction (“NPI”), low volume / high mix as well as high volume/ low mix assembly work at all levels of assembly and test complexity. From simple component assembly through the most complicated industry testing, the Company offers services required to build the vast majority of electronic devices commercially required in the market today.






Design Services: To complement the manufacturing services it offers its customers, the Company also offers design for manufacturability (“DFM”), and design for test (“DFT”) review services to help customers ensure that the products they have designed are optimized for production and testing. The Company also offers complete product design services for certain markets.

Supply Chain Management: The Company provides complete supply chain management for the procurement of components needed to build customers’ products. This includes the procurement and management of all types of electronic components and related mechanical parts such as plastics and metal. The Company’s resources supporting this activity are provided both on a plant specific basis as well as globally through its IPO in Taipei, Taiwan. Each of its sites is linked together using the same Enterprise Resource Planning (“ERP”) system and custom Iscore software tools with real-time on-line visibility for customer access. The Company procures material from major manufacturers and distributors of electronic parts all over the world.

The Company relies on numerous third-party suppliers for components used in the Company’s production process. Certain of these components are available only from single-sources or a limited number of suppliers. In addition, a customer’s specifications may require the Company to obtain components from a single-source or a small number of suppliers. The loss of any such suppliers could have a material impact on the Company’s results of operations. Further, the Company could operate at a cost disadvantage compared to competitors who have greater direct buying power from suppliers. The Company orders material from its suppliers consistent with the purchase orders and binding forecasts it receives from its customers. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors – Raw material price increases and supply shortages could adversely affect results”.

Warehousing and Distribution: The Company provides both in-house and third-party warehousing, shipping, and customs brokerage for certain border crossings as part of its service offering. This includes international shipping, drop shipments to the end customer as well as support of inventory optimization activities such as kanban and consignment.

Government Compliance, Green, Sustainability, and Social Responsible Initiatives: The Company supports initiatives that promote sustainability, green environment and social responsibility. The Company helps its customers in achieving effective compliance. Those include, but are not limited to, Restrictions of Hazardous Substances (“RoHS”), Restriction of Chemicals (“REACH”) and Conflict Minerals regulations. 

Manufacturing Locations and Certifications: The Company’s manufacturing locations are strategically located to support our customers with locations in Elk Grove Village, Illinois U.S.; Union City, California U.S.; Acuna, Chihuahua and Tijuana, Mexico; Suzhou, China; and Bien Hoa City, Vietnam. The Company’s ability to transition manufacturing to lower cost regions without jeopardizing flexibility and service differentiates it from many competitors. Manufacturing certifications and registrations are location specific, and include ISO 9001:2015, ISO 14001:2004, ISO 14001:2015, IATF 16949:2016, Medical ISO 13485:2016 and FDB Certification, Aerospace AS9100D and International Traffic in Arms Regulations (“ITAR”) certifications. 

In addition, the Company provides products, supplies design and manufacturing services to the pet technology market through its wholly owned subsidiary, Wagz. Wagz is believed to be the first Pet Tech company to develop a broad based, integrated family of smart products that truly enable pet owners to interact with, and manage the daily needs of their pets, from anywhere. The Company offers electronic products such as the Freedom Smart Dog Collar, a wireless, geo-mapped fence, and wellness system, and apparel and accessories. It also sells its products online.

Sales and Marketing

Many of the members of the Company’s senior management are actively involved in sales and marketing efforts, and the Company has direct sales employees. The Company also markets its services through independent manufacturers’ representative organizations that employ sales personnel in the United States and Canada. Independent manufacturers’ representative organizations receive variable commissions based on orders received by the Company and are assigned specific accounts, not territories. In addition, the Company markets itself through its website and tradeshows. Wagz sells its products primarily online. 
Mexico, China, Vietnam and Taiwan Operations

The Company’s wholly-owned subsidiary, Standard Components de Mexico, S.A, a Mexican entity, is located in Acuna, Coahuila, Mexico, a border town across the Rio Grande River from Del Rio, Texas, U.S. and is 155 miles west of San Antonio. Standard Components de Mexico, S.A. was incorporated and commenced operations in 1968 and had 965 employees at April 30, 2022. The Company’s wholly-owned subsidiary, AbleMex S.A. de C.V., a Mexican entity, is located in Tijuana, Baja California, Mexico, a border town south of San Diego, California, U.S.. AbleMex S.A. de C.V. was incorporated and commenced operations in 2000. The operation had 446 employees at April 30, 2022. The Company’s wholly-owned subsidiary, Digital Appliance Controls de Mexico S.A., a Mexican entity, operates in Chihuahua, Chihuahua, Mexico, located approximately 235 miles from El Paso, Texas, U.S.. Digital Appliance Controls de Mexico S.A. was incorporated and commenced operations in 1997. The operation had 482 employees at April 30, 2022. The Company believes that one of the key benefits to having operations in Mexico is its access to cost-effective labor resources while having geographic proximity to the United States.

The Company’s wholly-owned foreign enterprises, Wujiang SigmaTron Electronics Co., Ltd. and SigmaTron Electronic Technology Co., Ltd., are located in Suzhou, China. The Company has entered into an agreement with governmental authorities in the economic development zone of Wujiang, Jiangsu Province, Peoples Republic of China, pursuant to which the Company became the lessee of a parcel of land of approximately 100 Chinese acres. The term of the land lease is 50 years. The Company built a manufacturing plant, office space and dormitories on this site during 2004. In fiscal year 2015, the China facility expanded and added 40,000 square feet in warehouse and manufacturing. The total square footage of the facility is 216,950 and the operation had 389 employees as of April 30, 2022. Both Wujiang SigmaTron Electronics Co., Ltd.
and SigmaTron Electronic Technology Co., Ltd. operate at this site. 

The Company’s wholly-owned subsidiary, Spitfire Controls (Cayman) Co. Ltd., owns all of the equity of the subsidiary, Spitfire Controls (Vietnam) Co. Ltd., and does not conduct any other operations. Spitfire Controls (Vietnam) Co. Ltd. is located in Amata Industrial Park, Bien Hoa City, Dong Nai Province, Vietnam, and is 18 miles east of Bien Hoa City. Spitfire Controls (Vietnam) Co. Ltd. was incorporated and commenced operation in 2005 and had 324 employees as of April 30, 2022.

The Company maintains an IPO in Taipei, Taiwan which was incorporated in 1991. The total square footage of the office is 4,685 square feet. The Company has an information technology office in Taichung, Taiwan. The total square footage of the office is 1,650 square feet. The Company had 35 employees located in the Taiwan offices as of April 30, 2022.

The Company provides funds for manufacturing services such as salaries, wages, inventory purchases for certain locations, overhead and capital expenditure items as necessary to operate its wholly-owned Mexican, Vietnamese and Chinese subsidiaries and foreign enterprises and the IPO in Taiwan. The Company provides funding in U.S. Dollars, which are exchanged for Pesos, Dong, Renminbi, and New Taiwan dollars. The fluctuation of currencies from time to time, without an equal or greater increase in inflation, could have a material impact on the financial results of the Company. The impact of currency fluctuations for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2022, resulted in net foreign currency transaction losses of approximately $412,218 compared to net foreign currency losses of $285,389 in the prior fiscal year. In fiscal year 2022, the Company paid approximately $62,250,000 to its foreign subsidiaries for manufacturing services. All intercompany balances have been eliminated upon consolidation. 

The consolidated financial statements as of April 30, 2022, include the accounts and transactions of SigmaTron, its wholly-owned subsidiaries, Standard Components de Mexico, S.A., AbleMex S.A. de C.V., Digital Appliance Controls de Mexico, S.A. de C.V., Spitfire Controls (Vietnam) Co. Ltd., Spitfire Controls (Cayman) Co. Ltd., and Wagz, Inc., wholly-owned foreign enterprises Wujiang SigmaTron Electronics Co., Ltd. and SigmaTron Electronic Technology Co., Ltd., and international procurement office, SigmaTron Taiwan Branch. The functional currency of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries operations is the U.S. Dollar. Intercompany transactions are eliminated in the consolidated financial statements.

 




Competition

The EMS industry is highly competitive and subject to rapid change. Furthermore, both large and small companies compete in the industry, and many have significantly greater financial resources, more extensive business experience and greater marketing and production capabilities than the Company. The significant competitive factors in this industry include price, quality, service, timeliness, reliability, the ability to source raw components, and manufacturing and technological capabilities. The Company believes it can compete on all of these factors.
Consolidation

As a result of consolidation and other transactions involving competitors and other companies in the Company’s markets, the Company occasionally reviews potential transactions relating to its business, products and technologies. Such transactions could include mergers, acquisitions, strategic alliances, joint ventures, licensing agreements, co-promotion agreements, financing arrangements or other types of transactions. In the future, the Company may choose to enter into these types of or other transactions at any time depending on available sources of financing, and such transactions could have a material impact on the Company’s business, financial condition or operations.
Governmental Regulations 

The Company’s operations are subject to certain foreign government, U.S. federal, state and local regulatory requirements relating to, among others, environmental, waste management, consumer, labor and health and safety matters.  Management believes that the Company’s business is operated in compliance with all such regulations, which include European regulations known as Restriction of Hazardous Substances (“RoHS”) and Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals (“REACH”).  From time-to-time the Company's customers request REACH required information and certifications on the assemblies the Company manufactures for them.  These requests require the Company to gather information from component suppliers to verify the presence and level of mass of any substances of very high concerns (“SVHCs”) greater than 0.1% in the assemblies the Company manufactures based on customer specifications.  If any SVHCs are present at more than 0.1% of the mass of the item, the specific concentration and mass of the SVHC must be reported to proper authorities by the Company's customer.

The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the “Dodd-Frank Act”) introduced reporting requirements for verification of whether the Company directly (or indirectly through suppliers of components) is purchasing the minerals or metals gold, columbite-tantalite, cassiterite, wolframite and their derivatives (tin, tungsten, and tantalum), that are being provided by sources in the conflict region of the Democratic Republic of Congo (“DRC”) and contributing conflict.  Consistent with recent prior years, in May 2022, the Company filed Form SD with the Securities and Exchange Commission stating the Company’s supply chain remains DRC conflict undeterminable.

Backlog

The Company relies on binding forecasted orders and purchase orders (firm orders) from its customers to estimate backlog. The Company’s backlog of firm orders as of April 30, 2022, and April 30, 2021, was approximately $485,670,000 and $307,130,000, respectively. The Company believes a significant portion of the backlog at April 30, 2022, will ship in fiscal year 2023. Because customers may cancel or reschedule deliveries, backlog may not be a meaningful indicator of future revenue. Variations in the magnitude and duration of contracts, forecasts and purchase orders received by the Company and delivery requirements generally may result in substantial fluctuations in backlog from period to period.
Human Capital Resources

The Company employed approximately 3,100 full-time employees of which approximately 500 were located in the U.S. as of April 30, 2022. There were approximately 250 engaged in engineering or engineering-related services, 2,450 in manufacturing and 400 in administrative functions, including supply chain, accounting, management and sales and marketing. 

 




The Company makes a considerable effort to maintain a qualified and engaged work force. The Company makes a concerted effort to engage its employees and provide opportunities for growth and the Company believes that its employee relations are good. The Company considers the health and safety of its employees a key priority, and even more so since the COVID-19 pandemic started. The Company has adopted various safety, cleaning and social distancing protocols consistent with the requirements of each jurisdiction.
