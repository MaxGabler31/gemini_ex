Item 1. Business
Company Overview
 
Immune Therapeutics, Inc. (“the Company”, “Immune”) was initially incorporated in Florida on December 2, 1993, as Resort Clubs International, Inc. (“Resort Clubs”). It was formed to manage and market golf course properties in resort markets throughout the United States. Galliano International Ltd. (“Galliano”) was incorporated in Delaware on May 27, 1998 and began trading in November 1999 through the filing of a 15C-211. On November 10, 2004, Galliano merged with Resort Clubs. Resort Clubs was the surviving corporation. On August 23, 2010, Resort Clubs changed its name to pH Environmental Inc. (“pH Environmental”). On April 23, 2012, pH Environmental completed a name change to TNI BioTech, Inc., and on April 24, 2012, we executed a share exchange agreement for the acquisition of all the outstanding shares of TNI BioTech IP, Inc.
 
On September 4, 2014, a majority of our shareholders approved an amendment to our Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation, as amended, to change our name to Immune Therapeutics, Inc. We filed our name change amendment with the Secretary of State of Florida on October 27, 2014, changing our name to Immune Therapeutics, Inc.
 
In December 2013, the Company formed a subsidiary, Cytocom Inc. (“Cytocom”), to focus on conducting LDN and MENK clinical trials in the United States. In December 2014, the Company finalized the distribution of common stock of Cytocom to its shareholders. As part of the transaction (“Original Agreement”), the Company transferred to Cytocom certain of its rights, title, and interest in or relating to intellectual property:
 

(i) | Patents, patent applications, and all divisional, continuations and continuations-in-part thereof, together with all reissues, reexaminations, renewals, and extensions thereof and all rights to obtain such divisionals, continuations and continuations-in-part, reissues, reexaminations, renewals and extensions, and all utility models and statutory invention registrations and any other such analogous rights. 
------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(ii) | Trademarks, service marks, Internet domain names, trade dress, trade styles, logos, trade names, services names, brand names, corporate names, assumed business names and general intangibles and other source identifiers of a like nature, together with the goodwill associated with any of the foregoing, and all registrations and applications for registrations thereof, together with all renewals and extensions thereof and all rights to obtain such renewals and extensions.
(iii) | Copyrights, mask work rights, database and design rights, moral rights and rights in Internet websites, whether registered or unregistered and whether published or unpublished, all registrations and recordings thereof and all applications in connection therewith, together with all renewals, continuations, reversions and extensions thereof and all rights to obtain such renewals, continuations, reversions and extensions. 
(iv) | Confidential and proprietary information, including, trade secrets and know-how. 

 
On May 1, 2018, the Company entered into an amended and restated licensing agreement (the “Restated Agreement”) with Cytocom. The Restated Agreement restates the licensing arrangement between the Company and Cytocom and grants the Company distribution and marketing rights for Lodonal™ and MENK for humans in certain Emerging Markets. In addition, the Company was granted the rights to distribute and market Lodonal™ and MENK for animal use in the United States. The royalty due to Cytocom was reduced from 5% to 1% of sales and the Company no longer has any ongoing obligations to pay for costs in connection with the assets of Cytocom. While the Company formalized the agreement to deconsolidate on May 1, 2018, Penn State University, a vendor of the Company, did not consent to assign the payables to Cytocom at the time of the Restated Agreement.
 
On June 4, 2018, the Company and Cytocom entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement (the “Stock Agreement”). Pursuant to which, the Company cancelled approximately $4,000,000 of debt owed to it by Cytocom in exchange for ten percent (10%) of the issued and outstanding common stock of Cytocom, as calculated on a fully diluted basis. The Restated Agreement was a condition of the Stock Agreement.
 
On April 8, 2019, the Company signed a second amendment to its licensing agreement (the “Second Amendment”) with Cytocom. The Second Amendment confirmed that, (as of its effective date December 31, 2018) the Company owned 15.57% of the Cytocom common shares issued and outstanding on that date. The Company agreed to assume responsibility to repay all accounts payable obligations and accrued liabilities owed by Cytocom as of the effective date, except those accounts’ payable obligations and accrued liabilities as specified in the Second Amendment. The Company also assumed the responsibility to repay all notes payable, together with any interest or fees payable thereon, owed by Cytocom as of the effective date, except those notes’ payable obligations, together with any interest or fees payable thereon, as specified by the Second Amendment. The parties further agreed that in the event of a change of control of Cytocom, and at the option of Cytocom, the Company would have the right to purchase outright the Company’s licensing rights to Emerging Markets for humans under the License Agreement at a price equal to value of those licensing rights as determined by and independent valuator acceptable to the Company and Cytocom.


In the third quarter of 2021, Cytocom announced the completion of its merger with Cleveland BioLabs, Inc. (“CBLI”) which resulted in the Company’s receipt of 1,150,000 common shares of CBLI, reflecting the Company’s retained minority interest in Cytocom. The merger was completed in July 2021. Subsequent to the merger, CBLI adopted a new corporate name, Statera BioPharma, Inc., with the ticker symbol “STAB” effective September 1, 2021. Cytocom emerged as a publicly traded entity following the merger with CBLI.

Forte Animal Health, Inc.
 
On July 8, 2021, the Company amended the license agreement (the “Amended License Agreement”) with Forte Animal Health Inc. (“Forte”) dated February 27, 2020.
 
Under the Amended License Agreement, the Company granted Forte an exclusive license to develop and commercialize pharmaceutical products consisting of Lodonal and MENK for use in veterinary applications for all indications world-wide. Milestone payments and royalties are defined in the agreement based on development and royalties are based on sales during the license period.
 
The Initial License Fee includes the assumption by Forte of certain Company defaulted Notes and other liabilities. The note holders and vendors associated with the assigned liabilities have not yet assigned their rights to Forte and as a result the Company has not completed the transaction.
 
Consideration for Amended License Agreement with Forte as of December 31, 2021
 

Consideration / Assumption of: | | 
---------------------------------------------------+---+----------
Notes and associated accrued interest in default | $ | 2,040,006
Accounts payable and accruals | | 338,909 
Past due employee obligations | | 786,177 
Total Consideration to be Recognize Upon Execution | $ | 3,165,092

 
The documentation and sign off, of the Forte license, have yet to be executed by the individual lenders that will be required to provide their sign-off and approval for the transfer of these notes. As such the accompanying financial statements do not reflect any gain on sale. Until such time as the transaction is completed Forte does not have clear title and interest to the veterinary rights.
 
Forte has agreed to make payments to the Company in connection with this agreement as follows:
 

● | Initial License Fee, upon the assignment of certain Company Notes Payable. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Development Milestone Payments upon the occurrence of the identified events, one-time, non-creditable, non-refundable milestone payments of $100,000 will be earned by the Company upon: (1) a successful MUMS designation and (2) upon a successful conditional approval. 
● | Commercial Milestone Payments upon reaching the mutually agreed aggregate net sales. Forte will pay one-time, non-creditable, non-refundable milestone payments to be negotiated and addressed in a separate Amendment later. 
● | Royalties during the royalty term (generally 15 years from the first sale of a product in a country), royalties on annual net sales as follows: 


Annual Sales of Royalty Qualifying Licensed Products | Royalty Rate | 
-----------------------------------------------------+--------------+--
<$500,000,000 | | 2 | %
500,000,000 to < $1,000,000,000 | | 4 | %
> $1,000,000,000) | | 6 | %

 
As of December 31, 2021, this license agreement has not been executed as Forte has failed to fund the consideration defined in the agreement. To date the Company has not received any payments under the terms of this agreement.

Cytocom
 
On May 13, 2020, the Company and Cytocom entered into an Amendment to The Second Amendment to The License Agreement (“Third Amendment”) that was effective December 31, 2018. The sublicense provides Cytocom with the Company’s previously licensed rights for LDN and MENK in Emerging Markets.
 
Original terms for consideration for the sublicense were not finalized until August 12, 2020, at which time Cytocom and the Company signed a letter agreement in which Cytocom agreed to assume a combination of defaulted notes plus certain other liabilities. Such terms were amended, and the Company agreed to transfer all the rights, title, and interest to Cytocom in technology licensed from Penn State Research Foundation (“PSU”) in exchange for Cytocom assuming all past due and future obligations under the PSU license. While the Company formalized the agreement to assign all outstanding liabilities due to PSU, a vendor of the Company, PSU did not consent to the assignment of the payables to Cytocom. As of December 31, 2021, the Company had no outstanding accounts payable balances due to Penn State University.
 
On July 20, 2021, Cytocom and the Company agreed to modify the terms of the original sublicense. The renegotiated terms are presented below. The assignment of the Notes and associated accrued interest and penalties in default was fully executed in the third quarter of 2020 with the transfer of the notes upon the creditors’ signoff. The Company recognized a gain upon the assignment of these notes in the third quarter of 2020. Cytocom has not completed the assumption of the remaining liabilities.
 
Consideration for License to Cytocom as of December 31, 2021
 

Consideration / Assumption of: | | 
-------------------------------------------------+---+-----------
Notes and associated accrued interest in default | $ | 3,302,209 | 
Accounts payable and accruals | | 230,000 | 
Past Due Employee Obligations | | 1,110,567 | 
Total anticipated Consideration | $ | 4,642,776 | 
Recognized through December 31, 2020 | | (3,302,209 | )
To Be Recognized upon Execution | $ | 1,340,567 | 

 
As of December 31, 2021, the Notes transaction has not been fully executed. The Notes in default have been assigned and the transfer signed off by the creditors, but Cytocom still has not completed the assumption of the agreed upon obligations. Until the transaction is completed Cytocom (Statera) does not have clear title and interest to the Immune technology.
 
Current Restructuring Strategy
 
Management is developing as a strategy to re-capitalize the Company and position it for future growth. Key steps to this process include:
 

● | Improve the condition of the financial position and balance sheet via license arrangements and capital infusions
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Identify and acquire late-stage assets for commercialization through cash and equity sources 
● | Build out operational infrastructure to generate revenue opportunities to grow shareholder value. 



There can be no guaranties that the Company will be successful in securing adequate capital to continue operations and in identifying and acquiring assets for future development.
 
The Company has incurred significant net losses since inception and has relied on its ability to fund its operations through private equity financings. Management expects operating losses and negative cash flows may continue in the future. As the Company continues to incur losses, transition to profitability is dependent upon the successful development, approval, and commercialization of its product candidates and the achievement of a level of revenues adequate to support the Company’s cost structure. The Company may never achieve profitability, and unless and until it does, the Company will continue to need to raise additional cash. Management intends to fund future operations through additional private or public debt or equity offerings and may seek additional capital through arrangements with strategic partners or from other sources.

Based on the Company’s operating plan, working capital at December 31, 2021 is not sufficient to meet the cash requirements to fund planned operations through the next twelve months without additional sources of cash. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern and do not include adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. This basis of accounting contemplates the recovery of the Company’s assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business.
 
If the Company is unable to secure new working capital, other alternatives strategies will be required.
 
Historically, the Company has been able to acquire and develop assets, spin them out and retain both an equity stake and royalties and milestone payments. In so doing, the Company has acted as an incubator for late-stage drug development. Management believes that this strategy can continue to be successful. At this time, the Company is reviewing several opportunities which it may pursue as soon as funding is available. At present no definitive actions have been taken.
 
There can be no guaranties that the Company will be successful in:
 

● | Executing its restructuring plan 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------
● | Securing adequate capital to continue operations. 
● | Identifying and acquiring assets for future development. 

 
The Company has rights to the following intellectual property, which have been substantially licensed from Forte and Cytocom, as described above. As noted above, neither Cytocom nor Forte have funded the full consideration required under the agreements, therefore neither has full title and interest in the technology none of which have active programs to commercialize at this time:

Competition 
 
The industry for treatment of humans is highly competitive and subject to rapid and significant technological change. While we believe that our technology rights provide our sublicenses with competitive advantages. Our sub-licensees will face potential competition from many different sources including large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, specialty pharmaceutical and generic drug companies, academic institutions, government agencies and research institutions.
 
Many of our sublicensee’s potential competitors have substantially greater financial, technical, and human resources than we do and significantly greater experience in the discovery and development of product candidates, obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals of products and the commercialization of those products. Accordingly, those competitors may be more successful than our sublicensees’ may be in obtaining FDA approval for drugs and achieving widespread market acceptance. Their competitors’ drugs may be more effective, or more effectively marketed and sold, than any drug our sublicensees may commercialize and may render their product candidates obsolete or non-competitive before they can recover the expenses of developing and commercializing any of their product candidates. Further, the development of new treatment methods for the conditions our sub licensees are targeting could render their drugs non-competitive or obsolete. The ability of our sublicensees to overcome competitive factors will materially impact the value of our equity holdings in such licensees.
