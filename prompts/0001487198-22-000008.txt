ITEM 1. BUSINESS.
Aspen Group, Inc. is an education technology holding company. AGI has two subsidiaries, Aspen University Inc. ("Aspen University" or "AU") organized in 1987 and United States University Inc. ("United States University" or "USU"). 
All references to the “Company”, “AGI”, “Aspen Group”, “we”, “our” and “us” refer to Aspen Group, Inc., unless the context otherwise indicates.
Description of Business
AGI leverages its education technology infrastructure and expertise to allow its two universities, Aspen University and United States University, to deliver on the vision of making college affordable again. Because we believe higher education should be a catalyst to our students’ long-term economic success, we exert financial prudence by offering affordable tuition that is one of the greatest values in higher education. AGI’s primary focus relative to future growth is to target the high growth nursing profession. As of April 30, 2022, 11,522 of 13,334 or 86% of all active students across both universities are degree-seeking nursing students. Of the students seeking nursing degrees, 9,562 are RNs studying to earn an advanced degree, including 6,672 at Aspen University and 2,890 at USU. In contrast, the remaining 1,960 nursing students are enrolled in Aspen University’s BSN Pre-Licensure program in the Phoenix, Austin, Tampa, Nashville and Atlanta metros.
Aspen University has been offering a monthly payment plan available to all students across every online degree program offered by Aspen University, since March 2014. The monthly payment plan is designed so that students will make one fixed payment per month, and that monthly payment is applied towards the total cost of attendance (tuition and fees, excluding textbooks). The monthly payment plan offers online undergraduate students the opportunity to pay their tuition and fees at $250/month, online master students $325/month, and online doctoral students $375/month, interest free, thereby giving students a monthly payment option versus taking out a federal financial aid loan.
USU has been offering monthly payment plans since the summer of 2017. Today, USU monthly payment plans are available for the online RN to BSN program ($250/month), online MBA/MAEd/MSN programs ($325/month), online hybrid Bachelor of Arts in Liberal Studies, Teacher Credentialing tracks approved by the California Commission on Teacher Credentialing ($350/month), and the online hybrid Master of Science in Nursing-Family Nurse Practitioner (“FNP”) program ($375/month). 
Fiscal 2022 Overview
For Fiscal Year 2022, the Company achieved and experienced the following key developments:
Aspen 2.0 Business Plan and Other Trends
In Fiscal Year 2022, the Company implemented its ‘Aspen 2.0’ business plan. Aspen 2.0 is designed to deliver maximum efficiency as defined by revenue earned from each marketing dollar spent. Under the plan, growth spending has been re-focused on our highest efficiency businesses in an effort to accelerate the growth in these units, with decreased spending in our lowest efficiency unit (an area where high growth is not essential). Specifically, we have reduced marketing spending in our traditional AU Nursing + Other unit. In addition, we have suspended spending in our Phoenix metro BSN Pre-Licensure, as it was nearing capacity and also more recently due to regulatory issues described beginning at page 1 of this Report. Those marketing dollars have been redirected towards high LTV programs, specifically our four new BSN Pre-Licensure metros, AU’s online doctoral programs, and USU's MSN-FNP program. Additionally, due to a requirement to collateralize a new surety bond required by the Arizona State Board for Private Postsecondary Education, the Company reduced marketing spend in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2022 compared to immediately preceding periods. While this resulted in improved operating results for that quarter, we may see negative trends in future periods if the decrease in marketing spend results in a decline in enrollments. In the Phoenix metro, which was profitable, we cannot currently matriculate pre-professional nursing students into the two-year core nursing program. See Item 7 “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” 
Arizona State Board of Nursing Probation
Because Aspen University’s first-time pass rates for our BSN pre-licensure students taking the NCLEX-RN exam in Arizona fell from 80% in 2020 to 58% in 2021, which is below the minimum 80% standard set by the Arizona State Board of Nursing (“AZ BON”) in March 2022, AU entered into a Consent Agreement for Probation and a Civil Penalty (the “Consent Agreement”) with the AZ BON pursuant to which AU’s Provisional Approval was revoked, with the revocation stayed pending 

AU’s compliance with the terms and conditions of the Consent Agreement. The minimum probationary period is 36 months from the date of the Consent Agreement. In June 2022, the AZ BON granted approval of Aspen University’s request for provisional approval as long as the program is in compliance with the consent agreement through March 31, 2025. Aspen University is not currently enrolling students in the BSN Pre-licensure program in Arizona.
Because the pre-licensure program is comprised of two components, a one-year pre-requisite Pre-Professional Nursing (“PPN”) requirement followed by a two-year core program, one effect of the foregoing events was to prevent PPN students from matriculating into the core program until after the probation stipulation is met. 
See “State Professional Licensure” on page 10 for more information on the Consent Agreement and Civil Penalty, and “Item 3 - Legal Proceedings” for more information on a class action lawsuit filed after disclosure of the Consent Agreement.
Stipulated Agreement and Surety Bond
In connection with the above developments with respect to the AZ BON, Aspen University has also entered into a Stipulated Agreement with the Arizona State Board for Private Postsecondary Education (the “Arizona Board”) which required us to post a surety bond for $18.3 million. Aspen University posted the surety bond on April 22, 2022. Aspen University is not currently enrolling students in the BSN Pre-licensure program in Arizona, a condition of the Stipulated Agreement.
Certain Financing and Related Developments
Set forth below are descriptions of certain transactions and developments involving funding and capital that occurred in fiscal year 2022. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - “Liquidity and Capital Resources” on page 61 for more information on our liquidity and capital resources.
a.On March 14, 2022, we raised $10 million in gross proceeds from the issuance of convertible notes. We also issued two lenders a total of $20 million in Revolving Promissory Notes which have not been drawn upon. Subsequently, the two Revolving Promissory Notes and $5 million of the proceeds from the convertible notes were pledged as collateral for the $18.3 million surety bond (see discussion above). For the fourth quarter 2022, the Company reduced marketing spend sequentially by $1.0 million, primarily to ensure sufficient collateral for the surety bond required by the Arizona State Board for Private Postsecondary Education.
b.On August 31, 2021, AGI entered into a letter agreement with The Leon and Toby Cooperman Family Foundation (“Cooperman”). On September 1, 2021, the Company borrowed $5 million from The Leon and Toby Cooperman Family Foundation (“Cooperman”) under a Credit Facility Agreement. 
c.On July 21, 2021, AGI received a payment of $498,120 as a final distribution by the bankruptcy trustee in the previously disclosed Higher Education Management Group, Inc. bankruptcy proceedings. The bankruptcy filing occurred after AGI obtained a $772,793 judgment against Higher Education Management Group, Inc. No further assets are available for distribution.
Atlanta, GA Campus Approvals
On January 20, 2022, the Company announced that Aspen University received the final required state and board of registered nursing regulatory approvals for their new BSN Pre-Licensure campus location in Atlanta, Georgia. The Atlanta site was occupied by the University of Phoenix, located at 859 Mt. Vernon Highway NE, Suite 100, which is situated just off Interstate 285 in the Sandy Springs suburb in the inner ring of Atlanta. Aspen University began enrolling first-year PPN students in Atlanta starting in February 2022, and expects to enroll Nursing Core students (Years 2-3) in Fall 2022.
Accreditation
Since 1993, Aspen University has been accredited by the Distance Education Accrediting Commission ("DEAC"), an institutional accrediting agency recognized by the United States Department of Education (the "DOE") and the Council for Higher Education Accreditation ("CHEA"). On February 25, 2019, the DEAC informed Aspen University that it had renewed its accreditation for five years to January 2024.
Since 2009, USU has been accredited by WASC Senior College and University Commission ("WSCUC"), an institutional accrediting agency recognized by the DOE and the Council for Higher Education Accreditation ("CHEA"). Its current accreditation period extends through 2030.

As a result of their respective accreditations, both universities are qualified to participate under the Higher Education Act of 1965 ("HEA") and the Federal student financial assistance programs (Title IV, HEA programs).
Our operations are organized in one reporting segment.
Competitive Strengths - We believe that we have the following competitive strengths:
Proprietary Education Technology Platform – Traditionally, a University or Online Program Manager (OPM) offering online education has three core systems that serve as the backbone of their technology stack: (i) a Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system used by the enrollment team to manage prospective students; (ii) a student information system (or SIS) that the university uses to manage its student body, and (iii) a learning management system (or LMS) which serves as the online classroom.
In each of these categories, there are a number of software as a service ("SaaS") companies that offer solutions for higher education. Most universities and OPMs license one or all of these systems. In studying these systems, we concluded that there was no reasonable way to have these three separately licensed systems fluently communicate with to each other to achieve our end goal of having real-time data on every aspect of a student's career – whether it be academic in nature or personal, financial or other behavioral aspects.
As a result, several years ago we built an in-house Student Information System and connected it to our Learning Management System, D2L. We subsequently built and launched the first phase of an in-house CRM system that was designed for the enrollment departments at Aspen University and USU. 
The first-phase CRM included an algorithm that recommends to Enrollment Advisors (EAs), in priority order, the follow-up calls that should be made in a given day to complete the enrollment process for prospective students in that EAs individually designated database. The algorithm was created by studying the daily habits and activities of the three most productive EAs in AGI history. This recommendation engine then automatically updates in real-time after each follow-up/action is conducted by an EA. To our knowledge, these advanced features are not offered by any CRM software company in the industry. This recommendation engine has boosted our lead conversion rates for our online nursing programs to approximately 12% vs. <10% prior to launch. 
Emphasis on Online Education - The curriculum for all courses at AGI's universities is designed primarily for online delivery. Two nursing degree programs at AGI's universities require clinical practice: Aspen University's BSN Pre-Licensure hybrid (online/on-campus) nursing program and USU’s MSN-FNP hybrid (online/on-campus) nursing program. In addition, USU's Bachelor of Arts in Liberal Studies degree, Teacher Credentialing tracks require field experience/student teaching. Online, we provide students the flexibility to study and interact at times that suit their schedules. We design our online/on-campus sessions and materials to be interactive, dynamic and user friendly. 
Debt Minimization - We are committed to offering among the lowest tuition rates in the sector. Our tuition rates combined with our monthly payment plan payment option for our post licensure online nursing programs has alleviated the need for a significant majority of our students to take out federal financial aid loans to fund their tuition and fees requirements.
Commitment to Academic Excellence - We are committed to continuously improving our academic programs and services, as evidenced by the level of attention and resources we apply to instruction and educational support. We are committed to achieving high course completion and graduation rates compared to competitive distance learning, for-profit schools. Regular and substantive interaction and one-on-one student contact with our highly experienced faculty brings knowledge and great perspective to the learning experience. Faculty members are available by telephone, video conference and email to answer questions, discuss assignments and provide help and encouragement to our students.
Highly Scalable and Profitable Business Model - We believe our education model, our relatively low student acquisition costs, and our flexible faculty cost model enable us to expand our operating margins. As we increase student enrollments, we are able to scale our online business on a variable basis through growing the number of full-time and adjunct faculty members after we reach certain enrollment metrics (not before). A single adjunct faculty member can work with as little as one student or as many as 50 at any given time. A full-time faculty member works with a maximum of 110 students at any given time.
We also believe our hybrid BSN Pre-Licensure Program has significant potential since there are large waiting lists of applicants at many public universities that offer BSN Pre-Licensure programs in major U.S. metropolitan areas. According to AACN’s report on 2019-2020 Enrollment and Graduations in Baccalaureate and Graduate Programs in Nursing, U.S. nursing schools turned away 80,407 qualified applicants from baccalaureate and graduate nursing programs in 2019 due to an insufficient number of faculty, clinical sites, classroom space, clinical preceptors and budget constraints.

(https://www.aacnnursing.org/Portals/42/News/Factsheets/Faculty-Shortage-Factsheet.pdf).
The Company is currently operating five pre-licensure locations in the Phoenix, Austin, Tampa, Nashville and Atlanta metros. We started operating in Phoenix in 2018. The Company opened two additional new metro locations in Fiscal Year 2021 (Austin and Tampa) and in Fiscal Year 2022 (Nashville and Atlanta), the latter of which began enrolling first year students in February 2022). We stopped admitting students into our Phoenix locations in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2022 in accordance with the AZ BON matter.
“One Student at a Time” Personal Care - We are committed to providing our students with highly responsive and personal individualized support. Every student is assigned an Academic Advisor who becomes an advocate for the student’s success. Our one-on-one approach assures contact with faculty members when a student needs it and monitoring to keep them on course. Our administrative staff is readily available to answer any questions and work with a student from initial interest through the application process and enrollment, and most importantly while the student is pursuing their studies.
Admissions
In considering candidates for acceptance into any of our certificate or degree programs, we look for those who are serious about pursuing – or advancing in – a professional career, and who want to be both prepared and academically challenged in the process. We strive to maintain the highest standards of academic excellence, while maintaining a friendly learning environment designed for educational, personal and professional success. A desire to meet those standards is a prerequisite. Because our programs are designed for self-directed learners, successful students have a basic understanding of time management principles and practices, as well as good writing and research skills. Admission to Aspen University is based on a thorough assessment of each applicant’s potential to complete the program successfully.
Industry Overview
According to the DOE reports, among college students that study exclusively online, the percentage of students at private for-profit institutions was higher (60%), than that of students at public institutions (46%) and private nonprofit institutions (34%). In particular, the percentage of students who took distance education courses exclusively was highest at private for-profit four-year institutions (73%) which, despite enrolling only 4% of undergraduates, accounted for 6% of undergraduates who were enrolled exclusively in distance education courses.
In terms of the nursing sector, job opportunities for registered nurses are expected to grow about as fast as the average growth for all occupations, or approximately 9%, between 2020 and 2030, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics’ Occupational Outlook Handbook, 2020-30 Edition. However, despite the anticipated growth in job opportunities, over 80,400 qualified applications were not accepted by entry-level baccalaureate and graduate nursing programs according to the 2019-2020 Enrollment and Graduations in Baccalaureate and Graduate Programs in Nursing report from the American Association of Colleges of Nursing (https://www.aacnnursing.org/Portals/42/News/Factsheets/Faculty-Shortage-Factsheet.pdf). These statistics suggest there continues to be unmet demand from qualified students for nursing educational programs. In fiscal year 2022, nursing shortages continued in part due to ongoing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. A growing number of nurses are leaving the profession as they reach retirement age or due to pandemic-induced job fatigue. This supply-side trend, coupled with the rising demand for healthcare to support the aging U.S. population, is expected to perpetuate a nursing shortage through 2030. Given the growing demand for healthcare services across a multitude of specialties, reports project that 1.2 million new registered nurses (RNs) will be needed by 2030 to address the current shortage.
Competition
According to the most recent 2019 Digest of Education Statistics (nces.ed.gov), there are more than 4,300 U.S. colleges and universities serving traditional college-age students and adult students. Any reference to universities herein also includes colleges. Competition is highly fragmented and varies by geography, program offerings, delivery method, ownership, quality level, and selectivity of admissions. No one institution has a significant share of the total postsecondary market. While we compete in a sense with traditional “brick and mortar” universities, our primary competitors are universities that primarily enroll online students. Our primarily online university competitors include American Public Education, Inc. (Nasdaq: APEI), Adtalem Global Education (NYSE: ATGE), Apollo Education Group, Inc., Grand Canyon Education, Inc. (Nasdaq: LOPE), Strategic Education, Inc. (Nasdaq: STRA), and Western Governors University.

We believe that these competitors have degreed enrollments ranging from approximately 38,000 to over 100,000 students. As of April 30, 2022, AGI had 13,334 active degree-seeking students enrolled. Because of COVID-19 which has caused most 

educational institutions to transition to some extent to more online capabilities, we may face more online competition in the future. Further, COVID-19 caused nurses to seek graduate level courses to retrench as they were overwhelmed treating hospitalized patients. COVID-19 also significantly reduced the number of students enrolled in postsecondary education institutions in recent years, which limits the pool of prospective students for which we compete for enrollments with our competitors in the industry.
The primary mission of most traditional accredited four-year universities is to serve full-time students and conduct research. Most online universities serve working adults. Aspen Group acknowledges the differences in the educational needs between working and full-time students at “brick and mortar” schools and provides programs and services that allow our students to earn their degrees without major disruption to their personal and professional lives.
We also compete with public and private degree-granting regionally and nationally accredited universities. An increasing number of universities enroll working students in addition to the traditional 18 to 24-year-old students, and we expect that these universities will continue to modify their existing programs to serve working learners more effectively, including by offering more distance learning programs. We believe that the primary factors on which we compete are the following:
•Active and relevant curriculum that considers the needs of employers;
•The ability to provide flexible and convenient access to programs and classes;
•Cost of the program;
•Monthly payment plan options;
•High-quality courses and services;
•Comprehensive student support services;
•Breadth of programs offered;
•The time necessary to earn a degree;
•Qualified and experienced faculty;
•Reputation of the institution and its programs;
•The variety of geographic locations of campuses;
•Name recognition; and
•Convenience.

Sales and Marketing
Following Mr. Michael Mathews becoming our Chief Executive Officer in 2011, he and his team made significant changes to Aspen’s sales and marketing program, specifically spending a significant amount of time, money and resources on our proprietary Internet marketing program. What is unique about our Internet marketing program is that we have not used and have no plans in the near future to acquire non-branded, non-exclusive leads from third-party online lead generation companies to attract prospective students. To our knowledge, most if not all for-profit online universities utilize multiple third-party online lead generation companies to obtain a meaningful percentage of their prospective student leads that are branded and exclusive in nature, and those leads are both non-branded and non-exclusive in addition to exclusive branded leads. Our executive officers have many years of expertise in the online lead generation and Internet advertising industry, which has and for the foreseeable future is expected to continue to allow us to cost-effectively drive all prospective student leads that are branded and exclusive in nature. 
We have invested in our technology infrastructure and believe our education technology platform enables us to achieve lower costs per enrollment as compared to our competition. 
Human Capital
We recognize that our performance depends on the education, experiences, and efforts of our employees, and our ability to foster a culture that brings out the best in each. As of April 30, 2022, we had 312 full-time employees, including full-time faculty, and 821 adjunct professors, who are part-time employees. None of our employees are parties to any collective bargaining arrangement. We believe our relationships with our employees are good. Our employees have diverse backgrounds, as evidenced by the fact that approximately 74% of our faculty and staff are female and approximately 48% of our employees self-identify as ethnically diverse.
Diversity and equity are at the heart of our culture, influenced in part by the communities we serve including but not limited to healthcare, the military, and veterans. In support of their respective missions, each of our universities have published diversity and equity statements that guide and support their actions to attract, retain and develop highly qualified administration, faculty, and staff:
Aspen University is committed to diversity, equity, and inclusion in its faculty, administration, and staff hiring practices, employee policies, and student admissions practices and policies. It is committed to non-discrimination in the delivery of its educational services and employment opportunities. The University does not discriminate on the basis of sex, race, color, national origin, religion, age, gender, sexual orientation, veteran status, physical or mental disability, medical condition as defined by law, or any basis prohibited by law.
As forged by its mission and vision and the University’s unique and distinctive character to serve the underserved community in California and the nation, United States University ensures an uncompromising commitment to offering access to affordable higher education to all individuals who meet the criteria for admission regardless of age, gender, culture, ethnicity, socio-economic class and disability. At all times, USU shall strive to ensure equitable representation of all diverse groups in its student body. USU’s diverse administration, faculty and staff shall be equally dedicated to the success of all students. The diversity of USU’s administration and faculty shall help enrich curricula, while a diverse staff shall serve students with sensitivity to special needs.
We have learned that an inclusive and positive workplace results in business growth and inspires increased academic and business innovation, the retention of exceptional talent, and a more involved workforce. 
Talent Development and Retention
The Company is dedicated to attracting, retaining, and developing employees who adhere to high standards of business and personal integrity and who maintain a reputation for honesty, fairness, respect, responsibility, and trust. Our strategic initiatives require our leadership, management, faculty, and staff to perform at a consistently high level and to adapt and learn new skills and capabilities. Our employees must have a wide and diverse range of education, experience, background, and skill to anticipate and meet our business needs and exercise sound business judgment. 
To promote retention, we offer comprehensive compensation and benefits packages that are competitive and performance-based. We have undertaken an analysis of market-competitive compensation and benefits practices to attract new and more culturally diverse employees and to reward current ones. We believe that continuous education aids in employee retention and so we provide a tuition benefit to them, their spouses, or their dependents. Full-time employees receive a 100% tuition discount on most programs offered by the universities. Spouses, legal partners, and legal dependents of full-time employees, as well as adjunct faculty, receive a 50% discount.
To promote career development among our leadership and staff, we provide job and leadership training as well as professional development opportunities. We financially support university administration and management as they seek professional development through professional organizations relevant to their fields and conference attendance. We financially support faculty professional development to stay current in their field of study through NurseTim© trainings (nursing faculty only) and conference attendance. The Faculty Speaker Series, Tuesday Teaching Tips, and Research Colloquium, all supported through the Center for Graduate Studies, also contribute to the professional development of faculty.
We believe that our well-educated and well-qualified faculty are the basis for the success of our students and our programs. Because our business is primarily nursing education, we expect our faculty to integrate their personal and professional nursing experiences into the education of our students. All nursing faculty maintain current, unencumbered state or multi-state compact RN licenses. All faculty are expected to have a degree one level above the degree level they are teaching and to maintain currency in their field. We train and develop our faculty through a formal onboarding process that includes orienting them to academic policies and procedures, pedagogical performance expectations, and responsibilities related to their faculty role. They 

also receive training in tools for increasing student engagement and specific technologies they are required to use for various purposes. After their training, the universities regularly review the performance of their faculty by, among other things, monitoring the contact that faculty have with students, reviewing student feedback, and evaluating the learning outcomes achieved by students. As a result of our training and professional development practices for faculty, we have very little turnover and faculty retention is high. 
Over time, we have hired, retained, and developed a diverse leadership, management, and workforce that is a key component of our success and culture. We believe that our success is directly correlated to our ability to provide employees an interesting and engaging work experience. We value our rich, diverse employees and provide career and professional development opportunities that foster the success of our company.
Impact of COVID-19
The health and well-being of our employees is of utmost importance to the Company. Starting in March 2020, all employees transitioned to a remote workforce. Since that time, Company employees have demonstrated resilience, wisdom, commitment, and compassion in working with colleagues and students. Beginning on June 1, 2021, in an abundance of caution, employees in the U.S. were allowed to return to their offices after providing proof of full vaccination. As of July 6, 2021, all U.S. employees began returning to their offices in a hybrid work environment, meaning that employees now work 40% from home and 60% from the office. Each team within the Company has been given the flexibility to work with their management to determine which days and/or weeks will be worked from home vs. office. Employees are required to follow all Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and local guidelines and federal regulations. Finally, the Company has also introduced a fully-remote model for certain high-performance employees, what the Company calls the ‘Meritocracy Benefit’.
Corporate History
The Company was incorporated on February 23, 2010 in Florida. In February 2012, Aspen Group reincorporated in Delaware under the name Aspen Group, Inc.
Aspen University Inc. was incorporated on September 30, 2004 in Delaware. Its predecessor was a Delaware limited liability company organized in Delaware. On March 13, 2012, Aspen Group, which was then inactive, acquired Aspen University Inc. in a transaction we refer to as the reverse merger. On December 1, 2017, Aspen Group acquired USU.
Available Information
Our corporate website is www.aspu.com. On our website under "SEC Filings", we make available access to our Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, Proxy Statements on Schedule 14A and amendments to those materials filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), free of charge.
Regulation
Regulatory Environment
Students attending our schools finance their education through a combination of individual resources, corporate reimbursement programs and federal student financial assistance funds available through our participation in the Title IV Programs. The discussion which follows outlines the extensive regulations that affect our business. Complying with these regulations entails significant effort from our executives and other employees. Further, regulatory compliance is also expensive. Beyond the internal costs, compliance with the extensive regulatory requirements also involves engagement of outside regulatory professionals.
To participate in Title IV Programs, a school must, among other things, be:
•Authorized to offer its programs of instruction by the applicable state education agencies in the states in which it is physically located (in our case, Colorado, Arizona, Texas, Florida, Georgia, Tennessee and California) or otherwise have a physical presence as defined by the state and meet the state education agency requirements to legally offer postsecondary distance education in any state in which the school is not physically located;
•Accredited by an accrediting agency recognized by the Secretary of DOE; and
•Certified as an eligible institution by DOE.

Collectively, state education agencies, accrediting agencies, and the DOE comprise the higher education regulatory triad. We cannot predict the actions that any entity in the higher education regulatory triad, Congress, or Administration may take or their effect on our schools. 
State Authorization
As institutions of higher education that grant degrees and certificates, we are required to be authorized by applicable state education authorities which exercise regulatory oversight of our schools. In addition, in order to participate in the Title IV Programs, we must be authorized by the applicable state education agencies.
Because we are subject to extensive regulations by the states in which we become authorized or licensed to operate, we must abide by state laws that typically establish standards for instruction, qualifications of faculty, administrative procedures, marketing, recruiting, financial operations and other operational matters. State laws and regulations may limit our ability to offer educational programs and to award degrees. Some states may also prescribe financial regulations that are different from those of DOE. If we fail to comply with state licensing requirements, we may lose our state licensure or authorizations, which in turn would result in a loss of accreditation and access to Title IV funds.
The California Legislature is currently considering the reauthorization of the California Bureau for Private Postsecondary Education (“California Bureau”) as part of its sunset review cycle. There is currently a bill in process (SB1433) that would amend the existing Private Postsecondary Education Act, which governs private institutions operating in the state. On June 22, 2022, SB1433 was amended to include a number of updated definitions, substantive changes around minimum operating standards, and amended accreditation requirements for degree granting institutions, among other amendments. The Bill is set for a hearing in the Assembly Business and Professions committee on June 28th. We expect there will be additional amendments following the hearing, and we do not know what the final version of the bill will include or whether it will be approved by the Governor. In prior years, there have been multiple onerous bills proposed in California that have not become law, and we cannot predict whether similar proposals may be integrated into the current proposal as it moves through the legislative process. Other states in which AGI operates may also make material changes to their authority and structure at any time, so AGI must constantly assess its state oversight agencies to ensure compliance. 
Licensure of Online Programs
On July 31, 2018, the DOE announced its intention to convene a negotiated rulemaking committee (the “Committee”) to consider proposed regulations for Title IV Programs, including revisions to the 2016 state authorization of distance education regulations. The Committee convened for several meetings from January to April 2019. On June 12, 2019, the DOE published a notice of proposed rulemaking, which included proposed regulations that would supplant the 2016 regulations. The DOE released final regulations on accreditation and state authorization of distance education on November 1, 2019, which took effect July 1, 2020 (the “Final Regulations”). Like the 2016 regulations, the Final Regulations require Title IV Program institutions, like ours, that offer postsecondary education through distance education to students in a state in which the institution is not physically located or in which it is otherwise subject to state jurisdiction as determined by that state, to meet any state requirements to offer postsecondary education to students who are located in that state. 
Under the Final Regulations, institutions may meet the authorization requirements by obtaining such authorization directly from any state that requires it or through a state authorization reciprocity agreement, such as the State Authorization Reciprocity Agreement (“SARA”). SARA is intended to make it easier for students to take online courses offered by postsecondary institutions based in another state. SARA is overseen by a National Council (“NC-SARA”) and administered by four regional education compacts.
In May 2022, resulting from its formal move from Colorado to Arizona, Aspen University was removed as an approved institutional participant in NC-SARA through CO-SARA. An agreement with CO-SARA permits most currently enrolled students to be covered through early September 2022. Aspen University will be on the agenda for AZ-SARA in early September 2022 to obtain approval to become an institutional participant again in NC-SARA from its new primary location in Arizona. In the meantime, Aspen University is seeking individual state authorizations for its students. Aspen University is currently authorized in 30 states and is in the development process with 20 states and the District of Columbia. Aspen maintains its state authorizations through annual reporting and required renewals. The only state that does not participate in NC-SARA is California and it has imposed regulatory requirements on out-of-state educational institutions operating within its boundaries, such as those having a physical facility or conducting certain academic activities within the state. Aspen University is registered as an out-of-state institution with California until February 19, 2023, and plans to renew at that time. Aspen University currently enrolls students in all 50 states. While we do not believe that any of the states in which our schools are currently licensed or authorized, other than Arizona, Texas, Florida, Georgia, Tennessee and California, is individually material to our 

operations, the loss of licensure or authorization in any state could prohibit us from recruiting prospective students or offering services to current students in that state, which could significantly reduce our enrollments.
On July 14, 2020, the Delaware DOE informed Aspen that an application for renewal was not necessary due to its active institutional membership with NC-SARA. With Aspen’s removal as an active institutional member of NC-SARA in May 2022, Aspen currently seeks renewal in the State of Delaware. 
Because USU is based in California, which does not participate in NC-SARA, USU must obtain authorization in every state in which it intends to market and enroll online students, which was the standard method prior to the formation of NC-SARA. USU is currently authorized to offer one or more programs in 42 states and is in the application development process with 8 additional states and the District of Columbia. USU maintains its state authorizations through annual reporting and required renewals.
Individual state laws establish standards in areas such as instruction, qualifications of faculty, administrative procedures, marketing, recruiting, financial operations, and other operational matters, some of which are different than the standards prescribed by the Arizona Board, the Texas Board, the Florida Commission, the Tennessee Commission, the Georgia Commission, and the California Bureau. Laws in some states limit the ability of schools to offer educational programs and award degrees to residents of those states. Some states also prescribe financial regulations that are different from those of DOE, and many require the posting of surety bonds. Laws, regulations, or interpretations related to online education could increase our cost of doing business and affect our ability to recruit students in particular states, which could, in turn, negatively affect enrollments and revenues and have a material adverse effect on our business.
Licensure of Physical Locations
The Higher Education Opportunity Act ("HEOA") and certain state laws require our institutions to be legally authorized to provide educational programs in states in which our schools have a physical location or otherwise have a physical presence as defined by the state. Aspen University is authorized to provide educational programs in Arizona by the Arizona State Board for Private Postsecondary Education (“Arizona Board”), in Texas by the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board (“Texas Board”), in Tennessee by the Tennessee Higher Education Commission (“Tennessee Commission”), in Georgia by the Georgia Nonpublic Postsecondary Education Commission (“Georgia Commission”), and in Florida by the Florida Commission on Independent Education (“Florida Commission”). USU is authorized to provide educational programs in California by the California Bureau. Failure to comply with state requirements could result in Aspen University losing its authorization from the Arizona Board, Texas Board, Tennessee Commission, Georgia Commission, or Florida Commission; and USU losing its authorization from the California Bureau. In such event, the schools would lose their eligibility to participate in Title IV Programs, or their ability to offer certain educational programs, any of which may force us to cease the school’s operations.
Additionally, Aspen University and USU are Delaware corporations. Delaware law requires an institution to obtain approval from the Delaware Department of Education, or Delaware DOE, before it may incorporate with the power to confer degrees. In July 2012, Aspen University received notice from the Delaware DOE that it was granted provisional approval status effective until June 30, 2015. On April 25, 2016, the Delaware DOE informed Aspen University it was granted full approval to operate with degree-granting authority in the State of Delaware. On July 14, 2020, the Delaware DOE informed Aspen that an application for renewal was not necessary due to its active institutional membership with NC-SARA. With Aspen’s removal as an active institutional member of NC-SARA in May 2022, Aspen currently seeks renewal in the State of Delaware. On June 6, 2018, the Delaware DOE granted an initial operating license to USU until June 30, 2023.
In March 2022, Aspen entered into a Consent Agreement with the AZ BON resulting primarily from concerns raised by the AZ BON stemming from NCLEX-RN pass rates below the state’s required threshold. The result of the Consent Agreement is that Aspen University remains approved with the AZ BON based on a stayed revocation and probationary period with certain conditions, including but not limited to, the cessation of enrollments in the core component of the pre-licensure nursing program and reporting to staff/board on a monthly basis. The cessation of enrollments into the core component of the pre-licensure nursing program will remain in effect until Aspen University complies with the conditions of its Consent Agreement with the AZ BON, which is more fully discussed under “State Professional Licensure” below. In April 2022, Aspen University entered into a Stipulated Agreement with the Arizona State Board for Private Postsecondary Education as an amendment to its 2022 Regular Vocational and Degree Granting Agreement for licensure. The Stipulated Agreement required the cessation of enrollments in both the pre-professional nursing and core components of the pre-licensure program in Arizona, the posting of a surety bond in the amount of $18,287,110 which has already been posted, the submission of student records on a monthly basis, and the removal of the Arizona pre-licensure nursing program start date information from its website and marketing materials. Aspen University is not currently enrolling students in the BSN Pre-licensure program in Arizona. The Stipulated Agreement can be amended in the future.
Accreditation
Aspen University is institutionally accredited by the DEAC, an accrediting agency recognized by CHEA and the DOE, and USU is institutionally accredited by WSCUC, an accrediting agency also recognized by CHEA and the DOE. Accreditation is a non-governmental system for evaluating educational institutions and their programs in areas including student performance, governance, integrity, educational quality, faculty, physical resources, administrative capability and resources, and financial stability. In the U.S., this recognition comes primarily through private voluntary associations that accredit institutions and programs. To be recognized by the DOE, accrediting agencies must adopt specific standards for their review of educational institutions. Accrediting agencies establish criteria for accreditation, conduct peer-review evaluations of institutions and programs for accreditation, and publicly designate those institutions or programs that meet their criteria. Accredited institutions are subject to periodic review by accrediting agencies to determine whether such institutions maintain the performance, integrity and quality required for accreditation.
Accreditation is important to our schools for several reasons. Accreditation provides external recognition and status. Employers rely on the accredited status of institutions when evaluating an employment candidate’s credentials. Corporate and government sponsors under tuition reimbursement programs look to accreditation for assurance that an institution maintains quality educational standards. Other institutions depend, in part, on our accreditation in evaluating transfers of credit and applications to graduate schools. 
Moreover, institutional accreditation awarded from an accrediting agency recognized by DOE is necessary for eligibility to participate in the Title IV Programs. As part of the Final Regulations published on November 1, 2019, and which took effect July 1, 2020, the DOE amended regulations relating to the recognition of accrediting agencies. The Final Regulations amended the DOE’s process for recognition and review of accrediting agencies, including the criteria used by the DOE to recognize accrediting agencies, and the DOE’s requirements for accrediting agencies’ policies and standards that are applied to institutions and programs. Accrediting agencies are under heightened scrutiny due to perceived shortcomings of certain agencies and their oversight of closed institutions. In response, accreditors are increasing their scrutiny of institutions. From time to time, accrediting agencies adopt or make changes to their policies, procedures and standards. If our schools fail to comply with any of these requirements, the non-complying school’s accreditation status could be at risk.
In addition to institutional accreditation, there are numerous specialized accreditors that accredit specific programs or schools within their jurisdiction, many of which are in healthcare and professional fields. USU’s and Aspen University’s baccalaureate and master’s degree programs in nursing are accredited by the Commission on Collegiate Nursing Education (CCNE) and Aspen University’s doctoral nursing degree is currently CCNE-accredited. CCNE is officially recognized by CHEA and the DOE and provides accreditation for nursing programs. Accreditation by CCNE signifies that those programs have met the additional standards of that agency. We are also pleased that Aspen University’s School of Business and Technology has been awarded the status of Candidate for Accreditation by the International Accreditation Council for Business Education (IACBE) for its baccalaureate and master’s business programs. Finally, USU’s Bachelor of Arts in Liberal Studies has two Teacher Credentialing tracks: (1) Multiple Subject Credential Preparation track for students in California interested in teaching at the TK-6 level, and (2) General track for students interested in exploring a variety of topics, transfer students, or students outside of California. Both tracks are approved by the California Commission on Teacher Credentialing (CTC).
If we fail to satisfy the standards of specialized accreditors, we could lose the specialized accreditation for the affected programs, which could result in materially reduced student enrollments in those programs and prevent our students from seeking and obtaining appropriate licensure in their fields.
State Professional Licensure
States have specific requirements that an individual must satisfy in order to be licensed or certified as a professional in specific fields. For example, graduates from some USU and Aspen University nursing programs often seek professional licensure in their field because they are legally required to do so in order to work in that field or because obtaining licensure enhances employment opportunities. Success in obtaining licensure depends on several factors, including each individual’s personal and professional qualifications as well as other factors related to the degree or program completed, including but not necessarily limited to:
•whether the institution and the program were approved by the state in which the graduate seeks licensure, or by a professional association;
•whether the program from which the applicant graduated meets all state requirements; and
•whether the institution and/or the program is accredited by a CHEA and DOE-recognized agency.

Professional licensure and certification requirements can vary by state and may change over time. 
In addition, the Final Regulations that took effect July 1, 2020 require institutions to make readily available disclosures to enrolled and prospective students regarding whether programs leading to professional licensure or certification meet state educational requirements for that professional license or certification. These disclosures apply to both on-ground and online programs that lead to professional licensure or certification or are advertised as leading to professional licensure or certification. Under the Final Regulations, institutions must determine the state in which current and prospective students are located, and then must: (1) determine whether such program’s curriculum meets the educational requirements for licensure or certification in that state; (2) determine whether such program’s curriculum does not meet the educational requirements for licensure or certification in that state; or (3) choose not to make a determination as to whether such program’s curriculum meets the educational requirements for licensure or certification in that state. Institutions must also provide direct disclosures in writing to prospective students and current students under certain circumstances. Institutions must provide direct disclosures in writing to prospective students if the institution has determined the program in which the student intends to enroll does not meet the educational requirements for licensure or certification in the state in which the student is located or if the institution has not made any determination. Institutions must provide direct disclosures in writing to current students, but only if the institution has determined the program in which the student is enrolled does not meet the educational requirements for licensure in the state in which the student is located.
As noted above, in March 2022, Aspen University entered into the Consent Agreement with the AZ BON. Aspen University held provisional approval to offer the core component of its pre-licensure nursing program in Arizona through AZ BON; in June 2022, the AZ BON granted approval of Aspen University’s request for provisional approval as long as the program is in compliance with the consent agreement through March 31, 2025. However, Aspen University is not currently enrolling students in the BSN Pre-licensure program in Arizona. While Aspen University disputed many of the allegations made, the institution determined that settlement was the best option to reduce disruption for students and address the concerns raised. As a condition of the Consent Agreement, Aspen University’s Provisional Approval was revoked, with the revocation stayed pending Aspen University’s compliance with the terms and conditions of the Consent Agreement. The stay is broken into two phases, the first lasting through the end of Calendar Year 2022. During Phase I, Aspen University is not permitted to enroll any new students into the core component of its pre-licensure nursing program in Arizona, and must achieve the AZ BON-required 80% NCLEX pass rate for the Calendar Year 2022 annual reporting cycle. If this benchmark is not achieved, the AZ BON may lift the stay and initiate the revocation. If Phase I is completed successfully, Phase II will commence with Aspen University on Probation (regular or “stayed revocation” probation, depending on the outcome of Phase I). Aspen University is permitted to begin enrollments into the core component of its pre-licensure nursing program in Arizona once four consecutive quarters of 80% NCLEX first-time pass rates occur. However, once achieved, if the NCLEX pass rate falls below 80% for any quarter, the AZ BON may limit enrollments, and repeated failures may result in a required cessation of enrollments and teach-out of the program. The terms of the Consent Agreement also include requirements that we provide the AZ BON with monthly reports, provide that our faculty and administrators undergo additional training, retain an approved consultant to prepare and submit evaluations to the AZ BON, and hire a minimum of 35% full-time qualified faculty by September 30, 2022. The Consent Agreement is filed as Exhibit 10.22 to this Report. For the quarters ended March 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, Aspen University’s NCLEX scores were 73.33% and 69.64%, respectively.
Nature of Federal, State and Private Financial Support for Postsecondary Education
The federal government provides a substantial part of its support for postsecondary education through the Title IV Programs, in the form of grants and loans to students. Students can use those funds at any institution that has been certified by DOE to participate in the Title IV Programs. Aid under Title IV Programs is primarily awarded on the basis of financial need, generally defined as the difference between the cost of attending the institution and the amount a student can reasonably contribute to that cost. All recipients of Title IV Program funds must maintain satisfactory academic progress and must progress in a timely manner toward completion of their program of study. In addition, each school must ensure that Title IV Program funds are properly accounted for and disbursed in the correct amounts to eligible students.
Our institutional missions manifest themselves through offering students the opportunity to fund their education without relying solely on student loans. In 2014, Aspen University launched a $250 monthly payment plan for associate and bachelor degree students and a $325 monthly payment plan for master’s degree students, and subsequently a $375 monthly payment plan for doctoral and MSN-FNP students. The monthly payment plan is available to all Aspen University and United States University students except those in the Aspen University BSN Pre-Licensure program. 
Currently, 6,811 or 67% of Aspen University students utilize monthly payment options, including the monthly payment plan or the installment plan. In 2017, USU implemented these monthly payment options and currently has 2,148 or 69% of its students utilizing them. 

When Aspen University students seek funding from the federal government, they could receive loans and grants to fund their education under the following Title IV Programs: (1) the Federal Direct Loan program, or Direct Loan, and (2) the Federal Pell Grant program, or Pell. USU students are eligible for the same, plus Federal Work Study and Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants, which are both financial needs based. Graduate students are only eligible to participate in the Direct Loan and Federal Work Study programs and not all undergraduate students receive a Pell Grant or the Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant. The majority of students who seek funding from the federal government receive at least one Direct Loan that must be repaid with interest starting after the student leaves school. 
Additionally, some students may receive full or partial tuition reimbursement from their employers. Eligible credit-worthy students can also access private loans through a number of different lenders for funding at current market interest rates.
Under the Direct Loan program, the DOE makes loans directly to students. The Direct Loan Program includes the Direct Subsidized Loan, the Direct Unsubsidized Loan, and the Direct PLUS Loan for credit-worthy parents of dependent undergraduate students and credit-worthy graduate and professional students. 
For Pell Grants, the DOE makes grants to undergraduate students who demonstrate financial need. To date, few of our students have received Pell Grants. Accordingly, the Pell Grant program currently is not material to the Company’s cash revenues.
Regulation of Federal Student Financial Aid Programs
The substantial amount of federal funds disbursed through Title IV Programs, the large number of students and institutions participating in these programs, and allegations of fraud and abuse by certain for-profit institutions have prompted the DOE to exercise considerable regulatory oversight over for-profit institutions of higher learning. Accrediting agencies and state education agencies also have responsibilities for overseeing compliance of institutions in connection with Title IV Program requirements. As a result, our institutions are subject to extensive oversight and review. Because the DOE periodically revises its regulations and changes its interpretations of existing laws and regulations, we cannot predict how the Title IV Program requirements will be applied in all circumstances. See the “Risk Factors” contained herein which disclose comprehensive regulatory risks.
In addition to the state authorization requirements and other regulatory requirements described herein, other significant factors relating to Title IV Programs that could adversely affect us include the following legislative action and regulatory changes:
Congressional Action. Congress reauthorizes the Higher Education Act approximately every five to six years. Congress most recently reauthorized the Higher Education Act in August 2008 through the end of 2013 and the law has been extended since that date. Congress has held hearings regarding the reauthorization of the HEA and has continued to consider new legislation regarding the passage of the HEA. Congress enacted a small package of HEA changes as part of the larger Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2021 legislation signed into law in December 2020, which will become effective between 2021 and 2023. The significant rules in this legislation were focused on the simplification of the federal aid application and determination of student eligibility. We cannot predict the impact of these new laws on our students since the DOE has not provided implementation guidance, nor can we predict whether or when Congress might act to amend further the HEA. The elimination of additional Title IV Programs, material changes in the requirements for participation in such programs, or the substitution of materially different programs could increase our costs of compliance and could reduce the ability of certain students to finance their education at our institutions.
Federal Rulemaking. On May 24, 2021, the DOE published a Federal Register notice indicating its intent to convene multiple committees to develop proposed regulations in three broad areas under Title IV of the Higher Education Act: affordability of postsecondary education, institutional accountability, and Federal student loans. 
The DOE held virtual public hearings for interested parties to comment on the rulemaking agenda, including the list of topics being considered and other suggested topics, in June 2021. 
In the Fall of 2021, the DOE conducted the first of two rounds of negotiated rulemaking. The first round of negotiations ran for three weeks over October, November and December and covered the following topics:
•Total and Permanent Disability
•Closed School Discharge
•Interest Capitalization
•Improving the Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) Application Process

•Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) Eligibility
•Borrower Defense to Repayment (Adjudication Process)
•Borrower Defense to Repayment (Post-Adjudication)
•Borrower Defense to Repayment (Recovery From Institutions)
•Predispute Arbitration and Class Action Waivers
•Creating A New Income-driven Repayment Plan
In the Spring of 2022, ED conducted a second round of rulemaking over three weeks in January, February, and March, covering the following topics:
•Administrative Capability
•The 90/10 Rule
•Certification Procedures
•Change in Ownership/Control
•Financial Responsibility
•Gainful Employment
•Ability-to-Benefit
As is typically the case with federal rulemaking, limited consensus was reached, providing the DOE with discretion to draft regulations for comment as it sees fit on most of the topics noted. We are aware of approximately 10 of the discrete regulatory topics discussed during the rulemaking that have been drafted into proposed rules and submitted to the White House Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (“OIRA”)/Office of Management and Budget (“OMB”) for review. The content of those proposed rules is not public and will not be made public until the White House offices have signed off, at which point, the DOE can publish the proposals for comment. Rules that impact the Title IV programs are subject to the HEA Master Calendar, which requires final rules be published before November 1 of the year prior, in order to become effective on July 1 of the following year. In order to meet this deadline, the DOE must complete the OIRA and OMB processes as noted above, publish the proposed rule for comment (typically with a 30-60 day public response period), review and respond to the comments, draft a final rule, have that reviewed by counsel and the OIRA/OMB, and then publish in the Federal Register by November 1.
Currently, the following proposed rules are being reviewed by OIRA/OMB:
•Income Driven Repayment
•Implementing Statutory Changes to Pell Grants for Incarcerated Students
•The 90/10 Rule
•Clarifying Rules on Changes in Ownership
•Borrower Defense 
•Total and Permanent Disability Discharge
•Closed School Discharge
•False Certification Discharges 
•Public Service Loan Forgiveness 
•Interest Capitalization
The DOE is still indicating that it believes it will get this collection of regulatory packages through the process prior to November 1. 
On June 21, 2022, the Agency Rule List for the DOE stated that five of the 2021-2022 Federal Negotiated Rulemaking issues will not be completed this year. The list includes: 
•Gainful Employment
•Factors of Financial Responsibility
•Standards of Administrative Capability
•Certification Procedures
•Ability-to-Benefit
This delay means that these rules cannot become effective until July 1, 2024, at the earliest.
Administrative Capability. The DOE regulations specify extensive criteria by which an institution must establish that it has the requisite “administrative capability” to participate in Title IV Programs. Failure to satisfy any of the standards may lead DOE to 

find the institution ineligible to participate in Title IV Programs or to place the institution on provisional certification as a condition of its participation. To meet the administrative capability standards, an institution must, among other things:
•Comply with all applicable Title IV Program regulations;
•Have capable and sufficient personnel to administer the federal student financial aid programs;
•Have acceptable methods of defining and measuring the satisfactory academic progress of its students;
•Have cohort default rates above specified levels;
•Have various procedures in place for safeguarding federal funds;
•Not be, and not have any principal or affiliate who is, debarred or suspended from federal contracting or engaging in activity that is cause for debarment or suspension;
•Provide financial aid counseling to its students;
•Refer to the DOE’s Office of Inspector General any credible information indicating that any applicant, student, employee, or agent of the institution, has been engaged in any fraud or other illegal conduct involving Title IV Programs;
•Report annually to the Secretary of Education on any reasonable reimbursements paid or provided by a private education lender or group of lenders to any employee who is employed in the institution’s financial aid office or who otherwise has responsibilities with respect to education loans;
•Develop and apply an adequate system to identify and resolve conflicting information with respect to a student’s application for Title IV aid;
•Submit in a timely manner all reports and financial statements required by the regulations; and
•Not otherwise appear to lack administrative capability.
The DOE regulations also add an administrative capability standard related to the existing requirement that students must have a high school diploma or its recognized equivalent in order to be eligible for Title IV Program aid. Under the administrative capability standard, institutions must develop and follow procedures for evaluating the validity of a student’s high school diploma if the institution or the Secretary of Education has reason to believe that the student’s diploma is not valid.
If an institution fails to satisfy any of these criteria or any other DOE regulation, DOE may:
•Require the repayment of Title IV Program funds;
•Transfer the institution from the “advance” system of payment of Title IV Program funds to heightened cash monitoring status (HCM1) or to the “reimbursement” system of payment;
•Place the institution on provisional certification status; or
•Commence a proceeding to impose a fine or to limit, suspend or terminate the participation of the institution in Title IV Programs.
Distance Education. We primarily offer our existing degree and certificate programs via Internet-based telecommunications from our headquarters in Arizona and California. Under the HEOA, an accreditor that evaluates institutions offering distance education must require such institutions to have processes through which the institution establishes that a student who registers for a distance education program is the same student who participates in and receives credit for the program.
The Final Regulations regarding state authorization, effective as of July 1, 2020, require Title IV Program institutions, like ours, that offer postsecondary education through distance education to students in a state in which the institution is not physically located or in which it is otherwise subject to state jurisdiction as determined by that state, to meet any state requirements to offer postsecondary education to students who are located in that state. Institutions may meet the authorization requirements by obtaining such authorization directly from any state that requires it or through a state authorization reciprocity agreement, such as SARA, where applicable. See “Risk Factors” in Item 1A of this Report.
The Final Regulations regarding distance education, effective as of July 1, 2021, included new definitions for student and faculty interaction, the definition of faculty, and other aspects of the administration of a distance education program. These are key requirements for distance education program students to retain access to Title IV funds. The universities assessed the amended regulations and determined that material changes to their delivery methodology and processes were not necessary.
Financial Responsibility. The Higher Education Act and the DOE regulations establish extensive standards of financial responsibility that institutions such as Aspen and USU must satisfy to participate in the Title IV Programs. These standards generally require that an institution provide the resources necessary to comply with Title IV Program requirements and meet all of its financial obligations, including required refunds and any repayments to the DOE for liabilities incurred in programs administered by the DOE.

The DOE evaluates institutions on an annual basis for compliance with specified financial responsibility standards that include a complex formula that uses line items from the institution’s audited financial statements. In addition, the financial responsibility standards require an institution to receive an unqualified opinion from its accountants on its audited financial statements, maintain sufficient cash reserves to satisfy refund requirements, meet all of its financial obligations, and remain current on its debt payments. The formula focuses on three financial ratios: (1) equity ratio (which measures the institution’s capital resources, financial viability, and ability to borrow); (2) primary reserve ratio (which measures the institution’s viability and liquidity); and (3) net income ratio (which measures the institution’s profitability or ability to operate within its means). An institution’s financial ratios must yield a composite score of at least 1.5 on a scale of -1.0 to 3.0 for the institution to be deemed financially responsible without the need for further federal oversight. The DOE may also apply such measures of financial responsibility to the operating company and ownership entities of an eligible institution.
Although we believe our schools met the minimum composite score necessary to meet the financial ratio standard for fiscal year 2022, the DOE may determine that our calculations are incorrect, and/or it may determine that either or both of our schools continue to not meet other financial responsibility standards. If the DOE were to determine that we do not meet its financial responsibility standards, we may be able to continue to establish financial responsibility on an alternative basis. Alternative bases include, for example:
•Posting a letter of credit in an amount equal to at least 50% of the total Title IV Program funds received by us during our most recently completed fiscal year;
•Posting a letter of credit in an amount equal to at least 10% of such prior year’s Title IV Program funds received by us, accepting provisional certification, complying with additional the DOE monitoring requirements and agreeing to receive Title IV Program funds under an arrangement other than the DOE’s standard advance payment arrangement such as the “reimbursement” system of payment or cash monitoring.
On May 14, 2019, USU was granted temporary provisional approval to participate in the Title IV Programs and had a program participation agreement reapplication date of December 31, 2020 which it met. As part of the temporary provisional approval, the DOE informed USU that it must post a letter of credit ("LOC") in the amount of $255,708 based on a failure to meet the audited same day balance sheet requirements that apply in a change of control. This LOC was funded by USU. The DOE informed USU that the LOC was reduced to $9,872; this letter with the reduced amount will remain in effect for at least the duration of the temporary provisional approval. On May 6, 2022, the DOE fully certified USU and issued a new Program Participation Agreement, effective through December 31, 2025, thereby removing the provisional status of its participation. USU is working with the DOE to address the outstanding LOC.
Failure to meet the DOE’s “financial responsibility” requirements, either because we do not meet the DOE’s financial responsibility standards or are unable to establish financial responsibility on an alternative basis, would cause us to lose access to Title IV Program funding.
Third-Party Servicers. DOE regulations permit an institution to enter into a written contract with a third-party servicer for the administration of any aspect of the institution’s participation in Title IV Programs. The third-party servicer must, among other obligations, comply with Title IV Program requirements and be jointly and severally liable with the institution to the Secretary of Education for any violation by the servicer of any Title IV Program provision. An institution must report to the DOE new contracts with or any significant modifications to contracts with third-party servicers as well as other matters related to third-party servicers. We contract with two third-party servicers which perform certain activities related to our participation in Title IV Programs. If our third-party servicers do not comply with applicable statutes and regulations including the Higher Education Act, we may be liable for their actions, and we could lose our eligibility to participate in Title IV Programs.
Return of Title IV Program Funds. Under the DOE’s return of funds regulations, when a student withdraws, an institution must return unearned funds to the DOE in a timely manner. An institution must first determine the amount of Title IV Program funds that a student “earned.” If the student withdraws during the first 60% of any period of enrollment or payment period, the amount of Title IV Program funds that the student earned is equal to a pro rata portion of the funds for which the student would otherwise be eligible. If the student withdraws after the 60% threshold, then the student has earned 100% of the Title IV Program funds. Additionally, effective July 1, 2021, a student is not considered to have withdrawn if the student successfully completes one module that includes 49% or more of the number of days in the payment period, excluding scheduled breaks of five or more consecutive days and all days between modules. The institution must return to the appropriate Title IV Programs, in a specified order, the lesser of (i) the unearned Title IV Program funds and (ii) the institutional charges incurred by the student for the period multiplied by the percentage of unearned Title IV Program funds. An institution must return the funds no later than 45 days after the date of the institution’s determination that a student withdrew. If such payments are not timely made, an institution may be subject to adverse action, including being required to submit a letter of credit equal to 25% of the refunds 

the institution should have made in its most recently completed fiscal year. Under the DOE regulations, late returns of Title IV Program funds for 5% or more of students sampled in the institution’s annual compliance audit or a DOE program review constitutes material non-compliance with the Title IV Program requirements and may result in the posting of a letter of credit.
The “90/10 Rule.” A requirement of the Higher Education Act commonly referred to as the “90/10 Rule,” applies only to “proprietary institutions of higher education.” An institution is subject to loss of eligibility to participate in the Title IV Programs if it derives more than 90% of its revenues (calculated on a cash basis and in accordance with a DOE formula) from Title IV Programs for two consecutive fiscal years. An institution whose rate exceeds 90% for any single fiscal year will be placed on provisional certification for at least two fiscal years and may be subject to other conditions specified by the Secretary of the DOE. For the fiscal year ended April 30, 2021, approximately 44.72% of Aspen’s revenue and approximately 33.81% of USU’s revenue were derived from Title IV Programs.
The 90/10 Rule was recently changed as part of the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (“ARP”), but the effective date of this change is not yet established. Under a provision in ARP, the HEA would be modified to change the formula from counting only Title IV program funds on the “90 side” to include instead all ‘‘federal funds that are disbursed or delivered to or on behalf of a student to be used to attend such institution” or collectively “federal education assistance funds.” This is a substantial change, and the impact is not entirely clear, in part because it is unclear whether other federal funds, such as Department of Defense Military Tuition Assistance program, Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act and Trade Adjustment Assistance, will be included in the new definition, despite not being discussed as an impetus for the change. The 90/10 Rule was one of the few items during the 2021/2022 Negotiated Rulemaking that reached consensus; however, the proposed rule is currently with OIRA/OMB and is not yet public. The changes agreed to by the negotiators did not clearly address how federal funds through programs outside of those provided to veterans and military members would be counted, but it was clear that the intent is for GI Bill and any funds provided by the Department of Defense to be moved to the “90 side” of the equation, and it is possible that other federal funding programs, such as the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act, will be included as well.
Student Loan Defaults. Under the Higher Education Act, an education institution may lose its eligibility to participate in some or all of the Title IV Programs if defaults on the repayment of Direct Loan Program loans by its students exceed certain levels. For each federal fiscal year, a rate of student defaults (known as a “cohort default rate”) is calculated for each institution with 30 or more borrowers entering repayment in a given federal fiscal year by determining the rate at which borrowers who become subject to their repayment obligation in that federal fiscal year default by the end of the following two federal fiscal years. For such institutions, the DOE calculates a single cohort default rate for each federal fiscal year that includes in the cohort all current or former student borrowers at the institution who entered repayment on any Direct Loan Program loans during that year.
If an institution’s cohort default rate equals or exceeds 25% in any single year, the institution may be placed on provisional certification status. Provisional certification does not limit an institution’s access to Title IV Program funds; however, an institution with provisional status is subject to closer review by the DOE and may be subject to summary adverse action if it violates Title IV Program requirements. If an institution’s default rate exceeds 40% for one federal fiscal year, the institution may lose eligibility to participate in some or all Title IV Programs. Aspen University’s current official 3-year cohort default rates are as follows: FY2018 (6%), FY2017 (6%), and FY2016 (8.8%). USU’s current official 3-year cohort default rates are as follows: FY2018 (11.7%), FY2017 (7.7%), and FY2016 (10.6%).
Incentive Compensation Rule. As a part of an institution’s program participation agreement with the DOE and in accordance with the HEOA, an institution may not provide any commission, bonus or other incentive payment to any person or entity engaged in any student recruitment, admissions or financial aid awarding activity based directly or indirectly on success in securing enrollments or financial aid. Failure to comply with the incentive payment rule could result in termination of participation in Title IV Programs, limitation on participation in Title IV Programs, or financial penalties. AGI believes its schools are compliance with the Incentive Compensation Rule (the “IC Rule”).
In recent years, other postsecondary educational institutions have been named as defendants in whistleblower lawsuits, known as “qui tam” cases, brought by current or former employees pursuant to the Federal False Claims Act, alleging that their institution’s compensation practices did not comply with the IC Rule. A qui tam case is a civil lawsuit brought by one or more individuals, referred to as a relator, on behalf of the federal government for an alleged submission to the government of a false claim for payment. The relator, often a current or former employee, is entitled to a share of the government’s recovery in the case, including the possibility of treble damages. A qui tam action is always filed under seal and remains under seal until the government decides whether to intervene in the case. If the government intervenes, it takes over primary control of the litigation. If the government declines to intervene in the case, the relator may nonetheless elect to continue to pursue the litigation at his or her own expense on behalf of the government. Any such litigation could be costly and could divert management’s time and attention away from the business, regardless of whether a claim has merit.

The U.S. Government Accountability Office (the “GAO”) released a report finding that the DOE has inadequately enforced the current ban on incentive payments. In response, the DOE has undertaken to increase its enforcement efforts by, among other approaches, strengthening procedures provided to auditors reviewing institutions for compliance with the incentive payments ban and updating its internal compliance guidance in light of the GAO findings.
Code of Conduct Related to Student Loans. As part of an institution’s program participation agreement with the DOE, HEOA requires that institutions that participate in Title IV Programs adopt a code of conduct pertinent to student loans. For financial aid officers or other employees who have responsibility related to education loans, the code must forbid, with limited exceptions, gifts, consulting arrangements with lenders, and advisory board compensation other than reasonable expense reimbursement. The code also must ban revenue-sharing arrangements, “opportunity pools” that lenders offer in exchange for certain promises, and staffing assistance from lenders. The institution must post the code prominently on its website and ensure that its officers, employees, and agents who have financial aid responsibilities are informed annually of the code’s provisions. Aspen has adopted a code of conduct under the HEOA which is posted on its website. In addition to the code of conduct requirements that apply to institutions, HEOA contains provisions that apply to private lenders, prohibiting such lenders from engaging in certain activities as they interact with institutions. Failure to comply with the code of conduct provision could result in termination of our participation in Title IV Programs, limitations on participation in Title IV Programs, or financial penalties.
Misrepresentation. The HEOA and current regulations authorize the DOE to take action against an institution that participates in Title IV Programs for any “substantial misrepresentation” made by that institution regarding the nature of its educational program, its financial charges, or the employability of its graduates. The DOE regulations define “substantial misrepresentation” to cover additional representatives of the institution and additional substantive areas and expands the parties to whom a substantial misrepresentation cannot be made. The regulations also augment the actions the DOE may take if it determines that an institution has engaged in substantial misrepresentation, which include revoking an institution’s program participation agreement or imposing limitations on an institution’s participation in Title IV Programs.
Credit Hours. The Higher Education Act and current regulations use the term “credit hour” to define an eligible program and an academic year and to determine enrollment status and the amount of Title IV Program aid an institution may disburse for particular programs. There are different regulatory definitions for a credit hour for degree and non-degree programs that do not transfer to a degree. Recently, both Congress and the DOE have increased their focus on institutions’ policies for awarding credit hours. The credit value for degree program courses is generally monitored by an institution’s accreditor. The DOE regulations contain specific formulas for Title IV eligible credits for non-degree programs that do not transfer to a degree. DOE regulations define the term “credit hour” in terms of a certain amount of time in class and outside class, or an equivalent amount of work. If the DOE determines that an institution is out of compliance with the credit hour definition, the DOE could require the institution to repay the incorrectly awarded amounts of Title IV Program aid. In addition, if the DOE determines that an institution has significantly overstated the amount of credit hours assigned to a program, the DOE may fine the institution, or limit, suspend, or terminate its participation in the Title IV Programs.
The DOE published a Final Rule relating to credit and clock hours, as well as distance education, on September 2, 2020, with an effective date of July 1, 2021. The Final Rule modified the credit hour formula and calculation of credit hours for programs that do not lead to a degree or are fully transferable to a degree program. Aspen University and USU do not provide Title IV funding to students in non-degree programs that would be subject to this rule change. The Final Rule did not change the method of determining the credit value of courses offered at the universities.
Compliance Reviews. We are subject to announced and unannounced compliance reviews and audits by various external agencies, including the DOE, its Office of Inspector General, state licensing agencies, and accrediting agencies. As part of the DOE’s ongoing monitoring of institutions’ administration of Title IV Programs, the HEOA and the DOE regulations require institutions to submit annually a compliance audit conducted by an independent certified public accountant in accordance with Government Auditing Standards and applicable audit standards of the DOE, which were updated effective for fiscal years beginning after June 30, 2016. These auditing standards differ from those followed in the audit of our consolidated financial statements contained herein. In addition, to enable the DOE to make a determination of financial responsibility, institutions must annually submit audited financial statements prepared in accordance with the DOE regulations. Furthermore, the DOE regularly conducts program reviews of education institutions that are participating in the Title IV Programs, and the Office of Inspector General of the DOE regularly conducts audits and investigations of such institutions.
Potential Effect of Regulatory Violations. If we fail to comply with the regulatory standards governing Title IV Programs, the DOE could impose one or more sanctions, including transferring the non-complying school to the reimbursement or cash monitoring system of payment, seeking to require repayment of certain Title IV Program funds, requiring Aspen or USU to post a letter of credit in favor of the DOE as a condition for continued Title IV certification, taking emergency action against us, referring the matter for criminal prosecution or initiating proceedings to impose a fine or to limit, condition, suspend or 

terminate our participation in Title IV Programs. In addition, the failure to comply with the Title IV Program requirements by one institution could increase DOE scrutiny of the other institution and could impact the other institution’s participation in Title IV Programs.
We also may be subject, from time to time, to complaints and lawsuits relating to regulatory compliance brought not only by our regulatory agencies, but also by other government agencies and third parties, such as state attorneys general, federal and state consumer protection agencies, present or former students or employees and other members of the public.
Restrictions on Adding Educational Programs. State requirements and accrediting agency standards may, in certain instances, limit our ability to establish additional educational programs. Many states require approval before institutions can add new programs under specified conditions. The Arizona Board, the Florida Commission, the Texas Board, the Tennessee Commission, The Georgia Commission, and the California Bureau, institutional or programmatic accreditors and other state educational regulatory agencies that license, accredit or authorize us and our programs may require institutions to notify them in advance of implementing new programs, and upon notification, may undertake a review of the institution’s licensure, accreditation or authorization.
On August 22, 2017, the DOE recertified Aspen University to participate in Title IV Programs. On April 16, 2021, the DOE granted provisional certification for a two-year timeframe, and set a subsequent program participation reapplication date of September 30, 2023. On May 15, 2019, USU was granted temporary provisional approval to participate in the Title IV Programs and submitted a program participation agreement reapplication prior to the December 31, 2020 deadline. On May 6, 2022, USU was issued a new program protection agreement and has full certification until December 31, 2025.
In the future, the DOE may impose terms and conditions in any program participation agreement that it may issue, including growth restrictions or limitations on the number of students who may receive Title IV Program aid. The institution may also be required to provide certifications to the DOE signed by a senior administrative official attesting that the new program meets certain accreditation and state licensure requirements.
DEAC and WSCUC require pre-approval of new courses, programs, and degrees that are characterized as a “substantive change.” An institution must obtain written notice approving such change before it may be included in the institution’s scope of accreditation. An institution is further prohibited from advertising or posting on its website information about the course or program before it has received approval. The process for obtaining approval generally requires submission of a report and course materials and may require a follow-up on-site visit by an examining committee.
Gainful Employment. Under the Higher Education Act, only proprietary school educational programs that lead to gainful employment in a recognized occupation are eligible to participate in Title IV Program funding. DOE issued final Gainful Employment (“GE”) regulations on October 31, 2014 (“2014 GE Rule”), which went into effect on July 1, 2015. The 2014 GE Rule defines the requirements that programs at proprietary institutions must meet in order to be considered a GE program that is eligible for Title IV Program funding. On July 1, 2019, DOE issued a new final GE Rule. In this publication, the DOE rescinded the entirety of Subparts Q and R of 34 CFR 668, which included all of the provisions of the 2014 GE Rule. The effective date of this new rule is July 1, 2020, with an option to implement early. As of July 1, 2019, neither Aspen University nor USU is required to comply with the 2014 GE Rule.
As noted above, GE was one of the topics included in the 2022 negotiated rulemaking. The issue paper presented on GE was hotly debated and did not reach consensus. Unlike most of the other non-consensus proposals, the GE proposal was voted down by at least six negotiators, including representatives of the community colleges. The primary concerns were the abbreviated opportunity to review the proposal and the data supporting it, and the proposed addition of an earnings threshold unrelated to the student’s debt, but targeting an earnings threshold based on what an average high school graduate in the state would earn without a degree or diploma. If a GE program did not yield earnings above that threshold it would fail, regardless of its debt-to-income ratio. Additionally, the proposal removed the transitional periods, the alternative earnings reporting, and the appeal process.  As of now, the GE proposed rule has not been submitted to OIRA/OMB, and it is unclear whether it will be submitted in the near future. We do not know what will be included in the proposed or final rule. As explained above, GE is one of the rules that the DOE has indicated will not be complete by November 1, 2022 and therefore cannot be effective until July 2024, at the earliest. 
Eligibility and Certification Procedures. Each institution must periodically apply to the DOE for continued certification to participate in Title IV Programs. Such recertification is typically required every six years, but may be required earlier, including when an institution undergoes a change of control. An institution may come under the DOE’s review when it expands its activities in certain ways, such as opening an additional location, adding a new program, or, in certain cases, when it modifies academic credentials that it offers.

The DOE may place an institution on provisional certification status if it finds that the institution does not fully satisfy all of the eligibility and certification standards and in certain other circumstances, such as when it undergoes a change in ownership and control. The DOE may more closely review an institution that is provisionally certified if it applies for approval to open a new location, add an educational program, acquire another school or make any other significant change.
In addition, during the period of provisional certification, the institution must comply with any additional conditions included in its program participation agreement. If the DOE determines that a provisionally certified institution is unable to meet its responsibilities under its program participation agreement, it may seek to revoke the institution’s certification to participate in Title IV Programs with fewer due process protections for the institution than if it were fully certified. Students attending provisionally certified institutions remain eligible to receive Title IV Program funds.
Borrower Defense to Repayment (“BDTR”). Pursuant to the Higher Education Act and following negotiated rulemaking, on November 1, 2016, the DOE released a final regulation (“2016 BDTR Rule”) specifying the acts or omissions of an institution that a borrower may assert as a defense to repayment of a loan made under the Direct Loan Program and the consequences of such borrower defenses for borrowers, institutions, and the DOE. Under the regulation, for Direct Loans disbursed after July 1, 2017, a student borrower may assert a defense to repayment if: (1) the student borrower obtained a state or federal court judgment against the institution; (2) the institution failed to perform on a contract with the student; and/or (3) the institution committed a “substantial misrepresentation” on which the borrower reasonably relied to his or her detriment.
These defenses are asserted through claims submitted to the DOE, and the DOE has the authority to issue a final decision in which it may discharge all or part of a borrower's Direct Loan. In addition, the regulation permits the DOE to grant relief to an individual or group of individuals, including individuals who have not applied to the DOE seeking relief. If a defense is successfully raised, the DOE has discretion to initiate action to collect from an institution the amount of losses incurred based on the borrower defense discharge.
The 2016 regulation also amends the rules concerning discharge of federal student loans when a school or campus closes, requires institutions to report events that might potentially impact an institution’s financial responsibility (“financial triggers”) to allow the DOE to determine if the institution needs to provide additional assurances or surety to continue participating in the Title IV Programs, and prohibits pre-dispute arbitration agreements and class action waivers for borrower defense-type claims.
On January 19, 2017, the DOE issued a final procedural rule, specifically relating to the then-upcoming borrower defense rules, with request for comments. These rules were limited to updating the hearing procedures for actions to establish liability against an institution of higher education and establishing procedures for recovery proceedings under the borrower defense regulations.
On June 16, 2017, the DOE announced its intent to convene a negotiated rulemaking committee to develop new and different proposed regulations related to borrower defense to replace the 2016 BDTR Rule and to address certain other related matters. The DOE published the amended final BDTR Rule on September 23, 2019 (the “2019 BDTR Rule”), with an effective date of July 1, 2020. The amended rule made substantial changes to the 2016 Rule. The 2019 BDTR Rule again changes the basis under which a student can make a BDTR claim for loans disbursed after July 1, 2020, limiting it from the three bases in the 2016 Rule to only one basis in the 2019 Rule: misrepresentation upon which a borrower reasonably relied, and which resulted in financial harm to the borrower. The 2019 Rule also removes the group claim option, and instead relies on individual evaluation of borrower’s claims; however, as was the case in the 2016 Rule, the DOE can still initiate an action against the institution to recoup its losses for discharged loans. 
In addition, the 2019 BDTR Rule changes the “financial triggers” and reporting process, narrowing the DOE’s basis for determining a school lacks financial responsibility, and relying on more definitive liabilities that would impact an institution’s composite score, as opposed to more speculative potential losses. The updated provisions include both “mandatory triggering events,” and “discretionary triggering events” that may impact the institution’s financial responsibility under the DOE rules. Institutions are required to report any of the events included under either category, but mandatory events will require the DOE to take action (which includes recalculating the institution’s most recent composite score, if applicable), while the DOE has discretion to determine whether action needs to be taken if the trigger is discretionary. The mandatory triggers include a liability from a settlement or final determination in an action brought by a state or federal agency; a capital distribution or distribution of dividends when an institution’s composite score is below 1.5; or, for publicly traded institutions, an action to revoke registration or delist by the applicable exchange. 
The 2019 Rule removes the prohibition on pre-dispute arbitration provisions and class action waivers, and instead requires institutions to disclose, in laymen’s terms, how arbitration and class action waivers impact the student. The 2019 Rule also makes additional changes to the closed school and false certification loan discharge rules, as well as updating the financial 

reporting requirements relating to how long term debt is calculated and disclosed in annual financial audits, and how institutions must account for operating leases to reflect updated GAAP standards. 
The DOE has begun aggressively pursuing resolution of hundreds of thousands of BDTR claims, granting billions in loan discharges. This has proven quite difficult for institutions as the applicable regulation varies depending on the date of disbursement of the loan for which discharge is sought. Thus, for any borrower applicant, depending on their dates of enrollment and when loans were disbursed, could have their claim reviewed under three different versions of the BDTR regulation.
Now to further complicate this process, the DOE included a revision of the BDTR regulations in the 2021/2022 negotiated rulemaking. The proposed rule is currently with OIRA/OMB and the text is not yet public. However, the proposal presented and discussed during rulemaking includes many of the same provisions as the 2016 BDTR Rule, but split the financial responsibility sections out into a separate package debated by a different set of negotiators. If adopted as drafted, the BDTR proposal would reinstitute the group claim process, reduce due process safeguards for institutions, especially during the claim adjudication process, allow claims at any time without statutes of limitations, and provide for loan discharges regardless of whether there is any actual harm to the borrower. 
Because the proposed rule is with OIRA/OMB now, we expect that it will complete the comment and response process in time for a November 1, 2022 publication, resulting in a July 1, 2023 effective date. 
Change in Ownership Resulting in a Change of Control. In addition to school acquisitions, other types of transactions can also cause a change of control. The DOE, accrediting agencies, and most state education agencies, all have standards pertaining to the change of control of schools, but those standards are not uniform. The DOE regulations describe some transactions that constitute a change of control, including the transfer of a controlling interest in the voting stock of an institution or the institution’s parent corporation. The DOE regulations provide that a change of control of a publicly-traded corporation occurs in one of two ways: (i) if there is an event that would obligate the corporation to file a Current Report on Form 8-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC, disclosing a change of control or (ii) if the corporation has a shareholder that owns at least 25% of the total outstanding voting stock of the corporation and is the largest shareholder of the corporation, and that shareholder ceases to own at least 25% of such stock or ceases to be the largest shareholder. A significant purchase or disposition of our voting stock could be determined by the DOE to be a change of control under this standard. Many states include the sale of a controlling interest of common stock in the definition of a change of control requiring approval. A change of control under the definition of one of these agencies would require us to seek approval of the change in ownership and control to maintain our accreditations, state authorization or licensure. The requirements to obtain such approval from the states and our accrediting agencies vary widely. In some cases, approval of the change of ownership and control cannot be obtained until after the transaction has occurred.
When a change of ownership resulting in a change of control occurs at a for-profit institution, the DOE applies a different set of financial tests to determine the financial responsibility of the institution in conjunction with its review and approval of the change of ownership. The institution generally is required to submit a same-day audited balance sheet reflecting the financial condition of the institution or its parent corporation immediately following the change in ownership. The institution’s same-day balance sheet must demonstrate an acid test ratio of at least 1:1, which is calculated by adding cash and cash equivalents to current accounts receivable and dividing the sum by total current liabilities (and excluding all unsecured or uncollateralized related party receivables). The same-day balance sheet must also demonstrate positive tangible net worth. If the institution does not satisfy either of these requirements, the DOE may condition its approval of the change of ownership on the institution’s agreeing to post a letter of credit, provisional certification, and/or additional monitoring requirements, as described in the above section on Financial Responsibility. As part of the change of control of USU, in addition to being granted provisional approval to participate in the Title IV Programs, the DOE informed USU that it must post a letter of credit based on a failure to meet the audited same day balance sheet requirements that apply in a change of control. 
A change of control also could occur as a result of future transactions in which Aspen is involved. Some corporate reorganizations and some changes in the composition of the Board are examples of such transactions. Moreover, the potential adverse effects of a change of control could influence future decisions by us and our shareholders regarding the sale, purchase, transfer, issuance or redemption of our stock. In addition, the regulatory burdens and risks associated with a change of control also could discourage bids for your shares of common stock and could have an adverse effect on the market price of your shares. The time required for the DOE to act on a change in ownership and control application may vary substantially. In some such recent transactions, institutions have experienced extensive delays in this review process, in some cases exceeding 18-24 months.
Possible Acquisitions. Similar to the Company’s acquisition of USU, we may expand through acquisition of related or synergistic businesses. Our internal growth is subject to monitoring and ultimately approval by the DEAC and WSCUC. If the 

DEAC or WSCUC finds that the growth may adversely affect our academic quality, the DEAC or WSCUC can request us to slow the growth and potentially withdraw accreditation and require us to re-apply for accreditation. The DOE may also impose growth restrictions on an institution, including in connection with a change in ownership and control.
Clery Act and Title IX. Both USU and Aspen University publish the required Annual Crime and Security Reports to comply with the requirements of the federal Jeanne Clery Disclosure of Campus Security Policy and Campus Crime Statistics Act (“Clery Act”). USU publishes separate reports for its San Diego, CA and Phoenix, AZ locations; Aspen publishes separate reports for its Denver, CO, Austin, TX, and Phoenix, AZ locations. With the publication cycle in October 2022, Aspen will additionally publish for locations in Tampa, FL and Nashville, TN. Both universities are committed to providing students, faculty, staff, and guests a safe and secure environment. The Reports identify policies and procedures for security and crime prevention, substance abuse, sexual misconduct/harassment (Title IX), and emergency response and evacuation. On May 6, 2020, the DOE issued a new final rule regarding Title IX which substantially changes institutions’ responsibilities in responding to sexual harassment and sexual assault. The new rule became effective on August 14, 2020, and USU and Aspen have made necessary changes to our policies and procedures to maintain compliance. 
The Biden Administration indicated early on that it planned to make updates to the Title IX regulations a priority item. The proposed rule was submitted to OIRA/OMB in February 2022, and an unofficial version was published on June 23rd, the 50th anniversary of the original passage of the law. Once the proposed rule is officially published in the Federal Register, commentors will have 60 days to provide feedback. 
Because Title IX regulations are not subject to the Master Calendar that governs Title IV regulations, an updated final rule on Title IX could be published relatively quickly. We expect that there is sufficient time for the rule to become final before the end of 2022. 
Other Approvals. The U.S. Department of Defense and the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (the “VA”) regulate our participation in the military’s tuition assistance program and the VA’s veterans’ education benefits program, respectively. The laws, regulations, standards and policies of these agencies cover the vast majority of our operations, including our educational programs, facilities, instructional and administrative staff, administrative procedures, marketing, recruiting, financial operations and financial condition. These regulatory requirements can also affect our ability to add new or expand existing educational programs and to change our corporate structure and ownership.
Seasonality
Our business has been seasonal with our fiscal fourth quarter (beginning February 1) being our strongest quarter and the fiscal second quarter (beginning August 1) being the next strongest. The fiscal first quarter (beginning May 1) is the weakest as it covers the summer months of June and July. Given the growth of USU’s structured two-year MSN-FNP program and Aspen University’s BSN Pre-Licensure hybrid campus program, future seasonality may be less pronounced.
