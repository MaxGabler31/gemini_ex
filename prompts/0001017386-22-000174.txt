Our operations are organized around the following principal activities:

Talent Development:
 

• | We actively seek out new talent to establish the next generation of MMA fighters to provide our audiences with the exciting combat action for which XFC events have become known. Our fighter-centric leadership team takes pride in discovering the next generation of rising superstars and providing them the resources and training required to maximize their success in the Hexagon. A key element to the success of our talent development efforts surrounds our national and regional “Tryouts” which are held to identify the next generation of talent. These events are designed to highlight the competitive elements of our events and allow fighters to rise through multiple levels of the tryout and tournament competitions. New fighters that are identified at our tryouts are offered the chance to sign an exclusive agreement to compete in XFC events for a specified period of time.

Previously, we were an exploration stage company engaged in the acquisition and exploration of mineral properties named Duke Mountain Resources, Inc.  On December 31, 2013, we completed the acquisition of all of the issued and outstanding shares of Fostung Resources, which is the holder of certain leases and mining claims to a Fostung Tungsten property located in Foster Township, Sudbury, Ontario, Canada (the "Fostung Property") from RenovaCare, Inc. (f/k/a Janus Resources, Inc.) ("Janus"), a corporation organized under the laws of the State of Nevada.
 
During 2018, the Company began making investments of its capital, time and other resources in the market of mixed martial arts (“MMA”). The Company, as a result of its investments became a majority owner in a private company called, Xtreme Fighting Championships, Inc., a Florida corporation. The MMA and extreme sports market in general have become very profitable and so the company has begun operating in the MMA market. On July 13, 2020, the company changed its name to Xtreme Fighting Championships, Inc., pursuant to the laws of the Company’s state of incorporation and the rules and requirements of FINRA.

On January 25, 2020, Duke Mountain Resources, Inc. and Atlas Capital Partners, Inc. entered into a Share Purchase and Assignment of Debt Agreement.  However, it was later discovered that Atlas Capital Partner, Inc. did not own the intellectual property agreed to by the parties and the debt in the agreement was later forgiven.
 
On December 17, 2021, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, also known as FINRA, approved our name change to Xtreme Fighting Championships, Inc. and a change to our stock symbol on the Over-the-Counter Stock Exchange from “DKMR” to “XFCI”. In addition, we performed a 1 for 1000 reverse stock split. Which reduced our outstanding stock from 132,419,516 to 132,420.
 
Industry and Market
 
The industry and market under which XFC exists is the sports market and martial arts fighting. We work with broadcast partners, such as NBC, FOX Sport and Telemundo, to broadcast fights to has many countries as possible.
Competition

Of our competitors, Ultimate Fighting Champions (“UFC”) is the largest. They are a multi-billion-dollar corporation whose fights are also broadcast on television. UFC is far larger than we are and they are currently better capitalized. We expect to continue to grow our business, but we are currently among the smaller MMA Fighting Leagues.
Intellectual Property
 
Our success and ability to compete depends in part on our ability to maintain our trade secrets. All of our employees and consultants are subject to non-disclosure agreements and other contractual provisions to establish and maintain our proprietary rights.
Research and Development
 
We are not in an industry or market where research and development is required to remain competitive. Our main product involves our ability to showcase the talents that our mixed martial arts fighters are able to display during their fights which we are able to display and broadcast to the public through our broadcast partners such as NBC, FOX Sports and Telemundo.
