We are one of the gaming industry’s leading manufacturers and suppliers of casino table game equipment. We custom manufacture and supply casino currency, with multiple security and design options, playing cards, table layouts, gaming furniture, table accessories, dice, and roulette wheels. We also provide multiple radio frequency identification (RFID) technologies including low- and high-frequency RFID casino currency, RFID solutions for casino currency (consisting of low- and high-frequency RFID casino currency readers, antennas, casino currency authentication software, casino currency inventory software applications, and software maintenance services). Our products and services are used with casino table games such as blackjack, poker, baccarat, craps, and roulette. Our products fall into two categories – non-consumable and consumable. Non-consumable products consist of casino currencies, gaming furniture, and RFID solutions. These products typically have a useful life of several years or longer. Sales of non-consumables are typically driven by casino openings, expansions, and re-brandings, as well as replacement in the normal course of business. Consumable products consist of playing cards, table layouts, dice, and table accessories. These products each have a useful life that ranges from several hours for playing cards and dice to several months for layouts. Casinos tend to buy these products annually, if not more frequently.

The majority of our products are specifically designed and produced to meet our customers’ requirements, whether they are related to use, branding, aesthetic appeal, security, or anti-counterfeiting features. We believe our ability to produce products with a variety of styles and features, in combination with years of reliable delivery, enhance our competitive position. Our strategy is to be the exclusive supplier of table game products for every new casino. Through this strategy, revenues are generated both from the initial sale and replenishment of consumable products.
 
Merger Agreement
 
On November 27, 2018, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”) with Angel Holdings Godo Kaisha, a company organized under the laws of Japan (“Angel”), and AGL Nevada Corporation, a Nevada corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of Angel (“Merger Sub”), pursuant to which Angel will acquire the Company in exchange for cash. The Merger Agreement was unanimously adopted by the Special Transaction Committee of independent directors of the Board of Directors of the Company as well as the full Board.
 
Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, Merger Sub will merge with and into the Company (the “Merger”), the separate existence of Merger Sub will cease, and the Company will continue as the surviving corporation, which will be a wholly owned subsidiary of Angel. The surviving corporation shall succeed to and assume all of the rights and obligations of Merger Sub and the Company. At the effective time of the Merger (the “Effective Time”), by virtue of the Merger and without any further action on the part of Angel, Merger Sub, the Company or the holders of any capital stock or other securities of the Company: (i) any shares owned immediately prior to the Effective Time by the Company (or held in the Company’s treasury), Angel or Merger Sub or any of their respective direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiaries (the “Excluded Shares”) shall be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist; (ii) except for Excluded Shares, each share of our common stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will be automatically converted into the right to receive $13.75 in cash (the “Merger Consideration”); and (iii) each share of common stock of Merger Sub, $0.01 par value per share, outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into one share of common stock of the surviving corporation.

Casino Currency
 
Casino currency, used at table games, can be divided into two basic styles: American-style, known as chips, and European-style, known as plaques and jetons. Our broad range of currency products enables us to meet our customers’ preferences and specifications, including branding, aesthetic, security, and anti-counterfeiting features. Because casino currency, like real currency, is subject to counterfeiting, we incorporate a variety of custom security and anti-counterfeit features, such as ultra-violet (UV) pigments, UV inks, four-color process UV markings, infrared pigments, DNA type taggants, gold lace materials, alpha dots, customized rings, number serializations, security films, holograms, and micro-text. Manufacturing techniques used to thwart counterfeiting include creation of intricate multi-shot molds and complex currency designs to increase replication difficulty. Our most sophisticated anti-counterfeiting feature is an RFID device, based on a microchip that can be embedded in our casino currency making it counterfeit resistant when combined with our chip inventory, validation and tracking system (CIS).
 
Typically, a casino will order all of its casino currency, including replacement currency, from a single supplier. Accordingly, we strive to become the original casino currency supplier to a casino upon its opening, thereby enhancing our opportunity to receive additional sales when the casino places replacement orders or grows. A new casino order will typically include at least five to seven distinct currency denominations, colors, and styles, ranging in denominations from $0.50 to in excess of $1 million. Our selling price depends on customization, quantities, design, and security features. We hold the leading worldwide market share in casino currency.
 
American-style Casino Currency. American-style casino currency, commonly known as chips, is used worldwide. There are currently four main manufacturing technologies used to produce this type of currency: injection molding, thermo-compression molding, laser cut-thermo-compression, and sublimation. We produce casino currency using all four of these methods. We sell American-style casino currency under the Paulson®, Bud Jones®, Blue Chip® (BC®), Dolphin® and Bourgogne et Grasset® (BG®) brand names.
 

• | Injection-molded Currency. Our BG®, Dolphin® and Bud Jones® Plastic injection-molded casino currencies are made with several injection-molded colors, typically with a central metal piece for added weight, and printed decals. There are several standard diameters and a wide range of design and color combinations. Various security features are used to make the currencies counterfeit resistant, including using various UV, 3-in-1 UV and infra-red pigments, and other ELP pigments, specialty inks, security taggants, holograms, 4C-UV, security film, serialization, Datatrace, DNA security powders (that can be read with specialized equipment), electromagnetic (EM) detection and RFID technology. Under our BG® brand, our Premium Chip allows for the design and full customization of the chip mold. Our new BG® V-Series chip line was developed using an exclusive and highly durable injection material formula. The V-Series utilizes a proprietary and interchangeable mold system that offers customers a broader range of mold designs and the option to select between two decal sizes. All V-Series chips come standard with ChipShield, an anti-fungal agent that keeps chips cleaner. All four color shot V-Series chips come standard with an exclusive state-of-the-art hidden infra-red security feature.

• | Thermo-compression Molded Currency. Our Paulson® and Blue Chip® (BC®) thermo-compression molded casino currencies are manufactured using a proprietary formulation. Printed decals or “inlays” are incorporated in the product during the compression steps. Customized designs, security, and identifying features can be incorporated into the currencies. These casino currencies have a unique feel when stacked and are commonly referred to as “clay chips.” Various security features are used to make this currency counterfeit resistant, including UV and infra-red pigments, UV and 4C-UV inks, alphadots, custom molds, serialization, EM detection and RFID technology. Our Paulson® Premium Chip has an outer décor ring made from the same materials used in our European-style plaques and jetons. The addition of the décor ring gives customers the option of adding additional security features.

• | Laser CutThermo-compression Currency. Our BG® J3 jeton is a laser cut, thermo-compression casino currency that features intricate edge insert designs, two decal size options and the most advanced technology in security features. The J3 is referred to as a hybrid chip as it combines European-style plaque and jeton materials and aesthetic features with the feel and handling properties of American-style casino currency. Security features such as RFID technology, EM detection, microdots, gold lace, serialization, 4C-UV, UV Electro Luminescent and infra-red pigments, holograms and security film can be added to make the currency more counterfeit resistant.

• | Sublimation Currency. Sublimation currency, manufactured under the BG® brand, is made from an injection-molded white disc. Currency designs are transferred to the disc using a technology called “pad printing.” This technology permits simultaneous printing of the face and the edge of the chip. We refer to this casino currency style as “Full Face.” The security feature available is infra-red pigments. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

European-style Casino Currency. Plaques and jetons are European-style casino currency. Plaques can be rectangular, square, oval, or custom-shaped and are available in various sizes. Jetons are circular with multiple diameters. Plaques and jetons are made of laminated cellulose acetate with a large range of colors, shapes, security, and anti-counterfeit components such as UV pigment, number serialization, laser pigment, gold lace material, EM detection, and RFID technology. We offer a number of standard designs as well as highly customized designs. GPI SAS created its original product line in 1925 and has held the leading position in this market since that time.
RFID Casino Currency. Since 1996, we have been at the forefront of applying RFID technology to casino currency. Our RFID products include RFID-embedded currency and readers and antennas for the cage, gaming tables, and chip vaults. All of these RFID products can be integrated with our CIS software to provide authentication and inventory management across multiple locations within a casino. RFID enables quick and accurate accounting and verification of casino currency, either one at a time or in larger quantities, whether in stacks, racks, chip trays, or cabinets. When integrated with CIS, casino management can access, in real-time, a number of custom reports.
 
Use of RFID in gaming started with our low-frequency (125 KHz) devices used primarily for security. In 2006, we developed and introduced a faster, high-frequency (13.56 MHz) line of RFID products which offered a higher level of security and had much faster reading speeds, allowing tracking of currency movements within a casino. In 2015, after three years of research and development, we introduced SMART, a proprietary, high-performance RFID technology. Using a new generation of RFID tags and antennas, SMART operates at even faster chip-reading speeds. The SMART reader generates less heat and requires a smaller footprint.
 
RFID Solutions. RFID Solutions are customized applications running on CIS which integrate into a casino’s system to authenticate and track casino currency. We also provide associated hardware support and maintenance services.
 
Playing Cards
 
We manufacture and sell two brands (Paulson® and Gemaco®) of paper casino playing cards in single, multi-deck, and pre-shuffled packages. In addition, we offer plastic cards under our Gemaco® brand. Based on casino controls and practices, playing cards are typically replaced at least every 24 hours, excluding plastic cards which are used for longer periods. A casino typically enters into a one- or two-year purchase commitment with a supplier to supply its playing cards at regular intervals, generally monthly or quarterly. Our playing cards are compatible with all types of playing card shufflers.
Table Layouts
 
All live gaming tables are covered with a layout printed with artwork particular to each specific game and casino preference. To give our customers maximum design flexibility, we have developed an extensive range of layouts using wool, polyester, and our proprietary Paulson® FX material. Printing processes include screen printing, custom hand painting, and full graphic sublimation. All graphic designs are developed in house by our art department.

Dice
 
We manufacture and sell various brands of dice. We offer a variety of options, including size, finish type, customer logo, color, serialization, and security features. In a busy casino, a stick of dice (two and one-half pair) does not generally remain in play for more than one day.
Gaming Furniture
 
We sell a complete line of table gaming furniture, including tables, bases, and pit podiums. Our hand-crafted gaming furniture is custom built based on a casino’s designs and specifications. Our tables can be designed to incorporate all of our accessories and RFID systems as well as all third-party products, such as playing card shufflers, playing card readers, monitors, and bill validators. Table gaming furniture is typically sold in combination with table layouts and table accessories.
Table Accessories and Other Products
 
We offer a full line of table game accessories, including table displays, roulette reader boards, foot rails, chip trays, drop boxes, shoes, cut cards, dice sticks, lammers, markers and buttons. We manufacture many of these products and have aligned with a number of third-party vendors, such as TECHART, to provide products that we don’t manufacture. We are a licensed manufacturer of roulette wheels and sell them worldwide.
Backlog

We maintain a global sales network. In the Americas, we primarily sell through our U.S.-based sales force. In Europe and Africa, we primarily sell through our Beaune, France-based sales force. In the Asia-Pacific region, we distribute products through our Macau S.A.R., China-based sales force. In a few cases, when direct selling was not feasible because of local conditions, we have entered into agreements with carefully selected local sales agents or distributors. However, we always maintain direct contact with the customer to ensure that our brand integrity is not compromised.
 
We have product design teams in the United States, Mexico, France, and Asia to support our sales staff to develop artwork for custom products and to assist our manufacturing operations.
 
We actively promote our product lines, service capabilities, and product quality in a variety of traditional and emerging media. We place advertising in trade publications, support frequent editorial inquiries, and participate in major casino industry trade shows, including the Global Gaming Expo (G2E) events in Las Vegas, Nevada, and Macau S.A.R., China, the International Casino Exhibition (ICE) show in London, England, and the National Indian Gaming Association (NIGA) show held in various cities in the United States. We also promote our products through periodic direct-to-customer print and e-mail campaigns and maintain a website dedicated to providing our customers with an easy-to-use product information resource.
 
We also market casino-specific themed products in certain gaming jurisdictions, including casino currency, table layouts, playing cards, and dice. These themed products are used by our customers to promote special events, including sporting events, conventions, holidays, casino anniversaries, and premier entertainment events.

Research and Development
 
We continually invest in developing or acquiring new or improved products. We release new updates to our Chip Inventory System (CIS), we develop new security features for our casino currency products and develop new manufacturing processes to improve the quality of our products. In 2018, we entered into global strategic agreements for development and licensing with both BrainChip Holdings Limited (ASX: BRN), a leading developer of software and hardware accelerated solutions for advanced artificial intelligence and machine learning applications, and Xuvi, LLC, a developer of an immersive data analytics and automation platform. For information regarding the amounts spent during 2018 and 2017 on research and development activities, see Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
Intellectual Property
 
We own numerous United States and internationally-protected patents, trademarks and logos. Our trademarks, logos, and patent rights are valuable to our operations and are an important part of our marketing strategy. Our policy is to actively pursue and maintain registration of our patents, trade secrets, trademarks and logos, where needed, and to vigorously defend against any infringement or dilution.
Environmental Matters
 
Our operations are in compliance with international, federal, state, and local environmental laws and regulations. Liability for environmental remediation is accrued if considered probable and costs can be reasonably estimated.
Employees
 
At December 31, 2018, we employed 719 full-time employees, consisting of 344 employees in Mexico, 236 in the United States, 110 in France, and 29 in Macau S.A.R. None of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements and we believe that our relations with our employees are good.
Regulation and Licensing
 
The gaming operations of each of our subsidiaries, as well as the operations of casinos, are subject to extensive regulation by over 200 state, federal, tribal, and international agencies, with the majority of oversight by individual state gaming control boards and tribal gaming agencies. We have never been denied a gaming-related license.
 
While the regulatory requirements vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, most require licenses, permits, findings of suitability, documentation of qualification including evidence of financial stability and/or other required approvals for companies who manufacture and distribute gaming equipment, as well as the individual suitability of officers, directors, major stockholders, and key employees. Under the various gaming regulations, key personnel generally include the current and/or proposed corporate officers and directors of a corporation and its subsidiaries. Laws of the various gaming regulatory agencies are generally intended to protect the public and ensure that gaming-related activity is conducted honestly and competitively and is free of corruption.
 
Certain regulators not only govern the activities within their jurisdiction, but also oversee activities that occur in other jurisdictions to ensure that we comply with local standards on a worldwide basis. As a Nevada corporation, state regulatory authorities require us to maintain, at a minimum, Nevada gaming standards for all operations worldwide. Violations of laws in one jurisdiction could result in disciplinary action in other jurisdictions. A more detailed description of the regulations to which we are subject is provided in Exhibit 99.01 of this annual report on Form 10-K.
 
In August 2012, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) adopted the conflict mineral rules requiring issuers that manufacture products that contain certain minerals and metals, known as conflict minerals, to perform due diligence and to report annually to the SEC whether such minerals originated in the Democratic Republic of Congo or an adjoining country. The implementation of these new requirements could adversely affect the sourcing, availability, and pricing of minerals that we use in the manufacture of our products. In addition, we have incurred and will incur additional costs to comply with these disclosure requirements, including costs related to determining the source of any of the relevant minerals used in our products. A report is due annually on May 31 for the previous calendar year.
 
Dependence on One or a Few Major Customers
 
At December 31, 2018 and 2017, no casino customer accounted for 10% or more of our accounts receivable balance.
 
Because of large orders for casino openings or expansions, it is not unusual to have temporary concentrations of our accounts receivable balance related to one or a few customers.
