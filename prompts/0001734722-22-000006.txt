Item 1. Business
Overview
Our automation platform is designed to transform the way humans work. We provide our customers with a robust set of capabilities that allow them to discover automation opportunities and to build, manage, run, engage, measure, and govern automations across departments within an organization. Our platform leverages the power of artificial intelligence ("AI") based computer vision to enable our software robots to perform a vast array of actions as a human would when executing business processes. These actions include, but are not limited to, logging into applications, extracting information from documents, moving folders, filling in forms, and updating information fields and databases. The ability of our robots to replicate steps performed by humans in executing business processes drives continuous improvements in operational efficiencies and enables companies to deliver on key digital initiatives with greater speed, agility, and accuracy.
Our platform interacts with and automates processes across a company’s existing enterprise stack. As a result, our customers can leverage the power of our platform without the need to replace or change existing business applications, resulting in lower overall information technology ("IT") infrastructure cost. Our platform enables employees to quickly build automations for both existing and new processes. Employees can seamlessly maintain and scale automations across multiple deployment options, constantly improve and evolve automations, and continuously track and measure the performance of automations, all without substantial technical experience.
At the core of our automation platform is a set of capabilities that emulates human behavior and provides our customers with the ability to automate both simple and complex use cases. Automations can be built, consumed, managed, and governed by any employee who interacts with computers, resulting in the potential for broad applicability across departments within an organization. Many of our customers expand the scope and size of use cases across their organizations as they quickly realize the power of our platform. 
We believe that the success of our land-and-expand business model is centered on our ability to deliver significant value in a short time. We grow with our customers as they identify and expand the number of business processes to automate, which increases the number of robots deployed and the number of users interacting with robots. We have an efficient go-to-market model, which consists primarily of an enterprise field sales force supplemented by a high velocity inside sales team focused on small and mid-sized customers, as well as a global strategic sales team focused on the largest global customers.
Our mission is to unlock human creativity and ingenuity by enabling the fully automated enterprise and empowering employees through automation. Our society is at a turning point in how organizations execute work, and we believe that the ability to leverage software to enrich the employee experience will unlock tremendous value and efficiency opportunities. While we are still in the early days of a multi-year journey, momentum is growing as organizations across the world are only now beginning to understand the power of automation. We believe that we are disrupting a significant and fast-growing market and that the largely untapped opportunity ahead of us has the potential to be one of the biggest ever in enterprise software.
Trends Shaping Our Industry
Explosive growth of cloud-based applications is creating a new era of IT complexity. Businesses around the world are spending billions of dollars to adopt applications that help advance digital transformation and drive competitive advantages. With the proliferation of cloud technologies and software-as-a-service ("SaaS"), traditional software suites have been disaggregated into point solutions. For example, human capital management software has been segregated across recruiting, payroll, benefits administration, and other key business functions. As a result, enterprises have transitioned from managing a handful of multi-purpose, largely on-premises applications to managing hundreds and even thousands of specialized point solutions deployed across on-premises, cloud, and hybrid environments. These applications, which were generally not designed for interoperability, run in tandem with long-running, legacy technologies. The increasing volume of applications has a compounding effect on the complexity of business processes and the IT environments that support them.

The benefits of digital transformation have yet to make their way to the workforce. Modern enterprise applications enable deep and nuanced functionalities, such as conducting personalized marketing campaigns, predictive service delivery, and real time visibility of goods movement across the supply chain. However, despite massive functional advancement, the true promise and potential of digital transformation—reallocating human capital towards cognitive, higher-value activities—remains elusive, which limits improvements in productivity.
Individual business processes rely on multiple business applications, and humans to orchestrate them. While specialized applications deliver extensive functionality, they do not account for the full spectrum of how work gets done. The proliferation of specialized applications has resulted in humans being the connective tissue in an enterprise, working across a wide range of applications that individually are not built to address the needs of the actual processes they are supporting. As a result, activities performed by many employees today are still manual, mundane, and administrative, taking their focus away from higher-value activities that can directly improve business performance.
Manual and repetitive tasks have a negative impact on employee experience. Employees must navigate an ever-increasing number of systems and applications to perform their day-to-day work. This dynamic forces them to constantly execute manual, time-consuming, and repetitive tasks to get their work done. The friction faced by employees often results in lost productivity that can have a direct impact on a company’s bottom line. Traditional automation solutions intended to reduce this friction have generally been designed to be used by developers and engineers, rather than the employees directly involved in executing the actual work being automated. As a result, employees are limited by the lack of flexibility of these traditional automation technologies, and employee productivity, innovation, and satisfaction suffer.
Empowering employees to automate their personal workflows is leading to a democratization of automation. The emerging workforce is developing increasingly advanced technical skills and training in automation. Individuals are entering the workforce with higher expectations related to job impact, satisfaction, and efficiency, and view software as a driving force in realizing those expectations. As a result, organizations are seeking to empower employees with tools that optimize the more tedious parts of their jobs. Together, the combination of technology that can emulate human behavior and a workforce with the knowledge and tools to create their own automations has enabled enterprises to begin to automate a significant number of use cases, from individual tasks to enterprise-wide processes.
Cost of skilled human capital is accelerating the evolution towards the fully automated enterprise. The cost of skilled human capital continues to rise due to growing demand. This trend has become particularly evident in light of the high rate of voluntary resignations following the COVID-19 pandemic, known as "The Great Resignation." We believe it is increasingly imperative for enterprises to leverage automation to liberate employees from menial, repetitive, and less productive tasks and to better utilize the positive qualities that only humans have, such as abstract thinking, making connections, dealing with ambiguity, creativity, innovation, passion, and community engagement. We believe this will drive enterprise value and greater employee engagement.
Automation is the new frontier of competitive differentiation. Enterprises want to be able to unify, tailor, and run applications without significant IT resources or changes to existing infrastructure. Automation solutions that can accurately and consistently emulate human behavior are able to work within existing business processes in a way that traditional applications cannot, allowing businesses to harness the power of their specialized applications. This new approach is disrupting traditional automation and transforming data-processing work by allowing customers to find efficiencies without materially changing business processes or infrastructure.
Competition
The market for robotic process automation ("RPA") is one of the fastest growing enterprise software markets and is increasingly competitive. We believe our competitors primarily exist across the following three categories:
•RPA software providers that offer RPA platforms, but lack end-to-end automation capabilities.
•Adjacent automation and integration platform companies, such as low-code, intelligent business process management suite ("iBPMS"), integration platform as a service ("iPaaS"), process mining, and test automation vendors, that provide additional features that can be useful for automations. We have alliances and integrations with the key vendors in each of these groups, but they often develop and market automation capabilities as extensions of their core platforms.
Table of Contents

•Enterprise platform vendors that are acquiring, building, or investing in RPA functionality or partnering with RPA providers.
A number of technology companies have attempted to address the automation needs of organizations through the application of business process management, application development platform offerings, RPA tools, and AI point offerings, as well as other horizontal software applications. However, these existing offerings are challenged by a number of inherent limitations, including:
•lack of an end-to-end platform;
•overreliance on application programming interfaces ("APIs");
•inability to automate across applications;
•challenges in linking AI capabilities to real-world execution;
•immature user interface ("UI") automation capabilities;
•need for changes to an enterprise's underlying infrastructure;
•unsuitability for organization-wide use;
•lack of governance capabilities at scale;
•onerous deployment;
•lack of openness and interoperability; and
•lack of an engaged user community.
Our Solution
Our platform is purpose-built to be responsive to these challenges and to advance the next generation of automation with several key strengths:
•Our open ecosystem is architecture agnostic, which allows organizations to automate existing infrastructure and accelerate digital innovation without the need to replace or make large investments in their existing infrastructure.
•Our platform’s embedded AI and machine learning ("ML") capabilities improve decisioning and information processing by adapting to constantly changing variables.
•Our robots’ ability to emulate human behavior allows organizations to leverage our platform to address a myriad of use cases, from the simple to the complex, and makes automation accessible to employees throughout an organization.
•Our multi-tenant platform is built for enterprise deployment, with security and governance at its core, and can be deployed on-premises, in a public or private cloud, or in a hybrid environment. In addition, we offer a managed, multi-tenant SaaS version called Automation Cloud, which enables our customers to begin automating without the need to provision infrastructure, install applications, or perform additional configurations.
•Our intuitive interface and low-code, drag-and-drop functionality is easy for employees to learn regardless of their technical acumen; built-in, customizable, and shareable components serve as building blocks for users to quickly and easily build and deploy automations.
•Our platform tracks, measures, and forecasts the performance of automations, enabling customers to gain powerful insights and generate key performance indicators with actionable metrics.
•Our technology democratizes automation, empowering employees and resulting in greater professional fulfillment and job satisfaction.
•Our platform was designed to enable people and robots to work together in harmony, with each focusing on the processes they execute best, to improve business outcomes. Robots execute the time-consuming, manual processes that make work less interesting and satisfying, freeing up humans to think more creatively, innovate, and solve complex problems.

Intellectual Property
Intellectual property rights are important to the success of our business. We rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark, and trade secret laws in the United States ("U.S") and other jurisdictions, as well as license agreements, confidentiality procedures, non-disclosure agreements with third parties, and other contractual protections, to protect our intellectual property rights, including our proprietary technology, software, know-how, and brand.
As of January 31, 2022, we held 31 issued patents: 24 U.S., 5 South Korea, 1 Taiwan, and 1 China. We also had 160 pending patent applications in the U.S., including 9 allowed U.S. patent applications, 124 pending Patent Cooperation Treaty applications, and 338 pending and 6 allowed patent applications in other jurisdictions. Our issued patents are scheduled to expire between October 2039 and February 2040. As of January 31, 2022, we held 11 registered U.S. trademarks, 11 pending U.S. trademark applications, and more than 670 active foreign trademark filings. As of January 31, 2022, we also held 54 internet domain names. We continually review our development efforts to assess and identify the existence and patentability of new intellectual property.
The terms of individual patents extend for varying periods of time, depending upon the date of filing of the patent application, the date of patent issuance, and the legal term of patents in the countries in which they are obtained. Generally, patents issued for applications filed in the U.S. are effective for 20 years from the earliest effective filing date of a non-provisional patent application. The duration of patents outside of the U.S. varies in accordance with provisions of applicable local law, but is typically also 20 years from the earliest effective filing date. However, the actual protection afforded by a patent varies from country to country and depends upon many factors, including the type of patent, the scope of its coverage, the availability of legal remedies in a particular country, and the validity and enforceability of the patent.
Although we rely on intellectual property rights, including patents, copyrights, trademarks, and trade secrets, as well as contractual protections to establish and protect our proprietary rights, we believe that factors such as the technological and creative skills of our personnel, development of new services, features, and functionality, and frequent enhancements to our platform are equally essential to establishing and maintaining our technology leadership position.
We control access to and use of our proprietary technology and other confidential information through the use of internal and external controls, including contractual protections with employees, contractors, customers, and partners. We require our employees, consultants, and certain other third parties to enter into confidentiality and 
Table of Contents

proprietary rights agreements, and we control and monitor access to our software, documentation, and other confidential information. Our policy is to require all employees and independent contractors to sign agreements assigning to us any inventions, trade secrets, works of authorship, developments, processes, and other intellectual property generated by them on our behalf and under which they agree to protect our confidential information. In addition, we generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our customers and partners. See the section titled “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property,” included in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, for a description of risks related to our intellectual property.
Government Regulation
Our business is and will continue to be subject to extensive U.S. federal and state and foreign laws and regulations, including laws and regulations involving privacy, data protection, security, intellectual property, competition, taxation, anti-corruption, anti-bribery, anti-money laundering, and other similar laws. Many of these laws and regulations are still evolving and are likely to remain uncertain for the foreseeable future, and these laws and regulations can vary significantly from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. The costs of complying with these laws and regulations are high and are likely to increase in the future. Further, the impact of these laws and regulations may disproportionately affect our business in comparison to our competitors that have greater resources.
In the United States, we are subject to data security and privacy rules and regulations promulgated under the authority of the Federal Trade Commission, the Electronic Communications Privacy Act, the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, ("CCPA"), and other state and federal laws relating to privacy and data security. The CCPA requires covered businesses to provide new disclosures to California residents and to provide them new ways to opt out of the sale of personal information, and provides a private right of action and statutory damages for data breaches. Other jurisdictions in the U.S. are beginning to propose laws similar to the CCPA.
As a result of our international operations, we must comply with a multitude of data security and privacy laws that may vary significantly from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Virtually every jurisdiction in which we operate has established or is in the process of establishing data security and privacy legal frameworks with which we or our customers must comply. Our failure to comply with the laws of each jurisdiction may subject us to significant penalties. For example, the data protection landscape in Europe, including with respect to cross-border data transfers, is currently unstable and other countries outside of Europe have enacted or are considering enacting cross-border data transfer restrictions and laws requiring local data residency.
We must also comply with sanctions that are issued by countries in which we do business. As of March 2022, in response to Russia’s military operations in Ukraine, the U.S., the European Union ("EU"), the United Kingdom ("U.K."), Australia, Japan and other countries imposed sanctions on Russia. Russia has also started to impose sanctions. While this represents, at present, a small percentage of our business, it is a complex and rapidly evolving area.
For a discussion of the various risks we face from regulation and compliance matters, see the sections titled “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Data Privacy and Cybersecurity” and “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Regulatory Compliance and Governmental Matters” included in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Employees and Human Capital Resources
Workforce
Human capital is our most important asset. We were recognized as one of Inc.’s Best Workplaces for 2020 and won six Best Company awards from Comparably in 2020, including awards for Happiness, Professional Development, and Leadership. We have been able to attract and motivate exceptionally talented, educated, and experienced employees, and believe that our ability to continue to do so is critical to our success. The principal purposes of our equity and other incentive plans are to attract, retain, and motivate selected employees, consultants, and directors through the granting of stock-based compensation awards and cash-based performance bonus awards.
Table of Contents

As of January 31, 2022, we had a total of 4,013 full-time employees, geographically distributed as follows:
*Includes 1% in Russia, Ukraine, and Belarus combined
The following chart presents our full-time employees by financial statement line as of January 31, 2022:
We are subject to, and comply with, local labor law requirements in all countries in which we operate. We consider our employee relations to be good and we have not experienced any work stoppages. Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, the majority of our workforce has been working remotely; although we expect most of these employees to return to our offices in the future, the extent and timing of that return is still uncertain.
Culture and Values
We believe our culture and values are critical to our success and have helped us deliver tangible financial and operational benefits to our customers, employees, and stockholders. Early on in our company’s history, we decided 
Table of Contents

to make humility the center of our values. While humility is a muscle to be trained, we believe it should come through in everything we do.
We complement humility with our other core tenets in our culture:
•Be humble – listen, learn, help
•Be bold – challenge, seek, explore
•Be immersed – consider, reflect, imagine
•Be fast – act, preempt, experiment
In addition to our four core values, we believe open and transparent communication is critical to a high-performing business. We also believe that our employees must feel that they work in a psychologically safe environment.
We are determined to always act quickly to best serve our customers and partners, deliver on our product platform vision, and create a better place to work.
Diversity, Equity, and Belonging
We believe that diversity, equity, and belonging is a business priority and a moral imperative, driving value for our employees, communities, and customers. We are strong because we welcome diverse perspectives, experiences, and approaches. We have added dedicated diversity, equity, and belonging roles to our human resources organization and seek to create an environment where employees are valued, respected, and empowered. We are committed to challenging inequities internally and in our communities and invest in education to create equity. We increase job candidate pipeline diversity through external organizations such as Jobwel, NPower, Inroad, as well as outreach to Historically Black Colleges, Black Girls Who Code, and Women Impact Tech, and have increased focus on recruiting women into leadership roles and to our Board of Directors.
Social Responsibility and Community Initiatives
We aspire to make work more meaningful for the global community as we help accelerate human achievement. This is reflected in our desire to improve our communities by bringing our technology to underserved areas. Through our global Automation for Good initiatives, we have worked with governments during the COVID-19 pandemic to deploy our technology to assist government entities, hospitals, and non-profit organizations to improve citizen response, free health care workers to spend more time with patients, and accelerate mission objectives. As part of our commitment to make automation a force for good in the world, we have invested in research, collaborations, and partnerships to develop automation solutions to help solve global challenges and explore how to increase the positive impact of this technology for the benefit of people and our planet. Furthermore, we have supported initiatives and opportunities dedicated to improving automation skills and technology access and creating social good, having reached more than one million learners worldwide on our free online platform, UiPath Academy. Working with our partners to develop accessible paths towards fulfilling careers and foster meaningful employment opportunities remains a key priority for UiPath. In 2021 we expanded our network of partner organizations to equip students and workers with automation skills as part of our UiPath Academic Alliance program. The UiPath Foundation, a Romanian charity, aims to provide children living in poverty with the skills and tools necessary to reach their potential. In April 2021, we joined the Pledge 1% movement, and reserved 2.8 million shares of our Class A common stock to fund our social impact and environmental, social, and governance initiatives, to be distributed over ten years.
