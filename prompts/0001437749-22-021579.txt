The Lucky Shot Property and the Minerals Property are collectively referred to in this Annual Report on Form 10-K as the “Contango Properties”.
 
As of June 30, 2022, the Company had approximately $23.3 million of cash.
 
The Peak Gold JV spent approximately $15.8 million on its 2021 drilling program and completed approximately 33,000 ft. of drilling on the Manh Choh Project in 2021.  The majority of the activity was directed towards in-fill drilling to support a detailed mine plan and feasibility study with additional drilling to support on-going geotechnical, metallurgical, environmental studies and water quality data collection. In addition, the Peak Gold JV submitted a permitting package to the US Army Corps of Engineers for the Wetlands Dredge and Fill permit, also known as a 404 permit, just prior to the end of 2021.  On December 17, 2021, the Peak Gold JV initially approved a budget of $47.9 million for its 2022 program.  At a meeting of the Management Committee of Peak Gold JV (the “Management Committee”) held on February 14, 2022, Kinross Gold Corporation (“Kinross”), the manager of Peak Gold JV, presented updated information that resulted in a decrease in its 2022 spending program to approximately $26.0 million.  However, on August 4, 2022 the Management Committee voted to increase the 2022 budget to $39.6 million, of which our total share is $11.9 million for the year.  The 2022 budget covers the following areas of work: feasibility study, permitting, on-going environmental monitoring, community engagement, engineering, early construction, and exploration.  The Peak Gold JV released a feasibility study in July 2022.  Also, in July 2022, Kinross announced that its board of directors (the “Kinross Board”) made a decision to proceed with development of the project.  The early works program has begun at the project, with camp refurbishments, earthworks and road construction now underway.
   
   At the Lucky Shot Property, the Company engaged Atkinson Construction and Major Drilling as contractors to execute the planned 2022 exploration/development program to advance the Enserch Tunnel to the footwall of the area where it expects to locate the Lucky Shot vein and drift 1500 foot parallel and set up drill stations every 75 feet.  The Company began pilot hole drilling in late June 2022, with a plan to drill approximately 3200 meters (~10,000 feet) from underground into what it believes to be the down-dip projection of the previously identified area where it expected to locate the Lucky Shot vein. The assays from the drilling program are not available yet, however the Company intersected the area in four out of four exploration drill holes from the “West Ballroom” located on the west side of the tunnel.  A fifth hole is planned from the West Ballroom to be followed by five additional pilot holes from the East Ballroom.
 
   On the Shamrock Property, the Company conducted soil and surface rock chip sampling during 2021. Follow up trenching and detailed geologic mapping is planned for th e summer of 2023.  At the Eagle/Hona Property, the Company carried out a detailed reconnaissance of the northern and eastern portions of the large claim block that had not previously been detail sampled. Due to the steep topography, a helicopter was used to execute the program safely.  Follow up geologic mapping and sampling is planned for the  summer of 2023.

Background
 

 The Company was formed on September 1, 2010 as a Delaware corporation for the purpose of engaging in the exploration in the State of Alaska for gold ore and associated minerals.  On January 8, 2015, the Company and a subsidiary of Royal Gold, Inc. (“Royal Gold”) formed the Peak Gold JV. The Company contributed a 100% leasehold interest in an estimated 675,000 acres (the “Tetlin Lease”) from the Tetlin Tribal Council, the council formed by the governing body for the Native Village of Tetlin, an Alaska Native Tribe (the “Tetlin Tribal Council”); and State of Alaska mining claims near Tok, Alaska (together with other property, formerly the “Peak Gold Joint Venture Property”), and Royal Gold made an initial investment into the Peak Gold JV of $5.0 million. By September 29, 2020, Royal Gold had contributed approximately $37.1 million to the Peak Gold JV and earned a cumulative economic interest of 40.0%.  The proceeds from the investments were used for exploration of the Peak Gold Joint Venture Property. Royal Gold served as the manager of the Peak Gold JV and managed, directed, and controlled operations of the Peak Gold JV until the Kinross Transactions (described below). 
Kinross Transaction
 
On September 29, 2020, the Company, CORE Alaska, LLC and KG Mining (Alaska), Inc. (“KG Mining”), an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Kinross Gold Corporation, a corporation formed under the laws of Ontario, Canada (“Kinross”), entered into a Purchase Agreement (the “CORE Purchase Agreement”), pursuant to which CORE Alaska sold a 30.0% membership interest (the “CORE JV Interest”) in the Peak Gold JV, to KG Mining (the “CORE Transactions”). The CORE Transactions closed on September 30, 2020.  In consideration for the CORE JV Interest, the Company received $32.4 million in cash and 809,744 shares of the Company’s common stock, par value $0.01 per share (the “Common Stock”). The 809,744 shares of Common Stock were previously acquired by KG Mining from Royal Gold, as part of the Royal Gold Transactions (described below) and were subsequently canceled by the Company. Of the $32.4 million cash consideration, $1.2 million constituted a reimbursement prepayment to the Company by KG Mining of amounts relating to CORE Alaska’s proportionate share of certain silver royalty payments that the Peak Gold JV may be obligated to pay to Royal Gold, with the understanding that as a result of such reimbursements, KG Mining would bear the entire economic impact of those silver royalty payments due from the Peak Gold JV.  Concurrently with the CORE Purchase Agreement, KG Mining, in a separate transaction, acquired from Royal Gold (i) 100% of the equity of Royal Alaska, LLC (“Royal Alaska”), which held a 40.0% membership interest in the Peak Gold JV (the “Royal Gold Transactions” and, together with the CORE Transactions, the “Kinross Transactions”).  Therefore, as of June 30, 2022, the Company holds a 30.0% membership interest in the Peak Gold JV, and KG Mining holds a 70.0% membership interest in the Peak Gold JV and serves as the manager and operator of the Peak Gold JV. KG Mining and CORE Alaska entered into the Amended and Restated Limited Liability Company Agreement of the Peak Gold JV (the “A&R JV LLCA”) on October 1, 2020 to address the new ownership arrangements and to incorporate additional terms that will permit the Peak Gold JV to further develop and produce from its properties.

The Peak Gold JV had also historically held certain State of Alaska unpatented mining claims for the exploration of gold ore and associated minerals.  Prior to the Kinross Transactions, the Peak Gold JV, Contango Minerals Alaska, LLC, an Alaska limited liability company formed by the Peak Gold JV (“Contango Minerals”), the Company, CORE Alaska, Royal Gold and Royal Alaska entered into a Separation and Distribution Agreement, dated as of September 29, 2020 (the “Separation Agreement”). Pursuant to the Separation Agreement, the Peak Gold JV formed Contango Minerals, contributed approximately 167,000 acres of Alaska State mining claims to it, subject to the Option Agreement (described below), and retained an additional 1.0% net smelter returns royalty interest on certain of the Alaska state mining claims that were contributed. After the formation and contribution to Contango Minerals, the Peak Gold JV made simultaneous distributions to Royal Alaska and CORE Alaska by (i) granting a new 28.0% net smelter returns silver royalty on all silver produced from a defined area within the Tetlin Lease and transferring the additional 1.0% net smelter returns royalty described above to Royal Gold and (ii) assigning 100.0% of the membership interests in Contango Minerals to CORE Alaska, which were in turn distributed to the Company, resulting in Contango Minerals becoming a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. The Separation Agreement contains customary representations, warranties and covenants.
 
In connection with the Separation Agreement, the Peak Gold JV and Contango Minerals entered into an Option Agreement, dated as of September 29, 2020 (the “Option Agreement”). Under the Option Agreement, Contango Minerals granted the Peak Gold JV an option, subject to certain conditions contained in the Option Agreement, to purchase approximately 13,000 acres of the Alaska state mining claims which were contributed to Contango Minerals pursuant to the Separation Agreement, together with all extralateral rights, water and water rights, and easements and rights of way in connection therewith, that are held by Contango Minerals.  Subject to the conditions in the Option Agreement, the Peak Gold JV had the right to exercise the option to purchase the Alaska state mining claims, in whole or in part, at an exercise price of $50,000. The Peak Gold JV exercised this option in whole in June 2021 and paid the Company $50,000, whereupon the 13,000 acres of Alaska state mining claims were transferred to the Peak Gold JV.   
 
Kinross is a large gold producer with a diverse global portfolio and extensive operating experience in Alaska. The Peak Gold JV plans to mine ore from the Main and North Manh Choh deposits and then process ore at the existing Fort Knox mining and milling complex located approximately 250 miles (400 km) away. The use of the Fort Knox facilities is expected to accelerate the development of the Peak Gold JV Property and result in significantly reduced upfront capital development costs, smaller environmental footprint, a shorter permitting and development timeline and less overall risk for Peak Gold JV Property as the Fort Knox facilities have existing operations as opposed to developing, permitting, and building a new mill and processing facilities.
 
Acquisition of Lucky Shot Property
 
On August 24, 2021, the Company completed the purchase of all outstanding membership interests (the “Interests”) of AGT from CRH Funding II PTE. LTD, a Singapore private limited corporation (“CRH”) (the “Lucky Shot Transaction”). AGT holds rights to the Lucky Shot Property.  The Company agreed to purchase the Interests for a total purchase price of up to $30 million. The purchase price included an initial payment at closing of $5 million in cash and a promissory note in the original principal amount of $6.25 million, payable by the Company to CRH (the “Promissory Note”), with a maturity date of February 28, 2022 (the “Maturity Date”).  The Promissory Note was secured by the Interests.  The Company had the option to pay the Promissory Note through the issuance to CRH of shares of the Company’s common stock if the Company completed an offering and obtained a listing of its shares on the NYSE American prior to the Maturity Date.  In November 2021, the Company’s common stock commenced listing on the NYSE American. Since the Company did not complete the required offering, it paid the Promissory Note in cash on February 25, 2022
 
The Company is obligated to pay CRH additional consideration if production on the Lucky Shot Property meets two separate milestone payment thresholds.  If the first threshold of (1) an aggregate “mineral resource” equal to 500,000 ounces of gold or (2) production and receipt by the Company of an aggregate of 30,000 ounces of gold (including any silver based on a 1:65 gold:silver ratio) is met, then the Company will pay CRH $5 million in cash and $3.75 million in newly issued shares of CORE common stock.  If the second threshold of (1) an aggregate “mineral resource” equal to 1,000,000 ounces of gold or (2) production and receipt by the Company of an aggregate of 60,000 ounces of gold (including any silver based on a 1:65 gold:silver ratio) is met, then the Company will pay CRH $5 million in cash and $5 million in newly issued shares of CORE common stock. If payable, the additional share consideration will be issued based on the 30-day volume weighted average price for each of the thirty trading days immediately prior to the satisfaction of the relevant production goal.  If the milestones are not met no additional payments will be made to CRH.
 
The Company also agreed to make $10,000,000 in expenditures during the 36-month period following closing toward the existence, location, quantity, quality or commercial value of mineral deposits in, under and upon the Lucky Shot Property.  On August 16, 2021, the Company hired Chris Kennedy, who has prior experience in underground mine operations management, to serve as the Company’s Mine General Manager. In his role, Mr. Kennedy will manage the Company's underground exploration and development program on the Lucky Shot Property. As of June 30, 2022, the Company had made expenditures of $8.6 million toward the required amount.

Strategy
 
Retaining Proven Executive Leadership.  Effective as of January 6, 2020, Rick Van Nieuwenhuyse was appointed to serve as President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company.  Mr. Van Nieuwenhuyse will perform the functions of the Company’s principal executive officer.  Also effective on January 6, 2020, the size of the Board was increased from four to five directors with Mr. Van Nieuwenhuyse appointed to the Board to fill the vacancy created by the increase.  Mr. Van Nieuwenhuyse, 66, previously served as President and Chief Executive Officer of Trilogy Metals Inc. from January 2012 until December 2019. Between May 1999 and January of 2012, he served as the President and Chief Executive Officer of NOVAGOLD Resources, Inc. 
 
Partnering with strategic industry participants to expand future exploration work. In January 2015, the Company formed the Peak Gold JV pursuant to the JV LLCA with Royal Gold. Under the JV LLCA, Royal Gold was appointed as the manager of the Peak Gold JV, initially, with overall management responsibility for operations of the Peak Gold JV. As of October 1, 2020, in conjunction with the Kinross Transactions and the signing of the A&R JV LLCA, KG Mining became the manager of the Peak Gold JV (the “Manager”).  KG Mining may resign as Manager and can be removed as Manager for a material breach of the A&R JV LLCA, a material failure to perform its obligations as the Manager, a failure to conduct the Peak Gold JV operations in accordance with industry standards and applicable laws, and other limited circumstances. The Manager will manage and direct the operation of the Peak Gold JV, and will discharge its duties, in accordance with approved programs and budgets. The Manager will implement the decisions of the Management Committee and will carry out the day-to-day operations of the Peak Gold JV. Except as expressly delegated to the Manager, the A&R JV LLCA provides that the Management Committee has exclusive authority to determine all management matters related to the Company. The Management Committee currently consists of one appointee designated by the Company and two appointees designated by KG Mining.  The Representatives designated by each member of the Peak Gold JV vote as a group, and in accordance with their respective membership interests in the Peak Gold JV. Except in the case of certain actions that require approval by unanimous vote of the Representatives, the affirmative vote of a majority of the membership interests in the Peak Gold JV constitutes the action of the Management Committee.
 
Structuring Incentives to Drive Behavior. The Company believes that equity ownership aligns the interests of the Company’s executives and directors with those of its stockholders. As of June 30, 2022, the Company’s directors and executives beneficially own approximately 24.4% of the Company’s Common Stock. An additional 11.6% of the Company’s Common Stock is beneficially owned by the Marital Trust of Mr. Kenneth R. Peak, the Company’s former Chairman, who passed away on April 19, 2013.
 
Acquiring exploration properties.  The Company anticipates from time to time acquiring additional properties in Alaska or elsewhere for exploration, subject to the availability of funds. The acquisitions may include leases or similar rights from Alaska Native corporations or may include filing Federal or State of Alaska mining claims by staking claims for exploration. Acquiring additional properties will likely result in additional expense to the Company for minimum royalties, minimum rents and annual exploratory work requirements.
 
Adverse Climate Conditions
 
Weather conditions affect the Company’s and the Peak Gold JV’s ability to conduct exploration activities and mine any ore from the Contango Property and the Peak Gold JV Property in Alaska. While the Company believes exploration, development work and any subsequent mining may be conducted year-round, the arctic climate limits many exploration and mining activities during certain seasons.
Competition
 
The Company currently faces strong competition for the acquisition of any new exploration-stage properties as well as extraction of any minerals in Alaska. Numerous larger mining companies actively seek out and bid for mining prospects as well as for the services of third party providers and supplies, such as mining equipment and transportation equipment. The Company’s competitors in the exploration, development, acquisition and mining business will include major integrated mining companies as well as numerous smaller mining companies, almost all of which have significantly greater financial resources and in-house technical expertise. In addition, the Company will compete with others in efforts to obtain financing to explore our mineral properties.
Government Regulation
 
The Company and the Peak Gold JV’s mineral exploration activities are generally affected by various laws and regulations, including environmental, conservation, tax and other laws and regulations relating to the exploration of minerals. Various federal and Alaskan laws and regulations often require permits for exploration activities and also cover extraction of minerals. In addition, the Tetlin Lease is located on land leased from the Tetlin Tribal Council. Federally recognized Native American tribes are independent governments, with sovereign powers, except to the extent those powers may have been limited by treaty or by the United States Congress. Such tribes maintain their own governmental systems and often their own judicial systems and have the right to tax, and to require licenses and to impose other forms of regulation and regulatory fees, on persons and businesses operating on their lands. As sovereign nations, federally recognized Native American tribes are generally subject only to federal regulation. States do not have the authority to regulate them, unless such authority has been specifically granted by Congress, and state laws generally do not directly apply to them and to activities taking place on their lands, unless they have a specific agreement or compact with the state or federal government allowing for the application of state law. The Company believes that the Peak Gold JV will continue to use its best efforts to ensure that it is in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations, but the denial of permits required to explore for or mine ore may prevent it from realizing any revenues arising from the presence of minerals on its properties.
