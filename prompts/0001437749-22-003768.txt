Item 1. Business. 
 
Cohu is a leading supplier of semiconductor test and inspection handlers, micro-electromechanical system (“MEMS”) test modules, test contactors, thermal sub-systems and semiconductor automated test equipment used by global semiconductor and electronics manufacturers and semiconductor test subcontractors. We offer a wide range of products and services, and revenue from our capital equipment products is driven by the capital expenditure budgets and spending patterns of our customers, who often delay or accelerate purchases in reaction to variations in their business. The level of capital expenditures by these companies depends on the current and anticipated market demand for semiconductor devices and the products that incorporate them. Our recurring revenues are driven by an increase in the number of semiconductor devices that are tested and by the continuous introduction of new products and technologies by our customers.
 
On June 24, 2021, we completed the sale of our PCB Test Equipment (“PCB Test”) business, which represented our PCB Test reportable segment. As part of the transaction we also sold certain intellectual property held by our Semiconductor Test & Inspection segment that is utilized by the PCB Test business. Our decision to sell this non-core business resulted from management’s determination that that they were no longer a fit within our organization. We evaluated the guidance in Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 205-20, Presentation of Financial Statements – Discontinued Operations, and determined that the divestment of our PCB Test business does not represent a strategic shift as the divestiture will not have a major effect on Cohu’s operations and financial results and, as a result, it is not presented as discontinued operations in any periods presented.
 
Unless otherwise noted, all amounts presented are from continuing operations.
 
We have determined that we have one reportable segment, Semiconductor Test and Inspection Equipment (“Semiconductor Test & Inspection”). Prior to the sale of our PCB Test Group (“PTG”) on June 24, 2021, we reported in two segments, Semiconductor Test & Inspection and PCB Test Equipment. Financial information on our reportable segments for each of the last three years is included in Note 10, “Segment and Geographic Information” in Part IV, Item 15(a) of this Form 10-K.

Sales by reportable segment, expressed as a percentage of total consolidated net sales, for the last three years were as follows:
 

 | 2021 | | | 2020 | | 2019
--------------------------------+------+-----+---+------+-----+-----
Semiconductor Test & Inspection | | 97 | % | | 92 | % | 93 | %
PCB Test | | 3 | % | | 8 | % | 7 | %
 | | 100 | % | | 100 | % | 100 | %

 
Cohu, Inc. (“Cohu”, “we”, “our”, “us” and the “Company”) was incorporated under the laws of California in 1947, as Kalbfell Lab, Inc. and commenced active operations in the same year. Our name was changed to Kay Lab in 1954. In 1957, Cohu was reincorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware as Cohu Electronics, Inc. and in 1972 our name was changed to Cohu, Inc.
 
Our Products
 
We currently sell the following products:
 
Semiconductor Test. Semiconductor Automated Test Equipment (“ATE”) is used both for wafer level and device package testing. Our semiconductor ATE solutions consist primarily of two platforms focused on the system on a chip (“SoC”) device market. The Diamond series platform, which includes the flagship Diamondx test system, offers high-density instrumentation for low-cost testing of microcontrollers, application specific standard products (“ASSP”), power management, display drivers, sensors and other mixed signal devices. The PAx series of testers is focused primarily on the RF Front End IC and Module market.
Semiconductor Handlers. Semiconductor test handlers are used in conjunction with semiconductor ATE to automate the testing of packaged semiconductor devices. Our handlers support a variety of package sizes and device types, including those used in automotive, mobile, industrial, computing applications, among others. We offer a broad range of test handlers, including pick-and-place, turret, gravity, strip, MEMS and thermal sub-systems, along with inspection handlers that perform automated optical inspection of semiconductor devices.
Interface Products. Our interface products are comprised of test contactors, probe heads and probe pins. Test contactors serve as the interface between the test handler and the semiconductor device under test such as digital semiconductor devices utilizing spring probe technology, power management and LED semiconductor devices utilizing cantilever technology, and RF semiconductor devices based on contacts designed to operate at high frequencies. Test contactors and probe heads are specific to individual semiconductor device designs, need to be replaced frequently and increase in size with the number of devices tested in parallel. Interface Products are included in our recurring revenues.

 (1) Recurring revenues include interface products, spares, kits (not as part of system sales) and services
 
Customers
 
Our customers include semiconductor integrated device manufacturers, fabless design houses, PCB manufacturers, and test subcontractors throughout the world. Repeat sales to existing customers represent a significant portion of our sales. During the last three years, customers of our Semiconductor Test & Inspection segment that comprised 10% or greater of our consolidated net sales were as follows:

 | 2021 | | | 2020 | | 2019
---------------+------+------+---+------+---+-----
Analog Devices | | 14.1 | % | | * | | * | 
Intel | | * | | | * | | 11.1 | %


* Less than 10% of consolidated net sales.
------------------------------------------

 
The loss of, or a significant reduction in, orders by these or other significant customers, including reductions due to market, economic or competitive conditions or the outsourcing of final integrated circuit test to subcontractors that are not our customers would adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.
 
On June 24, 2021, we completed the divestment of our PCB Test business. No customer of our PCB Test segment exceeded 10% of consolidated net sales for the years ended December 25, 2021, December 26, 2020 or December 28, 2019.
 
Additional financial information on revenues from external customers by geographic area for each of the last three years is included in Note 10, “Segment and Geographic Information” in Part IV, Item 15(a) of this Form 10-K.
 
Sales and Marketing
 
We market our products worldwide through a combination of a direct sales force and independent sales representatives. In geographic areas where we believe there is sufficient sales potential, we generally employ our own personnel. Our United States (U.S.) sales offices are located in Poway and Milpitas, California, St. Paul, Minnesota, Lincoln, Rhode Island and Norwood, Massachusetts. Our European sales offices are located in Kolbermoor, Germany; Grenoble, France; Agrate, Italy and La Chaux-de-Fonds, Switzerland. We operate in Asia with sales and service offices in Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, Philippines, Taiwan, China, South Korea and Japan.
Competition
 
The semiconductor equipment industry is intensely competitive and is characterized by rapid technological change and demanding worldwide service requirements. Significant competitive factors include product performance, price, reliability, lead-time, customer support and installed base of products. While we believe that we are the leading worldwide supplier of semiconductor test handling equipment, we face substantial competition in Japan and Taiwan which represent a significant percentage of the worldwide market. Test subcontractors in Asia also purchase mostly from local Asian competitors. In the semiconductor test market, we face competition from two dominant suppliers headquartered in the U.S. and Japan, both of which are substantially larger than Cohu’s test business. While we are among the leading worldwide suppliers of test contactors, this market is fragmented with a large number of global and local competitors. To remain competitive within the industries we serve, we believe we will require significant financial resources to offer a broad range of products, maintain localized customer support and service centers worldwide and to invest in research and development of new products. Failure to introduce new products in a timely manner or the introduction by competitors of products with actual or perceived advantages could result in a loss of competitive position and reduced sales of existing products. No assurance can be given that we will continue to compete successfully throughout the world.

Backlog
 
Our backlog of unfilled orders for products, by segment at December 25, 2021 and December 26, 2020 was as follows:
 

(in millions) | 2021 | | 2020 | 
--------------------------------+------+-------+------+--
Semiconductor Test & Inspection | $ | 292.9 | | $ | 237.1
PCB Test | | N/A | | | 22.4 
Total consolidated backlog | $ | 292.9 | | $ | 259.5

 
Backlog is generally expected to ship within the next twelve months. Our backlog at any point in time may not be representative of actual sales in any future period due to the possibility of customer changes in delivery schedules, cancellation of orders, potential delays in product shipments, and difficulties in obtaining parts from suppliers or failure to satisfy customer acceptance requirements resulting in the inability to recognize revenue under accounting requirements. Furthermore, many orders are subject to cancellation or rescheduling by the customer with limited or no penalty. A reduction in backlog during any period could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
 
Manufacturing and Raw Materials
 
Our principal manufacturing operations are currently located in Malacca, Malaysia (handler operations and kits); Laguna, Philippines (kits and test contactors); Lincoln, Rhode Island (connectors); and Osaka, Japan (probe pins).
 
We outsource the manufacturing of many of our semiconductor automated test equipment products to Jabil Circuit, Inc.’s facility in Penang, Malaysia. Our contract manufacturing partner is responsible for significant material procurement, assembly and testing. We continue to manage product design through pilot production for the subcontracted products, and we are directly involved in qualifying suppliers and key components used in all our products. Our contract manufacturer is responsible for funding the capital expenses incurred in connection with the manufacture of our products, except with regard to end-of-line testing equipment and other specific manufacturing equipment utilized in assembling our products or sub-components which are financed and owned by Cohu. Contracting with a global provider such as Jabil, gives us added flexibility to manufacture certain products closer to target markets in Asia, potentially increasing responsiveness to customers while reducing costs and delivery times.
 
Many of the components and subassemblies we utilize are standard products, although some items are made to our specifications. Certain components are obtained or are available from a limited number of suppliers or may be sole sourced. We seek to reduce our dependence on sole and limited source suppliers, however in some cases the complete or partial loss of certain of these sources could have a material adverse effect on our operations while we attempt to locate and qualify replacement suppliers.
 
Patents and Trademarks
 
Our technology is protected by various intellectual property laws including patent, license, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws. In addition, we believe that, due to the rapid pace of technological change in the semiconductor and electronic equipment industries, the successful manufacture and sale of our products also depends upon our experience, technological know-how, manufacturing and marketing skills and speed of response to sales opportunities. In the absence of patent protection, we would be vulnerable to competitors who attempt to copy or imitate our products or processes. We believe our intellectual property has value and we have in the past and will in the future take actions we deem appropriate to protect such property from misappropriation. However, there can be no assurance such actions will provide meaningful protection from competition. Protecting our intellectual property rights or defending against claims brought by other holders of such rights, either directly against us or against customers we have agreed to indemnify, would likely be expensive and time consuming and could have a material adverse effect on our operations.
Research and Development
 
Research and development activities are carried on in our various subsidiaries and are directed toward development of new products and equipment, as well as enhancements to existing products and equipment. Our total research and development expense was $92.0 million in 2021, $86.2 million in 2020 and $86.1 million in 2019.
 
We work closely with our customers to make improvements to our existing products and in the development of new products. We expect to continue to invest heavily in research and development and must manage product transitions successfully as introductions of new products could adversely impact sales.

Seasonality
 
Historically, the semiconductor industry has been seasonal with recurring periods of oversupply and excess capacity, which often have had a significant effect on the semiconductor industry’s demand for capital equipment, including equipment of the type we manufacture and market. We anticipate that the markets for newer generations of semiconductors and semiconductor equipment will be subject to similar cycles. See the risk factor entitled “The semiconductor industry we serve is seasonal, volatile and unpredictable, and increased cyclicality could have an adverse impact on our sales and gross margin.”
