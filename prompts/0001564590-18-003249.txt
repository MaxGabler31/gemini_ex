--------+---------

Overview
 We are a leading provider of cloud-based supply chain management solutions, providing network-proven fulfillment, sourcing and item assortment management solutions, along with comprehensive retail performance analytics to thousands of customers worldwide.  We provide our solutions through the SPS Commerce Platform, a cloud-based product suite that improves the way retailers, suppliers, distributors and logistics firms orchestrate the sourcing, set up of new vendors and items and fulfillment of products that consumers buy.  Implementing and maintaining this suite of supply chain management capabilities is resource intensive and not a core competency for most businesses.  The SPS Commerce Platform eliminates the need for on premise software and support staff, which enables our customers to focus their resources on their core business.  The SPS Commerce Platform enables retailers, suppliers, distributors and logistics firms to increase supply cycle agility, optimize inventory levels and sell-through, reduce costs, increase visibility into customer orders and ensure suppliers, distributors and logistics firms satisfy exacting retailer requirements.
 As of December 31, 2017, we had approximately 26,000 customers with contracts to pay us monthly fees, which we refer to as recurring revenue customers.  We have also generated revenues by providing our cloud-based supply chain management solutions to an additional 49,000 organizations that, together with our recurring revenue customers, we refer to as our customers.  Once connected to our Platform, our customers often require integrations to new organizations that represent an expansion of our Platform and new sources of revenues for us.
 As a provider of cloud services, we enable our customers to easily interact with their trading partners around the world without the local implementation and servicing of software that traditional on-premise solutions require.  Our delivery model also enables us to offer functionality, integration, analytics and reliability with less cost and risk than traditional solutions.
 For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, we generated revenues of $220.6 million, $193.3 million and $158.5 million, respectively.  Our fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2017 represented our 68th consecutive quarter of increased revenues.  Recurring revenues from recurring revenue customers accounted for 92.5%, 91.6% and 90.8% of our total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  Our revenues are not concentrated with any customer, as our largest customer represented less than 1.0% of total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2017 and less than 2.0% of total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015.
 Our Platform
 We operate one of the largest retail trading partner networks through a cloud-based services suite that improves the way suppliers, retailers, logistics firms, distributors and other trading partners manage and fulfill orders, manage sell-through performance and source new items.  Approximately 75,000 customers across more than 60 countries currently use our Platform to improve the performance of their trading relationships.  Our Platform fundamentally changes how organizations use electronic communication to manage their supply chains by replacing the collection of traditional, custom-built, point-to-point integrations with a network model whereby a single integration to our Platform enables an organization to connect seamlessly to the entire SPS Commerce network of trading partners.
 From that single connection, a member of our network can make use of the full suite of our solutions, from fulfillment automation, to the analysis and optimization of item sell-through performance, to sourcing new items, retailing relationships or providers of logistics and other services.  This represents a fundamental change to fulfillment automation and enables inherent adaptability and flexibility not possible with traditional supply chain management system architectures.
 Our Platform is comprised of a set of coupled cloud services that deliver value as stand-alone offerings, but also provide additional value when used collectively.  Our fulfillment product combines integrations that comply with numerous rule books for retailers and distributors with whom we and our customers have done business.  By maintaining current integrations with retailers, our Platform removes the need for a retailer’s trading partners to continually stay up-to-date with the rule book changes required by retailers.  Moreover, by utilizing a cloud services 
 4


model, we eliminate or greatly reduce the burden on trading partners to support and maintain an on-premise software application, thereby reducing ongoing operating costs.  As the transaction hub for trading partners, we also are able to provide increased performance visibility and data analytics capabilities across their supply chains, each of which is difficult to gain from traditional, point-to-point integration solutions.
 The following solutions are enabled through the SPS Commerce cloud services Platform:
  
• | Trading Partner Community Enablement. Our Community Enablement solution enables organizations, from large to small retailers and suppliers to emerging providers of value-added products and services, to verify that they can electronically trade with their trading partners. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Trading Partner Fulfillment. Our Fulfillment solution provides fulfillment automation and replaces or augments an organization’s existing trading partner electronic communication infrastructure, enabling them to have visibility into the journey of an order and comply with retailers’ rule books and enabling the electronic exchange of information among numerous trading partners through various protocols. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Trading Partner Assortment. Today’s retail marketplace requires the management of tens and even hundreds of individual attributes associated with each item a retailer or supplier sells today. This information can include supply chain descriptions and measurements, store and shelf dimensions, warehouse dimensions, digital images/video, customer facing descriptions and measurements, and warehouse information. Our Assortment product provides robust, extensible management of this information, enabling accurate orders and rapid fulfillment. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Trading Partner Analytics. Our Analytics solution consists of data analytics applications that enable our customers to improve their visibility across, and analysis of, their supply chains. When focused on point-of-sale data, for example, retailers and suppliers can ensure inventory is located where demand is highest. Retailers improve their visibility into supplier performance and their understanding of product sell-through. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Trading Partner Sourcing. Through Retail Universe, our social network for the retail industry, retailers can source providers of new items, suppliers can connect with new retailers and the broader retailing community can make connections to expand their business networks and grow. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Other Trading Partner Solutions. We provide a number of peripheral solutions such as barcode labeling, planogram services and our scan and pack application, which helps trading partners process information to streamline the picking and packaging process.

Our Customer and Sales Sources
 As one of the largest providers of cloud services for supply chain management, the trading partner relationships that we enable among our retailer, supplier and fulfillment customers naturally lead to new customer acquisition opportunities.
“Network Effect”
 Once connected to our network, trading partners can exchange electronic supply chain information with each other.  The value of our Platform increases with the number of trading partners connected to the Platform.  The addition of each new customer to our Platform enables that new customer to communicate with our existing customers and enables our existing customers to do business with the new customer.  Additionally, through our Sourcing product, our community now has a social network focused on facilitating connections and business interactions among retailers and suppliers.  This “network effect” of adding an additional customer to our Platform creates a significant opportunity for existing customers to realize incremental sales by working with our new trading partners and vice versa.  As a result of this increased volume of activity amongst our network participants, we earn additional revenues from these participants.
Customer Acquisition Sources
 Community Enablement.  As retailers and suppliers reshape how they do business in an omnichannel landscape, they need to bring new capabilities and services to their trading partner networks.  For instance, a 
 5


supplier may wish to collaborate with their retailers around point-of-sale analytics data, or a retailer may decide to change the workflow or protocol by which it interacts with its suppliers.  In each case, the supplier and retailer may engage us to work with its trading partner base to enable the new capability.  Performing these programs on behalf of retailers and suppliers often generates supplier sales leads for us.
 Referrals from Our Customers.  We also receive sales leads from our customers seeking to communicate electronically with their trading partners.  For example, a supplier may refer to us its third-party logistics provider or manufacturer which is not in our network.
 Channel Partners.  In addition to the customer acquisition sources identified above, we market and sell our solutions through a variety of channel partners including software providers, resellers, system integrators and logistics partners.  For example, software partners such as Microsoft, NetSuite, Oracle, SAP, Sage and their business partner communities generate sales for us as part of broader enterprise resource planning, warehouse management system and/or transportation management system sales efforts.  Our logistics partners also drive new sales both by providing leads and by embedding our solutions as part of their service offerings.
Our Sales Force
 We also sell our solutions through a global sales force which is organized as follows:
  
• | Retailer Sales. We employ a team of sales professionals who focus on selling our cloud services suite to retailers and distributors. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Supplier Sales. We employ a team of supplier sales representatives focused on selling our cloud services suite to suppliers. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Business Development Efforts. Our business development organization is tasked with finding new sources of revenue and development of new business opportunities through channel partners and other areas that present opportunity for growth. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our Growth Strategy
 Our objective is to be the leading global provider of supply chain management solutions.  Key elements of our strategy include:
  
• | Further Penetrate Our Current Market. We believe the global supply chain management market is underpenetrated and, as the retail industry continues to respond to the changing requirements of the omnichannel marketplace, and as the supply chain ecosystem becomes more complex and geographically dispersed, the demand for supply chain management solutions will increase, especially among small- and medium-sized businesses. We intend to continue leveraging our relationships with customers and their trading partners to obtain new sales leads. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Increase Revenues from Our Customer Base. We believe our overall customer satisfaction is strong and will lead our customers to further expand their use of the solutions they have currently purchased as well as purchase additional services to continue improving the performance of their trading partner relationships, generating additional revenues for us. We also expect to introduce new solutions to sell to our customers. We believe our position as the incumbent supply chain management solution provider to our customers, our integration into our recurring revenue customers’ business systems and the modular nature of our Platform are conducive to deploying additional solutions with customers. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Expand Our Distribution Channels. We intend to grow our business by expanding our network of sales representatives to gain new customers. We also believe there are valuable opportunities to promote and sell our solutions through collaboration with other providers. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Expand Our International Presence. We believe our presence in Asia Pacific, as well as Europe, represents a significant competitive advantage. We plan to increase our international sales efforts to obtain new customers around the world. We intend to leverage our current international presence to increase the number of integrations we have with retailers in foreign markets to make our Platform more valuable to their trading partners based overseas. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

• | Enhance and Expand Our Platform. We intend to further improve and develop the functionality and features of our Platform, including, from time to time, developing new solutions and applications. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Selectively Pursue Strategic Acquisitions. The fragmented nature of our market provides opportunity for selective acquisitions. In 2014, we purchased substantially all of the assets of Leadtec Systems Australia Pty Ltd (“Leadtec”) and its affiliates, a privately-held provider of cloud-based integration solutions in Australia and New Zealand. This acquisition expanded our base of recurring revenue customers and added suppliers to our network. In 2016, we purchased Toolbox Solutions, Inc. (Toolbox Solutions), a Canadian based point-of-sale analytics and category management services provider to retailers and consumer packaged goods suppliers in North America. To complement and accelerate our internal growth, we may pursue acquisitions of other supply chain management companies to add customers or additional functionalities. We plan to evaluate potential acquisitions of other supply chain management companies primarily based on the number of customers and revenue the acquisition would provide relative to the purchase price. We also may pursue acquisitions that allow us to expand into regions where we do not have a significant presence or to offer new functionalities we do not currently provide. We plan to evaluate potential acquisitions to expand into new regions or offer additional functionalities primarily based on the anticipated growth the acquisition would provide, the purchase price and our ability to integrate and operate the acquired business.

Technology, Development and Operations
 Technology
 We were an early provider of cloud services to the retail supply chain management industry, launching the first version of our Platform in 1997.  We use commercially available hardware and cloud services with a combination of proprietary and commercially available software.
 Our cloud Platform treats all customers as logically separate tenants in a common Platform.  As a result, we spread the cost of delivering our solutions across our customer base.  Because we do not manage thousands of distinct applications with their own business logic and database schemes, we believe that we can scale our business faster than traditional software vendors, even those that modified their products to be accessible over the Internet.
 Development
 Our research and development efforts focus on maintaining, improving and enhancing our existing solutions, as well as developing new solutions and applications.  Our multi-tenant Platform serves all of our customers, which allows us to maintain relatively low research and development expenses and release software updates more frequently compared to traditional on-premise licensed software solutions that support multiple versions.  Our development efforts take place at our U.S. locations in Minnesota and New Jersey, as well as in Toronto, Canada and Kiev, Ukraine.
Operations
 We operate our infrastructure in third-party data centers located in Minnesota and New Jersey; Melbourne, Australia; as well as provisioned services in public cloud providers.  In all cases, infrastructure and services are managed by us.
 We have internal and third party monitoring software that continually checks our Platform and key underlying components for continuous availability and performance, ensuring our Platform is available and providing adequate service levels.  We have a technology operations team that provides system provisioning, management, maintenance, monitoring and back-up.
 We operate a service architecture using industry best practices to insure multiple points of redundancy, high availability and scale as needed.  Our databases are replicated between locations with a defined recovery point objective.

Our Customers
 As of December 31, 2017, we had approximately 26,000 recurring revenue customers and approximately 75,000 total customers.  Our primary source of revenue is from small- to mid-sized suppliers in the consumer packaged goods industry.  We also generate revenues from other members of the supply chain ecosystem, including retailers, distributors, third-party logistics providers and other trading partners.  Our revenues are not concentrated with any customer, as our largest customer represented less than 1.0% of total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2017 and less than 2.0% of total revenues for both the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015.
Competition
 Vendors in the supply chain management industry offer solutions through three delivery methods: on demand or cloud-based, traditional on-premise software and managed services.
 The market for cloud-based supply chain management solutions is fragmented and rapidly evolving.  Cloud service vendors compete directly with each other based on the following:
  
• | breadth of pre-built connections to retailers, third-party logistics providers, and other trading partners;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | history of establishing and maintaining reliable integration connections with trading partners;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | reputation of the cloud service vendor in the supply chain management industry;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | price;
--+-------


• | specialization in a customer market segment;
--+---------------------------------------------


• | speed and quality with which the cloud service vendor can integrate its customers to their trading partners;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | functionality of the cloud service solution, such as the ability to integrate the solution with a customer’s business systems;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | breadth of complementary supply chain management solutions the cloud service vendor offers; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | training and customer support services provided during and after a customer’s initial integration.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We expect to encounter new and increased competition as this market segment consolidates and matures.  Consolidation among cloud service vendors could create a direct competitor that is able to compete with us more effectively than the numerous, smaller vendors currently offering cloud service supply chain management solutions.  Increased competition from cloud service vendors could reduce our market share, revenues, and operating margins or otherwise adversely affect our business.
 Cloud service vendors also compete with traditional on-premise software companies and managed service providers.  Traditional on-premise software companies focused on supply chain integration management include IBM-Sterling Commerce and OpenText-GXS.  These companies offer a “do-it-yourself” approach in which customers purchase, install, and manage specialized software, hardware and value-added networks for their supply chain integration needs.  This approach requires customers to invest in staff to operate and maintain the software. Traditional on-premise software companies use a single-tenant approach in which information maps to retailers are built for and used by one supplier, as compared to cloud service solutions that allow multiple customers to share information maps with a retailer.
 Managed service providers focused on the supply chain management market include IBM-Sterling Commerce and OpenText-GXS.  These companies combine traditional on-premise software, hardware and value-added networks with professional information technology services to manage these resources.  Like traditional on-premise software companies, managed service providers use a single-tenant approach.
 Customers of traditional on-premise software companies and managed service providers typically make significant upfront investments in the supply chain management solutions these competitors provide, which can decrease the customers’ willingness to abandon their investments in favor of a cloud service solution.  Cloud service supply chain management solutions also are at a relatively early stage of development compared to traditional on-premise software and managed service providers.  Cloud service vendors compete with these better established 
 8


solutions based on total cost of ownership and flexibility.  If suppliers do not perceive the benefits of cloud service solutions, or if suppliers are unwilling to abandon their investments in other supply chain management solutions, our business and growth may suffer.  In addition, many traditional on-premise software companies and managed service providers have larger customer bases and may be better capitalized than we are, which may provide them with an advantage in developing, marketing or servicing solutions that compete with ours.
 Intellectual Property and Proprietary Content
 We rely on a combination of copyright, trademark and trade secret laws as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary technology and our brand.  We enter into confidentiality and proprietary rights agreements with our employees, consultants and other third parties and control access to software, documentation and other proprietary information. We have registered trademarks and pending trademark applications in the U.S. and certain foreign countries. Depending on the jurisdiction, trademarks are generally valid as long as they are in use or their registrations are properly maintained and they have not been found to have become generic.  Registrations of trademarks can also generally be renewed indefinitely as long as the trademarks are in use.  We do not have any patents, but we have pending patent applications. Our trade secrets consist primarily of the software we have developed for our SPS Commerce Platform. Our software is also protected under copyright law, but we do not have any registered copyrights.
Employees
 As of December 31, 2017, we had 1,336 employees.  We also employ independent contractors to support our operations.  We believe that our continued success will depend on our ability to continue to attract and retain skilled technical and sales personnel.  We have never had a work stoppage, and none of our employees are represented by a labor union.  We believe our relationship with our employees is good.
