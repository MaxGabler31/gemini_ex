ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
 
MySize is a provider of an innovative artificial intelligence driven measurement solutions that are designed to address shortcomings in multiple verticals, including the e-commerce fashion/apparel, shipping/parcel and do it yourself, or DIY, industries. Currently, we are mainly focusing on the e-commerce fashion/apparel industry. Utilizing our sophisticated algorithms within our proprietary technology, we can calculate and record measurements in a variety of novel ways, and most importantly, increase revenue for businesses across the globe.
 
Our solutions can be utilized to accurately take measurements of a variety of items via a mobile device. By downloading the application to a smartphone, the user is then able to run the mobile device over the surface of an item the user wishes to measure. The information is then automatically sent to a cloud-based server where the dimensions are calculated through our proprietary algorithms, and highly accurate measurements (+ or - 2 centimeters) are then sent back to the user’s mobile device. We believe that the commercial applications for this technology are significant in many areas.
 
Our flagship product, MySizeID, enables shoppers to generate highly accurate measurements of their body to find proper fitting clothes and accessories, through the use of our application on their mobile phone or through a simple questionnaire if the user decides not to download the application. MySizeID syncs the user’s measurement data to a sizing chart integrated through a retailer’s (or a white labeled) mobile application, and only presents items for purchase that match their measurements to ensure a correct fit. MySizeID is available for license by retailers and download by consumers on both iOS and Android operating systems.
 
While we rollout our products to major retailers and apparel companies, there is a lead time for new customers to ramp up before we can recognize revenue. This lead time varies between customers, especially when the customer is a tier 1 retailer, where the integration process may take longer. Generally, first we integrate our product into a customer’s online platform, which is followed by piloting and implementation, and, assuming we are successful, commercial roll-out, all of which takes time before we expect it to impact our financial results in a meaningful way. While we have begun generating initial sales revenue, we do not expect to generate meaningful revenue during 2022 from MySizeID. Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the success of our market penetration and our dependence on the extent to which MySizeID is adopted and utilized, we are unable to predict the extent to which we will recognize revenue. We may be unable to successfully develop or market any of our current or proposed products or technologies, those products or technologies may not generate any revenues, and any revenues generated may not be sufficient for us to become profitable or thereafter maintain profitability.
 
Recent Developments
 
Shoshana Zigdon Agreement
 
On May 26, 2021, we, My Size Israel 2014 Ltd, or My Size Israel, and Shoshana Zigdon entered into an Amendment to Purchase Agreement, or the Amendment, which made certain amendments to a Purchase Agreement between the parties dated February 16, 2014, or the Purchase Agreement.
 
Pursuant to the Amendment, Ms. Zigdon agreed to irrevocably waive (i) the right to repurchase certain assets related to the collection of data for measurement purposes that My Size Israel acquired from Ms. Zigdon under the Purchase Agreement and upon which our business is substantially dependent, or the Assets, and (ii) all past, present and future rights in any of the intellectual property rights sold, transferred and assigned to My Size Israel under the Purchase Agreement and any modifications, amendments or improvements made thereto, including, without limitation, any compensation, reward or any rights to royalties or to receive any payment or other consideration whatsoever in connection with such intellectual property rights, or the Waiver. In consideration of the Waiver, we issued 2,500,000 shares of common stock to Ms. Zigdon.
 
Under the Purchase Agreement prior to the Amendment, Ms. Zigdon had a right to repurchase the Assets until June 16, 2021 at the market price of the Assets as determined by a third party independent valuation. In addition, under the Purchase Agreement prior to the Amendment, Ms. Zigdon would have had a right to receive 18% of My Size Israel’s operating profit, directly or indirectly connected with the Assets, together with VAT for a period of seven years from the end of the development period of My Size Israel’s measurement solution.

On October 26, 2021, holders of warrants exercised an aggregate of 2,625,908 shares of common stock in consideration for $2,889,000. In addition, on the same day, we entered into securities purchase agreements, or the RD Purchase Agreements with several institutional investors, or the Purchasers, pursuant to which we agreed to sell and issue in the RD Offering an aggregate of 2,514,800 of our shares of common stock, or the RD Shares, and, in a concurrent private placement, an aggregate of 1,886,100 unregistered warrants to purchase shares of common stock, or the RD Warrants, at an offering price of $1.352 per share and associated warrant. In addition, we entered into security purchase agreements, or the PIPE Purchase Agreements, and together with the RD Purchase Agreements, the Purchase Agreements, with the Purchasers pursuant to which we agreed to sell and issue in a PIPE Offering an aggregate of 3,772,208 unregistered shares of common stock, or the PIPE Shares, and together with the RD Shares, the Shares, and unregistered warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of 2,829,156 shares of common stock, or the PIPE Warrants and together with the RD Warrants, the Warrants, at the same purchase price as in the RD Offering.

The Warrants are immediately exercisable and expire five years from issuance at an exercise price of $1.26 per share, subject to adjustment as set forth therein. The Warrants may be exercised on a cashless basis if there is no effective registration statement registering the shares underlying the warrants.
 
In connection with the PIPE Purchase Agreement, we entered into a registration rights agreement, or the Registration Rights Agreement, with the Purchasers. Pursuant to the Registration Rights Agreement, we will be required to file a resale registration statement, or the Registration Statement, with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC, to register for resale the shares issuable in connection with the PIPE Offering, including shares issuable upon exercise of the Warrants, within 20 days of the signing date of the PIPE Purchase Agreement, or the Signing Date, and to have such Registration Statement declared effective within 60 days after the Signing Date in the event the Registration Statement is not reviewed by the SEC, or 90 days of the Signing Date in the event the Registration Statement is reviewed by the SEC. 
 
Aggregate gross proceeds to us in respect of the Offerings was approximately $8.5 million, before deducting fees payable to the placement agent and other estimated offering expenses payable by us.
 
We also entered into a letter agreement, or the Engagement Agreement, with H.C. Wainwright & Co., LLC, or Wainwright, pursuant to which Wainwright agreed to serve as the exclusive placement agent for us in connection with the Offerings.

Our Growth Strategy
 
We aim to drive revenue primarily through penetration of the U.S. market through a business to business to consumer (B2B2C) model in the verticals we are targeting. We are pursuing the following growth strategies:

● | Sign Additional Commercial Agreements with U.S. Retailers. During 2020 and 2021, we entered into commercial agreements with Levi’s, Nautica, Gant, Lacoste, Trutex, Penti, DeMoulin, UniformMarket, and Tricorp among others. We are in various stages of discussions with U.S. and foreign retailers for the deployment of our measurement technology with a view to entering into additional commercial agreements. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Pursue a Two-Pronged Commercialization Strategy. We are seeking to accelerate adoption of our solutions both through direct partnerships with e-commerce websites as well as through third-party platform websites. While we seek to directly enter into partnerships with companies maintaining e-commerce websites in the apparel, courier and DIY markets, we are also seeking to deploy our solutions on third-party platforms. Furthermore, with the expansion of MySizeID through the release of our FirstLook Smart Mirror, which we are offering to brick and mortar stores to digitize the physical stores, MySizeID is now available for online retailers utilizing the WooCoomerce, Shopify, Lightspeed, PrestaShop, Bitrix and Wix platforms and to brick and mortar stores through GK Software POS solution while BoxSize is available on the Honeywell Marketplace, Zebra Technologies and Datalogic. 
● | Ongoing Investment in our Technology Platform. We continue to invest in building new software capabilities and extending our platform to bring the power of accurate measurement to a broader range of applications. In particular, we seek not only to deliver size recommendations but to provide a robust, end-to-end,artificial intelligence, or AI-driven platform that inspires consumer confidence and drives revenue growth by providing a superior consumer journey to both online and the brick and mortar stores. 
● | Grow our database. As the usage of our measurement apps increases, our database of information including user behaviour and body measurements generates valuable statistics. Such data can be used in the big data market for targeted advertising and for blind consumer data mining. 
● | Identify and acquire synergistic businesses. In order to reduce our time to market and obtain complementary technologies, we are seeking to acquire technologies and businesses that are synergistic to our product offering. We recently completed an acquisition of Orgad which operates an omnichannel e-commerce platform. 
● | Partnerships and cooperation. In order to bring a wider solution for the retail market we are working to partner and integrate our technology with partners that can increase our penetration and offering to the market. 

Market Opportunity
 
The mass adoption of mobile technologies such as tablets and smartphones has led to a surge of consumer activity online. Tasks that were once primarily brick-and-mortar – shopping for clothes, shipping a package, or buying supplies for a DIY home renovation project – have now shifted to digital, as consumers prefer the convenience of shopping anywhere, anytime.
 
E-commerce’s meteoric rise has been a boon to retailers who can offer shoppers a simple customer experience through desktop or mobile devices. According to Statista, retail e-commerce sales worldwide for 2021 were $5.0 trillion and this figure is forecast to grow by 50 percent over the next four years, reaching about 7.4 trillion dollars by 2025. While many sectors have found ways to increase revenue through e-commerce, e-commerce is still plagued by issues that cut into profits and negatively impact the bottom line, such as customer returns, low consumer conversion, and associated restocking and shipping costs.

Fashion/Apparel
 
Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, a large volume of shopping has migrated online. In a report by McKinsey from 2020, the total global revenue of fashion sales through ecommerce jumped from 16% to 29%. The same year, Shopify recorded that over 150 million people shopped online for the first time. An online shopping trend has enabled retailers to further re-strategize their shopping models to gauge the interest of tech-savvy customers.
 
As pandemic restrictions slowly begin to ease in the United States and abroad, the shift from online retail back to brick-and-mortar shopping is revving up. 
 
In addition, according to analytics from Meticulous Research, AI in the retail market is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 34.4% from 2020, and is projected to be worth nearly $20 billion by 2027. AI-powered solutions like virtual assistants, chatbots, virtual try-on, and generated size recommendations can help retailers. The technology extracts accurate customer insight and provides improved shopping experiences to consumers who visit online stores.
 
The fashion market is one of the fastest growing sectors of online retail – what was already estimated to be an approximately $758 billion market in 2021 and is projected to increase to over $1,003 billion by the end of 2025 according to DataFeedWatch. However, conveniences of online shopping, including simple search filters, the ability to purchase apparel without trying it on, and free returns, have led to returns. One of the biggest causes for returns are sizing issues, due in part to a generally standardized sizing system that many retailers and clothing brands have. Despite this universal system, many retailers’ clothes fit differently, which leaves consumers guessing what size they need or ordering multiple sizes and returning the ones that do not fit, all at the retailer’s expense.


As brands move online or significantly expand their online presence, we believe that developing innovative ways to connect with shoppers, both online and offline, has become a top priority.


Shipping/Parcel
 
According to Pitney Bowes, parcel revenue in 13 major countries around the world increased by 22% year over year from $351 billion in 2019 (reflecting 103 billion parcels) to $430 billion in 2020 (reflecting 131 billion parcels). In the shipping/parcel industry, the dimensions of a package are critical. It is not merely the measurement of a package or box – but rather the amount of space that the package or box will take up on a truck, airplane, or ship that will be transporting the package or box. Far too often, retailers use unfit packaging for their items, adding additional costs in materials and shipping fees.

-

DIY
 
Similar to issues in the apparel and fashion market, big box, hardware, furniture, and DIY stores are plagued by returns due to incorrect fit and measurements. In an industry where precise measurement for projects is an absolute necessity, e-commerce has not grown as quickly as in other industries which we believe is due to lack of consumer confidence in measurements at home and buying the correct item online.
 
MySizeID
 
We have released the MySizeID app for both iOS and Android which assists consumers to take highly accurate measurement of their own body in order to size clothing in the best way possible without the need to try the clothes on before purchasing. MySizeID is designed to simplify the process of purchasing clothes online and significantly reduce the rate of returns of poor-fitting clothing. During 2021, MySizeID delivered over 21 million size recommendations.
 
The application is the result of a research and development effort that combines:
 

● | anthropometric research – analyses of information pertaining to body measurements derived from a survey and the subsequent determination of correlations between body parts; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | body measurement algorithm research – an algorithm created by us to measure body parts; and 
● | retailers size chart analyses – adopting a deep understanding of the size charts of retailers and the corresponding “body to garment size.” 

 
MySizeID allows consumers to create a secure, online profile of their personal measurements, which can then be utilized, with partnered online retailers, to ensure that no matter the manufacturer or size chart, they will get the right fit. MySizeID operates based on the use of existing sensors in smart phones which enable, through a specific purpose application, the measurement of the body of any consumer by moving the smartphone phone along his or her body. The MySizeID application does not rely on user photographs or any additional hardware; all a user needs to do is scan their body with their smartphone and the application records their measurements. The measurements can then be saved in our database in the cloud, enabling the user to search for clothes in various retailer websites without worrying about size. When a search is made, the retailer will connect to our cloud database, and then provide results based on the user’s measurements and other parameters as he or she may have defined. This data is also saved for use when a customer enters a brick and mortar store to help serve the customer more efficiently and to provide a better shopping experience.

As part of the integration process, we offer to the retailer four main components:
 

● | Mobile App. MySizeID comes in the form of a native app or as white label app. Our native app can be used “as is” integrated into the retailer’s e-commerce website. Alternatively, it can be white labeled according to the retailer’s needs in a manner that showcases the retailer brand (colors, logo etc.). The retailer can also receive the MySizeID software development kit (SDK), and integrate it into its own existing application so the retailer’s consumers will not have to have two separate apps when shopping online. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
During 2021, we introduced a full integration of our e-commerce shoe sizing solution directly to retailers’ websites and added a three-dimensional, or 3D, “Try-It-On” avatar feature. Furthermore, we launched an application for the Evropeyskiy Mall in Russia which is designed to streamline in-person shopping from browsing to point of sale.
 

● | Widget. When a consumer enters into the retailer’s website and looks for a specific item, he or she can click on the MySizeID widget which will inform the consumer of his or her recommended size, based on his or her actual measurements, as measured using the app and the item he or is looking at. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
The widget has two features:
 
Manual mode – which allows the user to obtain size from the following parameters: gender, height and weight only. Thus, we are able to give a size estimation even without having all the measurements made with the app.
 
Guest mode - allows a user that does not wish to sign up to MySizeID as a user, to obtain size recommendations as well.

Another feature we added is the “in-between sizing” feature. Our system can detect a user that has body dimensions that place the user in-between the clothes sizes being offered and lets the user know that. That way a user can choose between the two sizes according to the user’s fit preference (tight/loose/average).
 
In addition, we have recently released our Instant-App feature which allows shoppers to generate their body measurements directly from our widget, without the need to download our mobile app. Using this technology, the shoppers can create their online profile of their personal measurements and complete a purchase faster and easier with minimum distractions.
 
The body profile can be created while shoppers are viewing the page from their mobile phone, or by scanning a QR code on desktop that will open the same page on the mobile phone.

● | MyDash Platform. The MyDash platform is a smart back-office system where the retailer enters all the information regarding its size charts that correlates to every product in its e-commerce site, and where the retailer can access the information on its users. This system is customizable based on retailers needs. In 2021, we changed the MyDash system in order to increase the system’s accessibility, added walkthroughs, user guides and changed the user interface and much more for the ease of use. We added the option to use our generic size charts, added the option upload size chart files instead of typing the size charts values manually, added more widget styling options and changed the pairing mechanism between the size chart and the products to be more user-friendly.

● | FirstLook Smart Mirror. We recently launched the MySizeID FirstLook Smart Mirror which provides an interactive, mirror-like touch display that allows brands to provide in-store customers with an enhanced, online shopping experience, contactless checkout and obtains the recommended size. The MySizeID FirstLook Smart Mirror can be placed in numerous locations throughout a retail store, including the fitting rooms (without cameras) or other high-traffic locations of the store. Highlight capabilities of the FirstLook Smart Mirror include a 3D “Try-it-on” interactive avatar experience, personalized and highly accurate size recommendations by MySizeID, third-party point of sale systems integration, styling recommendations and contactless “select and collect” at the register feature.

We are currently offering MySizeID technology to retailers through either a pay-per-use model or a monthly subscription model. In our pay-per-use business model, every time the consumer obtains a recommended size, the retailer is charged for the usage.
 
In addition, we have developed applications for third party ecommerce platforms so that retailers who use those platforms will find our application on the platform’s app store and will be able to easily install it in their store. In February 2020, MySizeID became available for online retailers utilizing the Shopify platform. Fashion and apparel retailers using Shopify can deploy the MySizeID turnkey solution through the simple integration of the MySizeID widget on their site. During 2020 we also released applications for Lightspeed and for WooCommerce which are the biggest ecommerce platform in the market allowing more retailers to easily integrate and use the MySizeID solution.
 
In 2020, we integrated MySizeID with Wix, PrestaShop and Bitrix, which is the biggest eCommerce platform in Russia.
 
BoxSize
 
BoxSize is a parcel measurement application that can provide real-time logistic data on package volumes and transportation, resulting in improved operational efficiency and reduced operating expenses. In addition, BoxSize allows customers to easily measure the size of their parcel with their smartphone, calculate shipping costs and arrange for a convenient pick-up time for the package. BoxSize is available both on iOS and Android.
 
In 2020 we released the “One Click” feature on BoxSize that enables the user to measure a package with just one swipe of the handheld device. Previously, measurements through BoxSize would require three separate swipes.

Our BoxSize mobile measurement solution is available on the Honeywell Marketplace. In addition, BoxSize was approved for Honeywell’s Global Vendor Program, and is available to provide highly accurate mobile measurement solutions for thousands of Honeywell clients. We also developed a new dashboard for the courier companies to have all the required data about each package in one place. It includes package dimensions, pictures, scan geo location and more. The dashboard also let the courier use Webhooks, which allows him to get the information from his own system.
 
In 2020, we announced our partnership with Datalogic, a company focused on the automatic data capture and process automation markets. The partnership makes our BoxSize measurement solution available to thousands of Datalogic customers in the Transportation and Logistics vertical.
 
Agreement with Katz Delivery Services, LTD
 
On November 20, 2015, we entered into an agreement, or the Katz Agreement, with Katz Deliveries, LTD, or Katz, one of the largest courier services in Israel. Pursuant to the Katz Agreement, the parties have agreed to mutually work together to develop and integrate MySize technology with the Katz ERP to monitor the volume of all parcels delivered to it for shipment by its clients. The goal is for Katz to use our technology to help with planning its distribution routes, thus reducing operational costs by adjusting the distribution vehicles to the volume of the shipments.
 
KatzID was developed for Katz and is to be used to measure packages, boxes and pallets at Katz’ logistics center. The app allows users to scan the barcode of a package and measure the package dimensions using MySize’s SizeIT technology (described below) and then subsequently upload the information directly to Katz’s back office.

SizeUp
 
We are working on additional consumer applications, including a DIY application. Our SizeUp application is a smart tape measure for the business to consumer market which allows users to utilize their smartphone as a tape measure. The application provides measurements with an accuracy of within two centimeters. Through the use of SizeUp users will be able to visualize how an object or a piece of furniture will fit in an existing room in their home or office. During 2020, we expanded availability of SizeUp to more than 68 different iOS and Android smartphone models worldwide. It also added Google Vision for image content analysis, object detection, and title suggestions. 
 
Currently the SizeUp app for Android and iOS is available for free for the first 30 days, after which a user will be required to register via e-mail and pay a one-time fee of $1.99 to continue using the application. To date, revenues from downloads have been minimal.
 
SizeIT
 
We have developed SizeIT, a smart measuring tape SDK for both Android and iOS platforms. SizeIT provides users with the ability to instantly and accurately measure objects with a quick movement of their mobile device. SizeIT, the core technology behind MySizeID, SizeUp, and BoxSize applications, can be embedded into any company’s existing or white label mobile app in a short period of time, offering an efficient solution to the escalating costs associated with product sizing issues and returns. SizeIT enables users to measure objects by moving their mobile device from one side of an object to another side of the object. Our algorithm utilizes a mobile device’s motion sensors to calculate the travelled distance.


Research and Development
 
Our research and development team are responsible for the research, algorithm, design, development, and testing of all aspects of our measurement platform technology. We invest in these efforts to continuously improve, innovate, and add new features to our solutions.
 
We incurred research and development expenses of approximately $4.25 million in 2021 and $1.5 million in 2020, relating to the development of its applications and technologies. The increase from the corresponding period primarily resulted from share based payment in the amount of $2.6 million attributed to the share issuance to Ms. Zigdon under that certain Amendment to Purchase Agreement dated May 26, 2021. We intend to continue to invest in our research and development capabilities to extend our platform and bring our measurement technology to a broader range of applications.
 
Sales and Marketing
 
In 2019, we launched a commercialization strategy that directs our sales efforts toward both sales to e-commerce players in specific vertical markets such as fashion/apparel and shipping/delivery as well as to e-commerce third-party platform providers. As of March 18, 2022, we have nine sales offices in the following countries: US, UK, France, Netherlands, Turkey, Russia, Germany, Israel and Italy, generating customer leads, building out a sales pipeline, and developing customer relationships.
 
We believe an effective method to market our suite of products is for users to actively use and explore its capabilities. We encourage free trials of one or more of our products in order to successfully convert those accounts to paid subscriptions.
 
Proprietary Rights
 
We rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws in the United States and other jurisdictions, as well as contractual protections, to protect our proprietary technology.

14
--

 

As of December 31, 2021, we owned eighteen issued patents: six in Europe, four in the US, three in each of Russia and Japan and one each in Canada and Israel which expire between January 20, 2033 and August 18, 2036, and we have three additional patent applications in process. As of such date, we do not have any registered trademarks.
 
We cannot provide any assurance that our proprietary rights with respect to our products will be viable or have value in the future since the validity, enforceability and type of protection of proprietary rights in software-related industries are uncertain and still evolving.
 
Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary. Policing unauthorized use of our products is difficult, and while we are unable to determine the extent to which piracy of our software products exists, software piracy can be expected to be a persistent problem. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect proprietary rights to as great an extent as do the laws of the United States, and effective copyright, trademark, trade secret and patent protection may not be available in those jurisdictions. Our means of protecting our proprietary rights may not be adequate to protect us from the infringement or misappropriation of such rights by others.
 
Further, in recent years, there has been significant litigation in the United States involving patents and other intellectual property rights, particularly in the software and Internet-related industries. We can become subject to intellectual property infringement claims as the number of our competitors grows and our products and services overlap with competitive offerings. These claims, even if not meritorious, could be expensive to defend and could divert management’s attention from operating our business. If we become liable to third parties for infringing their intellectual property rights, we could be required to pay a substantial award of damages and to develop non-infringing technology, obtain a license or cease selling the products that contain the infringing intellectual property. We may be unable to develop non-infringing technology or obtain a license on commercially reasonable terms, if at all.
 
Government Regulation
 
We are subject to a number foreign and domestic laws and regulations that involve matters central to our business. These laws and regulations may involve privacy, data protection, intellectual property, or other subjects. Many of the laws and regulations to which we are subject are still evolving and being tested in courts and could be interpreted in ways that could harm our business. In addition, the application and interpretation of these laws and regulations often are uncertain, particularly in the new and rapidly evolving industry in which we operate. Because global laws and regulations have continued to develop and evolve rapidly, it is possible that we, our products, or our platform may not be, or may not have been, compliant with each such applicable law or regulation.
 
In particular, we are subject to a variety of federal, state and international laws and regulations governing the processing of personal data. Many U.S. states have passed laws requiring notification to data subjects when there is a security breach of personally identifiable data. There are also a number of legislative proposals pending before the U.S. Congress, various state legislative bodies and foreign governments concerning data protection. In addition, data protection laws in Europe and other jurisdictions outside the United States can be more restrictive than those within the United States, and the interpretation and application of these laws are still uncertain and in flux.
 
For example, the General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, which took effect on May 25, 2018, enhances data protection obligations for entities that process personal data about individuals, including obligations to cooperate with European data protection authorities, implement security measures and keep records of personal data processing activities. Noncompliance with the GDPR can trigger fines equal to the greater of €20 million or 4% of global annual revenue. In addition, the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, or CCPA, effective as of January 1, 2020, gives California residents expanded rights to access and require deletion of their personal information, opt out of certain personal information sharing, and receive detailed information about how their personal information is used. The CCPA provides for civil penalties for violations, as well as a private right of action for data breaches, that is expected to increase data breach litigation. Further, failure to comply with the Israeli Privacy Protection Law of 1981, and its regulations, as well as the guidelines of the Israeli Privacy Protection Authority, may expose us to administrative fines, civil claims (including class actions) and in certain cases criminal liability. Current pending legislation may result in a change of the current enforcement measures and sanctions. Given the breadth and depth of changes in data protection obligations, meeting the requirements of GDPR and other applicable laws and regulations has required significant time and resources, including a review of our technology and systems currently in use against the requirements of GDPR and other applicable laws and regulations. We have taken various steps to prepare for complying with GDPR and other applicable laws and regulations however there can be no assurance that these steps are sufficient to assure compliance. Further, additional EU laws and regulations (and member states’ implementations thereof) further govern the protection of individuals and of electronic communications. If our efforts to comply with GDPR or other applicable laws and regulations are not successful, we may be subject to penalties and fines that would adversely impact our business and results of operations, and our ability to use personal data of individuals could be significantly impaired.

Competition
 
We operate in a highly competitive industry that is characterized by constant change and innovation. Changes in the applications and the programing languages used to develop applications, devices, operating systems, and technology landscape result in evolving customer requirements. Our competitors include True Fit, Virtusize, EasyMeasure, AR MeasureKit, Smart Measure and 3DLook.
 
The principal competitive factors in our market include the following:
 

● | Product and platform features, architecture, reliability, privacy and security, performance, effectiveness, and supported environments; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Product extensibility and ability to integrate with other technology infrastructures; 
● | Digital operations expertise; 
● | Ease of use of products and platform capabilities; 
● | Total cost of ownership; 
● | Adherence to industry standards and certifications; 
● | Strength of sales and marketing efforts; 
● | Brand awareness and reputation; and 
● | Focus on customer success. 

 
We believe we generally compete favorably with our competitors on the basis of these factors. We expect competition to increase as other established and emerging companies enter our markets, as customer requirements evolve, and as new products and technologies are introduced. We expect this to be particularly true as we are a smartphone-based offering that does not need to utilize the smartphone’s camera, and our competitors may also seek to repurpose their existing offerings to provide similar solutions. Many of our competitors have substantially greater financial, technical, and other resources, greater name recognition, larger sales and marketing budgets, broader distribution, and larger and more mature intellectual property portfolios.
 
Human Capital Management
 
As of March 14, 2022, we had a total of 32 employees, of which 30 were full-time employees, including 13 in sales and marketing, 14 in technology and development and 5 in administration and finance. None of our employees are represented by a collective bargaining agreement, nor have we experienced any work stoppage. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good. Our future success depends on our continuing ability to attract and retain highly qualified engineers, sales and marketing, account management, and senior management personnel.
 
We believe that our future success will depend, in part, on our continued ability to attract, hire and retain qualified personnel. In particular, we depend on the skills, experience and performance of our senior management and research personnel. We compete for qualified personnel with other hi-tech companies, as well as universities and non-profit research institutions.

We provide competitive compensation and benefits programs to help meet the needs of our employees. In addition to salaries, these programs (which vary by country/region and employment classification) include incentive compensation plan, pension, and insurance benefits, paid time off, , among others. We also use targeted equity-based grants with vesting conditions to facilitate retention of personnel, particularly for our key employees.
 
The success of our business is fundamentally connected to the well-being of our people. Accordingly, we are committed to the health and safety of our employees. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented significant changes that we determined were in the best interest of our employees, as well as the communities in which we operate, and which comply with government regulations. This includes having employees work from home, while implementing additional safety measures for employees continuing critical on-site work.
 
We consider our employees to be a key factor to our success and we are focused on attracting and retaining the best employees at all levels of our business. Inclusion and diversity is a strategic, business priority. We employ people based on relevant qualifications, demonstrated skills, performance and other job-related factors. We do not tolerate unlawful discrimination related to employment, and strive to ensure that employment decisions related to recruitment, selection, evaluation, compensation, and development, among others, are not influenced by race, color, religion, gender, age, ethnic origin, nationality, sexual orientation, marital status, or disability. Continuous monitoring to ensure pay equity has been a focus in 2021. We have continued to improve gender balance in 2021 with a focus on increasing the representation of women hired as new college graduates. We are committed to creating a trusting environment where all ideas are welcomed and employees feel comfortable and empowered to draw on their unique experiences and backgrounds.
 
We consider our relations with our employees to be good.

By the end of 2012, we ceased operations and in January 2013, we sold our entire ownership interest in Metamorefix.
 
In September 2013, Ronen Luzon, our Chief Executive Officer, acquired control of the Company from Asher Shmuelevitch, according to which Mr. Luzon purchased 1,755,950 shares of common stock from Mr. Shmuelevitch, which shares represented approximately 40% of the issued and outstanding capital stock of the Company at such time, thus becoming a controlling shareholder of the Company. In connection with the acquisition, Mr. Luzon reached a settlement with our then creditors pursuant to which the main creditor, Mr. Shmuelevitch, was paid a total sum of approximately $140,000 in consideration for a full and final waiver of any and all his claims that he may have relating to any monetary indebtedness of the Company to the creditors.
 
In February 2014, My Size Israel, our wholly owned subsidiary, entered into a Purchase Agreement, or the Purchase Agreement, with Shoshana Zigdon, who at the time was a beneficial owner of more than 20% of our outstanding shares, with respect to the acquisition by us of certain rights related to the collection of data for measurement purposes including rights in the venture, the method and a patent application that had been filed by the Seller (PCT/IL2013/050056), or the Assets. In consideration for the sale of the Assets, we agreed to pay to Ms. Zigdon, 18% of our operating profit, directly or indirectly connected with the Assets together with value-added tax in accordance with the law for a period of seven years from the end of the development period of the aforementioned venture. In addition to the foregoing, the Purchase Agreement provided that all developments, improvements, knowledge and know-how developed and/or accumulated by us after the execution of the Purchase Agreement will be owned by us.
