Company and Product Overview

Jacksam Corporation dba Convectium is a technology company focused on developing and commercializing products of vaporizer cartridge filling & capping, pre-roll filling, and automation systems. We service the medical and recreational cannabis, hemp, and CBD segments of the larger e-cigarette, vaporizer, and pre-roll markets. Our product line primarily consists of the eShark cartridge filling machine, the 710 Shark cartridge filling machine, the 710 Captain cartridge capping machine, the “PreRoll-ER” automated pre-roll & cone filling machine, and cartridges.

The eShark was introduced to the market in the second half of 2019. The eShark was developed based on our prior flagship product - the 710 Shark cartridge filling machine. The eShark features electric motor system, oil heating mechanics, and advanced automation software system. eShark machines are designed to inject oil into various cartridges (glass, plastic and PODS), while also having the capability to fill bottles and other form factors. eShark machines can fill 100 traditional cartridges in approximately 60 seconds, saving our customers’ valuable time and labor expense over the hand filling method, which is currently the industry norm. We estimate that, in most applications, the eShark will have a 50x faster rate than hand filling. The eShark is currently produced in USA. The eShark has the UL Certification. UL stands for Underwriter Laboratories, a third-party product safety certification company that has operated for over a century.

Our prior flagship product is the 710 Shark cartridge filling machine, which is now on its eighth version. The 710 Shark has pneumatic motor system, oil heating mechanics, and automation software system. It can inject oil into various cartridges (glass, plastic and PODS), while also having the capability to fill bottles and other form factors. It can fill 100 traditional cartridges in approximately 60 seconds. The 710 Shark is currently produced in China. The 710 Shark is sold at a lower price point compared to the eShark to meet the demand from a wider group of customers.

During the second quarter of 2018, we introduced our 710 Captain cartridge capping machine. It is designed to affix caps to the cartridges filled by our eShark and 710 Shark filling machines and matches their production capacity of 100 cartridges in approximately 30 seconds. It is pneumatically operated. The 710 Captain is currently produced in USA.

In December 2019, we entered into a strategic partnership with Jupiter Research, a subsidiary of TILT Holdings. This partnership enabled our company to distribute Jupiter Research’s C-Cell cartridges and enabled Jupiter Research to distribute our filling and capping machines under a profit-sharing agreement. 

As the first company in our industry, we introduced a pre-racked tray solution to the market in late 2019. Our customers will receive boxes of trays preloaded with empty cartridges. Using our automated machines, our customers can finish filling and capping 100 cartridges in less than 2 minutes. As the last step, our customers made new orders, and boxed of pre-racked cartridges will be delivered to their facilities. Customers using our pre-racked tray solution together with our automated capping and filling machines can save significant production time and labor cost, compared to using the traditional hand filling method or using our competitors’ machines.

During the second quarter of 2020, we entered into a strategic partnership with 14th Round Inc, a California based leading cartridge company specialized in high-end and customizable cartridges. The partnership highlights the sales force collaboration, equipment R&D collaboration, and marketing collaborations.

During the third quarter of 2020, we introduced the PreRoll-Er pre-roll filling machine to the U.S. market. The PreRoll-ER is the result of 30 months of research and development. Capable of replacing the work of 10-15 employees, the PreRoll-ER can produce up to 900 cones per hour. The machine has a highly sophisticated system of tamping, twisting, weighing and cutting the cones to a precise and uniform specification. It is manufactured in Montreal, Canada and is one of the leading automated pre-roll machines in the marketplace.

Our customers are primarily businesses operating in jurisdictions that have some form of cannabis legalization. These businesses include, but not limited to, medical and recreational cannabis multi-state operators (MSOs), dispensaries, large and small-scale processors, growers, and distributors. We expect continued growth as we take measures to invest in our intellectual property. We utilize our direct sales force, our strategic partners’ sales force, independent sales representatives, our website, and a wide range of referral network to sell our products.

Our marketing efforts include attending industry trade shows and advertising on social media, industry magazines, and other regional events where both B2B and B2C opportunities exist. We plan to expand our marketing efforts to new jurisdictions as they pass medical and recreational cannabis-use laws.

Corporate History and Background

The Company was originally incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on September 21, 1989, under the name of Fulton Ventures, Inc. On September 19, 2002, management at that time changed the name of Fulton Ventures, Inc. to Asia Premium Television Group, Inc. On November 16, 2009, management at that time changed the name of Asia Premium Television Group, Inc. to China Grand Resorts, Inc. to reflect their new business efforts more accurately. Commencing in 2002, management at that time acquired and sold a series of subsidiary entities that were incorporated in various foreign jurisdictions, including the People’s Republic of China, or PRC, Macau, Hong Kong and the British Virgin Islands. From 2002 to 2009, these subsidiaries engaged in a variety of businesses, including, principally, marketing, brand management, advertising, media planning, public relations and direct marketing services to clients in the PRC.

Management at that time discontinued filing periodic reports under the Exchange Act, after it filed a quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the period ended June 30, 2014 (the “June 2014 10-Q”) on August 14, 2014. As reported in the Company’s annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended September 20, 2013 (the last periodic audited report filed under the Exchange Act, with which the Company furnished audited financial statements) and the June 2014 10-Q, management at that time engaged the Company, through its subsidiaries, in the provision of mobile phone based services in the PRC through Sun New Media Transaction Services Ltd., a Hong Kong corporation, and real estate investment in the PRC through Key Proper Holdings Limited, a British Virgin Islands corporation.

Since the filing of the June 2014 10-Q, current management is not aware of any contact between the Company and management at that time as of the filing of the June 2014 10-Q, nor does current management have any knowledge or information relating to the business operations conducted by the Company or its subsidiaries as of that date, other than as reported in the periodic reports filed with the SEC. 

On April 4, 2016, Mr. Bryan Glass was appointed to serve as the custodian of the Company, which was under the name of China Grand Resorts, Inc. at that time, pursuant to an order of the District Court of Clark County, Nevada. During the course, Mr. Glass was issued 30 million shares of common stock and became the controlling owner of the Company. Current management does not have any records of the Company prior to Mr. Glass became the controlling owner of the Company in April 2016, other than the documents filed with or furnished to the SEC. 

Jacksam was a company originally founded in August 2013, as a Delaware corporation, under the name of Jacksam Corporation. On September 14, 2018, current management entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger and Reorganization (the “Merger”) that resulted in the acquisition of the operational business of Jacksam, by the Jacksam Acquisition Corp, or the Acquisition Sub, a corporation formed in the State of Nevada on September 11, 2018.

Prior to the Merger, the Company was a dormant company without any active operation and was a “shell company” as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 12b-2.

On November 5, 2018, current management merged Jacksam Acquisition Corp into the parent Company, China Grand Resorts, Inc, or the Company. In connection with the transaction, current management amended the articles of incorporation of the Company and changed its name from China Grand Resorts, Inc. to Jacksam Corporation dba Convectium.

Since the Merger, the Company has been operated under the control of current management and continued to operate the business of Jacksam Corporation, described herein, as our sole business.

Our Business Strategy

Our overall goal is to become a leading technology company in the segment of the vaporizer cartridge filling & capping, pre-roll filling, and automation systems. We focus on serving the medical and recreational cannabis, hemp and CBD industries. We develop and commercialize products utilizing an open-source platform. 

Our immediate term goals are: 


· | Create new products and maintain technology leadership. We intend to continue to develop increasing efficient and faster iterations of our filling and capping machines. Additionally, we intend to continue to develop and introduce new automation solutions to the market. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Execute strategic partnership. We intend to focus on the plan and execution for the best utilization of the sales force and other resources of both parties of a strategic partnership. 
· | Increase our domestic and international presence. As more states and countries approve legalized cannabis use, we plan to hire additional sales personnel where appropriate to take advantage of the new markets. We also plan to continue to grow our distributor and affiliate networks to meet expected additional demand for our products.

Existing or Probable Governmental Regulation

Because cannabis remains illegal under U.S. federal law and our products are primarily purchased by providers of cannabis to consumers in those states that have legalized medical or recreational cannabis, a change in U.S. federal enforcement priorities could adversely affect our customers and our business. 

Our products and business are not otherwise subject to material governmental regulation other than those laws and regulations of general application.

Market Competition 

The automated cartridge filling and packaging industry in the cannabis, hemp and CBD marketplace is relatively nascent. We believe that we are the largest manufacturer of cannabis-focused filling machines, with an approximately 50% market share by units sold. Our automated filling machine is designed to fill 100 cartridges per minute. Most cartridge filling operations are still done by using the hand filling method at present, with a throughput rate of approximately 5 per minute. Hand-filling remains our largest competitor. We also believe we offer the highest efficient automated capping machine in the marketplace. Our automated capping machine is designed to cap 100 cartridges per minute, matching the production capability of our filling machines. Lastly, we believe we are the first company offering pre-roll automated filling machine and pre-racked tray solution to customers in the U.S. market.

The competition in the cannabis-focused filling machine market consists of a few players that are focused on regional markets and small growers. Our most direct competitors include Thompson-Duke in Oregon, ATG Pharma in Canada, Vape-Jet in Oregon, and Cooljarz in California. We estimate that none of these competitors appears to offer filling and capping machines that can match the production capability of our machines.

Additionally, there are a few manufacturers that manufacture and distribute machines directly from China, none of which appears to have gained significant market share. 

Our most substantial competitive threat would be from the large tobacco e-cigarette manufacturers and the large medical equipment manufacturers, should either decide to enter the automated cartridge filling and packaging industry for cannabis, hemp and CBD products. Many of these companies possess substantially greater manufacturing, sales, marketing, research and development, and financial resources. As of the date of this report, however, none has entered the market, nor are we aware of any with immediate plans to do so. We believe the changing Federal and state laws that regulate the cannabis industry have an impact on the decisions of those larger manufacturers. Were any large tobacco or e-cigarette manufacturer or medical equipment manufacturer to enter the market, our business and prospects would be adversely affected.

Intellectual Property Rights

We currently have one U.S. patent filed with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), number 16682977, issued on November 13, 2019 and valid for 20 years. We also have one Certificate of Design Patent from the People’s Republic of China, number ZL201630571863.4, issued on May 31, 2017 and valid for 10 years. We have not filed for any other patent, but continue to examine whether, and where, it may be advantageous for us to do so. 

In addition, we also rely upon trade secrets, know-how, trademarks, copyright protection, and continuing technological opportunities to develop and maintain our competitive position. We have periodically monitored and continue to monitor the activities of our competitors and other third parties with respect to their use of our intellectual property. We require our employees, consultants, and third-party collaborators to execute confidentiality and invention assignment agreements upon commencing employment or consulting relationships with us.

Research and Development

Our research and development team was originally formed by Jacksam’s founder, Daniel Davis, and three employed engineers. The founder separated from the Company on May 31, 2019. One of the three engineers remained with the Company as the lead engineer and continue research and development activities. This lead engineer and our new engineers work with our manufacturers to design new products.
Employees

Presently, we have 10 full-time employees. Three employees are engaged in sales and business development, three employees are engaged in research and development and engineering, and four are engaged in business operations including project management, manufacturing, logistics, marketing, finance and accounting, and general management and administration. We have no collective bargaining agreements with our employees, and we have not experienced any work stoppages. We consider our relations with our employees to be good.
