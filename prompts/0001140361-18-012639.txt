Item 1. Business
Turning Point Brands, Inc., Overview
 
Turning Point Brands, Inc. (the “Company,” “we,” “our,” or “us”) is a leading, independent provider of Other Tobacco Products (“OTP”) in the U.S.  We estimate the OTP industry generated approximately $11 billion of manufacturer revenue in 2017.  In contrast to manufactured cigarettes, which have been experiencing declining volumes for decades based on data published by the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (“TTB”), the OTP industry is demonstrating increased consumer appeal with low to mid-single digit consumer unit growth as reported by Management Science Associates, Inc. (“MSAi”), a third-party analytics and information company.  We were the 6th largest competitor in terms of total OTP consumer units sold during 2017.  We sell a wide range of products across the OTP spectrum; however, we do not sell cigarettes.  Our portfolio of brands includes some of the most widely recognized names in the OTP industry, such as Zig-Zag®, Beech-Nut®, Stoker’s®, Trophy®, VaporBeast®, and Vapor Shark®. We currently ship to approximately 800 distributors with an additional 100 secondary, indirect wholesalers in the U.S. that carry and sell our products. We operate in three segments: (i) Smokeless products, (ii) Smoking products, and (iii) NewGen products.  Information regarding net sales, operating income, and assets attributable to each of our segments is included within Note 20 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which are incorporated herein by reference.
 
We have a portfolio of widely recognized brands with significant customer loyalty. We have an experienced management team that possesses long-standing industry relationships and a deep understanding of the OTP industry. We have identified additional opportunities to grow sales, including the launch of new products and expanding our distribution and salesforce. We also believe there are meaningful opportunities to grow through acquisitions and joint ventures across all product categories. As of December 31, 2017, our products are available in approximately 170,000 U.S. retail locations which, with the addition of retail stores in Canada, brings our total North American retail presence to an estimated 200,000 points of distribution. Our sales team targets widespread distribution to all traditional retail channels, including convenience stores, where over 60% of all OTP volume is currently sold, according to MSAi.
 
Smokeless Segment
 
Our Smokeless segment includes both loose leaf chewing tobacco and moist snuff tobacco (“MST”).  Our Smokeless focus brand is Stoker’s in both chewing tobacco and MST.  Stoker’s® chewing tobacco has grown considerably over the last several years and is presently the #1 discount brand and the second largest brand in the industry, with approximately 18% market share.  Our status in the chew market is further strengthened by Beech-Nut®, the #3 premium brand and #6 overall, as well as Trophy®, Durango®, and the five Wind River Brands we acquired in November 2016.  Refer to Note 4 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further details regarding this acquisition.  Collectively, the company is the #2 marketer of chewing tobacco with approximately 28% market share.  Our chewing tobacco operations are facilitated through our long-standing relationship with Swedish Match, the manufacturer of our loose leaf chewing tobaccos.1
 
In MST, Stoker’s remains among the fastest growing brands and holds a 6.7% share in the stores with distribution and a 2.9% share of the total U.S. MST market.  Stoker’s pioneered the large 12 oz. tub packaging format and is manufactured using a proprietary process that we think results in a superior product.  In late 2015, we extended the Stoker’s® MST franchise to include traditional 1.2 oz. cans to broaden retail availability.  Our proprietary manufacturing process is conducted at our Dresden, Tennessee, plant and packaged in both our Dresden, Tennessee, and Louisville, Kentucky facilities.1
 
Smoking Segment
 
Our Smoking segment principally includes cigarette papers and Make-Your-Own (“MYO”) cigar wraps.  The iconic strength of the Zig-Zag® brand drives our leadership position in both the cigarette papers and MYO cigar wrap markets.  In cigarette papers, Zig-Zag® is the #1 premium cigarette paper in the U.S. with approximately 30% market share.  Management estimates also indicate that Zig-Zag® is the #1 brand in the promising Canadian market.  Cigarette paper operations are aided by our sourcing relationships with Bolloré.1
 
In MYO cigar wraps, the Zig-Zag® brand commands about three-quarters of the market and continues to innovate in novel ways, including our recent introduction of Zig-Zag® ‘Rillo sized wraps which are similar in size to cigarillos, the most popular and fastest growing type of machine-made cigars.  MYO cigar wraps operations are facilitated by our long-standing commercial relationship with the patent holder, Durfort.1

NewGen Segment
 
Our NewGen segment includes our recent acquisitions of Smoke Free Technologies, d/b/a VaporBeast (“VaporBeast”), and The Hand Media and its subsidiaries, d/b/a Vapor Shark (collectively, “Vapor Shark”), which have solidified our status as a major player within the segment, in addition to V2 branded products. Refer to Note 4 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further details regarding these acquisitions. VaporBeast is a leading distributor of liquid vapor products servicing the non-traditional retail channel. Vapor Shark is a leading distributor and manufacturer of premium vaping e-liquids with nationwide distribution through non-traditional retail as well as Vapor Shark branded retail locations. Our acquisition of VaporBeast, and subsequent acquisition of Vapor Shark, accelerated our entry into the non-traditional retail outlets for vaporizers, e-liquids, and accessories, which we estimate sell greater than 50% of all liquid vapor volume. We believe our NewGen business will expand further as consumers continue to move from combustible cigarettes to vaping. We believe we are well-positioned to act as a consolidator in the NewGen space in anticipation of increased regulation and will continue to explore potential acquisitions.
 
IPO
 
In our May 2016 initial public offering (the “IPO”), we sold 6,210,000 shares of our voting common stock at a public offering price per share of $10.00. We raised a total of approximately $62.1 million in gross proceeds from the IPO which amounted to $58.2 million in net proceeds after deducting underwriting commissions and other associated costs. We used the proceeds from the IPO, together with cash on hand, to pay fees and expenses related to the IPO; repurchase outstanding warrants and options issued by our subsidiary Intrepid Brands, LLC (“Intrepid”); repay approximately $34 million of our floating rate PIK Toggle Notes due 2021; and repay approximately $20 million in borrowings outstanding under our second lien credit facility.
Competitive Strengths
 
We believe our competitive strengths include the following:
 
Large, Leading Brands with Significant Scale
 
We have built a portfolio of leading brands with significant scale that are well recognized by consumers, retailers, and wholesalers. Our Stoker’s® and Zig-Zag® brands are each well established and date back 78 and 118 years, respectively. Though the NewGen segment is relatively new within the OTP industry, our 2016 acquisition of VaporBeast added a leading seller of e-liquids, devices, and accessories. In 2017, Stoker’s®, Zig-Zag®, and VaporBeast® together generated approximately $261 million of gross sales, or 84% of our consolidated gross sales. Specifically:
 
 
· | Stoker’s® is the #2 loose leaf chewing tobacco brand and among the fastest growing MST brands in the industry. We manufacture Stoker’s® MST using only 100% American Leaf, utilizing a proprietary process to produce what we believe is a superior product.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Zig-Zag® is the #1 cigarette paper brand in terms of retail dollar sales in the U.S., as measured by Nielsen Convenience, with significant distribution in Canada. Zig-Zag® is also the #1 MYO cigar wrap brand in the U.S.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | VaporBeast is a leading distributor of liquid vapor products to the non-traditional retail channel. Revenue growth at VaporBeast has been delivered through a more effective selling process, which generated increased order sizes and the frequency of customer orders. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



We believe the Stoker’s® brand is seen as an innovator in both the loose leaf chewing tobacco and moist snuff markets. Zig-Zag® is an iconic brand and has strong, enduring brand recognition among a wide audience of consumers.  VaporBeast is a powerful distribution engine that allows us to further penetrate the vaporizer and e-liquids markets via non-traditional retail outlets.
 
Successful Track Record of New Product Launches and Category Expansions
 
We have successfully launched new products and entered new product categories by leveraging the strength of our brands. We methodically target markets which we believe have significant growth potential. We have been successful in entering new product categories by extending existing products and brands in addition to introducing new products:

· | We leveraged the proud legacy and value of the Stoker’s® brand to introduce a 12 oz. MST tub, a product whose size was not offered by any other market participant at the time of introduction. Stoker’s® MST has been among the fastest growing moist snuff brands in the industry in terms of pounds sold. While competitors have introduced larger format tub packaging, the early entry and differentiation of the Stoker’s® product have firmly established us as the market leader with over 50% of the Tub market. In third quarter 2015, we introduced Stoker’s® MST in 1.2 oz. cans to further expand retail penetration, particularly in convenience stores.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

· | In 2009, we extended the Zig-Zag® tobacco brand into the MYO cigar wraps market and captured a 50% market share within the first two years. We are now the market share leader for MYO cigar wraps with a 76% share. We believe our success was driven by the Zig-Zag® tobacco branding, which we feel is widely understood by consumers to represent a favorable, customizable experience ideally suited to MYO products.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | VaporBeast quickly established itself as a leading marketer and distributor of liquid vapor products to the non-traditional retail universe. With its national footprint, VaporBeast is leveraging its regional consumer preference insights to further accelerate sales advances.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



We strategically target product categories that we believe demonstrate significant growth potential and for which the value of our brands is likely to have a meaningful impact.  We believe that our track record and existing portfolio of brands provide growth advantages as we continue to evaluate opportunities to extend our product lines and expand into new categories.
 
Extensive Distribution Network and Data Driven Sales Organization
 
We have taken important steps to enhance our selling and distribution network and consumer marketing capabilities while keeping our capital expense requirements relatively low. We service our customer base with an experienced sales and marketing organization of approximately 145 professionals who possess in-depth knowledge of the tobacco industry. We extensively use data supported by leading technology to enable our salesforce to analyze changing trends and effectively identify evolving consumer preferences at the store level. We subscribe to a sales tracking system provided by MSAi that measures all OTP product shipments by all market participants, on a weekly basis, from approximately 900 wholesalers to over 250,000 retail stores in the U.S. This system enables us to understand share and volume trends across multiple categories at the individual store level, allowing us to allocate field salesforce coverage to the highest opportunity stores, thereby enhancing the value of new store placements and sales activity.  Within our Stoker’s product categories, we have seen a positive correlation between the frequency of store calls by our salesforce and our retail market share. As the initial sales effort is critical to the success of a product launch, we believe our experienced salesforce, expansive distribution network, and leading market analytics put us in a strong position to swiftly execute new product launches in response to evolving consumer and market preferences.
Long-standing, Strong Relationships with an Established Set of Producers
 
As part of our asset-light operating model we built long-standing and extensive relationships with leading, high-quality producers. In 2017, our four most important producers were:
 
 
· | Swedish Match, which manufactures our loose leaf chewing tobacco;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Bolloré, which provides us with exclusive access to the Zig-Zag® cigarette paper and accessories brand for the U.S. and Canada;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Durfort, from which we source our MYO cigar wraps; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------


· | JJA Distributors (“JJA”), from which we source our Zig-Zag branded cigars.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------



By outsourcing the production of products that represent approximately 87% of our gross sales to a select group of producers with whom we have strong relationships, we are able to maintain low overhead costs and minimal capital expenditures, which together drive our margins.
 
Experienced Management Team
 
With an average of 25 years of consumer products experience, including an average of 22 years in the tobacco industry, our senior management team has enabled us to grow and diversify our business while improving operational efficiency. Members of management have previous experience at other leading tobacco companies, including Altria Group, Inc. (formerly Philip Morris); Liggett & Myers Tobacco Company (now Liggett Group, a subsidiary of Vector Group ltd); Swedish Match; American Brands, Inc.; and U.S. Smokeless Tobacco Company (a subsidiary of Altria). Notably, Lawrence Wexler, our President and CEO, brings over 20 years of experience from Altria Group, Inc., where he held various leadership positions within the finance, marketing, planning, manufacturing, and sales departments. Given the professional experience of the senior management team we are able to analyze risks and opportunities from a variety of perspectives. Our senior leadership has embraced a collaborative culture in which the combined experience, analytical rigor, and creativity are leveraged to assess opportunities and deliver products that satisfy consumers’ demands.
Growth Strategies
 
We are focused on building sustainable margin streams, expanding the availability of our products, developing new products through innovation, and enhancing overall operating efficiencies with the goal of improving margins and cash flow. We adopted the following strategies to drive growth in our business and build stockholder value:

Grow Share of Existing Product Lines, Domestically and Internationally
 
We intend to remain a consumer centric organization with an innovative view and understanding of the OTP market. We believe there are meaningful opportunities for growth within the OTP market. We expect to continue to identify unmet consumer needs and provide quality products that we believe will result in genuine consumer satisfaction and foster the growth of revenue. We maintain a robust product pipeline and plan to strategically introduce new products in attractive, growing OTP segments, both domestically and internationally. For example, in addition to our successful launch of Stoker’s® smaller 1.2 oz. MST cans, we believe there are opportunities for new products in the MST pouch, cigar, and MYO cigar wrap markets. Products currently in our pipeline include Zig-Zag® Natural Leaf Wraps and Zig-Zag® Unbleached/Hemp Paper in the Smoking products segment and Primal® Hemp Wraps/Cones, Premium e-liquids, and Vape-not-Burn (“VnB”) devices in the NewGen products segment. We believe we have successfully built strong, powerful brands possessing significant potential.
 
In 2017, less than 5% of our revenues were generated outside of the U.S. Having established a strong infrastructure and negotiated relationships across multiple segments and products, we are pursuing an international growth strategy to broaden sales and strengthen margins. We believe international sales represent a meaningful growth opportunity. Our goals include expanding our presence in the worldwide OTP industry on a targeted basis. For example, we are selling our Stoker’s® MST products in South America, Zig-Zag® cigars in Canada, and Primal® herbal wraps and cones internationally. We intend to pursue a dual path of introducing our own products and brands as well as partnering with other industry leaders to improve market access and profitability in efforts to support our international expansion.
 
Expand into Adjacent Categories through Innovation and New Partnerships
 
We continually evaluate opportunities to expand into adjacent product categories by leveraging our current portfolio or through new partnerships. In 2009, we leveraged the Zig-Zag® tobacco brand and introduced Zig-Zag® MYO cigar wraps with favorable results. We now command the #1 market share position for that segment. We are currently expanding our Zig-Zag® MYO cigar wraps through the expansion of the Zig-Zag® ‘Rillo™ size cigar wraps which are similar in size to machine-made cigarillos, the most popular and rapidly growing cigar type. Additionally, in 2015, we negotiated the worldwide, exclusive distribution rights to an herbal sheet material that does not contain tobacco or nicotine, affording us the opportunity to sell, on a global basis, an assortment of products that meet new and emerging consumer preferences. These products are sold under our Primal® brand name and are a component of our NewGen product segment. We intend to continue to identify new adjacent categories for which we are able to leverage our existing brands and partnerships.
 
Continue to Grow a Strong NewGen Platform
 
The OTP category is continually evolving as consumers actively seek out new products and product forms. Given this market demand, we have developed a NewGen product platform which we believe will serve new and evolving consumer demands across multiple product categories. Core products within our existing NewGen segment include:
 
 
· | Electronic cigarette (“e-cigarette”) and vapor products, including e-liquids,
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Tobacco vaporizers, which heat rather than combust the smoking material (VnB), and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Herbal smoking products, which contain no tobacco or nicotine.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------



Among these categories, we believe the emerging liquid vapor segment may present the greatest growth opportunity as it allows each consumer to customize his or her experience by being able to choose both flavor and nicotine level. Although the liquid vapor segment is in its infancy, we believe that, when properly commercialized, it may be highly disruptive to the combustible cigarette industry and emerge as a more significant segment of the OTP market. We believe a majority of current liquid vapor revenues are earned outside of the traditional retail environment through online sales or in non-traditional retail outlets. Our recent acquisitions of VaporBeast and Vapor Shark accelerate our expansion into the non-traditional retail outlets for liquid vapor products.
 Outside of the tobacco space, we believe there are meaningful opportunities for herbal smoking products like wraps and cones. To capitalize on these opportunities, we have obtained the exclusive rights to a proprietary and patented herbal sheet process that enables us to meet consumer interest and achieve strong margins. These products are marketed and sold on a worldwide basis under our Primal™ brand as discussed above.
 
We believe the categories within our NewGen segment are poised to be the key industry growth drivers in the future, and we are well-positioned to capitalize on this growth. We intend to continue to pursue growth of our NewGen product platform by offering unique and innovative products to address evolving consumer demands.

Strategically Pursue Acquisitions
 
We believe there are meaningful acquisition opportunities in the fragmented OTP space. We regularly evaluate acquisition opportunities across the OTP landscape. In evaluating acquisition opportunities, our focus is on identifying acquisitions that strengthen our current distribution platform and product offerings or enable category expansion in areas with high potential growth.
 
Substantially all of our 2017 U.S. gross margin was derived from sales of products currently regulated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) Center for Tobacco Products. We have significant experience in complying with the FDA regulatory regime with a compliance infrastructure composed of legal and scientific professionals. We believe many smaller OTP manufacturers currently lack this infrastructure, which we believe is necessary to comply with the broad scope of FDA regulations. We believe our regulatory compliance infrastructure, combined with our skilled management and strong distribution platform, position us to act as a consolidator within the OTP industry.
 
We have a strong track record of enhancing our OTP business with strategic and accretive acquisitions. For example, our acquisition of the North American Zig-Zag® cigarette papers distribution rights in 1997 has made us the #1 premium cigarette paper brand in the U.S. in terms of retail dollar sales, as measured by Nielsen. Perhaps more importantly, we own the Zig-Zag® tobacco trademark in the U.S. and have leveraged this asset effectively with approximately 52% of our total 2017 Zig-Zag branded gross sales under our own Zig-Zag® marks rather than those we license from Bolloré. In 2003, we acquired the Stoker’s® brand. We have since built the brand to a strong #2 position in the chewing tobacco industry while successfully leveraging the brand’s value through our MST expansion where it remains among the fastest growing MST brands in the industry. More recently, we have completed three acquisitions to acquire the five smokeless tobacco brands from Wind River in addition to VaporBeast and Vapor Shark.
 
We will continue to evaluate acquisition opportunities as they may arise while exercising care and diligence to ensure we only pursue opportunities believed to afford operational or distribution synergies and add value.
 
Maintain Lean, Low-Cost Operating Model
 
We have a lean, asset-light manufacturing and sourcing model which requires low capital expenditures and utilizes outsourced supplier relationships. We believe our asset-light model provides marketplace flexibility and allows us to achieve favorable margins. Our market analytics allow us to efficiently and effectively address evolving consumer and market demands. Our supplier relationships allow us to increase the breadth of our product offerings and quickly enter new OTP markets as management is able to focus on brand building and innovation. We intend to continue to optimize our asset-light operating model as we grow in order to maintain a low cost of operations and healthy margins. In 2017, approximately $268 million of our gross sales, or 87%, were from outsourced production operations. Our capital expenditures have ranged between $0.7 million and $3.2 million per year over the previous 5 years. We do not intend to outsource our MST production as a result of our proprietary manufacturing processes which are substantively different than those of our competitors.
Raw Materials, Product Supply, and Inventory Management
 
We source our products through a series of longstanding, highly-valued relationships which allow us to conduct our business on an asset-light, distribution-focused basis.
 
The components of inventories at December 31, 2017 and 2016, were as follows (in thousands):

 | $ | 63,296 | | | $ | 62,185 | 

Smokeless Products
 
Our loose leaf chewing and moist snuff tobaccos are produced from air-cured and fire-cured leaf tobacco, respectively. We utilize recognized suppliers that generally maintain 12- to 24-month supplies of our various types of tobacco at their facilities. We do not believe we are dependent on any single country or supplier source for tobacco. We generally maintain up to a two-month supply of finished, loose leaf chewing tobacco and moist snuff. This supply is maintained at our Louisville, Kentucky, facility and in two regional public warehouses to facilitate distribution.
 
 8
 

We also utilize a variety of suppliers for the sourcing of additives used in our smokeless products and for the supply of our packaging materials. Thus, we believe we are not dependent on a single supplier for these products. There are no current U.S. federal regulations that restrict tobacco flavor additives in smokeless products. The additives that we use are food-grade, generally accepted ingredients.
 
All of our loose leaf chewing tobacco production is fulfilled through our agreement with Swedish Match. See the “Distribution and Supply Agreements” section for our discussion of the Swedish Match Manufacturing Agreement. All of our moist snuff products are manufactured at our facility in Dresden, Tennessee. Packaging occurs at the Dresden, Tennessee, location in addition to the facility in Louisville, Kentucky.
 
Smoking Products
 
Pursuant to our distribution agreements with Bolloré (discussed in more detail, below, under the heading “Distribution and Supply Agreements”), we are required to purchase from Bolloré all cigarette papers, cigarette tubes, and cigarette injecting machines that we sell, subject to Bolloré fulfilling its obligations under these distribution agreements. If Bolloré is unable or unwilling to perform its obligations or ceases its cigarette paper manufacturing operations, in each case, as set forth in the Distribution Agreements, we may seek third-party suppliers and continue the use of the Zig-Zag® trademark to market these products. To ensure we have a steady supply of premium cigarette paper products, as well as cigarette tubes and injectors, Bolloré is required to maintain, at its expense, a two-month supply of inventory in a bonded, public warehouse in the U.S.
 
We obtain our MYO cigar wraps from the patent holder under our agreement with Durfort in the Dominican Republic. We obtain our Zig-Zag branded cigar products under our agreement with JJA, which sources the cigars on our behalf from the Dominican Republic. We obtain our MYO cigar smoking tobaccos and pipe tobaccos from domestic sources. We generally purchase these tobaccos through multiple sources; thus, we believe we are not dependent on a single supplier. We package these products at our Louisville, Kentucky, facility.
 
NewGen Products
 
We have sourcing relationships that are capable of providing liquid vapor products and tobacco vaporizer products for other companies’ brands and for producing our own branded product lines in the category, including our Zig-Zag® brand. Our acquisitions of VaporBeast and Vapor Shark have (i) accelerated our entry into the non-traditional retail channel, where we believe the majority of liquid vapor products are sold; (ii) provided enhanced distribution of products; and (iii) established a best-in-class distribution platform combining VaporBeast’s non-traditional selling skills with a national, retail salesforce.
 
Our herbal smoking products are obtained from a supplier which owns the patented process for producing the sheet material. We have worldwide, exclusive rights to the material. The production and packaging of our herbal smoking products is subject to an agreement with Durfort. Durfort manufactures and packages the finished goods in the Dominican Republic, subject to our specifications, and coordinates with JJA delivery of the products to our designated distribution center in the U.S. We believe our early entry into the herbal smoking products market has provided us with a meaningful opportunity to capture market share and increase this share as the market grows.
 
Distribution and Supply Agreements
 
Bolloré Distribution and License Agreements
 
We are party to two long-term distribution and license agreements with Bolloré with respect to sales of cigarette papers, cigarette tubes, and cigarette injector machines—one with respect to distribution in the U.S. and one with respect to distribution in Canada (collectively, the “Distribution Agreements”). Under the Distribution Agreements, Bolloré granted us the exclusive right to purchase products bearing the Zig-Zag® brand name from Bolloré for resale in the U.S. and Canada. We have the sole right to determine pricing and other terms upon which we may resell any products purchased from Bolloré, including the right to determine the ultimate distributors of such products within these countries. Furthermore, on March 19, 2013, we entered into an additional License and Distribution Agreement with Bolloré (the “Bolloré License Agreement”), which permits us the exclusive use of the Zig-Zag® brand name in the U.S. for e-cigarettes and any related accessories, including vaporizers and e-liquids. The Bolloré License Agreement terminates upon termination of the Distribution Agreements.

Each of the Distribution Agreements were entered into on November 30, 1992, by a predecessor in interest for an initial twenty-year term. The Distribution Agreements automatically renewed in November 2012 for a second twenty-year term and will automatically renew for successive twenty-year terms unless terminated in accordance with the provisions of such agreement. The Distribution Agreements provide that, in order to assure each of the parties receives commercially reasonable profits in light of inflationary trends and currency fluctuation factors, 120 days prior to December 31, 2004, and each fifth-year anniversary from such date thereafter, the parties are required to enter into good faith negotiations to agree on an index and currency adjustment formula to replace the index and formula currently in effect. If the parties are unable to agree, the dispute is to be submitted to binding arbitration. Pursuant to the Distribution Agreements, if at any time the price received by Bolloré fails to cover its costs, Bolloré may give us notice of this deficiency, and the parties must promptly negotiate in good faith to adjust prices. If the parties cannot agree on new prices, we may purchase products from an alternative supplier reasonably acceptable to Bolloré until the next price adjustment period (subject to certain price-matching rights available to Bolloré and other terms and conditions). As of March 1, 2018, we are operating under a temporary pricing structure and formula. The parties are considering a modified pricing formula and a potential new index and duration; however, there is no guarantee that we will be able to reach a new pricing agreement with Bolloré at all or on terms satisfactory to us. Further, Bolloré sources its needs for our orders from an affiliate of one of our competitors. See “Risk Factors—We depend on a small number of key third-party suppliers and producers for our products” for further details.
 
Pursuant to the Distribution Agreements, export duties, insurance, and shipping costs are the responsibility of Bolloré. Import duties and taxes in the U.S. and Canada are our responsibility. Under the Distribution Agreements, we must purchase cigarette papers, cigarette tubes, and cigarette injector machines from Bolloré, subject to Bolloré fulfilling its obligations under these agreements. Bolloré is required to provide us with the quantities of the products that we order consistent with specific order-to-delivery timelines detailed in the agreement. The Distribution Agreements provide us with certain safeguards to ensure that we will be able to secure a steady supply of product, including (i) granting us the right to seek third-party suppliers with continued use of the Zig-Zag® trademark if Bolloré is unable to perform its obligations or ceases its cigarette paper manufacturing operation, in each case as set forth in the Distribution Agreements, and (ii) maintaining a two-month supply of safety stock inventory of the premium papers, tubes, and injector machines in the U.S. at Bolloré’s expense.
 
Under the Distribution Agreements, we have agreed that for a period of five years after the termination of the agreements we will not engage, directly or indirectly, in the manufacturing, selling, distributing, marketing, or otherwise promoting, in the U.S. and Canada, of cigarette paper or cigarette paper booklets of a competitor without Bolloré’s consent, except for certain de minimis acquisitions of debt or equity securities of such a competitor and certain activities with respect to an alternative supplier used by us as permitted under the Distribution Agreements.
 
Each of the Distribution Agreements permits Bolloré to terminate such agreement (i) if certain minimum purchases (which, in the case of both Distribution Agreements, have been significantly exceeded in recent years) of cigarette paper booklets have not been made by us for resale in the jurisdiction covered by such agreement within a calendar year, (ii) if we assign such agreement without the consent of Bolloré, (iii) upon a change of control without the consent of Bolloré, (iv) upon certain acquisitions of our equity securities by one of our competitors or certain investments by our significant stockholders in one of our competitors, (v) upon certain material breaches, including our agreement not to promote, directly or indirectly, cigarette paper or cigarette paper booklets of a competitor, or (vi) upon our bankruptcy, insolvency, liquidation, or other similar event. Additionally, the Canada Distribution Agreement is terminable by either us or Bolloré upon the termination of the U.S. Distribution Agreement.
 
Swedish Match Manufacturing Agreement
 
On September 4, 2008, we entered into a manufacturing and distribution agreement with Swedish Match whereby Swedish Match became the exclusive manufacturer of our loose leaf chewing tobacco. Under the agreement, production of our loose leaf chewing tobacco products was completely transitioned to Swedish Match’s plant located in Owensboro, Kentucky, on September 18, 2009. We source all of the tobacco Swedish Match uses to manufacture our products along with certain proprietary flavorings and retain all marketing, design, formula, and trademark rights over our loose leaf products. We also have the right to approve all product modifications and are solely responsible for decisions related to package design and branding of the loose leaf tobacco produced for us. Responsibilities related to process control, manufacturing activities, and inventory management with respect to our loose leaf products are allocated between us and Swedish Match as specified in the agreement. We also have rights to monitor production and quality control processes on an ongoing basis.
 
The agreement had an initial ten-year term and will automatically be renewed for five successive ten-year terms unless either party provides at least 180 days’ notice prior to a renewal term of its intent to terminate the agreement, or unless otherwise terminated by mutual agreement of the parties in accordance with the provisions of the agreement. If a notice of non-renewal is delivered, the contract will expire two years after the date on which the agreement would have otherwise been renewed. The terms allow the agreement to be assumed by a buyer, terminated for uncured material breach, or terminated by us subject to a buyout. We also hold a right of first refusal to acquire the manufacturing plant as well as Swedish Match’s chewing tobacco unit.

JJA Distributors Service Agreement
 
On April 1, 2013 we entered into an agreement with JJA to source our Zig-Zag branded cigars and cigarillos and other products from the Dominican Republic. Under the agreement, JJA and its Dominican Republic partner purchase and inventory all of the necessary raw materials, including packaging bearing our intellectual property, manufacture to our specifications, and deliver to our designated U.S. distribution center. We retain all marketing, design, and trademark rights over our cigar products.
Production and Quality Control
 
We primarily outsource our manufacturing and production processes and focus on packaging, marketing, and distribution. We currently manufacture approximately 13% of our products as measured by gross sales. Our in-house manufacturing operations are limited to (i) the processing and packaging of our pipe tobacco products, which is completed at our manufacturing facility in Louisville, Kentucky, (ii) the manufacturing of our moist snuff products, which occurs at our facility in Dresden, Tennessee, (iii) the packaging of our moist snuff products at our facilities in Dresden, Tennessee, and Louisville, Kentucky, and, with the acquisition of Vapor Shark, (iv) the manufacturing of e-liquids at our Miami, Florida, facility. Our MST products are processed in-house, rather than outsourced, as a result of our proprietary manufacturing processes which are substantively different than those of our competitors.
 
We use proprietary production processes and techniques, including strict quality controls. Our quality control group routinely tests the quality of the tobacco, flavorings, application of flavorings, premium cigarette papers, tubes and injectors, cigars, MYO cigar wraps, liquid vapor products, tobacco vaporizer products, and packaging materials. We utilize sophisticated quality controls to test and closely monitor the quality of our products. The high quality of our tobacco products is largely the result of using high-grade tobacco leaf and food-grade flavorings and, on an ongoing basis, analyzing the tobacco cut, flavorings, and moisture content together with strict specifications for sourced products.
 
Given the importance of contract manufacturing to our business, our quality control group ensures that established, written procedures and standards are adhered to by each of our contract manufacturers. Responsibilities related to process control, manufacturing activities, quality control, and inventory management with respect to our loose leaf are allocated between us and Swedish Match under the manufacturing agreement.
 
Sales and Marketing
 
We have grown the size and capacity of our salesforce and intend to continue strengthening the organization to advance our ability to deepen and broaden the retail availability of our products and brands.
 
As of December 31, 2017, we had a nationwide sales and marketing organization of approximately 145 professionals. Our sales and marketing group focuses on priority markets and sales channels and seeks to operate with a high level of efficiency. In 2017, our sales and marketing efforts enabled our products to reach an estimated 200,000 retail doors in North America and over 800 direct wholesale customers with an additional 100 secondary, indirect wholesalers in the U.S.
 
Our sales efforts are focused on wholesale distributors and retail merchants in the independent and chain convenience store, tobacco outlet, food store, mass merchandising, drug store, and non-traditional retail channels. We have expanded, and intend to continue to expand, the sales of our products into previously underdeveloped geographic markets and retail channels. In 2017, we derived more than 95% of our net sales from sales in the U.S., with the remainder primarily from sales in Canada.
 
We subscribe to a sales tracking system from MSAi that records all traditional OTP product shipments (ours as well as those of our competitors) from approximately 900 wholesalers to over 250,000 retail stores in the U.S. This system enables us to understand individual product share and volume trends across multiple categories down to the individual retail store level, allowing us to allocate field salesforce coverage to the highest opportunity stores. Additionally, the ability to select from a range of parameters and to achieve this level of granularity means we can analyze marketplace trends in a timely manner and swiftly evolve our business planning to meet market opportunities.
 
We employ marketing activities to grow awareness, trial, and sales including selective trade advertising to expand wholesale availability, point-of-sale advertising and merchandising and permanent and temporary displays to improve consumer visibility, and social media. We comply with all regulations relating to the marketing of tobacco products, such as directing marketing efforts to adult consumers, and are committed to full legal compliance in the sales and marketing of our products. To date, we have neither relied upon, nor conducted, any substantial advertising in the consumer media for our products.
 
In the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, we did not have any customer that accounted for 10% or more of our gross sales. Our customers use an open purchase order system to buy our products and are not obligated to do so pursuant to ongoing contractual obligations. We perform periodic credit evaluations of our customers and generally do not require collateral on trade receivables. Historically, we have not experienced material credit losses. Sales to customers within our NewGen segment are generally prepaid.

Competition
 
Many of our competitors are better capitalized than we are and have greater resources, financial and otherwise. We believe our ability to effectively compete and strong market positions in our principal product lines are due to the high recognition of our brand names, the perceived quality of each of our products, and the efforts of our sales, marketing, and distribution teams. We compete against “big tobacco,” including Altria Group, Inc. (formerly Philip Morris); British American Tobacco p.l.c. (formerly Reynolds); Swedish Match; Swisher International; and manufacturers including U.K. based Imperial Brands, PLC, across our segments. “Big tobacco” has substantial resources and a customer base that has historically demonstrated loyalty to their brands.
 
Competition in the OTP market is based upon not only brand quality and positioning but also on price, packaging, promotion, and retail availability and visibility. Given the decreasing prevalence of cigarette consumption, the “big tobacco” companies continue to demonstrate an increased interest and participation in a number of OTP markets.
 
Smokeless Products
 
Our three principal competitors in the loose leaf chewing tobacco market are Swedish Match, the American Snuff Company, LLC (a unit of British American Tobacco p.l.c.), and Swisher International Group, Inc. We believe moist snuff products are used interchangeably with loose leaf products by many consumers. In the moist snuff category, we face the same competitors with the addition of U.S. Smokeless Tobacco Company (a division of Altria Group, Inc.).
Smoking Products
 
Our two major competitors for premium cigarette paper sales are Republic Tobacco, L.P., and Commonwealth Brands, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Imperial Brands, PLC. Our two major competitors for MYO cigar wraps are New Image Global, Inc., and Blunt Wrap USA. In cigars, we compete in the non-tipped cigarillo market with Swisher International, Inc., Swedish Match, and Good Times USA.
 
NewGen Products
 
In the NewGen products segment, our competitors are varied as the market is relatively new and highly fragmented. Our direct competitors sell products that are substantially similar to our products through the same channels in which we sell our liquid vapor products and tobacco vaporizer products. We compete with these direct competitors for sales through wholesalers and retailers including, but not limited to, vapor stores, national chain stores, tobacco shops, and convenience stores. Through our acquisitions of VaporBeast and Vapor Shark, we now also compete directly with other non-traditional distributors and retailers.

Research and Development and Quality Assurance
 
We have a research and development and quality assurance function that tests raw materials and finished products in order to maintain a high level of product quality and consistency. Research and development largely bases its new product development efforts on our high-tech data systems. We spent approximately $1.9 million, $1.8 million, and $1.4 million dollars on research and development and quality control efforts for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively.
Employees
 
As of March 1, 2018, we employed 289 full-time employees. None of our employees are represented by unions. We believe we have a positive relationship with our employees.
