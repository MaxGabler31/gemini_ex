Item 1. Business
Overview
Pulse Biosciences, Inc. is a novel bioelectric medicine company committed to health innovation using an entirely new and proprietary energy modality. The Company’s CellFX® System is the first commercial product to harness the distinctive advantages of the Company’s proprietary Nano-Pulse Stimulation™ (“NPS”) technology. The CellFX System delivers nanosecond duration pulses of electrical energy, each less than a millionth of a second long, to non-thermally clear targeted cells while sparing adjacent non-cellular tissue, to treat a variety of medical conditions for which an optimal solution remains unfulfilled. 
The CellFX® System

We have begun commercializing our proprietary CellFX System into the large and growing dermatology procedure market as our first commercial market. Powered by NPS technology, the CellFX System delivers nano second duration pulses of electrical energy to non-thermally clear targeted cells while sparing adjacent non-cellular tissue. This non-thermal specificity for cellular targets is a significant differentiator for the CellFX System compared to other energy devices used in dermatology and other medical specialties, such as radiofrequency ablation. The Company has validated the cell-specific effects of NPS technology with a series of completed and ongoing clinical studies of cellular lesions, which are skin conditions characterized by abnormal or undesired cellular structures located on, or in, the non-cellular dermal collagen.




In February 2021, the Company received 510(k) clearance from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”) for the CellFX System for dermatologic procedures requiring ablation and resurfacing of the skin. In January 2021, the Company received Conformité Européene (“CE”) marking approval for the CellFX System, which allows for marketing of the system in the European Union (“EU”); in June 2021, the Company received Health Canada approval for the CellFX System, which allows for marketing of the system in Canada; and in November 2021, the Company received approval for the CellFX System from the Therapeutic Goods Administration (“TGA”), and from the New Zealand Medicines and Medical Devices Safety Authority (“Medsafe”) which allows for marketing of the system in Australia and New Zealand. The CE mark, Health Canada, TGA, and Medsafe approvals allow for use of the CellFX System in dermatological procedures requiring ablation and resurfacing of the skin for the reduction, removal, and/or clearance of cellular-based benign lesions, including Sebaceous Hyperplasia (“SH”), Seborrheic Keratosis (“SK”), and cutaneous non-genital warts.

The CellFX System is a tunable, software-enabled, console-based platform, designed to accommodate the clinical workflow preferred by physicians. The CellFX System currently includes a multi-use handpiece and a suite of single-patient use treatment tips ranging from 1.5mm2 to 10mm2, enabling treatment of a variety of lesion sizes and depths. The treatment tips wirelessly connect to the CellFX System when plugged into the handpiece, allowing for the use of automated treatment settings based on the treatment tip used.

We have also designed an integrated cloud software infrastructure called CellFX CloudConnect™ to enable our innovative utilization-based business model to help align the interests of patients, practices, and the Company. CellFX CloudConnect makes possible the wireless connectivity between the physician’s CellFX System, our e-commerce customer portal (“CellFX Marketplace”), practice management tools to track utilization data and other metrics, and our internal customer relationship management and enterprise resource planning software systems. CellFX CloudConnect also facilitates direct connectivity to the CellFX System to enable remote software updates, service, and maintenance functions. Because of this ability to streamline, be responsive, and reduce disruption to the clinician workflow, CellFX CloudConnect allows us to provide active high-touch support.

Our Proprietary Nano-Pulse Stimulation Technology Platform

Our proprietary CellFX System leverages our patented NPS technology platform. NPS technology is characterized by nanosecond duration pulses of electrical energy, each less than a millionth of a second long. When applied to targeted tissue, our NPS technology sends energy pulses to cells in order to alter the function of the internal cellular organelles, including the mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum, without disrupting extracellular tissue. We believe this leads to regulated cell death, a process exhibited naturally by cells in the human body when they undergo stress and are unable to restore cellular homeostasis. 

The CellFX System is designed to function on the basis of a unique non-thermal mechanism of action that likely results in a biophysical disruption brought about by the tunable speed and amplitude of our NPS pulses interacting with the physical structure of cells. While the CellFX System delivers pulses that directly affect the internal organelles of cells, these pulses do not have significant functional effect on non-cellular tissue, such as collagen, a protein that forms the structural foundation of the skin. In short, with our proprietary CellFX System, we can deliver a cell-focused effect that we believe leads to regulated cell death while preserving surrounding non-cellular tissue, a combination that may potentially lead to highly differentiated treatment applications.

Our Strategy

Our objective is to advance our NPS technology platform into medical specialty areas where an optimal solution remains unfulfilled. We are in the business of commercializing novel, proprietary, and differentiated products that have the potential to significantly improve patient outcomes in the markets we serve, as well as those we intend to serve in the future. To achieve this plan, we intend to: 

Demonstrate the unique benefits of our proprietary CellFX System and its unique non-thermal mechanism of action across a number of compelling applications:

oThe first introduction of the CellFX System focuses on serving dermatologists and other skin specialists as a new modality to address common benign skin conditions that are cellular in nature and often difficult to treat. We have conducted, and will continue to conduct, numerous clinical studies, including studies in SK, the most common benign raised pigmented lesion; SH, small skin-colored bumps, often oily in appearance and can appear in clusters; cutaneous non-genital warts; and back acne.
‎




Continue commercialization efforts of our proprietary CellFX System and applications for its use across clinical indications already cleared or approved:

oIn January 2021, the Company received CE marking approval for the CellFX System, which allows for marketing of the system in the European Union and, in June 2021, the Company received Health Canada approval for the CellFX System, which allows for marketing of the system in Canada. The CE mark and Health Canada approvals allow for indication of use of the CellFX System in dermatological procedures requiring ablation and resurfacing of the skin for the reduction, removal, and/or clearance of cellular-based benign lesions, including SH, SK, and cutaneous non-genital warts.
oIn February 2021, we received 510(k) clearance from the FDA for the CellFX System for general dermatologic procedures requiring ablation and resurfacing of the skin.
oIn November 2021, we received approval from Medsafe in Australia for indication of use of the CellFX System in dermatological procedures requiring ablation and resurfacing of the skin for the reduction, removal, and/or clearance of cellular-based benign lesions, including SH, SK, and cutaneous non-genital warts. 
oIn November 2021, we received approval from the TGA in Australia for indication of use of the CellFX System in dermatological procedures requiring ablation and resurfacing of the skin for the reduction, removal, and/or clearance of cellular-based benign lesions, including SH, SK, and cutaneous non-genital warts.
oIn December 2021, we received approval from the Health Sciences Authority in Singapore for indication of the CellFX System in dermatological procedures requiring ablation and resurfacing of the skin for the reduction, removal, and/or clearance of cellular-based benign lesions, such as non-genital cutaneous warts and plantar warts.

Continue with our Controlled Launch and build a foundation of clinical and commercial advocacy among this group of clinics to propel the first wave of early adopters:

oIn February 2021, we initiated controlled launch programs in the United States and the European Union and in June 2021 we initiated a controlled launch program in Canada (collectively, our “Controlled Launch”). We expect our Controlled Launch participants will influence the first wave of early adopters when it comes to their CellFX purchase decisions and integrating the CellFX into a successful aesthetic dermatology practice. 
oIn the fourth quarter of 2021, we completed the first two commercial sales of the CellFX System.
oAs of December 31, 2021, we onboarded a total of seventy CellFX Controlled Launch Program participants across the U.S., Europe, and Canada, completing program enrollment. As of December 31, 2021, twenty-nine Controlled Launch Program participants opted to purchase their CellFX System and six clinics opted out of the program. 

Expand utilization of the CellFX System with new applications and procedure optimization:

oThe sale of each CellFX System and the sale of cycle units required to operate the CellFX System are both revenue-generating events. The treatment of each lesion requires cycle units which the treating physicians will need to periodically replenish, creating additional revenue-generating events. Providing additional evidence and/or regulatory clearances for new clinical conditions is expected to increase the potential for physicians to increase their procedure volumes and associated procedure fees, which in turn should increase the number of cycle units purchased for the existing installed base and increase the likelihood that additional physicians will purchase a CellFX System based on its expanded utility and revenue-generating potential within their practice.
oWe expect to continue to conduct clinical studies and make regulatory submissions on an ongoing basis to broaden the approved uses of the CellFX System. Specific indication labeling will allow the Company to provide educational and promotional materials to our physician customers to enable them to promote specific applications to their patients. Based on the local regulations of each geographic market, the Company may also engage in cooperative marketing and advertising, under appropriate circumstances.
‎




oIn December 2021, upon completion of all treatments in an investigational device exemption (“IDE”) pivotal comparison study to evaluate the treatment of SH using the CellFX System, we submitted a 510(k) to add the treatment of SH to the CellFX System’s indications for use in the United States. In February 2022, we received an Additional Information (“AI”) letter from the FDA in response to the 510(k) submitted. In the AI letter, the FDA stated it did not believe the Company provided sufficient clinical evidence at this time to support the expanded indication for use, and that the Company had not met the primary endpoints of the SH IDE study. The Company anticipates meeting with the FDA to discuss the contents of the AI letter and potential next steps, which may require additional clinical data and potentially a new 510(k) submission.

Leverage the CellFX branding of cellular mechanism to drive expansion in dermatology and set the stage for future applications beyond dermatology:

oWhile we are prioritizing cash-pay applications in the immediate term, the Company intends to invest in continued research with non-melanoma skin cancer and other medical applications to expand users and usage. This includes evaluating reimbursement strategies and options for selected applications.
oThe significant investments in scientific and clinical programs in dermatology we have made over the last several years have given us unique insights and a deeper understanding of our cell-based, tissue-sparing platform technology that should inform and accelerate the use of NPS in other application areas within and outside of dermatology. This includes early pre-clinical work in areas such as otolaryngology, cardiology, and oncology.

Aesthetic Dermatology Procedure Market

We believe the CellFX System has the potential to offer improved clinical outcomes for a broad range of dermatologic conditions and aesthetic skin applications for which targeted clearance of cellular lesions or structures is medically or cosmetically desirable. Current dermatology procedures to remove lesions or undesired skin tissue typically involve either excision (e.g., surgery), the use of heat (e.g., lasers or radiofrequency energy), or the use of cold (e.g., cryoablation). The latter-mentioned thermal methods of tissue destruction affect both cellular and non-cellular tissue components indiscriminately, which can lead to collateral damage of the dermal foundation in the skin.

Based on the ability of our NPS mechanism to clear cellular structures while sparing the structural foundation of the skin, we believe there is a significant opportunity for the CellFX System in the growing aesthetic and medical dermatology market. In the United States, according to the 2019 Survey on Dermatologic Procedures by the American Society for Dermatologic Surgery (“ASDS”), dermatologists performed nearly 14 million cosmetic and medically-necessary procedures, with 4.1 million cosmetic procedures performed using energy-based devices – an 18% increase from 2018 and a 106% increase from 2012. ASDS has also reported that consumers ranked their dermatologist as the #1 influencer of skin procedure decisions. We have worked closely with top KOLs in the aesthetic and medical dermatology field to identify those procedures and skin conditions in which the CellFX System and its unique NPS mechanism of action would offer a high value proposition.

Regarding prevalence of our intended initial dermatologic applications (SH, SK, and cutaneous non-genital warts), based on third-party surveys conducted among aesthetic physicians, an average of 200 patients per month in both the United States and the European Union who visit aesthetic dermatology practices present with each of our initial dermatologic applications. Further, these surveys reported that patients place greater value on lesion removal procedures over other popular aesthetic procedures they currently receive and are willing to pay cash to treat multiple lesions in a single visit.

Initial Aesthetic Dermatology Applications

Sebaceous Hyperplasia

SH is a common benign condition of sebaceous glands in adults of middle age or older. SH occurs when the sebaceous glands become enlarged, creating small, shiny, yellowish lesions or bumps, usually 2-4 millimeters in diameter and typically on the face. In a 2019 marketing study conducted with U.S. dermatologists (n=304), physicians reported seeing on average 42 patients per week with SH, with 65% left untreated due to the lack of desirable outcomes with traditional treatment methods (e.g., electrocautery). 




Results from our clinical trials have demonstrated that NPS has a unique ability to clear cellular structures located within the dermis of the skin, such as enlarged sebaceous glands that cause SH, without damaging the dermal foundation, making it a potentially unique and highly effective treatment modality for SH lesions and similar targets residing deeper within the dermis of the skin. 

In our multi-center clinical studies to date, we have treated more than 1,000 SH lesions in more than 260 patients. As studies are ongoing, results to date indicate that NPS technology is effective for the treatment of SH. Over 80% of treated SH lesions were rated clear or mostly clear by investigators at the 60-day post treatment follow-up evaluation. In our latest study in which we evaluated whether the use of lower energy settings would maintain efficacy, results demonstrated that lower NPS energy levels maintained high efficacy while improving overall cosmetic effects, as well as higher patient satisfaction, compared to our first studies. 

In January 2021, we completed all treatments in an IDE pivotal study to compare the safety and efficacy of the CellFX System to a comparator group, Electrodessication for the treatment of SH lesions. In December 2021, we submitted a 510(k) to add the treatment of SH to the CellFX System’s indications for use in the United States. In February 2022, we received an AI letter from the FDA in response to the 510(k) submitted. In the AI letter, the FDA stated it did not believe the Company provided sufficient clinical evidence at this time to support the expanded indication for use, and that the Company had not met the primary endpoints of the SH IDE study. The Company anticipates meeting with the FDA to discuss the contents of the AI letter and potential next steps, which may require additional clinical data and potentially a new 510(k) submission. 

Notwithstanding the AI letter and the FDA’s preliminary assessment, we believe that the successful treatment of SH lesions reflects a valuable commercial opportunity for the CellFX System in an area of unmet need and substantiates the unique ability of NPS pulses to penetrate the dermis and clear deeper cellular structures without damaging the surrounding dermis. In Europe, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand, the CellFX System is approved for the treatment of sebaceous hyperplasia, seborrheic keratosis and non-genital warts.

Seborrheic Keratosis

SK is one of the most common non-cancerous skin growths in older adults. SK usually appear as a brown, black, or light tan growth on the face, chest, shoulders, or back and has a waxy, scaly, slightly elevated appearance. SK are normally painless, and patients often seek to have them removed if they become irritated by clothing or for cosmetic reasons. Based on 2019 marketing research, dermatologists in the United States report seeing 84 patients with SK each week, with 52% left untreated despite having available treatment options (e.g., cryosurgery).

During 2017 and 2018 we conducted a multi-center clinical study evaluating the safety and efficacy of NPS technology for the treatment of SK. Results from our clinical study, including 58 patients and 174 treated SK lesions, indicate that a single NPS treatment is effective for the treatment of SK. Eighty-two percent (82%) of treated SK lesions were rated clear or mostly clear by investigators at the 106-day post treatment follow-up evaluation. Patients in the study rated 78% of treatment outcomes as satisfied or mostly satisfied.

Cutaneous, Non-Genital Warts

Non-genital warts are an extremely common benign skin disease caused by infection of epidermal cells with the human papillomavirus (“HPV”), resulting in cell proliferation and a thickened, warty papule on the skin. Common warts are most often seen on the hands and present as skin-colored papules with a rough scaly surface. Flat warts are most often seen on the backs of the hands and on the legs. They appear as slightly elevated small plaques that are skin-colored or light brown. Plantar warts occur on the soles of the feet and look like very thick callouses. 

During 2020, we initiated a 62-patient, multi-center, clinical, pivotal study evaluating the safety and efficacy of the CellFX System for the treatment of non-genital cutaneous warts. Results from this study showed favorable outcomes of up to 75% clearance rate for warts on the hands, leg, knee, and neck, with rapid skin recovery and a low rate of residual skin effects. During 2021 we completed enrollment of 150 patients in an IDE pivotal comparison study to assess the treatment of cutaneous non-genital warts using the CellFX System. We are currently analyzing the study data and are anticipating a 510(k) submission during the second quarter of 2022.

Future Dermatology Application Feasibility Studies

We expect to conduct clinical studies on an ongoing basis to continue to evaluate clinical opportunities for, and demonstrate the value of, the CellFX System across a growing list of valuable indications, including: 

Basal Cell Carcinoma

During 2021 we completed enrollment of 30 patients as part of an FDA Investigational Device Exemption (“IDE”) feasibility study to assess the treatment of Basal Cell Carcinoma (“BCC") using the CellFX System. BCC is the most frequently occurring form of cancer in the US, with an estimated 3.6 million diagnosed cases every year, according to the Skin Cancer Foundation. The current treatment of BCC is wide margin surgical excision, which can result in undesirable scarring. We believe that NPS technology and the CellFX System can be used to treat smaller BCC lesions with improved outcomes in cosmetically sensitive areas, such as on the face, and we believe that this new application would be beneficial to a large number of patients.

The objective of the feasibility study is to demonstrate that the CellFX System can safely be used to eliminate BCC lesions with a potentially superior cosmetic outcome when compared to wide margin excision. During the study, BCC lesions are treated with the CellFX System and approximately 60 days following the treatment, the treatment area is examined for the cosmetic outcome. The lesion is then be excised using the current standard of care wide margin excision procedure and analyzed by the study pathologist to determine whether there are any remaining basal cells present in the treatment area. This study has been completely enrolled and the data is being analyzed.

Dermatofibroma

Dermatofibroma are small, benign lesions typically found on the extremities, especially the lower legs. These persistent and sometimes painful growths are fairly common, with dermatologists reporting seeing as many as 30 patients presenting with them per week. However, the current treatment rate is low, due primarily to the lack of available treatments. The current standard of care, surgical excision, is used infrequently because it typically results in undesirable scaring. There are currently no energy-based devices that are regularly used to treat dermatofibroma and for this reason we believe this could potentially be a large market opportunity and a viable CellFX procedure performed with the currently available treatment tips.
Safety Profile of Our NPS Technology Platform

During the course of conducting human clinical studies in dermatology with the NPS platform to support an FDA filing at leading dermatology research centers across the United States, no serious adverse events have been reported and patient tolerance to the procedure has been high. A histological study of treated human tissue examined by experts in dermatopathology revealed a unique and consistent cell-specific non-thermal mechanism of action and a predictable healing response that spared non-cellular dermal tissue across a wide range of skin types and patient demographics.
Commercialization Strategy

To launch the CellFX System, we selected approximately 70 centers across the United States, Canada and the European Union to be the first physicians to receive the system in their respective markets and geographies through our Controlled Launch program. An objective of our ongoing Controlled Launch program has been to turn participating clinics into high utilization commercial customers that will serve as important reference clinics for future commercial customers. We initially expected clinics to complete the program requirements within three to five months. However, the average time for clinics that have completed the Controlled Launch program has been seven months. We continue to gain valuable information from the Controlled Launch process. While the real-world delivery of NPS technology through the CellFX System has proven to clear benign lesions in clinical studies, we have learned that the market development for benign lesions and the integration of this procedure into the practice workflow will require a higher touch model to generate the system utilization we are expecting. We now expect clinics to continue to move through the program throughout 2022, as they complete the program requirements. 

We have deployed a sales and marketing team comprised of professionals with experience in delivering products and applications into the dermatology market and have long-standing relationships with the KOLs, clinics, and customers in this market. The field sales team has been converting Controlled Launch participants to purchases, as well as engaging in direct commercial sales of the CellFX System. 




Controlled Launch participants that have opted to purchase the CellFX System for commercial use have performed CellFX procedures since becoming commercial users and, in the aggregate, have increased the number of treatment sessions per month. Currently, our commercial clinics are averaging ten patient treatment sessions per month with their CellFX System. Our goal for the end of 2022 is to increase utilization to forty patient treatment sessions per month at our current commercial clinics. To drive this increased utilization and emphasis on education, training and marketing at our current accounts, we have implemented changes to our commercial leadership, restructured our commercial field organization and modified our strategy in support of our utilization focus and reduced emphasis on new system sales in the near-term. In February 2022, we appointed Kevin Danahy as Chief Commercial Officer. Mr. Danahy has a proven track record of building exceptional commercial teams and implementing strategies to drive market penetration and significant growth with disruptive medical technologies across a variety of medical disciplines. Under Mr. Danahy’s leadership, the near-term focus of our commercial team’s efforts will be to increase utilization at our commercial clinics.

Potential of Nano-Pulse Stimulation Technology Beyond Dermatology

We continue to invest in and investigate potential uses for our NPS technology outside of dermatology, and one of our directors, Mitch Levinson, joined the Company as our Chief Strategy Officer in August 2021 to lead these efforts. Mr. Levinson has over 30 years of experience developing and launching novel medical device technologies across multiple medical disciplines, including dermatology, wound care, surgery, diagnostics, patient monitoring, and digital health.

Some early research initiatives outside of dermatology have been encouraging. For example, preclinical data was recently presented on the use of NPS technology in the field of gastroenterology by Dr. Robert Ganz at the Annual Meeting of the American Foregut Society. Dr. Ganz is a key opinion leader in this field and one of the foremost experts on the treatment of Barrett’s esophagus using ablative technologies. Dr. Ganz’s presentation, entitled “Nano-Pulse Stimulation Technology is a Promising New Energy Modality for Barrett’s Esophagus,” showed the successful use of NPS technology in an animal model of Barrett’s Esophagus.

Barrett’s esophagus is a complication of gastroesophageal reflux disease, or GERD, faced by approximately 10% of people with chronic GERD symptoms, in which the tissue lining the esophagus becomes dysplastic or precancerous as a result of the damage caused by the chronic acid reflux. The dysplastic cells are associated with an increased risk of esophageal cancer, and for this reason they are typically removed or destroyed using thermal energy modalities. The porcine study presented by Dr. Ganz demonstrated that the CellFX System using our novel and proprietary esophageal applicator can remove the esophageal epithelium and submucosal glands without causing significant fibrosis or evidence of stricture, which suggests that NPS technology may provide unique safety and efficacy benefits for the treatment of Barrett's esophagus over currently used thermal ablative technologies that can sometimes lead to adverse outcomes such as esophageal stricture, scarring, pain, and retreatment. Importantly, this evidence also demonstrates that the proven mechanism of action of NPS in skin can be applicable to other tissues of similar architecture, such as in the esophagus. 

This early preclinical work represents one of several potential new application areas for the CellFX platform and NPS technology outside of dermatology. However, while we believe there are exciting potential applications across many medical specialties for our NPS platform technology, we remain committed and focused on execution of our commercial launch in dermatology.

Intellectual Property

We maintain a portfolio of intellectual property surrounding our CellFX System and our NPS technology platform. As a medical technology company our current patents and ongoing intellectual property development are, and will continue to be, a priority for our business. We believe our intellectual property is an important competitive advantage for us. We also rely on trade secrets, know-how, continuing technological innovations, and licensing opportunities to further develop, maintain, and strengthen our competitive position. We actively protect our intellectual property through a combination of patent registrations, trademarks, and copyright protections; confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, and other parties; and access control to sensitive information.




We own or have a license to 123 issued patents worldwide and have 105 patent applications pending worldwide, with the earliest expiration of a U.S.-issued licensed patent in 2024 and the latest in 2039. As in the past, we plan to continue to file new patent applications to protect our systems, algorithms, applicators, methods, and designs of our technologies and products as they evolve. Medical technologies such as ours may be utilized in many different applications and incorporate several patentable features, and our strategy will be to always strive to protect our products and technologies with multiple patents directed to the variety of features and applications, in order to establish a strong defense against competitors and such that an expiration of a single patent does not lessen our overall comprehensive coverage. We believe our NPS platform and current CellFX System are protected by several issued patents, as well as pending applications.

Research and Development

Since inception, the majority of our business has focused on the development of the CellFX System and earlier clinical versions of the system, conducting clinical studies, including dermatology studies in SK, SH, warts, acne, moles (nevi), syringoma, and BCC, and pre-clinical and basic research into the unique mechanism of action of our NPS technology platform.

In 2022, we have the following planned clinical studies:
US: dermatofibroma and BCC
Europe: dermatofibroma, moles (nevi), actinic keratosis, and BCC
Canada: plantar warts 

The development of our proprietary CellFX System has involved a multi-disciplinary effort including; electrical, mechanical, biomedical, and software engineers to design and integrate the various elements of the CellFX System and its predecessors; clinical research specialists to plan and conduct clinical studies; and research scientists to assess and interpret the focal and systemic biological effects of our technology. We believe we can expand the potential of the CellFX System through ongoing innovation and additional clinical studies demonstrating safety and efficacy in additional dermatologic conditions and additional therapeutic areas.

Competition

The applications we intend to target are subject to intense competition from rapidly evolving companies and new scientific discoveries. We compete against well-established incumbent technologies offering products in oncology, dermatology and aesthetics, minimally invasive procedures, and veterinary applications. Given the broad scope of our technology, we face competition ranging from large manufacturers with multiple business lines to small companies with focused products, as well as providers of other medical therapies and therapeutics for conditions that our products are intended to treat. Some of these companies currently have greater financial, technical, research, and/or other resources than we do and have larger and more established manufacturing capabilities and marketing, sales, and support functions. Our future success will depend on our ability to establish and maintain a competitive position in current and future technologies. Our technology is unique and differentiated in that NPS technology can influence many cellular functions depending on the energy applied. When it is used to stimulate primarily regulated cell death, we believe it would be less traumatic to treated tissue and would result in less scarring or collateral damage to surrounding tissues.
Government Regulation

The CellFX System is a medical device subject to extensive and ongoing regulation by the FDA under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and its implementing regulations, as well as other federal and state regulatory bodies in the U.S. The laws and regulations govern, among other things, product design and development, pre-clinical and clinical testing, manufacturing, packaging, labeling, storage, recordkeeping and reporting, clearance or approval, marketing, distribution, promotion, import and export, and post-marketing surveillance. 

The FDA regulates the medical device market to ensure the safety and efficacy of these products. For medical devices that require pre-market review, the FDA allows for three clearance/approval pathways for a medical device to be commercialized: approval via a Pre-market Approval Application (“PMA”), clearance of a 510(k) submission, or submission of a de novo application. The FDA has established three different classes of medical devices, based on the level of risk associated with using a device and consequent degree of regulatory controls needed to govern its safety and efficacy, as well as the appropriate clearance/approval pathway needed to obtain authorization to legally market a medical device in the U.S.




Class I and Class II devices are considered low and moderate risk devices. Most Class I devices are exempt from premarket notification. Most Class II devices require 510(k) clearance from the FDA in order to be marketed in the U.S. A 510(k) Premarket Notification is a premarket submission made to the FDA to demonstrate that the device to be marketed is substantially equivalent to a legally marketed Class II device, or a predicate. Companies making a 510(k) submission must compare their 510(k)-candidate device to a predicate device and establish substantial equivalence to the satisfaction of FDA. A device previously cleared under 510(k) or a device approved through a de novo application can be used as a predicate device for later developed substantially equivalent medical devices. However, establishing substantial equivalence in a 510(k) submission requires the candidate device to have the same intended use and the same technological characteristics as a predicate device. The FDA has a 90-calendar day review goal from the date of receipt of the 510(k) to either authorize or decline commercial distribution of the device, but clearance generally takes longer than 90 days. During the review process, the FDA may also request additional information which extends the review process. If the FDA decides that the product is not substantially equivalent to a predicate device, a clearance will not be granted, and the device cannot be commercialized. If a 510(k) submission is rejected by FDA, the applicant may be required to seek premarket authorization through the de novo pathway or the premarket approval pathway, which are more costly and will generally take longer for FDA approval. 

Medical devices regarded as the highest risk by the FDA are typically designated Class III and generally require the submission of a PMA application for approval. Class III devices generally include life-sustaining, life-supporting, or implantable devices or devices without a known predicate technology already approved by the FDA. A PMA application must be accompanied by substantial data that supports the reasonable safety and efficacy of the device, which includes the provision of pre-clinical, clinical, technical, manufacturing, and labeling information. After the FDA determines the application is sufficiently complete to commence a substantive review, it has 180 days to review the submission, but it can typically take longer (up to several years) as this regulatory body can request additional data, including clinical data or clarifications. The FDA may also impose additional regulatory scrutiny for a PMA, including the institution of an outside advisory committee (panel review) to assess the application or provide recommendations as to whether to approve the device. Although the FDA is not required to follow the recommendation of an advisory panel, it generally does. As part of the review, the FDA will also inspect the manufacturing operations of the Company requesting approval to verify compliance with Quality System regulations.

If a new medical device does not qualify for the 510(k) premarket notification process because no predicate device to which it is substantially equivalent can be identified, the device is automatically classified into Class III. The Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act of 1997 established a new route to market for low to moderate risk medical devices that are automatically placed into Class III due to the absence of a predicate device, called the “Request for Evaluation of Automatic Class III Designation,” or the de novo classification process. This process allows a manufacturer whose novel device is automatically classified into Class III to request down-classification of its medical device into Class I or Class II on the basis that the device presents low or moderate risk, rather than requiring the submission and approval of a PMA. If the manufacturer seeks reclassification into Class II, the manufacturer must include a draft proposal for special controls that are necessary to provide a reasonable assurance of the safety and efficacy of the medical device. The FDA may reject the reclassification petition if it identifies a legally marketed predicate device that would be appropriate for a 510(k) or determines that the device is not low to moderate risk and requires PMA or that general controls would be inadequate to control the risks and special controls cannot be developed.

After a device receives 510(k) clearance or PMA approval, any modification that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a major change in its intended use, will require a new 510(k) clearance or PMA Supplemental approval. The FDA requires each manufacturer to make this determination initially, but the FDA can review any such decision and can disagree with a manufacturer’s determination. If the FDA disagrees with the determination not to seek a new 510(k) clearance or PMA Supplement, the FDA may retroactively require a new 510(k) clearance or PMA Supplements to be submitted. The FDA could also require a manufacturer to cease marketing and distribution and/or recall the modified device until clearance or approval is obtained. Also, in these circumstances, the manufacturer may be subject to significant regulatory fines, penalties, and possible warning letters.

Pervasive and Continuing Regulation

Even after a device is placed on the market with FDA clearance or approval, numerous regulatory requirements continue to apply. These include:

the FDA’s Quality System Regulation (“QSR”) which requires manufacturers, including third-party manufacturers, to follow stringent design, testing, control, documentation, and other quality assurance procedures during all aspects of the manufacturing process;

labeling regulations and FDA and FTC prohibitions against the promotion of products for uncleared, unapproved, or off-label uses;

medical device reporting regulations, which require that manufacturers report to the FDA if their device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if the malfunction were to recur; and

post-market surveillance regulations, which apply when necessary to protect the public health or to provide additional safety and efficacy data for the device.

The FDA has broad post-market and regulatory enforcement powers, and we must comply with the post-market surveillance regulations, including medical device reporting regulations. We are required to report to the FDA information if a device has, or may have, caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or has malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to death or serious injury, if the malfunction of the device or one of our similar devices were to recur. If we fail to report events required to be reported to the FDA within the required timeframes, or at all, the FDA could take enforcement action and impose sanctions against us. Any such adverse event involving our products also could result in future voluntary corrective actions, such as recalls or customer notifications, or agency action, such as inspection or enforcement action. Any corrective action, whether voluntary or involuntary, as well as defending ourselves in a lawsuit, would require our time and capital, distract management from operating our business, and may harm our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 

We may be subject to unannounced inspections by the FDA and the Food and Drug Branch of the California Department of Public Health to determine our compliance with the QSR and other regulations, and these inspections may include the manufacturing facilities of our suppliers. 

Failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can result in enforcement action by FDA, which may include any of the following sanctions:

warning letters, fines, injunctions, consent decrees, and civil penalties;

repair, replacement, refunds, recall, or seizure of our products;

operating restrictions, partial suspension, or total shutdown of production;

refusing our requests for 510(k) clearance or premarket approval of new products, new intended uses, or modifications to existing products;

withdrawing 510(k) clearance or premarket approval that has already been granted; and

criminal prosecution.

Regulatory System for Medical Devices in Europe

The European Union (the “EU”) consists of 27-member states and has a coordinated system for the authorization of medical devices. Marketing medical devices in the EU is subject to compliance with the Medical Devices Directive 93/92/EEC (MDD) and the European Union Medical Device Regulation (2017/745 or EU MDR) following its entry into application on May 26, 2020. A medical device may be placed on the market within the EU only if it conforms to certain “essential requirements” and bears the CE Mark. The most fundamental and essential requirement is that a medical device must be designed and manufactured in such a way that it will not compromise the clinical condition or safety of patients, or the safety and health of users and others. In addition, the device must achieve the essential performance(s) intended by the manufacturer and be designed, manufactured, and packaged in a suitable manner.




Manufacturers must demonstrate that their devices conform to the relevant essential requirements through a conformity assessment procedure. The nature of the assessment depends upon the classification of the device. The classification rules are mainly based on three criteria: the length of time the device is in contact with the body, the degree of invasiveness, and the extent to which the device affects the anatomy. Conformity assessment procedures for all but the lowest risk classification of device involve a notified body. Notified bodies are often private entities and are authorized or licensed to perform such assessments by government authorities. Manufacturers usually have some flexibility to select a notified body for the conformity assessment procedures for a particular class of device and to reflect their circumstances, e.g., the likelihood that the manufacturer will make frequent modifications to its products. Conformity assessment procedures require an assessment of available clinical evidence, literature data for the product, and post-market experience in respect of similar products already marketed. Notified bodies also may review the manufacturer’s quality systems. If satisfied that the product conforms to the relevant essential requirements, the notified body issues a certificate of conformity, which the manufacturer uses as a basis for its own declaration of conformity and application of the CE Mark. Application of the CE Mark allows the general commercializing of a product in the EU. The product can also be subjected to local registration requirements depending on the country. 

The EU MDR, which repealed and replaced the MDD, entered into force on May 25, 2017 with a transition period extending until May 26, 2021. The EU MDR clearly envisages, among other things, stricter controls of medical devices, including strengthening of the conformity assessment procedures, increased expectations with respect to clinical data for devices, and pre-market regulatory review of high-risk devices. The EU MDR also envisages greater control over notified bodies and their standards, increased transparency, more robust device vigilance requirements, and clarification of the rules for clinical investigations. Under transitional provisions, medical devices with notified body certificates issued under the MDD prior to May 26, 2020, and which have not been significantly changed, may continue to be placed on the market for the remaining validity of the certificate, until May 27, 2024 at the latest. After the expiry of any applicable transitional period, only devices that have been CE marked under the EU MDR may be placed on the market in the EU.

Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act

The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”) impacts the transmission, maintenance, use, and disclosure of certain individually identifiable health information (referred to as protected health information, or “PHI”). Since HIPAA was enacted in 1996, numerous implementing regulations have been issued, including, but not limited to: (1) standards for the privacy of individually identifiable health information (the “Privacy Rule”), (2) standards to protect the confidentiality, integrity and security of electronic protected health information (the “Security Rule”), (3) standards for electronic transactions, (4) a standard unique national provider identifier for providers and health plans, and (5) the HHS Breach Notification Rule. We refer to these rules, as well as similar state laws that may be applicable to our operations, as the HIPAA Rules. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”) has also issued regulations governing the enforcement of the HIPAA Rules, the violation of which potentially includes significant criminal and civil penalties. Furthermore, many states have similar laws and regulations that may be applicable to our operations, including but not limited to state data security breach requirements.

The HIPAA Rules apply to “covered entities”, which includes healthcare providers who conduct certain transactions electronically, including but not limited to the electronic submission of health care claims to an insurance carrier. 

On February 17, 2009, Congress enacted Subtitle D of the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (“HITECH”) provisions of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. This law includes strengthened federal privacy and security provisions to protect PHI, such as the notification requirements set forth in the Breach Notification Rule. On January 25, 2013, the Office for Civil Rights of the HHS published its final rule to modify the HIPAA Privacy, Security, Breach and Enforcement Rules, including most revisions/additions made by the HITECH. The rule became effective on March 23, 2013, and entities and business associates covered by the rule were required to comply with most of the applicable requirements by September 23, 2013. HITECH increased the civil and criminal penalties that may be imposed against Covered Entities, their Business Associates, and possibly other persons, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorney’s fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions.




In addition to the federal privacy regulations, there are a number of state laws regarding the privacy and security of health information and personal data that are applicable to clinical laboratories. The compliance requirements of these laws, including additional breach reporting requirements, and the penalties for violation vary widely and new privacy and security laws and regulations in this area are evolving and may be adopted in the future. We provide services to customers who are regulated entities under HIPAA and the HIPAA Rules, and we have taken steps to comply with health information privacy and security statutes and regulations in all jurisdictions, both state and federal, that apply to us. However, we may not be able to maintain compliance in all jurisdictions where we do business, and even if we are compliant, we may face allegations that we are not. Any actual or alleged failure to maintain compliance, or changes in state or federal laws regarding privacy or security, could result in regulatory investigations, enforcement actions, and civil and/or criminal penalties and could have a material adverse effect on our business.

If we or our operations are found to be in violation of HIPAA, HITECH, or their implementing regulations, we may be subject to penalties, including civil and criminal penalties, fines, and exclusion from participation in U.S. federal or state health care programs, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations. 

Federal, State and Foreign Fraud and Abuse Laws

Because of the significant federal funding involved in Medicare and Medicaid, Congress and the states have enacted, and actively enforce, a number of laws to eliminate fraud and abuse in federal healthcare programs. Our business is subject to compliance with these laws. In March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Healthcare and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act, which we refer to collectively as the Affordable Care Act, was enacted in the United States. The provisions of the Affordable Care Act are effective on various dates. The Affordable Care Act expands the government’s investigative and enforcement authority and increases the penalties for fraud and abuse, including amendments to both the Anti-Kickback Statute and the False Claims Act, to make it easier to bring suit under these statutes. The Affordable Care Act also allocates additional resources and tools for the government to police healthcare fraud, with expanded subpoena power for HHS, additional funding to investigate fraud and abuse across the healthcare system and expanded use of recovery audit contractors for enforcement.

Anti-Kickback Statutes. The federal healthcare programs’ Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits persons or entities from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving, or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in exchange for or to induce either the referral of an individual, or the furnishing or arranging for a good or service, for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program such as Medicare or Medicaid.

The definition of “remuneration” has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value, including, for example, gifts, certain discounts, the furnishing of free supplies, equipment or services, credit arrangements, payment of cash, and waivers of payments. Several courts have interpreted the statute’s intent requirement to mean that if any one purpose of an arrangement involving remuneration for inducing referrals of federal healthcare covered businesses, a violation of the statute can be found. Penalties for violations include criminal penalties and civil sanctions such as fines, imprisonment, and possible exclusion from Medicare, Medicaid, and other federal healthcare programs. In addition, a kickback violation can serve as a predicate for a violation under the Federal False Claims Act, discussed in more detail below.

The Anti-Kickback Statute is broad and prohibits many arrangements and practices that are otherwise lawful in businesses outside of the healthcare industry. Recognizing that the Anti-Kickback Statute is broad and may technically prohibit many innocuous or beneficial arrangements, Congress authorized the Office of Inspector General (“OIG”), of HHS to issue a series of regulations known as “safe harbors.” These safe harbors set forth provisions that, if all their applicable requirements are met, will assure healthcare providers and other parties that they will not be prosecuted under the Anti-Kickback Statute. The failure of a transaction or arrangement to fit precisely within one or more safe harbors does not necessarily mean that it is per se illegal or that prosecution will be pursued. However, conduct and business arrangements that do not fully satisfy an applicable safe harbor may result in increased scrutiny by government enforcement authorities such as OIG.

Many states have adopted laws similar to the Anti-Kickback Statute. Some of these state prohibitions apply to referral of recipients for healthcare items or services reimbursed by any source, not only the Medicare and Medicaid programs.

Government officials have focused their enforcement efforts on the marketing of healthcare services and products, among other activities, and recently have brought cases against companies, and certain individual sales, marketing, and executive personnel, for allegedly offering unlawful inducements to potential or existing customers in an attempt to procure their business.




Federal False Claims Act. Another broad statute affecting the healthcare industry is the increased use of the federal False Claims Act, and in particular, actions brought pursuant to the False Claims Act’s “whistleblower” or “qui tam” provisions. The False Claims Act imposes liability on any person or entity that, among other things, knowingly presents, or causes to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment by a federal healthcare program. The qui tam provisions of the False Claims Act allow a private individual to bring actions on behalf of the federal government alleging that the defendant has violated the False Claims Act and to share in any monetary recovery. In recent years, the number of suits brought against healthcare providers by private individuals has increased dramatically. In addition, various states have enacted false claims laws analogous to the False Claims Act, and many of these state laws apply where a claim is submitted to any third-party payor and not just a federal healthcare program.

When an entity is determined to have violated the False Claims Act, it may be required to pay up to three times the actual damages sustained by the government, plus civil penalties of between $11,463 and $22,927 for each separate instance of false claim, subject to adjustment for inflation. As part of any settlement, the government may ask the entity to enter into a corporate integrity agreement, which imposes certain compliance, certification, and reporting obligations. There are many potential bases for liability under the False Claims Act. Liability arises, primarily, when an entity knowingly submits, or causes another to submit, a false claim for reimbursement to the federal government. The federal government has used the False Claims Act to assert liability on the basis of inadequate care, non-compliance with medical necessity criteria, kickbacks and other improper referrals, and improper use of Medicare numbers when detailing the provider of services, in addition to the more predictable allegations as to misrepresentations with respect to the services rendered. In addition, the federal government has prosecuted companies under the False Claims Act in connection with off-label promotion of products. Our future activities relating to the reporting of wholesale or estimated retail prices of our products, the reporting of discount and rebate information, and other information affecting federal, state, and third-party reimbursement of our products and the sale and marketing of our products may be subject to scrutiny under these laws.

While we are unaware of any current matters, we are unable to predict whether we will be subject to actions under the False Claims Act or a similar state law, or the impact of such actions. However, the costs of defending such claims, as well as any sanctions imposed, could significantly affect our financial performance.

The Sunshine Act. The Physician Payment Sunshine Act (the “Sunshine Act”), which was enacted as part of the Affordable Care Act, requires applicable manufacturers and certain distributors of prescription drugs, devices, biologics or other medical supplies available for coverage by Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program to report annually to the Secretary of HHS: (i) payments or other transfers of value made by that entity, or by a third party as directed by that entity, to physicians and teaching hospitals or to third parties on behalf of physicians or teaching hospitals; and (ii) physician ownership (including immediate family ownership) and investment interests in the entity. The statute requires the federal government to make reported information available to the public starting September 2014, which it has. Failure to comply with the reporting requirements can result in significant civil monetary penalties ranging from $1,000 to $10,000 for each payment or other transfer of value that is not reported (up to a maximum per annual report of $150,000) and from $10,000 to $100,000 for each knowing failure to report (up to a maximum per annual report of $1.0 million). Additionally, there are criminal penalties if an entity intentionally makes false statements in such reports. Upon commercialization, if physicians use our products for procedures that are reimbursed by Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program, we may be subject to the Sunshine Act and the information we disclose may lead to greater scrutiny, which may result in modifications to established practices and additional costs. Additionally, similar reporting requirements have also been enacted on the state level domestically, and an increasing number of countries worldwide either have adopted or are considering similar laws requiring transparency of interactions with healthcare professionals.

Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”) prohibits any U.S. individual or business from paying, offering, or authorizing payment or offering of anything of value, directly or indirectly, to any foreign official, political party or candidate for the purpose of influencing any act or decision of the foreign entity in order to assist the individual or business in obtaining or retaining business. The FCPA also obligates companies whose securities are listed in the U.S. to comply with accounting provisions requiring us to maintain books and records that accurately and fairly reflect all transactions of the corporation, including international subsidiaries, if any, and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls for international operations.




International Laws. In Europe, various countries have adopted anti-bribery laws providing for severe consequences, in the form of criminal penalties and/or significant fines, for individuals and/or companies committing a bribery offense. Violations of these anti-bribery laws, or allegations of such violations, could have a negative impact on our business, results of operations, and reputation. For instance, in the United Kingdom, under the Bribery Act 2010, which went into effect in July 2011, a bribery occurs when a person offers, gives, or promises to give a financial or other advantage to induce or reward another individual to improperly perform certain functions or activities, including any function of a public nature. Bribery of foreign public officials also falls within the scope of the Bribery Act 2010. Under the new regime, an individual found in violation of the Bribery Act of 2010, faces imprisonment of up to 10 years. In addition, the individual can be subject to an unlimited fine, as can commercial organizations for failure to prevent bribery.

There are also international privacy laws that impose restrictions on the access, use, and disclosure of health information. All of these laws may impact our business. Our failure to comply with these privacy laws or significant changes in the laws restricting our ability to obtain required patient information could significantly impact our business and our future business plans.

U.S. Healthcare Reform

Changes in healthcare policy could increase our costs and subject us to additional regulatory requirements that may interrupt commercialization of our current and future solutions. Changes in healthcare policy could increase our costs, decrease our revenues, and impact sales of and reimbursement for our current and future solutions. The Affordable Care Act substantially changes the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers, and significantly impacts our industry. The Act contains a number of provisions that impact our business and operations, some of which in ways we cannot currently predict, including those governing enrollments in federal healthcare programs and reimbursement changes.

There will continue to be proposals by legislators at both the federal and state levels, regulators, and third-party payors to reduce costs while expanding individual healthcare benefits. Certain of these changes could impose additional limitations on the prices we will be able to charge for our current and future solutions or the amounts of reimbursement available for our current and future solutions from governmental agencies or third-party payors. While in general it is too early to predict specifically what effect the Affordable Care Act and its implementation or any future healthcare reform legislation or policies will have on our business, current and future healthcare reform legislation and policies could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.

Environmental

We are subject to federal, state, and local laws, rules, regulations, and policies governing the use, generation, manufacture, storage, air emission, effluent discharge, handling, and disposal of certain hazardous and potentially hazardous substances used in connection with our operations. Although we believe that we have complied with these laws and regulations in all material respects and, to date, have not been required to take any action to correct any noncompliance, there can be no assurance that we will not be required to incur significant costs to comply with environmental regulations in the future.
Insurance

We maintain product and clinical trial liability insurance coverage which includes a maximum of per claim and annual aggregate policy limits, subject to self-insured retentions. The policy covers, subject to policy conditions and exclusions, claims of bodily injury and property damage from any product manufactured by us or from trial-related adverse events.

There is no assurance that our level of coverage is adequate. We may not be able to sustain or maintain our current level of coverage and cannot assure you that adequate insurance coverage will continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. A successful product liability claim may exceed our existing coverages and may make future coverages significantly more expensive, if available at all.

Employees and Human Capital

As of December 31, 2021, we had 142 employees, of which substantially all are located at our headquarters in Hayward, California. Of these employees, 81 were engaged in research and development activities, and 61 were engaged in sales, marketing and general and administrative activities.
