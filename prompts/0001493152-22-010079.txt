ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
 
We are an ophthalmic research and development company focused on developing technologies to screen, monitor, diagnose and treat ocular, optical, and sight-threatening disorders. Our mission is to prevent vision loss and blindness due to diabetic retinopathy and maculopathy through two devices: (1) Retinal Imaging Screening Device, a portable, retinal imaging system providing a 200-degree field of view without requiring pupil dilation; and (2) RetinalCamTM, a home monitoring and imaging device offering real-time communication with physicians available 24/7.
 
One of the effects of diabetes is retinopathy, and subsequent diabetic maculopathy, characterized by loss of visual function through occlusion of image transmission externally, internally or by destruction of the image sensors in the macula themselves. The macula contains the majority and highest density of color and vision light sensors with providing maximum visual image resolution. Signals are passed through the retinal nerve fiber layer to the optic nerve, an extension of the brain, accumulating retinal nerve bundles forming trunks of connections to pass signals to the brain. The final images are processed at the occipital lobe. When the retina degenerates, patients experience loss of vision due to bleeding, retinal detachment, and other factors. Retinopathy in diabetes can also lead to a degenerative maculopathy, a progressive disease that can lead to vision loss and permanent blindness. Early detection for all causes of visual loss leading to macula disruption, destruction and occlusion are critical in preventing blindness in any form, and most importantly where progression is possible. We believe if detected early and properly treated, the progression of retinopathy can be slowed or even stopped, so that vision can be maintained.
 
Currently, the standard of care requires patients physically go into an office to have their pupil dilated, which, among other things, is costly, time consuming and may cause the patient discomfort. Instead of dilating pupils, some physicians opt to instead use a microscope-like device to detect early signs of diabetic retinopathy, but most such devices have a fixed field of view, typically between 20 to 50 degrees, and therefore, because the limited field of view, do not allow view of the periphery, where retinopathy typically begins, and may not detect signs of retinopathy. By the time the retinopathy reaches the center of the eye and can be seen by such instruments with a limited field of view, it can be too late to treat and may result in blindness. Currently, the only way for a physician to see changes in the periphery of the eye is by an exam after dilation through use of an instrument that has a 200 degree field of view. A patient, when seen without a dilated eye exam, may be misled to believe there is no evidence of retinopathy during the early stages, because, without dilation, such diagnosis can be easily missed.
 
We are in the process of developing two products aimed at preventing loss of vision. Specifically, we are developing (1) the RetinalGeniXTM Imaging System, a diabetic non-mydriatic mass retinal imaging and screening device and (2) the RetinalCamTM, a real-time in-home retinal monitoring, imaging, and physician alert system.
 
RetinalGeniXTM Imaging System – Diabetic Non-Mydriatic Mass Retinal Imaging and Screening Device
 
RetinalGeniXTM is a portable diabetic non-mydriatic mass retinal imaging screening device with a high resolution 200-degree field of view. It is intended to be a cost-effective, ultra-wide imaging technology used to examine the periphery of the retina, without the need for dilation. It can also be used to screen patients for neurological diseases and detect early signs of diabetic retinopathy. We believe RetinalGeniXTM may detect a variety of health issues including diabetes, retinopathy, ocular tumors, Alzheimer’s and autoimmune diseases, without the discomfort associated with pupil dilation. We believe RetinalGeniXTM will enable ophthalmologists, retinal specialists and optometrists to perform a more accurate screening with an improved field of view in less than one minute at a low-cost.

RetinalCamTM – Real-Time Patient In-Home Retinal Monitoring, Imaging, and Physician Alert System
 
RetinalCamTM is an in-home ocular and retinal monitoring device which allows individuals at high risk of vision loss or blindness to alert their physician of any vision changes on a real-time basis from their home. The images generated by RetinalCamTM may provide critical information in detecting abnormalities upon onset, potentially preventing degradation of a patient’s ocular health that might result in vision loss of blindness, if left untreated. RetinalCamTM connects directly to the internet or uses Wi-Fi to capture and transmit high resolution digital images directly to doctors from a patient’s home. Patients at risk include those with obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular disorders, macular degeneration, neurological disorders, ocular tumors, physical disabilities and individuals that lack regular access to eyecare. The images captured by RetinalCamTM may allow patients to detect any changes that may have occurred since their prior screenings.
 
We believe RetinalCamTM may offer an opportunity to prevent blindness by early detection of progression by high-risk individuals. In addition, we believe, future treatments targeted at COVID-19 may have toxic effects on the macula, which would result in a patient requiring close monitoring of their eyes. In July 2020, a study published in the European Association for the Study of Diabetes Journal, reported 46% of COVID-19 patients with diabetic maculopathy experienced vascular changes in the retina periphery. We anticipate the high incidence of microvascular changes may demonstrate a potential sign of the severity and a risk factor for death in COVID-19 patients with diabetic maculopathy.
 
As of the date of this prospectus, we do not have any products approved for sale and have not generated any revenue from product sales. We anticipate that we will need an additional $5,000,000 to complete product design and testing for RetinalGenixTM and RetinalCamTM and submit RetinalGenixTM for FDA clearance as we believe RetinalCamTM will be considered a Class II exempt medical device because it is non-diagnostic in nature, and therefore, we do not anticipate needing 510(k) clearance from the FDA to market such product. We intend to obtain such funding through the sales of our equity and debt securities and/or through potential strategic partnerships; however, no assurance can be provided that funds will be available to us on acceptable terms, if at all.
 
Recent Developments
 
On December 27, 2021, we entered into an exchange agreement with Sanovas Ophthalmology, LLC pursuant to which we exchanged 28,014,540 shares of our common stock held by Sanovas Ophthalmology, LLC for a pre-funded warrant to purchase up to an aggregate of 28,014,540 shares of our common stock. The pre-funded warrant is immediately exercisable at an exercise price of $0.0001 per share and terminates when exercised in full.
 
On November 21, 2021, our board of directors rescinded the 3,000,000 shares of Series F preferred stock issued to Halo Management Group LLC for lack of contract consideration.
 
Market Opportunity
 
According to Reuters, 2.1 billion people, or nearly 30% of the world’s population is obese or overweight, and according to the World Health Organization, obesity has reached epidemic proportions with at least 2.8 million people dying each year as a result of being overweight or obese. Obesity is a major risk factor in diseases including, but not limited to, diabetes. Globally, 39% of adults and 18% of children and adolescents are overweight or obese. In most high income countries, about two-thirds of adults are overweight or obese, and in the U.S. 70% are overweight or obese. According to The International Federation of Diabetes, there were 463 million adults worldwide with diabetes in 2019, and it is estimated that by 2045, there will be 700 million adults worldwide with diabetes. Furthermore, a 2017 study published by the National Institutes of Health indicated that diabetic retinopathy affects approximately 35% of diabetics and is a leading cause of blindness worldwide. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 34.2 million patients in the U.S. have diabetic maculopathy with 26.9 million diagnosed and 7.3 million undiagnosed. In addition, 88 million adult Americans are pre-diabetics of which 84%, or 74 million, are undiagnosed. Diabetic maculopathy effects 500 million patients globally.
Competition
 
The ophthalmic medical technology industries utilize rapidly advancing technologies and are characterized by intense competition. There is a strong emphasis on intellectual property and proprietary products. We face competition from different sources including ophthalmic medical technology companies, academic institutions, government agencies, and public and private research institutions. For example, we face competition from Optomed plc. (“Optomed”), Optos plc (“Optos”) and Zeiss with respect to our RetinalGeniXTM Imaging System. Optos has developed and is currently globally marketing a wide screen imaging system that has a 200 degree field of view that screens for diabetic retinopathy, and Optomed has developed and is currently globally marketing a wide screen imaging system that has a 150 degree field of view that screens for diabetic retinopathy. Zeiss has developed and is currently globally marketing a wide screen imaging system that has a 200 degree field of view that screens for diabetic retinopathy. Although we face competition with respect to our RetinalGeniXTM Imaging System, we do not believe we face competition with respect to our RetinalCamTM.

Many of our competitors have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, medical device development and obtaining regulatory approvals than us as well as more established distribution networks and relationships with healthcare providers. Mergers and acquisitions in the ophthalmic medical technology industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified personnel, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to our products.
 
Manufacturing and Supply
 
On June 24, 2021, we entered into an Amended and Restated Master Services Agreement (“Master Services Agreement”) with ADM Tronics Unlimited, Inc. (“ADM Tronics”), pursuant to which ADM Tronics will provide us with design, engineer and provide regulatory services related to RetinalGenixTM and RetinalCamTM.
 
On October 8, 2019, we entered into an option exchange agreement (the “Option Exchange Agreement”) with Diopsys, Inc. (“Diopsys”) pursuant to which we shall issue Diopsys an option to purchase up to 10% of our issued and outstanding shares of common stock and Diopsys shall issue us an option to purchase up to 10% of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock of Diopsys on the Closing Date (the “Option Exchange”). “Closing Date” means a date that is within 30 days of the date that all of the contingencies set forth in the Option Exchange Agreement are satisfied including, but not limited to, approval of a product by the FDA. In addition, pursuant to the Option Exchange Agreement, upon the closing of the Option Exchange, we shall enter into an exclusive distribution agreement with Diopsys pursuant to which Diopsys shall act as our exclusive distributor of such product. The agreement was terminated on February 14, 2022.
 
Intellectual Property Portfolio
 
Our success depends in large part on our ability to protect our proprietary technologies and information, and to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of third parties. We rely on a combination of patent, trade secret, trademark, and copyright laws, as well as confidentiality and other agreements, to establish and protect our proprietary rights. In addition to patent protection, we rely on trade secrets, proprietary know-how, and continuing technological advances to develop and maintain our competitive position. Our goal is to obtain, maintain and enforce patent protection for our products, preserve our trade secrets, and operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of other parties.
Sublicense Agreement with Sanovas Ophthalmology LLC
 
On June 24, 2021, we entered into a sublicense agreement (“Sublicense Agreement”) with Sanovas Ophthalmology LLC (“Sanovas Ophthalmology”) pursuant to which Sanovas Ophthalmology granted us an exclusive worldwide (“Territory”) license to certain intellectual property, including four patents, two patent applications, and two trademark applications, licensed to Sanovas Ophthalmology by Sanovas Intellectual Property LLC relating to certain technologies for eye and ocular visualization and monitoring (“Licensed IP”) for uses related to the screening, examination, diagnosis, prevention and/or treatment of any eye disease, medical condition or disorder, or any disease, medical condition or disorder affecting the eye. The Licensed IP which has been issued by the USPTO and relates to methods of use and systems expires on dates ranging from September 2034 to December 2034, and the Licensed IP which is still pending before the USPTO also relates to methods of use and systems.

Government Regulation
 
Our business is subject to extensive, complex, and rapidly changing federal and state laws and regulations. Various federal and state agencies have discretion to issue regulations any interpret and enforce healthcare laws. While we believe we comply in all material respects with applicable healthcare laws and regulations, these regulations can vary significantly from jurisdiction, and interpretation of existing laws and regulations may change periodically. Federal and state legislatures also may enact various legislative proposals that could materially impact certain aspects of our business.
United States Regulations
 
In the United States, medical devices are classified into one of three classes (e.g., Class I, II or III). The class to which the device is assigned determines, among other things, the type of pre-marketing submission and application required for FDA clearance or approval to market. If a device is classified as Class I or II, unless otherwise exempt, it requires a 510(k) pre-market notification and clearance, or grant a de novo request, prior to marketing. Under FDA regulations, all devices, including Class I devices, are subject to general controls, which are the basic authorities of the Medical Device Amendments that provide the FDA with the means of regulating devices to ensure their safety and effectiveness (e.g., labeling, facility registration and device listing and adherence to Quality System Regulation (“QSR”) requirements). For Class III devices, a PMA application will be required unless the device is a pre-amendment device (on the market prior to the passage of the medical device amendments in 1976, or substantially equivalent to such a device) or is exempted from submission of a PMA. In that case, a 510(k) will be the route to market. A 510(k) clearance will be granted if the submitted information establishes that the proposed device is substantially equivalent to a legally marketed Class I or II medical device, or to a Class III medical device for which the FDA has not required a PMA. The FDA may determine that a proposed device is not substantially equivalent to a legally marketed device or that additional information or data are needed before a substantial equivalence determination can be made. A request for additional data may require that clinical studies of the device’s safety and efficacy be performed.
 
Commercial distribution of a device for which a 510(k) notification is required may begin only after the FDA issues an order finding the device to be substantially equivalent to a previously cleared device. Even in cases where the FDA grants a 510(k) clearance, it may take the FDA between four and nine months from the date of submission to grant a 510(k) clearance, but may take longer.
 
A “not substantially equivalent” determination, or a request for additional information, could delay the market introduction of new products that fall into this category and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. For any of our products that are cleared through the 510(k) process, modifications or enhancements that could significantly affect the safety or efficacy of the device or that constitute a major change to the intended use of the device will require new 510(k) submissions.
 
Any products manufactured or distributed by us are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including record keeping requirements and reporting of adverse experiences with the use of the device. Device manufacturers are required to register their establishments and list their devices with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies. The FDCA requires devices to be manufactured to comply with applicable QSR regulations which impose certain procedural and documentation requirements upon us with respect to design, development, manufacturing and quality assurance activities. We are subject to unannounced inspections by the FDA and the Food and Drug Branch of the California Department of Public Health to determine our compliance with the QSR and other regulations, and these inspections may include the manufacturing facilities of our subcontractors.

Labeling and promotion activities are subject to scrutiny by the FDA and by the Federal Trade Commission. The FDA actively enforces regulations prohibiting marketing of products for unapproved uses. We and our products are also subject to a variety of state laws and regulations in those states or localities where our products will be marketed. Any applicable state or local regulations may hinder our ability to market our products in those states or localities. Manufacturers are also subject to numerous federal, state and local laws relating to such matters as safe working conditions, manufacturing practices, environmental protection, fire hazard control and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances. We may be required to incur significant costs to comply with such laws and regulations now or in the future. Such laws or regulations may have a material adverse effect upon our ability to do business.
 
Export of our products is regulated by the FDA and subject to the FDCA, 21 U.S.C. §§381-384f, and other statutes FDA administers, which greatly expanded the export of approved and unapproved United States medical devices. Some foreign countries require manufacturers to provide a specific type of FDA export certificate (such as a Certificate to Foreign Government or Certificate of Exportability), which may require the device manufacturer to certify the device is lawfully marketed in the United States, including in conformance with QSR requirements, labeling regulations, premarket notification, and other requirements. The FDA will refuse to issue any export certificate if significant outstanding QSR violations exist.
 
We believe RetinalGenixTM is a Class II medical device that will require 510(k) clearance from the FDA. In addition, we believe RetinalCamTM will be considered a Class II exempt medical device because it is non-diagnostic in nature, and therefore, we do not anticipate needing 510(k) clearance from the FDA to market such product. Pursuant to FDA product classification codes for ophthalmic cameras under 21 C.F.R. § 886.1120, “PJZ” cameras are prescription devices indicated only for the capture and storage of images of the eye and surrounding area in the general population. PJZ cameras cannot be indicated for any specific population (e.g., pediatrics, AMD patients, etc.), cannot contain any type of “diagnostic” or “aid in diagnosis” claims in the indication for use, and cannot reference any specific disease. PJZ cameras do not exceed group 1 radiant exposure limits for ultraviolet, visible, and infrared radiation under all light energy conditions, as defined in the ANSI Z80.36-2016 standard Light Hazard Protection for Ophthalmic Instruments. PJZ cameras also have other design and performance characteristics that are described by FDA in the product code description.
 
If the RetinalGeniXTM were to be classified as a Class II medical device, such classification would require us to submit a premarket notification submission to FDA. We anticipate the submission will require clinical evidence of safety and efficacy, generated through a regulated, randomized clinical trial or field evaluation. FDA clearance for ophthalmological devices usually require about 170 days.
 
We intend to launch RetinalCamTM in the fall of 2022 and we intend to apply for 510(k) clearance for RetinalGenixTM in 2022.
 
European Union Regulations
 
In the European Union (“EU”), there are four main medical device classes: I, IIa, IIb and III. Similar to the US classification system, the EU classification system is a risk-based system, depending on the potential risk associated with the device. In the EU, we believe the RetinalCamTM would be considered a Class IIa medical device, which would require the grant of a CE marking prior to launching in the EU. To obtain a CE marking, the device manufacturer must be certified to ISO 13485, and the product must meet certain harmonized standards for its design, development and testing. If the manufacturer is not self-certifying, outside agencies (known as Notified Bodies) will be required to test and certify that the device meets the applicable requirements, including clinical evidence of safe and effective use prior to the product being released for general market introduction.
Employees
 
As of April 14, 2022, we had no full-time employees and 1 part-time employee. We are not a party to any collective bargaining agreements. We believe that we maintain good relations with our employee.
