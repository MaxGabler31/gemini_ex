ModusLink's Services
ModusLink's revenue primarily comes from sales of adaptive supply chain services to its clients. Among ModusLink's core supply chain services are packaging, kitting & assembly, fulfillment, digital commerce and reverse logistics.
Packaging, Kitting & Assembly—These services center on developing and executing a strategy that has product configuration and packaging done at the optimal time, and for the greatest strategic benefit. With sites located in the Americas, the Asia-Pacific region and Europe, ModusLink affords manufacturers just-in-time flexibility. Options with this service include the ability to delay product/order configuration until the order fulfillment stage, and using the facilities closest to a client's customers. In addition, ModusLink's light manufacturing services cover the final assembly of components and parts into finished goods, including build-to-order customization. ModusLink also offers additional value-added processes such as product testing, radio frequency identification tagging, product or service activation, language settings, personalization, and engraving and multi-channel packaging and packaging design.
Fulfillment—ModusLink's Fulfillment Services are highly integrated and supported by a best-of-breed technology infrastructure to enable clients to quickly increase efficiency and reduce costs. It has deep experience and is exceptionally skilled at handling the fulfillment requirements of multiple channels, be they manufacturing sites, distribution centers, retail operations or individual consumers dispersed across the globe. ModusLink is equally strong in adapting to the needs of retail/B2B or B2C product movement with respect to bringing product to market, including order management, pick, pack and ship, retail compliance and demand planning services, which are integral components of ModusLink's Fulfillment Services. In addition, ModusLink can help optimize component and finished goods inventory levels for better efficiency and cost savings. Clients also look to ModusLink for the physical programming of digital content—such as software, firmware, upgrades or promotional material—onto numerous types of flash media, including SD and MicroSD cards, USB drives, navigation systems, smartphones and tablets. This programming includes content protection and activation options, as well as full IP security. As direct-to-consumer volumes increase, ModusLink is able to provide a customer experience that can further enhance a brand's relationship with consumers.
Digital Commerce—ModusLink's Digital Commerce Services are based on ModusLink's cloud-based e-commerce platform. These e-Business services remove the complexities and risk of a global web store, optimizing each stage of the online buying experience so that products can be quickly and easily purchased, serviced and delivered anywhere in the world. This end-to-end approach is fully integrated with global payment, customer relationship management (CRM) and fulfillment systems, helping clients to quickly and easily expand into a new region and country. In addition, if a client needs help in managing and optimizing its commerce solution once established, ModusLink can support that too. By leveraging ModusLink's e-commerce partnerships with Intershop and Shopify, clients can better meet revenue goals, drive growth and build their brands around the globe. Integration with either partner provides clients with a single, comprehensive view of their customers at every stage of their relationships. ModusLink can also manage the installation, 
integration and all technical operations for an online store, so a client can dedicate time and resources to its core business. By being able to adapt to their digital commerce and supply chain needs, ModusLink can help clients reach new markets, optimize order processing and customer service, reduce costs, and increase margins and flexibility without having to invest in their own infrastructure and personnel.
Reverse Logistics—ModusLink's Reverse Logistics Services simplify the returns process for retailers and manufacturers that want to improve service parts management and the value of returned assets. ModusLink manages the end-to-end process, including receipt, RMA, sorting, triage, credit processing and ultimate disposition of the returned product. Its approach to reverse logistics employs a modular global system that combines existing and new supply chain solutions, so clients can gain actionable insight into their reverse supply chains, which leads to reduced costs and increased customer service and satisfaction levels.
ModusLink's business solutions integrate with other supply chain service providers such as contract manufacturing companies and transportation providers.
Reportable Segments
Subsequent to the Company’s disposition of the Direct Marketing reportable segment with the IWCO Direct, the Company has one reportable segment: Supply Chain. The Company also has Corporate-level activity, which consists primarily of costs associated with certain corporate administrative functions such as legal, finance, share-based compensation and acquisition costs which are not allocated to the Company's reportable segments. The Corporate-level balance sheet information includes cash and cash equivalents, notes payables, and other assets and liabilities, which are not identifiable to the operations of the Company's reportable segments. Certain reportable segment information, including revenue, profit (loss) and asset information, is set forth in Note 21 of the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 in this Report and in "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations." 
Technology Infrastructure
ModusLink's information technology systems and infrastructure serve as the backbone of a client's fully integrated global supply chain services and manages the flow and use of physical assets and information. ModusLink offers a secure and redundant operating environment to ensure the integrity and privacy of its clients' data. ModusLink works with clients to integrate data, tools and applications to deliver an optimized solution that meets its clients' business needs and improves management of the global supply chain. ModusLink's ERP system is designed to provide the visibility and control needed for better decision making, rapid response to global market dynamics and effective asset utilization across services and geographies.
Competition
The market for the supply chain management service offerings provided by ModusLink is highly competitive. As a provider with service offerings covering a range of supply chain operations and activities across the globe, ModusLink competes with different companies depending on the type of service it is providing or the geographic area in which an activity is taking place. ModusLink faces competition from Electronics Manufacturing Services/Contract Manufacturers (EMS/CM), third party logistics (3PL) providers, Supply Chain Management (SCM) companies and regional specialty companies. For certain digital commerce services, ModusLink's competition includes global outsource providers, software as a service (SaaS) providers, technology providers and computer software providers offering content and document management solutions. As a provider of an outsourcing solution, ModusLink's competition also includes current and prospective clients, who evaluate ModusLink's capabilities in light of their own capabilities and cost structures.
The Company believes that the principal competitive factors in its market are quality and range of solutions and services, technological capabilities, costs, location of facilities, responsiveness and adaptability. With ModusLink's set of supply chain services, global footprint, strong client service acumen and its integrated global supply chain digital commerce services, the Company believes that it is well positioned to compete in each of the markets it serves, while expanding across various industry subsets. For more information, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business, Operations and Industry—Our business is subject to intense competition.”
Clients
A limited number of clients account for a significant percentage of the Company's consolidated net revenue. For the fiscal years ended July 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company's 10 largest clients accounted for approximately 78% and 81% of consolidated net revenue, respectively. Two clients accounted for 31% and 12% of the Company's consolidated net revenue for 
the fiscal years ended July 31, 2022, and one client accounted for 42% of the Company's consolidated net revenue for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2021. No other clients accounted for greater than 10% of the Company's consolidated net revenue for the fiscal years ended July 31, 2022 and 2021. In general, the Company does not have many agreements which obligate any client to buy a material amount of services from the Company, or which designate the Company as its sole supplier of any particular services. The Company sells its services to its clients primarily on a purchase order basis, which is subject to demand variability. As such, the loss of a significant amount of business or program with any key client could have a material adverse effect on the Company. The Company believes that it will continue to derive a majority of its consolidated operating revenue from sales to a small number of clients. 
There can be no assurance that revenue from key clients will not decline in future periods.
Resources
The Company purchases and maintains adequate levels of inventory in order to meet client needs on a timely basis. The Company has no guaranteed price, quantity or delivery agreements with its suppliers. Because of the diversity of its services, as well as the wide geographic dispersion of its facilities, the Company uses numerous sources for the wide variety of raw materials needed for its operations. 
The Company relies upon a combination of patent, trade secret, copyright and trademark laws to protect our intellectual property. From time to time, we develop new trade secrets and other intellectual property or obtain intellectual property through acquisition activities. Our businesses are not substantially dependent on any single or group of patents, trademarks, copyrights or licenses.
International Operations
In addition to its North American operations, ModusLink conducts business in several countries, including Mainland China, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Ireland and Singapore, among others. During the years ended July 31, 2022 and 2021, net revenues from our foreign operations accounted for approximately 75% and 73% of total net revenues respectively.
The Company's international operations increase its exposure to U.S. and foreign laws, regulations and labor practices, which are often complex and subject to variation and unexpected changes with which the Company must comply. A substantial portion of our international business is conducted in Mainland China, where we face (i) the challenge of navigating a complex set of licensing and tax requirements and restrictions affecting the conduct of business in Mainland China by foreign companies, (ii) potential limitations on the repatriation of cash, (iii) and foreign currency fluctuation. For more information, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business, Operations and Industry—The Supply Chain business conducts business outside of the U.S., which may expose the Company to additional risks not typically associated with companies that operate solely in the U.S.”
Human Capital Management
Steel Connect’s approximately 1,100 employees worldwide represent our most important asset. We are committed to creating workplace environments that are ethical, diverse, inclusive, and just, which go beyond simply complying with workplace laws. 
Human capital management is a key driver of the Company's success, and we are committed to a work environment in which everyone is treated fairly with dignity and respect. This is supported by our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, which establishes the baseline requirements of our integrity and compliance program. Our core values are Teamwork, Respect, Integrity and Commitment. By embracing these core values, the Company strives to create an environment where its employees can all be productive, innovative and true to themselves. 
The following programs are crucial to support and work to improve the Company's workplace environment:
•Steel Grow Program: The Company participates in the Steel Grow initiative which: (1) formalizes employee development throughout the Company with the goal of identifying its high performing employees and (2) recruits, retains and rewards the best talent available for the Company, in each case, without discrimination or harassment on the basis of race, color, religion, age, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, national origin, citizenship, disability, marital status, pregnancy (including unlawful discrimination on the basis of a legally protected pregnancy/maternity leave), veteran status, genetic information or any other characteristic protected by law. Management is committed to promoting from within when the opportunity is right for the employee and the Company. 
•Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Program: In 2020, we conducted a comprehensive Diversity, Equity and Inclusion review in the U.S. with and subsequently launched a comprehensive global plan in the second half of calendar 2021. Guided by our core values, we are committed to creating a company where everyone is included and respected, and where we support each other in reaching our full potential individually and as a company.
•Steel Wellness Council: Our Steel Wellness Council, with representatives from all our businesses, focuses on sharing best practices that maximize the overall wellness of employees, empowering them to help create positive change in communities where we work and live. Our initiatives include mental, physical and financial well-being along with healthcare education and community support. Community support includes using our coaching system to enhance the education of our employees who coach and lead children in our communities. 
•Steel Environmental Health and Safety Council: The Steel Environmental Health and Safety Council is comprised of the health and safety teams at the Company's affiliate companies and representatives from the legal and human resources departments who are dedicated to the safety of our people.
Employee Safety and Well-Being
The COVID-19 pandemic continues to impact lives and businesses worldwide, and the Company continues to take actions to ensure its employees' health and safety. Many of our office workers continue to telecommute; however, where our workers continue at our facilities, the Company has established a number of safety protocols as situations and local requirements dictate. Our COVID-19 Task Force meets regularly to share good practices and create risk mitigation plans and resource guides to safeguard our employees and their families.
