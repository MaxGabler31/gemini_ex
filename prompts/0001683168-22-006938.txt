The consideration for the purchase was provided to the Purchaser from the private funds of the principal of the Purchaser.
 
Series C Non-Convertible Preferred Stock (the “Preferred Stock”) was authorized for 10,000,000 shares of the Company. Each share of Preferred Stock is entitled to one thousand (1,000) votes per share and at the election of the holder. The series C is Non-Convertible Preferred Stock. The Purchaser owns approximately 100% of the fully diluted outstanding equity securities of the Company and approximately 100% of the voting rights for the outstanding equity securities.

We believe that our competitors have certain existing advantages such as history and heritage; strong ecommerce and mobile presence; wholesale and flagship retail presence; strong social presence; a wide range of ancillary product offerings; strong public relations and marketing efforts; a balanced range of price points across the board; and consumer trust and recognition. However, we set ourselves apart with strong brand identity and visuals, unique design and quality and brand awareness through traditional and social media.
 
Because we are a small company with a limited operating history, we are at a competitive disadvantage against larger and well-capitalized companies which have a track record of success and operations. Therefore, our primary method of competition involves promoting our direct to consumer offering.

Effect Of Existing Or Probable Governmental Regulations On The Business
 
The Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018, Public Law 115-334 (the “AIA”), was signed into law on December 20, 2018. It provided a new statutory definition of “hemp” and amended the definition of marihuana under 21 U.S.C. 802(16) and the listing of tetrahydrocannabinols under 21 U.S.C. 812(c). The AIA thereby amends the regulatory controls over marihuana, tetrahydrocannabinols, and other marihuana-related constituents in the Controlled Substances Act (CSA).
 
This rulemaking makes four conforming changes to the Drug Enforcement Administration’s (“DEA”) existing regulations:
 

1. | It modifies 21 CFR 1308.11(d)(31) by adding language stating that the definition of “Tetrahydrocannabinols” does not include “any material, compound, mixture, or preparation that falls within the definition of hemp set forth in 7 U.S.C. 1639 o.”
---+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


2. | It removes from control in schedule V under 21 CFR 1308.15(f) a “drug product in finished dosage formulation that has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration that contains cannabidiol (2-[1R-3-methyl-6R-(1-methylethenyl)-2- cyclohexen-1-yl]-5-pentyl-1,3- benzenediol) derived from cannabis and no more than 0.1% (w/w) residual tetrahydrocannabinols.”
---+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


3. | It also removes the import and export controls described in 21 CFR 1312.30(b) over those same substances.
---+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


4. | It modifies 21 CFR 1308.11(d)(58) by stating that the definition of “Marihuana Extract” is limited to extracts “containing greater than 0.3 percent delta-9- tetrahydrocannabinol on a dry weight basis.” This interim final rule merely conforms DEA's regulations to the statutory amendments to the CSA that have already taken effect, and it does not add additional requirements to the regulations.
---+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
The DEA’s interim rule also includes changes how it implements the CSA:
 
Changes to the Definition of Tetrahydrocannabinols:
 
The AIA also modified the listing for tetrahydrocannabinols under 21 U.S.C. 812(c) by stating that the term tetrahydrocannabinols does not include tetrahydrocannabinols in hemp. Specifically, 21 U.S.C. 812(c) Schedule I now lists as schedule I controlled substances: ‘‘Tetrahydrocannabinols, except for tetrahydrocannabinols in hemp (as defined under section 1639o of Title 7).’’ Therefore, the AIA limits the control of tetrahydrocannabinols (for Controlled Substance Code Number 7370). For tetrahydrocannabinols that are naturally occurring constituents of the plant material, Cannabis sativa L., any material that contains 0.3% or less of D9-THC by dry weight is not controlled, unless specifically controlled elsewhere under the CSA. Conversely, for tetrahydrocannabinols that are naturally occurring constituents of Cannabis sativa L., any such material that contains greater than 0.3% of D9-THC by dry weight remains a controlled substance in schedule I. The AIA does not impact the control status of synthetically derived tetrahydrocannabinols (for Controlled Substance Code Number 7370) because the statutory definition of ‘‘hemp’’ is limited to materials that are derived from the plant Cannabis sativa L. For synthetically derived tetrahydrocannabinols, the concentration of D9- THC is not a determining factor in whether the material is a controlled substance. All synthetically derived tetrahydrocannabinols remain schedule I controlled substances. This rulemaking is modifying 21 CFR 1308.11(d) to reflect this statutory change. By this rulemaking, 21 CFR 1308.11(d)(31) is being modified via the addition of subsection (11) which reads: “Tetrahydrocannabinols does not include any material, compound, mixture, or preparation that falls within the definition of hemp set forth in 7 U.S.C. 1639o.”
 



7
-

 

Stated simply, the above language from the DEA provides that any cannabis or cannabis derivative containing more than 0.3% ∆-9 THC fails to meet the AIA definition of hemp and therefore remains a controlled substance under the CSA. In other words, this proposed rule directly conflicts with the AIA’s definition of hemp which defines hemp as the “plant Cannabis sativa L and any part of that plant including the seeds thereof and all derivatives, extracts, cannabinoids, isomers, acids, salts, and salts of isomers, whether growing or not, with a delat-9 tetrahydrocannabinol concentration of not more than .3 percent on a dry weight basis.” 7 U.S.C definition § 1639o, subsection 1. Further, Congress expressly exempted hemp derivatives and hemp extracts from the federal Controlled Substances Act, as well as “hemp” itself: “(A) Subject to subparagraph (B), the term “marihuana” means all parts of the plant Cannabis sativa L., whether growing or not; the seeds thereof; the resin extracted from any part of such plant; and every compound, manufacture, salt, derivative, mixture, or preparation of such plant, its seeds or resin. (B) The term "marihuana" does not include— (i) hemp, as defined in section 1639o of title 7; or (ii) the mature stalks of such plant, fiber produced from such stalks, oil or cake made from the seeds of such plant, any other compound, manufacture, salt, derivative, mixture, or preparation of such stalks (except the resin extracted therefrom), fiber, oil, or cake, or the sterilized seed of such plant which is incapable of germination.” See 21 U.S.C. 802, subdivision (16). Further, Congress also expressly exempted the AIA’s definition of “hemp,” “hemp derivatives,” and “hemp extracts” from the Controlled Substances Act list of Schedule 1 drugs providing: “(c) Unless specifically excepted or unless listed in another schedule, any material, compound, mixture, or preparation, which contains any quantity of the following hallucinogenic substances, or which contains any of their salts, isomers, and salts of isomers whenever the existence of such salts, isomers, and salts of isomers is possible within the specific chemical designation: (17) Tetrahydrocannabinols, except for tetrahydrocannabinols in hemp (as defined under section 297A of the Agricultural Marketing Act of 1946 [7 USCS § 1639o]).” See 21 U.S.C. 812, subdivision (C), subpart (17).
 
Given that Congress explicitly defined “hemp” to include “hemp derivatives” and “hemp extracts,” as long as delta-8 tetrahydrocannabinol (delta- 8 THC) is extracted or derived from hemp or is extracted or derived from extract or derivative of “hemp,” it cannot be criminalized under the federal Controlled Substances Act, until Congress either further amends the AIA of 2018 or amends the existing CSA. There is case law precedent to support the proposition that a government agency, in this case the DEA, cannot make a rule that directly conflicts an existing federal statute. In determining whether to give deference to an agency rule with a federal statute, Courts apply the Chevron Doctrine set forth by the Supreme Court in Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Res. Def. Council. See 467 U.S. 837, 842-4 (1984).
 
Courts must employ a two-step analysis under the Chevron Doctrine. First, if the statute speaks clearly “to the precise question at issue," the Court must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of Congress.” Chevron, 467 U.S. at 842-43. Second, where the statute is “silent or ambiguous with respect to the specific issue,” the Court must sustain the agency determination if it is based on a “permissible construction” of the statute. Id. at 843. A court does not need to reach this second step if, “employing traditional tools of statutory construction, [it] ascertains that Congress had an intention on the precise question at issue” Id. at 843 n.9. Similarly, in Lamie v. United States Trustee, the Court noted that when a “statute’s language is plain, the sole function of the courts—at least where the disposition required by the text is not absurd—is to enforce it according to its terms.” 540 U.S. 526, 534 (2004). Furthermore, in America's Cmty. Bankers v. F.D.I.C., the Court explained that when a federal statute is clear and unambiguous then there is nothing for an agency to interpret and the court must give effect to that unambiguous expression of Congress. 200 F.3d 822, 833-34 (2000). This remains the case even when the executive agency at issue is the one tasked with enforcing that particular federal statute. Id.
 
As it pertains to the issue at hand, the DEA cannot promulgate a rule the directly conflicts the will of Congress as expressed by the AIA and the CSA. As previously noted, Congress expressly exempted hemp plants, including hemp derivatives and extracts, from the CSA. This exemption presumably encompasses all products that can be derived from hemp including THCs or salts (to the extent that both products are derived or extracted from hemp). There can be no assurance that the AIA will not be modified to conform to the DEA’s regulations regarding the regulatory controls over marihuana, tetrahydrocannabinols, and other marihuana-related constituents in the CSA.

Estimate Of The Amount Of Money Spent During Each Of The Last Two Fiscal Years On Research And Development
 
Other than time spent researching our business and proposed markets and segmentation, we have not spent any funds on research and development activities to date. In the event opportunities arise from our operations, we may elect to initiate research and development activities, but we have no plans for any activities to date.
Costs and Effects Of Compliance With Environmental Laws
 
Our operations are not subject to any environmental laws or regulations.
 
Number Of Total Employees And Number Of Full-Time Employees
 
As of this filing, the Company has 1 full time employee and no persons working part time in various functions.
 
We do not provide an employer contribution for healthcare, pension, annuity, insurance, profit sharing, or similar benefit plans; however, we may adopt plans in the future.
Implications of Being an Emerging Growth Company
 
We qualify as an emerging growth company as that term is used in the JOBS Act. An emerging growth company may take advantage of specified reduced reporting and other burdens that are otherwise applicable generally to public companies. These provisions include:

· | A requirement to have only two years of audited financial statements and only two years of related MD&A;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Exemption from the auditor attestation requirement in the assessment of the emerging growth company’s internal control over financial reporting under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Reduced disclosure about the emerging growth company’s executive compensation arrangements; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | No non-binding advisory votes on executive compensation or golden parachute arrangements.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We have already taken advantage of these reduced reporting burdens in this Form 10-K, which are also available to us as a smaller reporting company as defined under Rule 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”).
 
In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”) for complying with new or revised accounting standards. We are choosing to utilize the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards under Section 102(b)(2) of the JOBS Act. This election allows our Company to delay the adoption of new or revised accounting standards that have different effective dates for public and private companies until those standards apply to private companies. As a result of this election, our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with public company effective dates.

-

 

We could remain an emerging growth company for up to five years, or until the earliest of (i) the last day of the first fiscal year in which our annual gross revenues exceed $1 billion, (ii) the date that we become a “large accelerated filer” as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act, which would occur if the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter, or (iii) the date on which we have issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt during the preceding three year period.
 
We are a reporting company and file all reports required under sections 13 and 15d of the Exchange Act.
