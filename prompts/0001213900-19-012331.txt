ITEM 1. BUSINESS.
Organizational Structure
 Our business was originally organized in February 2006. We added our current parent holding company, GWG Holdings, Inc., in March 2008, and in September 2014 we consummated an initial public offering of our common stock on The NASDAQ Capital Market where our stock trades under the ticker symbol “GWGH.”
 GWG Holdings conducts its life insurance secondary market business through a wholly owned subsidiary, GWG Life, LLC (“GWG Life”), and GWG Life’s wholly owned subsidiaries, GWG Life Trust and GWG DLP Funding IV, LLC. GWG Holdings’ indirect interests in other alternative assets are held and managed by The Beneficient Company Group, L.P. (“BEN LP,” including all of the subsidiaries it may have from time to time — “Beneficient”) and its general partner, Beneficient Management, L.L.C. All of these entities are legally organized in Delaware, other than GWG Life Trust, which is governed by the laws of the State of Utah. GWG Holdings’ wholly owned subsidiary, Life Epigenetics Inc. (formerly named Actüa Life & Annuity Ltd.) (“Life Epigenetics”), was formed to engage in various life insurance related businesses and activities related to its development of epigenetic technology. Through its wholly owned subsidiary, youSurance General Agency, LLC (“youSurance”), GWG Holdings offers life insurance directly to customers from a variety of life insurance carriers. Unless the context otherwise requires or we specifically so indicate, all references in this report to “we,” “us,” “our,” “our Company,” “GWG,” or the “Company” refer to these entities collectively. Our headquarters are currently based in Minneapolis, Minnesota.
 Beneficient was formed in 2003 but began its alternative asset business in September 2017. Beneficient operates primarily through its subsidiaries, which provide Beneficient’s products and services. These subsidiaries include: (i) Beneficient Capital Company, L.L.C. (“BCC”), through which Beneficient offers loans and liquidity products; (ii) Beneficient Administrative and Clearing Company, L.L.C. (“BACC”), through which Beneficient provides services for fund and trust administration and plans to provide custody services; (iii) PEN Indemnity Insurance Company, LTD (“PEN”), through which Beneficient plans to offer insurance services; and (iv) ACE Portal, L.L.C. (“ACE”), through which Beneficient plans to provide an online portal for direct access to Beneficient’s financial services and products.
 Our Company
 We are a financial services company committed to transforming the alternative asset industry with disruptive and innovative products and services. In 2018 and early 2019 we consummated a series of transactions (as more fully described below) with Beneficient that has resulted in a significant reorientation of our business and capital allocation strategy towards an expansive and diverse exposure to alternative assets. As part of this reorientation, we also changed our Board of Directors and executive management team.
 Beneficient, through its subsidiaries, plans to operate three potentially high value, high margin lines of business:
 •        Private Trust Lending & Liquidity Products. Through BCC, Beneficient provides a unique suite of private trust, lending and liquidity products focused on bringing liquidity to owners of professionally managed alternative assets. Beneficient’s innovative liquidity solutions are designed to serve mid-to-high net worth (“MHNW”) individuals, small-to-mid sized (“STM”) institutions, and asset managers who have historically possessed few attractive options to access early liquidity from their alternative assets. Beneficient targets MHNW clients with $5 million to $30 million in net worth and STM institutional clients typically holding up to $1 billion in assets.
 •        Trust and Custody Services. Through BACC and (subject to capitalization) through PEN, Beneficient plans, in the future, to market retirement funds, custody and clearing of alternative assets, and trustee and insurance services for covering risks attendant to owning or managing alternative assets.
 •        Financial Technology. Through ACE, Beneficient plans to provide online portals and financial technologies for the trading and financing of alternative assets. 
 Beneficient’s existing and planned products and services are designed to support the tax and estate planning objectives of its MHNW clients, facilitate a diversification of assets or simply provide administrative management and reporting solutions tailored to the goals of the investor who owns alternative investments.

1
  While we are continuing our work to maximize the value of our secondary life insurance business, we have made the strategic decision to begin reducing capital allocated to purchasing additional life insurance policies in the secondary market and to begin increasing capital allocated toward providing liquidity to a broader range of alternative assets, primarily through investments in Beneficient. We believe Beneficient can finance investments in alternative assets that will produce higher risk-adjusted returns than those we can achieve from life insurance policies acquired in the secondary market. Furthermore, although we believe that our portfolio of life insurance policies is a meaningful component of a growing diversified alternative asset portfolio, we have begun to explore strategic alternatives for our life insurance portfolio aimed at maximizing its value, including a possible sale, refinancing or recapitalization of our life insurance portfolio.
 We completed our transactions with Beneficient to provide us with a significant increase in assets and common shareholder equity. In addition, our transactions with Beneficient provide us with the opportunity for a diversified source of future earnings within the alternative asset industry. We believe the Beneficient transactions will transform GWG from a niche provider of liquidity to owners of life insurance to, as GWG and Beneficient expand their strategic relationship, a full-scale provider of trust and liquidity products and services to owners of a broad range of alternative assets. 
 The Beneficient Transactions
 The Exchange Transaction
 On January 12, 2018, GWG Holdings and GWG Life entered into a Master Exchange Agreement with Beneficient, MHT Financial SPV, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“MHT SPV”), and various related trusts (the “Seller Trusts”), as amended and restated on January 18, 2018 with effect from January 12, 2018, and as further amended by the First Amendment to Master Exchange Agreement, the Second Amendment to Master Exchange Agreement and the Third Amendment to the Master Exchange Agreement (as amended, the “Master Exchange Agreement”). The material terms and conditions of the initial Master Exchange Agreement were described in GWG Holdings’ Current Report on Form 8-K (the “January 2018 Form 8-K”) filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) on January 18, 2018. 
 On August 10, 2018, GWG Holdings, GWG Life, Beneficient, MHT SPV, and the Seller Trusts entered into a Third Amendment to Master Exchange Agreement (the “Third Amendment”). Pursuant to the Third Amendment, the parties agreed to consummate the transactions contemplated by the Master Exchange Agreement in two closings. The Third Amendment also generally deleted MHT SPV as a party to the Master Exchange Agreement. The material terms and conditions of the Third Amendment to Master Exchange Agreement were described in GWG Holdings’ Current Report on Form 8-K (the “August 2018 Form 8-K”) filed with the SEC on August 14, 2018. The transactions contemplated by the Master Exchange Agreement, as amended, are referred to throughout this Report as the “Exchange Transaction.”
 On the first closing date, which took place on August 10, 2018 (the “Initial Transfer Date”):
 •        in consideration for GWG and GWG Life entering into the Master Exchange Agreement and consummating the transactions contemplated thereby, BEN LP, as borrower, entered into a commercial loan agreement (the “Commercial Loan Agreement”) with GWG Life, as lender, providing for a loan in a principal amount of $200,000,000 (the “Commercial Loan”);

 •        GWG and the Seller Trusts entered into a registration rights agreement with respect to the Seller Trust L Bonds received by the Seller Trusts; and

2
  •        GWG and Beneficient entered into a registration rights agreement with respect to the BEN LP common units received and to be received by GWG.
 Under the Master Exchange Agreement, at the final closing (the “Final Closing” and the date on which the final closing occurred, the “Final Closing Date”), which occurred on December 28, 2018:
 •        in accordance with the Master Exchange Agreement, and based on the net asset value of alternative asset financings as of the Final Closing Date, effective as of the Initial Transfer Date, (i) the principal amount of the Commercial Loan was reduced to $181,974,314, (ii) the principal amount of the Exchangeable Note was reduced to $148,228,432, and (iii) the principal amount of the Seller Trust L Bonds was reduced to $366,891,940;
 •        the Seller Trusts refunded to GWG $840,430 in interest paid on the Seller Trust L Bonds related to the Seller Trust L Bonds that were issued as of the Initial Transfer Date but cancelled, effective as of the Initial Transfer Date, on the Final Closing Date; 
 •        the accrued interest on the Commercial Loan and the Exchangeable Note was added to the principal amount of the Commercial Loan, as a result of which the principal amount of the Commercial Loan as of the Final Closing Date was $192,507,946; 
 •        the Seller Trusts transferred to GWG an aggregate of 21,650,087 common units of BEN LP and GWG received 14,822,843 common units of BEN LP in exchange for the Exchangeable Note, upon completion of which GWG owned (including the 4,032,349 common units received by GWG on the Initial Transfer Date) 40,505,279 common units of BEN LP;
 •        BEN LP issued to GWG an option (the “Option Agreement”) to acquire the number of common units of BEN LP, interests or other property that would be received by a holder of the NPC-A Prime limited partnership interests of Beneficient Company Holdings, L.P., an affiliate of BEN LP (“Beneficient Holdings”); and
 •        GWG issued to the Seller Trusts 27,013,516 shares of GWG common stock (including shares issued upon conversion of the Convertible Preferred Stock).
 On the Final Closing Date, GWG and the Seller Trusts also entered into a registration rights agreement with respect to the shares of GWG common stock owned by the Seller Trusts, an orderly marketing agreement and a stockholders agreement. The material terms of these agreements were described in our Information Statement on Schedule 14C filed with the SEC on December 6, 2018 and in our Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on January 4, 2019.
 The Expanded Strategic Relationship
 In the second quarter of 2019, we completed an expansion of the strategic relationship with Beneficient, which was a transformational event for both organizations that creates a unified platform uniquely positioned to provide an expanded suite of products, services and resources for investors and the financial professionals who assist them. GWG and Beneficient intend to collaborate extensively and capitalize on one another’s capabilities, relationships and services.
 On April 15, 2019, Jon R. Sabes, the Company’s former Chief Executive Officer and a former director, and Steven F. Sabes, the Company’s former Executive Vice President and a former director, entered into a Purchase and Contribution Agreement (the “Purchase and Contribution Agreement”) with, among others, Beneficient. The Purchase and Contribution Agreement was summarized in our Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on April 16, 2019.
 The closing of the transactions contemplated by the Purchase and Contribution Agreement (the “Purchase and Contribution Transaction”) occurred on April 26, 2019. Prior to or in connection with such closing:
 •        Messrs. Jon and Steven Sabes sold and transferred all of the shares of the Company’s common stock held directly and indirectly by them and their immediate family members (approximately 12% of the Company’s outstanding common stock in the aggregate); specifically, Messrs. Jon and Steven Sabes (i) sold an aggregate 2,500,000 shares of Company common stock to BCC for $25,000,000 in cash and (ii) contributed the remaining 1,452,155 shares of Company common stock to AltiVerse Capital Markets, L.L.C., a Delaware limited liability company (“AltiVerse”) (which is a limited liability company owned by certain of Beneficient’s 

3
  founders, including Brad K. Heppner (GWG’s Chairman and Beneficient’s Chief Executive Officer and Chairman) and Thomas O. Hicks (one of Beneficient’s current directors and a director of GWG)), in exchange for certain equity interests in AltiVerse.
 •        Our bylaws were amended to increase the maximum number of directors of the Company from nine to 13, and the actual number of directors comprising the Board was increased from seven to 11.
 •        All seven members of the Company’s Board of Directors prior to the closing resigned as directors of the Company, and 11 individuals designated by Beneficient were appointed as directors of the Company, leaving two board seats vacant after the closing.
 •        Jon R. Sabes resigned from all officer positions he held with the Company or any of its subsidiaries prior to the closing, other than his position as Chief Executive Officer of the Company’s technology focused wholly owned subsidiaries, Life Epigenetics and youSurance.
 •        Steven F. Sabes resigned from all officer positions he held with the Company or any of its subsidiaries prior to the closing, except as Chief Operating Officer of Life Epigenetics.
 •        The resignations of Messrs. Jon and Steven Sabes included a full waiver and forfeit of (i) any severance that may be payable by the Company or any of its subsidiaries in connection with such resignations or the Transactions and (ii) all equity awards of the Company currently held by either of them.
 •        Murray Holland, a trust advisor of the Seller Trusts, was appointed as Chief Executive Officer of the Company.
 •        The Company entered into performance share unit agreements with certain employees of the Company pursuant to which such employees will receive a bonus under certain terms and conditions, including, among others, that such employees remain employed by the Company or one of its subsidiaries (or, if no longer employed, such employment was terminated by the Company other than for cause, as such term is defined in the performance share unit agreement) for a period of 120 days following the closing.
 •        The stockholders agreement that was entered into on the Final Closing Date was terminated by mutual consent of the parties thereto.
 •        BCC and AltiVerse executed and delivered a Consent and Joinder to the Amended and Restated Pledge and Security Agreement dated October 23, 2017 by and among the Company, GWG Life, LLC, Messrs. Jon and Steven Sabes and the Bank of Utah, which provides that the shares of the Company’s common stock acquired by BCC and AltiVerse pursuant to the Purchase and Contribution Agreement will continue to be pledged as collateral security for the Company’s obligations owing in respect of the L Bonds issued under our Amended and Restated Indenture, dated as of October 23, 2017, as amended and supplemented.
 Among other things, the Purchase and Contribution Agreement contemplates that after the closing, the parties will seek to enter into an agreement pursuant to which the Company will have the right to appoint a majority of the board of directors of the general partner of Beneficient, resulting in the Company and Beneficient being under common control. The Company and Beneficient will also seek to enter into an agreement pursuant to which the Company will offer and distribute (through a FINRA registered managing broker-dealer) Beneficient’s liquidity products and services. The Company intends to reduce capital allocated to life insurance assets while it works with Beneficient to build a larger diversified portfolio of alternative asset investment products.
 A copy of the Purchase and Contribution Agreement is incorporated by reference as Exhibit 99.3 to this Report.
 We refer to the Exchange Transaction and the Purchase and Contribution Transaction as the “Beneficient Transactions.”

 Market Opportunity
 Alternative Asset Liquidity Products and Services
 The market demand for liquidity from owners of alternative assets is attributable to the outstanding net asset value of illiquid alternative assets (“NAV”) held by U.S. investors. Using data from various published industry reports from 2017 and 2018, certain widely accepted commercial private-equity databases, and applying its own proprietary assumptions and calculations (“BEN Estimates”), Beneficient estimates that total outstanding NAV held by U.S. investors exceeded $3 trillion in 2018.
 According to at least one industry report from 2018, total outstanding NAV in the hands of U.S. investors grew at a 12.1% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) for the ten years ended 2018 and is forecasted to grow at an 8% CAGR through 2023 as a result of continued increases in capital committed to the alternative asset class. 
 According to BEN Estimates, the large U.S. institutions representing approximately 54% of the NAV have consistently sought liquidity on approximately 1.85% to 2.25% of their outstanding NAV. Based on BEN Estimates, this has led to an annual demand for liquidity of nearly $40 billion in recent years.
 A primary group not included in this demand is the MHNW investor who holds investments of $5 million to $30 million compared to a large institution’s holdings in the hundreds of millions or billions of dollars. Intermediary brokers will often not represent the MHNW individuals (or STM institutional investors). According to BEN Estimates, MHNW investors hold over $700 billion in NAV, yet MHNW investors have only been able to access liquidity representing less than 0.5% of the NAV held by them each year, compared to the average 2% achieved by the large institutional owners, representing 54% of the market.
 Based on these amounts, Beneficient estimates that MHNW investors would seek liquidity of 3% of their outstanding NAV, or a slightly greater percentage than that of large U.S. institutions, each year if liquidity was made available to them. As a result, and according to BEN Estimates, the estimated market demand for liquidity by MHNW individuals would have exceeded $20 billion in 2018.
 Secondary Life Insurance Market
 The market for life insurance is large. According to the American Council of Life Insurers Fact Book 2018 (ACLI), consumers owned approximately $12.0 trillion in face value of individual life insurance policy benefits in the United States in 2017. In that same year, the ACLI reports that individual consumers purchased an aggregate of $3.1 trillion of new individual life insurance policy benefits. This figure includes all types of individual life policies, including term insurance and permanent insurance known as whole life and universal life.
 The life insurance secondary market primarily serves consumers, 65 years and older, and their families who own life insurance. 
 The secondary market for life insurance exists as a result of consumer lapse behaviors and surrender values far below economic value offered to consumers for their life insurance by the issuing insurance carriers. The ACLI reports that the annual lapse and surrender rate for individual life insurance policies is 5.7% of the in-force face value of benefits, amounting to over $680 billion in face value of policy benefits lapsed and surrendered in 2017 alone. According to Milliman (2004), a leading actuarial consulting firm, nearly 88% of all universal life insurance policies issued in the United States ultimately do not terminate with the payment of a death claim.
 In 2017, the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (“NAIC”) issued a policy bulletin in support of products we provide that the bulletin described as “innovative private market solutions for financing Americans’ long-term care needs.” The NAIC, citing the Company’s August 25, 2016 presentation, discussed how consumers could exchange the market value of their life insurance policies for products designed to fund long-term care expenses.

  Primary Life Insurance Market and Technology (“Insurtech”)
 The opportunity to apply technology to transform the insurance industry is significant. The application of technology to the insurance industry, commonly referred to as “insurtech”, provides opportunities for new entrants into the traditional insurance marketplace that have the potential to significantly disrupt the insurance industry’s historical approach to assessing and selecting acceptable underwriting risks.
 As contemplated by the Purchase and Contribution Agreement described above, the Company intends to:
 (a)     form a new technology subsidiary under the name of InsurTech Holdings, LLC (“InsurTech”), which will be wholly owned by a subsidiary of GWG other than GWG Life, LLC;
 (b)    effect a reorganization so that InsurTech owns only two direct subsidiaries, Life Epigenetics Inc. and youSurance General Agency, LLC, both of which hold all insurtech assets, and one indirect subsidiary, Scientific Testing Partners, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Life Epigenetics;
 (c)     cause Life Epigenetics and youSurance to become independent of GWG on commercially reasonable terms as soon as practical; and
 GWG anticipates funding a total of $20 million in capital to InsurTech over the next two years.
 If we succeed in causing Life Epigenetics and youSurance to become independent of GWG, GWG may retain a significant ownership interest in the independent company. 
 Business Strategies
 1.      Liquidity For Alternative Assets
 As a result of the Beneficient Transactions, we are now uniquely positioned to provide liquidity and related services to investors holding a full range of illiquid alternative assets. We will continue to work closely with Beneficient to create the most value for holders of alternative assets, the financial professionals who advise them and for our shareholders.
 Beneficient provides private trust solutions, including a unique suite of lending and liquidity products focused on bringing liquidity to owners of alternative assets. Beneficient’s innovative liquidity solutions are designed to serve MHNW individuals, STM institutions, and asset managers who have historically possessed few attractive options to access early liquidity from their alternative assets. Beneficient targets MHNW individual clients with $5 million to $30 million in investments and institutional clients typically holding up to $1 billion in assets.
 Beneficient’s products can also support tax and estate planning objectives, facilitate a diversification of assets or simply provide administrative management and reporting solutions tailored to the goals of the investor. In the future, Beneficient plans to offer insurance services covering risks associated with owning or managing alternative assets.
 Our life insurance secondary market business is designed to serve consumers 65 years or older owning life insurance. We seek to earn non-correlated yield from life insurance policies that we purchase in the secondary market. Since inception, we have purchased over $3.1 billion in face value of policy benefits from consumers for over $592 million, as compared to the $48 million in surrender value offered by insurance carriers on those same policies. Our products provide unique and valuable services to the senior consumers that we serve.
 The goal of our secondary life insurance business has been to build a profitable, large and well-diversified portfolio of life insurance assets. We believe that scale and diversification are key factors and risk mitigation strategies to provide consistent cash flows and reliable investment returns. We believe that we have reached the goal in terms of portfolio size and diversification.
 2.      Developing a World Class Financial Services Distribution Platform
 GWG has developed a large and sophisticated financial services product distribution platform. Today, this platform consists of over one hundred independent broker dealers and several thousand independent financial advisors (“Retail Distribution”) who sell the Company’s investment products. Since inception, GWG has raised over $1.13 billion of debt and equity capital to support our secondary market of life insurance business and related expenditures. 

6
  We believe that we are well positioned to continue to grow our Retail Distribution for several reasons:
 •        We believe there is a trend towards financial professionals leaving large full-service broker-dealers to become “independent”;
 •        Newly independent financial professionals and their clients demand a high level of customer service and access to innovative and value added products;
 •        The significant demand for liquidity from owners of alternative assets by US investors;
 •        We believe that our expanded relationship with Beneficient will attract more and larger broker dealers to our platform due to our increased size and market capitalization as well as the increase in products offered; and
 •        We believe that by using capital to provide liquidity products to our current customers, and as they begin to realize the benefit of these products, we will able to raise more capital and attract additional broker dealers into our selling group.
 3.      Commercializing Advanced Epigenetic Technology for Primary Life Insurance Markets
 We believe life insurance underwriting will be transformed due to advancements in science and technology. As part of that transformational change, we believe that the science of epigenetics will serve as a foundational science to this advancement for the life insurance industry. The life insurance industry is striving to achieve more automated underwriting and improve the overall customer experience. 
 As described above, the Company is working toward a separation of InsurTech as soon as practical and on commercially reasonable terms. We believe that as a separate entity (rather than as a small subsidiary of a large financial services holding company), the InsurTech businesses can reach their maximum potential in terms of marketing and branding, attraction of talent, appropriate peer group comparisons and, ultimately, return to its owners.

 We rely on the payment of policy benefit claims by life insurance companies as a significant source of cash inflow. The life insurance assets we own represent obligations of third-party life insurance companies to pay the benefit amount under the policy upon the mortality of the insured. As a result, we manage this credit risk exposure by generally purchasing policies issued by insurance companies with investment-grade ratings from Standard & Poor’s, and diversifying our life insurance portfolio among a number of insurance companies.
 The yield to maturity on bonds issued by life insurance carriers reflects, among other things, the credit risk (risk of default) of such insurance carrier. We follow the yields on certain publicly traded life insurance company bonds because this information is part of the data we consider when valuing our portfolio of life insurance policies for our financial statements.
 The average yield to maturity of publicly traded life insurance company bonds data we consider as inputs to our life insurance portfolio valuation process was 4.11% as of December 31, 2018. We believe that this average yield to maturity reflects, in part, the financial market’s judgment that credit risk is low with regard to these carriers’ financial obligations. The obligations of life insurance carriers to pay life insurance policy benefits ranks senior to all of their other financial obligations, including the senior bonds they issue. As of December 31, 2018, approximately 95.6% of the face value of policy benefits in our life insurance portfolio were issued by insurance companies with investment-grade credit ratings from Standard & Poor’s.

Competitive and Regulatory Framework
 Competition
 We encounter significant competition from numerous companies in the products and services we provide and seek to develop in the alternative assets industry. Many of these competitors have greater financial and other resources than we do and may have significantly lower cost of funds than us because they have access to insured deposits or greater access to the capital markets, for example. They may also have greater market share in the markets in which we operate. These factors could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition and our ability to implement our growth strategies.
 In addition, as we enter new markets, we expect to experience significant competition from incumbent market participants. Our ability to compete in these markets will be dependent upon our ability to deliver value-added products and services to the customers we serve. Our competitors in these markets may have greater financial, market share and other resources than we do. These factors also could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition and our ability to implement our growth strategies. 
Government Regulation
 Our life insurance secondary market business is highly regulated at the state level with respect to the life insurance industry, and at the federal level with respect to the issuance of our securities offerings. At the state level, states generally subject us to laws and regulations requiring us to obtain specific licenses or approvals to purchase life insurance policies in those states. State statutes typically provide state regulatory agencies with significant powers to interpret, administer and enforce the laws relating to the life insurance industry. Under this authority, state regulators have broad discretionary power and may impose new licensing and other requirements, and interpret or enforce existing regulatory requirements in new and different ways. Any of these new requirements, interpretations or enforcement directives could be materially adverse to our industry. 
 Beneficient has applied for trust company charters from the State of Texas and intends to carry on much of its business through two subsidiary trust companies. Because Beneficient’s current business plans are based in part on obtaining regulatory approval to operate as regulated trust companies, a failure to do so may materially and adversely impact its financial performance and prospects, which would likely decrease the value of the BEN LP common units and commercial loan receivable we hold and adversely affect our ability to execute our growth strategies.
 The state regulatory landscape for the use of genetic and epigenetic testing in life insurance underwriting is such that genetic and epigenetic testing is generally permitted. A few states require informed consent for use of genetic testing in life insurance underwriting. Epigenetic testing is distinguishable from genetic testing and we believe epigenetic

  testing does not raise the ethical issue found with genetic testing of denying insurance coverage to applicants based on immutable inherited characteristics. While well-informed policymakers and regulators should have little reason to consider expanding current definitions of genetic testing to include epigenetic testing, or to increase restrictions on life insurance underwriting using epigenetic test results, we can provide no such assurances.
 Other changes to the current genetic and epigenetic regulatory framework, including the imposition of additional or new regulations, could arise at any time during the development or marketing of our epigenetic based products. This may negatively affect our ability to obtain or maintain applicable regulatory clearance or approval of our products. In addition, regulatory authorities, such as the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), may introduce new requirements that may change the regulatory requirements for us or our customers, or both.
 Although the federal securities laws and regulations do not directly affect life insurance, in some cases the purchase of a variable life insurance policy may constitute a transaction involving a “security” that is governed by federal securities laws. While we presently hold few variable life insurance policies, our holding of a significant amount of such policies in the future could cause our Company or one of our subsidiaries to be characterized as an “investment company” under the federal Investment Company Act of 1940. The application of that law to all or part of our businesses — whether due to our purchase of life insurance policies or to the expansion of the definition of “securities” under federal securities laws — could require us to comply with detailed and complex regulatory requirements, and cause us to fall out of compliance with certain covenants under our amended and restated senior credit facility with LNV Corporation. Such an outcome could negatively affect our business, results of operations and financial condition and our ability to implement our growth strategies.
 We hold licenses to purchase life insurance policies in 39 states and can also purchase in the eight unregulated states. We also purchase life insurance policies from other secondary market participants. 
 Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)
 HIPAA requires that holders of medical records maintain such records and implement procedures designed to assure the privacy of patient records. In order to carry out our business, we receive medical records and obtain a release to share such records with a defined group of persons, take on the responsibility for preserving the privacy of that information, and use the information only for purposes related to the life insurance policies we own.
The Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act of 2008 (GINA)
 GINA is a federal law that protects people from genetic discrimination in health insurance and employment. GINA prohibits health insurers from: (i) requesting, requiring, or using genetic information to make decisions about eligibility for health insurance; or (ii) making decisions on the health insurance premium, contribution amounts, or coverage terms they offer to consumers. In addition, GINA makes it against the law for health insurers to consider family history or a genetic test result, a pre-existing condition, require a genetic test, or use any genetic information, to discriminate coverage, even if the health insurance company did not mean to collect such genetic information.
 GINA does not apply to the life insurance, long-term care or annuity industries. The life insurance, long-term care or annuity industries operate on medical-evidenced underwriting principles in which specific medical conditions are taken into account when assessing and pricing risk. The regulation of genomic data is relatively new, and we believe it is likely that regulation will increase and grow more complex in the foreseeable future. We cannot, however, predict what any new law or regulation would specifically involve or how it might affect our industry, our business, or our future plans.
 Patents, trademarks, licenses
 On April 26, 2017, our wholly owned subsidiary, Life Epigenetics, secured the exclusive license agreement for patent pending “DNA Methylation Based Predictor of Mortality” technology from The Regents of the University of California to commercialize advanced epigenetic technology for the life insurance industry. 
 On March 19, 2018, our wholly owned subsidiary, Life Epigenetics, filed provisional patents for the application of the use of epigenetic technology against the identification of tobacco and alcohol usage. We continue to advance our intellectual property protection of these alcohol and tobacco focused technologies.

  On December 17, 2018, our wholly owned subsidiary, Life Epigenetics, secured the exclusive evaluation and option agreement for patent pending “Phenotypic Age and DNA Methylation Based Biomarkers for Life Expectancy and Morbidity” technology from The Regents of the University of California to commercialize advanced epigenetic technology for the life insurance industry.
 We believe epigenetics holds promises to improve upon many traditional factors used in the life insurance underwriting process with greater accuracy, speed and convenience. To that end, we are engaged in several research and development efforts to further validate, refine and expand our epigenetic testing capabilities. In particular, we are working to conclude a research study comprised of approximately 1,300 participants in which biological samples, as well as medical records and prescription transaction history records, detailed health history, and DNA methylation analysis were conducted. During the second quarter of 2019, we expect to measure the results of each participant’s diagnostic indicators against insurance risk classes, disease states, biomarker levels, and prescription medication statuses.
 Employees
 We employ approximately 75 employees.
