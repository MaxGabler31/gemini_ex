ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
We create, manufacture, and market innovative technologies and tools for life sciences research. We sell instruments and consumables, including integrated fluidic circuits, or IFCs, assays and reagents, to academic institutions, clinical research laboratories, and biopharmaceutical, biotechnology, and agricultural biotechnology, or Ag-Bio, companies and contract research organizations, or CROs. Our technologies and tools are directed at the analysis of deoxyribonucleic acid, or DNA, ribonucleic acid, or RNA, and proteins in a variety of different sample types, from individual cells to bulk tissue.
We were a pioneer in the application of microfluidics to enable high-throughput and highly-multiplexed polymerase chain reactions, or PCR, for genetic analysis, as well as a field known as single-cell genomics, in which the genetic composition of individual cells is assayed. Our suspension and imaging mass cytometry systems enable the highly-multiplexed analysis of cellular surface and intracellular proteins in both blood and tissue. 
Researchers have successfully employed our products to help achieve breakthroughs in a variety of fields, including single-cell gene and protein expression, gene regulation, genetic variation, cellular function and applied genetics. These breakthroughs include using our systems to help detect life-threatening mutations in cancer cells, discover cancer associated biomarkers, provide new insights into immune-modulated disease, analyze the genetic composition of individual stem cells and assess the quality of agricultural products, such as seeds or livestock.
Our Technology
Multi-Layer Soft Lithography
Our IFCs are manufactured using multi-layer soft lithography technology, or MSL technology, to create valves, chambers, channels and other fluidic components on our IFCs that allow nanoliter quantities of fluids to be precisely manipulated within the IFC. We have developed commercial manufacturing processes to fabricate valves, channels, vias, and chambers with dimensions in the ten to 100 micron range, at high density and with high yields.
Integrated Fluidic Circuits
Our IFCs incorporate several different types of technology that together enable us to use MSL technology to rapidly design and deploy new microfluidic applications. The first level of our IFC technology is a library of components that perform basic microfluidic functions, such as pumps, mixers, single-cell capture chambers, separation columns, control logic, and reaction chambers. The second level of our IFC technology comprises the architectures we have designed to exploit our ability to conduct thousands of reactions on a single IFC. The third level of our IFC technology involves the interaction of our IFCs with the actual laboratory environment. Our IFCs are built on specially designed input frames that are compatible with most commonly used laboratory systems.
Instrumentation and Software
Our mass cytometry instrumentation technology includes a custom-designed inductively-coupled plasma ion source, ion-optical and vacuum systems, and instrument control electronics. With our Helios system, which is an enhanced version of our CyTOF 2 system, individual cells are atomized, ionized, and extracted. A time-of-flight mass analyzer separates atomic ions of different mass-to-charge ratios, providing information on temporal distribution of ions. The Hyperion Imaging System combines CyTOF technology with imaging capability to enable simultaneous interrogation of 4 to 37 protein markers in the spatial context of the tissue microenvironment.
Our Biomark HD system includes our custom thermal cycler, the FC1 cycler, and a sophisticated fluorescence imaging system. Our EP1 instrument is a fluorescence reader designed for end-point imaging, suitable for genotyping and digital PCR applications. Our C1 system combines the hardware elements of our IFC controllers and FC1 cycler with sophisticated scripting and protocol control software to enable automation of single-cell capture and preparation for subsequent analysis. Certain capabilities of the C1 system have been used to create our Juno system, which serves as a universal controller and cycler for our Dynamic Array IFCs. Our Polaris system combines the capabilities of all these instruments by incorporating thermal cycling, IFC control, environmental regulation, and imaging.
We have developed instrumentation technology to load samples and reagents onto our IFCs and to control and monitor reactions within our IFCs. Our line of IFC controllers consists of commercial pneumatic components and both custom and commercial electronics. They apply precise control of multiple pressures to move fluid and control valve states in a microfluidic IFC.
We have also developed specialized software to manage and analyze the unusually large amounts of data produced by our systems. Our bioinformatic toolset, the Singular software, facilitates the analysis and visualization of single-cell gene expression data. More recently, we extended the scope of the toolset to include DNA analysis tools. We also developed the C1 Script Builder software to enable customers to take full advantage of the flexibility of C1 IFC architecture by allowing them to program their own control scripts for the C1 system. We offer Fluidigm Cytobank, our cloud-based platform of analytical tools, for use with the Helios system.
Assays and Reagents
We manufacture metal-conjugated antibodies for use with our Helios system to allow detection of up to approximately 37 protein targets simultaneously in a single cell. Our metal-conjugated antibodies are manufactured using metal-chelating polymers, which are produced using proprietary polymerization processes and subsequent post-polymerization modifications.
Our Delta Gene and single-nucleotide polymorphism type, or SNP Type, assay products consist of assay design and custom content delivery systems for gene expression and genotyping, respectively. These offerings provide low-cost alternatives to chemistries such as TaqMan, and allow customers to use IFCs in more flexible ways. PCR assay reagents need to be specific to the gene targets of interest but the process of designing a set of assays may delay the implementation experiments or require the use of expensive pre-designed assays. We have developed a process to provide customers with validated assays for their targets of interest.

Market Opportunity
The current markets for our products include genomics and proteomics, predominantly among academic life science research customers, but also in various applied markets customers, such as clinical research laboratories, biopharmaceutical companies, biorepositories and agricultural biotechnology entities.
Markets:
Genomics
One primary area of focus within life science research is genetic analysis, the study of genes and their functions. The hereditary material or nucleic acid of an organism is often referred to as its genome, the protein-encoding regions of which are commonly known as genes. Analysis of variations in genomes, genes and gene activity in and between organisms can provide valuable insight into their health and functioning. Single-cell genomics is the study of the sequence and expression of genes and their ultimate functions at the individual cell level.
There are several forms of genetic analysis in use today, including genotyping, gene expression analysis and DNA sequencing.

• | Genotyping involves the analysis of DNA variations across individual genomes. There are multiple forms of variants, including single nucleotide polymorphism, or SNPs, insertion-deletions and copy number variation. A common application of genotyping focuses on analyzing SNPs to determine whether a SNP or group of SNPs are associated with a particular genetic trait, such as propensity for a disease.


• | Gene expression analysis involves measuring the levels of particular ribonucleic acid sequences known as messenger RNAs, or mRNAs, which have been transcribed from genes. Determining these levels is important because mRNAs are often translated by the cell into proteins, and may affect the activity of the cell or the larger organism.


• | DNA sequencing is a process by which researchers are able to determine the particular order of nucleotide bases that comprise all or a portion of a particular gene or genome, and typically improves with target enrichment, such as complex sample preparation and tagging processes. Researchers are increasingly using next-generation DNA sequencers to rapidly and cost-effectively sequence portions of genomes, which is important for the identification of genetic variations that correlate with particular phenotypes.

Gene expression and genotyping are studied through a combination of various technology platforms that characterize gene function and genetic variation. These platforms often rely on PCR, amplification to generate exponential copies of a DNA sample to provide sufficient signal to facilitate detection. Real-time quantitative PCR, or real-time qPCR, is a more advanced form of PCR that makes it possible to quantify the number of copies of DNA present in a sample.
Proteomics
Another focus within life science research is protein analysis, the study of proteins and their structures and functions. Proteins perform a vast array of functions within living organisms, including catalyzing metabolic reactions, replicating DNA, signaling response to stimuli and transporting molecules from one location to another. Protein analysis is required to profile and understand cellular function as well as the interaction in tissues and other complex microenvironments.
There are several forms of high-throughput protein analysis in use today, including mass spectrometry, traditional flow cytometry, immunohistochemistry and both suspension and imaging mass cytometry.

• | Mass spectrometry is an analytical chemistry technique that measures the mass-to-charge ratio in molecules using external electric and magnetic fields. Mass spectrometry techniques are limited to bulk samples and provide an understanding of global protein dynamics on a tissue or organism level, but does not alone enable researchers to analyze data at a single cell level.


• | Traditional flow cytometry utilizes a suspension of cells in a stream of fluid and passes them through an electronic detection apparatus to allow simultaneous multi-parameter analysis of the physical and chemical characteristics of up to thousands of cells per second. Although traditional flow cytometry technologies are high-throughput with

single-cell analysis capabilities, a key limitation is the use of fluorescent dyes to label antibodies for detection. These fluorescent labels have emission spectra that typically overlap, making it challenging to optimize reagents to analyze many protein markers at once. In general, the number of protein targets for conventional flow cytometry is less than about 10 with significant reagent optimization often involved.

• | Immunohistochemistry is a method by which cells in a tissue section are stained with antibodies and then imaged with a conventional or fluorescent microscope. Antibodies selected to bind to proteins of interest can be conjugated with either chromogenic or fluorescent labels, allowing cellular proteins to be visualized in spatial context. Immunohistochemistry is used broadly throughout the life sciences industry, and in clinical diagnostics, to diagnose and better understand the characteristics and relationship of cancerous versus normal cells in biopsy tissue. In general, the number of simultaneously imageable proteins is less than five, with researchers only able to achieve a higher-parameter resolution using serial sections (several adjacent sections of the same tissue) or other highly laborious, more serial staining methods.


• | Suspension mass cytometry is similar to traditional flow cytometry but is based primarily on antibodies using heavy metal isotope labels rather than fluorescent labels for detection of proteins, enabling the significant expansion of the number of parameters analyzed per individual cell versus conventional flow cytometry technologies. With high-throughput, single-cell analysis capabilities and the ability to analyze more protein markers per individual cell, researchers have more granular information, which allows them to identify and characterize even finer subpopulations of cells.


• | Imaging mass cytometry is similar to immunohistochemistry, but is also based primarily on antibodies using heavy metal isotope labels rather than fluorescent or chromogenic labels for detection of proteins. This method enables a significant expansion of the number of parameters simultaneously analyzed per tissue section rather than in adjacent sections or via serial staining protocols.

Customer Types:
Academic Life Science Research. A large portion of global life science research takes place in academic settings, including universities, publicly or philanthropically funded institutes, research hospitals and government-funded agencies. The activities conducted by these customers spans the entire range of products and services and are generally directed at producing new basic or translational biology insights for publication or presentation in peer-reviewed journals and forums. Many of the key breakthroughs in biological science employed or modified by clinical research laboratories, biopharmaceutical and other applied markets transpire first in the academic research setting. 
Clinical Research Laboratories. Recent advances in genetic analysis technology are increasingly being used for clinical research applications. Techniques such as SNP genotyping, gene expression analysis, targeted DNA sequencing and other genetic correlation studies, have been developed to identify disease susceptibility and to diagnose, classify and monitor disease progression. Prognostics and diagnostics based on measuring these genetic markers have the potential to be much more accurate and robust than conventional diagnostics. The validation and translation of prognostics and diagnostics into clinically available tests often requires life science automation systems that are able to measure multiple biomarkers efficiently in a large number of patient samples.
Biopharmaceuticals and Biotechnology. Biopharmaceutical companies use production scale genomic and proteomic analytical methods in numerous phases of the discovery, development and the approval process of a therapeutic agent.  These methods also may be used in companion diagnostics to attempt to reduce adverse events and identify patient populations that may more effectively respond to a therapeutic agent.
Biorepositories. Advancements in biology have led to an increased dependence on biorepositories to store genetic material for future testing and analysis. Flaws in the identity and quality of biorepository specimens are costly and result in erroneous data. To ensure sample integrity, biorepositories require cost-effective, simple and high-throughput techniques to identify DNA samples and ensure traceability throughout the banking and downstream analytical processes.
Agricultural Biotechnology. Ag-Bio applies scientific techniques, including genetic analysis techniques, such as SNP genotyping and DNA sequencing, to study and improve desired characteristics in plants, animals and microorganisms. Genetic analysis techniques have become increasingly useful in Ag-Bio applications, including wildlife population studies, agricultural quality control, and commercial genetic engineering and identification. Ag-Bio customers require systems that can quickly and accurately analyze a large number of samples, such as tissue from livestock populations or seeds from a production lot, in a high-throughput and cost-efficient manner.
Fluidigm’s Strategy
Key elements of our strategy include:

• | Offer innovative, differentiated products to researchers based on our microfluidic and mass cytometry technologies.


Our microfluidic technologies enable a scalable and sensitive solution in fields requiring high-throughput genomic analysis, whether this be for the analysis of gene expression profiles, genotyping or library preparation in advance of gene sequencing. Microfluidic solutions also enable single-cell genomic analysis across a broad menu of applications. Mass cytometry is a leading solution to analyze many cell-surface and intracellular proteins simultaneously in cell suspensions and tissues. Our products enable innovative methods to characterize cells and other sample types not commonly achieved with other technology analogues.

• | Expand addressable markets through attention to assay content, workflow efficiency, software improvements, and desirable strategic partnerships.


Our strategy devotes attention to building out applications, workflows and analytics to allow our customers better productivity, increasing the value of our toolsets. We have internally-developed and externally-partnered to enable our C1 system to enable the widest breadth of single-cell applications currently in the marketplace. Our content development strategy also includes our high-throughput genomics platforms for gene expression, genotyping and sequencing library preparations as well as our mass cytometry franchise. Our future assay development will leverage both in-house informatics as well as externally-partnered solutions to drive towards sample-to-answer functionality across all our platforms.
Marketing, Sales, Service and Support
We distribute our systems through our direct sales force and support organizations located in North America, Europe, and Asia-Pacific, and through distributors or sales agents in several European, Latin American, Middle Eastern, and Asia-Pacific countries. Our sales and marketing efforts are targeted at laboratory directors and principal investigators at leading companies and academic institutions who need reliable life science automation solutions or enabling new genomics and mass cytometry technologies for research or commercial purposes. 

Our sales process often involves numerous interactions and demonstrations with multiple people within an organization. Some potential customers conduct in-depth evaluations of the system, including running experiments on our system and competing systems. In addition, in most countries, sales to academic or governmental institutions require participation in a tender process involving preparation of extensive documentation and a lengthy review process. As a result of these factors and the budget cycles of our customers, our sales cycle, the time from initial contact with a customer to our receipt of a purchase order, can often be 12 months or longer.
As of December 31, 2017, we had 163 people employed in sales, technical support, and marketing, including 82 sales representatives and applications specialists located in the field. 
Customers
We sell our instruments to leading academic research institutions, translational research and medicine centers, cancer centers, clinical research laboratories, and biopharmaceutical, biotechnology and Ag-Bio companies. No single customer represented more than 10% of our total revenue for 2017, 2016, or 2015.
Manufacturing
Our manufacturing operations are primarily located in Singapore and Canada. Our facility in Singapore manufactures our genomics instruments, several of which are assembled at facilities of our contract manufacturers in Singapore, with testing and calibration of the assembled products performed at our Singapore facility. All of our IFCs for commercial sale and some IFCs for our research and development purposes are also fabricated at our Singapore facility. Our mass cytometry instruments for commercial sale, as well as for internal research and development purposes, are manufactured at our facility in Canada. We also manufacture assays and reagents at our facilities in the United States.

We rely on a limited number of suppliers for certain components and materials used in our products. Key components in our products that are supplied by sole or limited source suppliers include a specialized polymer and other specialized materials from which our IFC cores are fabricated, specialized custom camera lenses, fiber light guides, and other components required for the reader of our Biomark system; specialized pneumatic and electronic components for our C1, Juno, Callisto and Polaris systems, the electron multiplier detector included in, and the nickel sampler cone and certain metal isotopes used with, our Helios system; specially developed laser used in our Hyperion Imaging System; and certain raw materials for our Delta Gene and SNP Type assays and Access Array Target-Specific primers. The loss of a single or sole source supplier would require significant time and effort to locate and qualify an alternative source of supply, if at all, and could adversely impact our business. For additional information, please see the section entitled “Risk factors” in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K.
Research and Development 
We have assembled experienced research and development teams at our South San Francisco, California, Markham, Ontario, Canada, and Singapore locations with the scientific, engineering, software, bioinformatic, and process talent that we believe is required to grow our business. 
The largest component of our current research and development effort is in the areas of new products, new applications and new content. We developed a high-throughput C1 IFC (HT IFC) for handling up to 800 medium sized cell types applied to the work-flows of the Fluidigm installed base instruments. In the area of mass cytometry, we developed an initial prototype imaging mass cytometer instrument in 2016, and successfully launched the commercial Hyperion Imaging System in October 2017. The imaging mass cytometer system provides spatial resolution of protein expression in complex tissue samples at the single-cell level, quantitative measurement using metal isotope tags, and analysis of up to 37 proteins. We also developed metal-labeled antibodies compatible with formalin fixed paraffin embedded tissue samples, to be used with the Hyperion. We also invest significantly in research and development efforts to expand our single-cell and production genomics applications. For example, we continue to develop and commercialize various panel sets for cancer research for use with our systems. We successfully launched in 2017 the Advanta™ Immuno-Oncology Gene Expression Assay, which is a 170-gene expression qPCR assay that enables profiling of tumor immunobiology and new biomarker identification.
The second component of our research and development effort is to continuously develop new manufacturing processes and test methods to drive down manufacturing cost, increase manufacturing throughput, widen fabrication process capability, and support new microfluidic devices and designs.
Our research and development expenses were $30.8 million, $38.4 million, and $39.3 million in 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. As of December 31, 2017, 100 of our employees were engaged in research and development activities.
Competition
The life science markets are highly competitive and expected to grow more competitive with the increasing knowledge gained from ongoing research and development. We believe that the principal competitive factors in our target markets include cost of capital equipment and supplies; reputation among customers; innovation in product offerings; flexibility and ease of use; accuracy and reproducibility of results; and compatibility with existing laboratory processes, tools, and methods.
We compete with both established and development stage life science companies that design, manufacture, and market instruments for gene expression analysis, genotyping, other nucleic acid detection, protein expression analysis, and additional applications. In addition, a number of other companies and academic groups are in the process of developing novel technologies for life science markets. Many of our competitors enjoy several competitive advantages over us, including significantly greater name recognition; greater financial and human resources; broader product lines and product packages; larger sales forces and eCommerce channels; larger and more geographically dispersed customer support organization; substantial intellectual property portfolios; larger and more established customer bases and relationships; greater resources dedicated to marketing efforts; better established and larger scale manufacturing capability; and greater resources and longer experience in research and development. For additional information, please see the section entitled “Risk factors” in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K.
To successfully compete with existing products and future technologies, we need to demonstrate to potential customers that the performance of our technologies and products, the solutions we provide our customers, as well as our customer support capabilities, are superior to those of our competitors. To differentiate our company from other, larger enterprises, we need to introduce new and innovative offerings regularly and maintain a well-staffed commercial team “in 
the field” to successfully communicate the advantages of our products and overcome potential obstacles to acceptance of our products. In addition, ongoing collaborations and partnerships with key opinion leaders are desirable to demonstrate both biological innovation and applications that solve customer problems.

Government Regulation
Our products are currently labeled and sold for research purposes only, and we sell them to academic institutions, life sciences and clinical research laboratories that conduct research, and biopharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for non-diagnostic and non-clinical purposes. Our products are not intended for use in clinical practice in the diagnosis of disease or other conditions, and they are labeled for research use only. Accordingly, they are subject only to limited, specific regulation with respect to labeling by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA. In particular, while FDA regulations require that research use only products be labeled, “For Research Use Only. Not for use in diagnostic procedures,” or RUO products, the regulations do not subject such products to the FDA’s broader pre- and post-market controls for medical devices. 
In November 2013, the FDA issued a final guidance document stating that merely including a labeling statement that the product is for research purposes only will not necessarily render the device exempt from the FDA’s clearance, approval, or other regulatory requirements if the totality of circumstances surrounding the distribution of the product indicate that the manufacturer knows its product is being used by customers for diagnostic uses or the manufacturer intends such a use. These circumstances may include, among other things, written or verbal marketing claims regarding a product’s performance in clinical applications and a manufacturer’s provision of technical support for such activities. In the future, certain of our products or related applications could become subject to regulation as medical devices by the FDA. If we wish to label and market our products for use in performing clinical diagnostics, thus subjecting them to regulation by the FDA under premarket and postmarket control as medical devices, unless an exemption applies, we would be required to obtain either prior 510(k) clearance or prior pre-market approval from the FDA before commercializing the product. The FDA classifies medical devices into one of three classes. Devices deemed to pose lower risk to the patient are placed in either class I or II, which, unless an exemption applies, requires the manufacturer to submit a pre-market notification requesting FDA clearance for commercial distribution pursuant to Section 510(k) of the FFDCA. This process, known as 510(k) clearance, requires that the manufacturer demonstrate that the device is substantially equivalent to a previously cleared and legally marketed 510(k) device or a “pre-amendment” class III device for which pre-market approval applications, or PMAs, have not been required by the FDA. This FDA review process typically takes from four to twelve months, although it can take longer. Most class I devices are exempted from this 510(k) premarket submission requirement. Devices deemed by the FDA to pose the greatest risk, such as life-sustaining, life-supporting, or implantable devices, or those deemed not substantially equivalent to a legally marketed predicate device, are placed in class III. Class III devices typically require PMA approval. To obtain PMA approval, an applicant must demonstrate the reasonable safety and effectiveness of the device based, in part, on data obtained in clinical studies. PMA reviews generally last between one and two years, although they can take longer. Both the 510(k) and the PMA processes can be expensive and lengthy and may not result in clearance or approval. If we are required to submit our products for pre-market review by the FDA, we may be required to delay marketing and commercialization while we obtain premarket clearance or approval from the FDA. There would be no assurance that we could ever obtain such clearance or approval.
In some cases, our customers may use our RUO products in their own laboratory-developed tests, or LDTs, or in other FDA-regulated products for clinical diagnostic use. The FDA has historically exercised enforcement discretion in not 
enforcing the medical device regulations against LDTs and LDT manufacturers. However, on October 3, 2014, the FDA issued two draft guidance documents that set forth the FDA’s proposed risk-based framework for regulating LDTs, which are designed, manufactured, and used within a single laboratory. In January 2017, the FDA announced that it would not issue final guidance on the oversight of LDTs and LDT manufacturers, but would seek further public discussion on an appropriate oversight approach and give Congress an opportunity to develop a legislative solution. Any future legislative or administrative rule making or oversight of LDTs and LDT manufacturers if and when finalized, may impact the sales of our products and how customers use our products, and may require us to change our business model in order to maintain compliance with these laws.
We would become subject to additional FDA requirements if our products are determined to be medical devices or if we elect to seek 510(k) clearance or pre-market approval. We would need to continue to invest significant time and other resources to ensure ongoing compliance with FDA quality system regulations and other post-market regulatory requirements. For additional information, please see the section entitled “Risk factors” in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K.
International sales of medical devices are subject to foreign government regulations, which vary substantially from country to country. Outside of the EU, regulatory approval needs to be sought on a country-by-country basis in order to market medical devices. Although there is a trend towards harmonization of quality system, standards and regulations in each country may vary substantially which can affect timelines of introduction. 
Environmental Matters
We are subject to many federal, state, local, and foreign environmental regulations. To comply with applicable regulations, we have and will continue to incur significant expense and allocate valuable internal resources to manage compliance-related issues. In addition, such regulations could restrict our ability to expand or equip our facilities, or could require us to acquire costly equipment or to incur other significant expenses to comply with the regulations. For example, the Restriction on the Use of Certain Hazardous Substances in Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive, or RoHS, and the Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive, or WEEE, enacted in the European Union, regulate the use of certain hazardous substances in, and require the collection, reuse, and recycling of waste from, products we manufacture. Certain of our products sold in these countries are subject to RoHS and WEEE requirements. If we fail to comply with any present and future regulations, we could be subject to future fines, penalties, and restrictions, such as the suspension of manufacturing of our products or a prohibition on the sale of products we manufacture. For additional information, please see the section entitled “Risk factors” in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K.
Additionally, our research and development and manufacturing processes involve the controlled use of hazardous materials, including flammables, toxics, corrosives, and biologics. Our research and manufacturing operations produce hazardous biological and chemical waste products. We seek to comply with applicable laws regarding the handling and disposal of such materials. The volume of such materials used or generated at our facilities is small. However, we cannot eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or discharge and any resultant injury from these materials. We do not currently maintain separate environmental liability coverage and any such contamination or discharge could result in significant cost to us in penalties, damages, and suspension of our operations.
Geographic Area Information
During the last three years, a majority of our revenue was generated within the United States and Europe and a majority of our long-lived assets were located within the United States, in Singapore and in Canada. Total revenue received from customers outside the United States totaled $56.1 million, or 55% of our total revenue, in 2017, compared to $51.8 million, or 50% of our total revenue, in 2016, and $59.3 million, or 52% of our total revenue, in 2015. Please see Note 11 to our audited consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding geographic areas.
Seasonality
In 2011, 2012, 2014 and 2015, our product revenue was higher in the fourth quarter of the year than in the first quarter of the next year reflecting numerous factors, including, among others, seasonal variations in customer operations and customer budget and capital spending cycles. However, this trend did not occur in 2013 and 2016 with an increase in revenue in the first quarters of 2014 and 2017, respectively.
Raw Materials
Certain raw materials used in our Delta Gene and SNP Type assays and Access Array target-specific primers are available from a limited number of sources. Additionally, certain metals used in our Maxpar reagents are available from a sole source. Currently, we do not have supply agreements with these suppliers. While we generally attempt to keep our inventory at minimal levels, we purchase incremental inventory as circumstances warrant to protect our supply chain.
Backlog
We manufacture products based on forecasts of our customers’ demand and advance non-binding commitments from customers as to future purchases. Our customers generally do not place purchase orders far in advance. A substantial portion of our products are sold on the basis of standard purchase orders that are cancelable prior to shipment without penalty. Accordingly, backlog at any given time is not a meaningful indicator of future sales.
Employees
As of December 31, 2017, we had 505 employees, of which  work in research and development,  work in general and administrative, 141 work in manufacturing, and 163 work in sales, technical support, and marketing. None of our employees are represented by a labor union nor are they subject to a collective bargaining agreement.
