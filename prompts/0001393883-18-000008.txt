2017 Highlights
2017 Progress on Key Strategic Goals: Transition to Tech-Focused
In 2017, we made significant progress against the objective of our Tech-focused strategy that we announced in the fourth quarter of 2016. We realigned our organizational structure to more effectively allocate resources behind the most critical businesses and initiatives, and we began implementing key initiatives to enhance our value proposition for technology professionals and recruiting customers. Our intensified focus and commitment to delivering highly relevant career insights for technology professionals and highly-skilled technology talent for recruiters is strengthening our position as a leading online talent solutions platform for the fast growing field that is expanding across all industries.
Company Profile
DHI was incorporated in Delaware on June 28, 2005 and is a leading provider of data, insights and employment connections through our specialized services for technology professionals and other select online communities. Our mission is to empower tech professionals and organizations to compete and win through expert insights and relevant employment connections by delivering three key value propositions:
 5


• | Providing the most efficient solution for recruiters and employers;


• | Delivering the most relevant technology career related content; and


• | Aggregating and analyzing data to deliver specialized insights.

The majority of our revenues today are generated through the sale of recruitment packages, which allow customers to post jobs on our websites and source candidates through our resume databases and Open Web searches. Recruitment packages are typically provided through contractual arrangements with annual, monthly or interim terms.
Our Products and Services
We help organizations find the best talent, and we help professionals find the best jobs and advance their careers. We do this through a number of products, including:

• | Resume databases. Each of our brands provides powerful, detailed searches of a large number of candidate resumes. Showing customers the right talent makes their recruiting efforts more efficient. 


• | Job postings. Our job collections are focused on specific verticals, notably technology, making it easier for professionals to search for relevant jobs. In turn, the applications received by our customers are more likely to be relevant and qualified compared to applications received from generalist sites. Thus, showing professionals the right job postings benefits both the talent and the recruiting organization. 


• | Open Web. Our Open Web technology searches over 200 online sources to append and create profiles of a candidate’s professional experience, contributions, history and capabilities (as well as their passions and interests). This allows our customers to build broader pools of talent from across the web, gives them deeper insights into talent they discover, and allows them to engage prospective candidates with a differentiated message. 


• | Content and data. Each of our brands provides tailored content to help professionals manage their careers and provide employers insight into recruiting strategies and trends. In addition, some of our brands offer data products specific to their industries.

Our Industry 
We primarily operate in the talent discovery and acquisition segment of the broader market for human capital management services through vertically-oriented career sites. There is a shortage of skilled professionals worldwide and we believe that the overall demand for talent acquisition and career development products and services has significant long-term growth potential. 
 7

We also believe that certain industries that employ highly-skilled and highly-paid professionals will experience particularly strong demand for effective recruiting solutions due to the scarcity of such professionals. For example, as of December 2017, the seasonally unadjusted U.S. unemployment rate was 2.4% for computer-related occupations and 1.5% in the finance sector, as compared to the overall national average of 4.1%, seasonally adjusted. Historically, the unemployment rate for college graduates has been lower than the unemployment rate for the U.S. overall. As of December 2017, the seasonally unadjusted unemployment rate for college graduates was 2.0%. 
We believe that there are five major trends that will continue to shape demand for talent acquisition services:

• | Greater competition for professional talent. The candidate-employer relationship has changed, with the balance of power shifting towards the candidates. The length of time to fill positions is an indicator of the availability of qualified talent in the labor market. Our proprietary indicator of time to fill an open position, the DHI-DFH Vacancy Duration Measure, indicates that the mean time to fill a position was 27.9 days in November 2017, nearly seven days longer five years ago when the average was 21.3 days. The longest time-to-fill was in April 2017 at 30.3 days.


• | Sourcing of talent will become more mainstream. Companies are increasingly engaging in ongoing sourcing to build robust candidate pools for both “just in time” candidates as well as future hiring needs. This means recruiters must proactively identify and build relationships with professionals ahead of the creation of a specific job opening. Plus, our proprietary Dice data found a majority of tech professionals surveyed would take a pay cut if given the option to telecommute most of the time.


• | Continued professional interest in career brands specific to industry and skills. Our services focus on domains or industries that require specialized skills and knowledge and, thus, customized content, profiles and search parameters. In addition, the professionals in our verticals often share a sense of personal identity and community that goes beyond the confines of their careers. We believe that both specialized skills and the sense of personal identity and community lead professionals in our verticals to prefer specialized career brands over generalist ones. 


• | Talent attraction and retention becoming more of a strategic priority for companies. The PWC 2017 US CEO Survey found that 31% of U.S. CEOs are ‘extremely concerned’ about the availability of key skills as a threat to their organizations’ growth prospects (an additional 45% are ‘somewhat concerned’). In this environment where top talent is hard to find, organizations are increasingly prioritizing retention of talent. According to Deloitte’s Global Human Capital Trends 2017, more than 10,000 human resource and business leaders across 140 countries reported that they see a need to redesign the organization to drive engagement and retention, improve leadership, and build a meaningful culture. 


• | Increased use of data and analytics in human capital management and increased need for insights. As many companies prove the power of analytics in marketing and other business domains, organizations are seeking to gain a competitive advantage by applying data-driven insights to improve their hiring, retention and leadership capabilities. According to Deloitte’s Global Human Capital Trends 2017, 71% of surveyed companies believe that using people analytics is ‘very important or important.’ 

In this environment, we believe there is an opportunity for career management and talent acquisition tools that leverage the common interests, goals and skills of select professional communities. We believe that a focus on professional communities allows organizations to more efficiently identify talent, with more complete data and insights about that talent.
Our Value Proposition
We are a leading provider of data, insights and employment connections through specialized online professional communities organized around tech professional interests and skill sets. This specialized approach provides tech and fintech professionals with more relevant career related information and opportunities, enhancing their ability to maximize their careers. Through engaging with tech professionals we are able to build rich and unique data sets around valuable talent pools. The combination of our focused online professional websites and rich data sets allows organizations to find and hire professional tech talent more efficiently and effectively, and therefore incentivizes them to source talent through our online professional communities. The benefits our services provide to both tech professionals and recruiting customers create a robust marketplace.
Benefits we provide to Professionals
Relevant employment connections. When professionals post their resumes or apply for jobs on our websites, they can make valuable connections with organizations who prize their skills and expertise. Professionals can avoid having to “sort through the clutter” on generalist career sites, and get the most out of their time by using our more focused services. 
Skills/industry-specific career management tools, information and insights. We provide professionals with targeted and relevant career development tools, content and news. For example, Dice and ClearanceJobs provide professionals with market and salary information and local market trends. In addition, the Dice Careers Mobile App allows professionals to evaluate their 
 8

market value and map out which skills will increase their value. eFinancialCareers provides industry-specialized online career content, as well as career guides targeted to college and graduate students. We believe our career development services and tools provide professionals with the insights they need to propel their careers forward, and thus increase the engagement of professionals with our sites.
Benefits we provide to our Customers
Large pools of qualified and hard-to-reach professionals. We seek to improve the efficiency of the recruiting process for our customers by providing efficient access to large pools of highly qualified and hard-to-reach professionals. Because the communities of professionals who visit our websites are highly-skilled and specialized within specific industries, we believe our customers who post jobs receive applications from candidates who are better qualified for the positions, and that they receive fewer irrelevant applications than when using generalist sites. In addition, since our resume data and resume search functions are highly tailored by specialty, we believe that our customers can more efficiently identify talent using our resume databases than by using broader services.
Relevant information on prospective candidates. We believe that the specialized nature of our job posting and resume search products makes them inherently more relevant and efficient for recruiting. In addition, our Open Web product creates an aggregated profile of a professional’s experience, contributions, and capabilities as well as their passions and interests. Using all of these products together gives our customers the most complete view of a prospective candidate, and allows them to not only identify the best talent but also tailor their recruiting approach to each individual.
Hyper-targeted candidate outreach and employer branding. We offer recruiting customers the ability to target hard-to-find professionals with messages in the online forums they frequent. Our Lengo service leverages our Open Web capabilities to assemble candidate target lists based on specific factors like skill sets, work experience, location, or interests; then executes hyper-targeted employer branding or job search campaigns in online forums where specific potential candidates spend time. 
Skills assessment and certification. Through our partnership with HackerEarth, the world's largest platform for technology skills assessment and hackathons, Dice customers can screen and qualify candidates across 32 different programming languages, improving the efficiency and efficacy of the recruiting process. Tech professionals benefit by demonstrating proficiency in valuable tech skills that enhance their marketability and value. 
Our Strategic Goals
Our goal is to become the leading technology talent acquisition resource serving and engaging tech professionals across a variety of industries. There are four components to our tech-focused strategy:
Focus resources behind our core tech talent brands. We believe that focusing on technology talent acquisition provides us with the best opportunity to win in our increasingly competitive industry. Moreover, to capture the technology market opportunity we need to move quickly, so we plan to focus incremental investments behind the businesses that fall within our tech-focused portfolio - Dice, eFinancialCareers, and ClearanceJobs.

• | Deepen the integration of Open Web with Dice through enhanced data analytic capabilities and new go-to-market strategies;


• | Improve performance attribution for tech-focused talent acquisition brands by accelerating integration with customers’ applicant tracking systems (ATS); and


• | Launch new value-add Dice recruitment products, such as the HackerEarth partnership announced in January 2017.

Deepen engagement with tech professionals. A key conclusion from our strategic review was that in today’s evolving digital media ecosystem it is critical for our success to have meaningful engagement with professionals in order to gain insights and information about professionals that are valuable to our recruiting customers. 

• | Offer technology professionals a comprehensive career management platform that provides skill specific insights that help align professionals goals and careers; and


• | Increase the adoption and utility of the Dice Careers App to increase engagement with technology professionals.

Invest further in solutions that address evolving recruiting needs. As our industry continues to evolve, the talent acquisition ecosystem is becoming more complex and recruiters are pursuing more sophisticated search strategies. This environment creates demand for a variety of recruitment solutions, such as social sourcing, and targeted employer branding, among others, that are likely to gain share within the online and broader talent acquisition market in the coming years. We possess a set of solutions that are well positioned to benefit from this trend, which we believe will be a key source of growth for our company.

• | Further leverage our data aggregation and analysis capabilities through services like Lengo with our tech-focused talent acquisition brands to offer customers more comprehensive solutions.

Acquire complementary assets to accelerate growth. The ongoing evolution and fragmentation of our market provides us with the opportunity to launch or acquire new services to enhance our offering to professionals and recruiting customers.
Marketing and Sales
We focus our long-term marketing efforts on growing the number of professionals who visit and engage with our websites, which we believe increases the attractiveness of our websites to our customers. We use a combination of direct marketing, branding and communications initiatives to increase our brand awareness, traffic, new resumes posted and applications to job postings. We primarily engage in search engine marketing, online advertising, and participation in industry events, social media marketing and content marketing. Many of our brands use strategic alliances with relevant publishers, trade associations and industry groups to increase reach and traffic. Some of our brands have also invested in broader awareness campaigns that include outdoor advertising in select cities where competition for their respective specializations is high.
Our customer marketing efforts are primarily focused on lead generation activities, such as email campaigns and participation in industry events. We also use marketing communications, such as media relations, social media, and thought leadership content, to enhance brand awareness and client relationships. 
We sell our products primarily through our direct sales force. We have a number of direct sales teams organized by brand, market segment, and geography. Our field sales groups target Fortune 1000 companies, large staffing and recruiting firms and other large and mid-size businesses. Our in-house sales teams focus on generating new business from recruiters and small- and mid-size companies, renewing customer contracts, increasing the service levels customers’ purchase and servicing the needs of our largest clients. As of December 31, 2017, we employed approximately 107 sales personnel in the United States and approximately 83 in the rest of the world. In addition to our internal sales organization, we also use ad networks to help generate ad sales. 
 We also maintain teams of account managers and customer support specialists who work to ensure customers get the most from our products and services by providing training and assistance. In addition, our customer support departments perform some compliance functions, such as reviewing the websites for false or inaccurate job postings.
Customers
We currently serve a diversified customer base consisting of approximately 15,000 customers in total. No one customer accounted for more than 10% of our revenues in 2017. Our customers include small, mid-sized and large direct employers, staffing companies, recruiting agencies, consulting firms and marketing departments of companies. As of December 31, 2017, notable customers of the Tech-focused segment included Allegis, AT&T, Adecco, Amazon, Apple, Blackrock, Bloomberg, BNY Mellon, Cisco, Dell, Experis, GM Financial, Goldman Sachs, IBM, JP Morgan Chase, Kforce, Microsoft, Moody’s, Morgan Stanley, NCI, Oracle, Robert Half, Samsung, Standard Chartered Bank, UBS, and UPS. Notable customers of the Corp & Other segment included Fairmont, Four Seasons, Great Wolf Resorts, Hilton, Hyatt, IHG, La Quinta, Loews Hotels, Mandarin Oriental, Marriott, and Wyndham. See Item 7 for a description of the segments.
Technology
We use a variety of open source and proprietary technologies to support our website services.  Our websites provide a multi-tenancy technology platform with multiple application services developed to perform at scale.  We primarily utilize Amazon Web Services ("AWS") as our cloud infrastructure platform, which enables us to scale our compute, network, and storage capacity on an as-needed basis.  Our application services and data connections are monitored 24/7 for performance and stability.  Our application and infrastructure architecture enables us to ensure global reach, as well as advantages in resiliency and cloud delivery.  Job seekers and customers can access our website services with any standard web browser, mobile web browsers, and iOS and Android applications. Our websites also utilize AWS disaster recovery, redundancy, and resiliency services, including multi-availability zone, multi-region, redundant storage and networking solutions, and self-healing capabilities. 
Competition
The market for talent acquisition services is highly competitive with multiple online and offline competitors. With the evolution of the online recruiting model, there has been an increasing need to provide ease-of-use and relevance to 
 10

professionals, as well as an efficient and cost-effective recruitment method for direct employers, recruiters and staffing companies. Additionally, further technological advancements have made it easier for new competitors to emerge with minimal barriers to entry, and advertisers have many alternatives available to reach their target audiences. Our ability to maintain our existing customer base and generate new customers depends to a significant degree on the quality of our candidate databases and audiences, the quality of our services, our ability to enhance our websites and the underlying technology of our websites to meet the needs of a rapidly-evolving marketplace, our pricing strategy and ability to introduce value-added products and services, and our reputation among our customers and potential customers, who are increasingly-sophisticated and demanding. Our competitors include: 


• | social and professional networking sites, such as LinkedIn, Facebook, Twitter and Google;


• | niche or specialist professional networking sites such as GitHub and Stack Overflow;


• | generalist job boards, some of which have substantially greater resources and brand recognition than we do, such as CareerBuilder, Monster, StepStone, and Seek which, unlike specialized job boards, permit customers to enter into a single contract to find professionals across multiple occupational categories and attempt to fill all of their hiring needs through a single website;


• | aggregators and distributors of job postings and profiles, including Indeed (owned by Recruit), TalentBin (owned by Monster Worldwide), Entelo, ZipRecruiter, Google and Craigslist;


• | career-focused community sites such as Glassdoor;


• | newspaper and magazine publishers, national and regional advertising agencies, executive search firms and search and selection firms that carry classified advertising, many of whom have developed, begun developing or acquired new media capabilities, such as recruitment websites, or have partnered with generalist job boards;


• | specialized services focused specifically on the industries we service, such as FT.com, Oilandgasjobsearch.com (owned by CareerBuilder), Doximity, Upwork and JobServe;


• | new and emerging competitors with new business models and products;


• | our customers, who seek to recruit candidates directly by using their own resources, including corporate websites; and


• | general business sites and print publications, as well as technology news and information community sites, such as Google News, Digg.com and Reddit.com.

Intellectual Property 
We seek to protect our intellectual property through a combination of service marks, trademarks, copyrights and other methods of restricting disclosure of our proprietary or confidential information. We have one or more patent applications pending for some of our current services. As we continue to develop and improve our technology, patents may become a more significant part of our intellectual property in the foreseeable future. We generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants and vendors. We also seek to control access to and distribution of our technology, documentation and other proprietary information.
We generally pursue the registration of the material service marks we own in the United States and internationally, as applicable. We own a number of registered, applied for and/or unregistered trademarks and service marks that we use in connection with our businesses. Our trademarks and registered trademarks in the United States and other countries include DICE, CLEARANCEJOBS.COM, RIGZONE, EFINANCIALCAREERS, and HCAREERS.COM. Registrations for trademarks may be maintained indefinitely, as long as the trademark owner continues to use and police the trademarks and timely renews registrations with the applicable governmental office. Although we generally pursue the registration of our material service marks and other material intellectual property we own, where applicable, we have trademarks and/or service marks that have not been registered in the United States and/or other jurisdictions. We have not registered the copyrights in the content of our websites and do not intend to register such copyrights.
The steps we have taken to protect our copyrights, trademarks, service marks and other intellectual property may not be adequate, and third parties could infringe, misappropriate or misuse our intellectual property. If this were to occur, it could harm our reputation and affect our competitive position. See Item 1A. “Risk Factors-Misappropriation or misuse of our intellectual property could harm our reputation, affect our competitive position and cost us money.”

Within the websites, the information that is collected, stored and used has been provided by the professionals or customers with the intent of making it publicly available. We do not ask professionals or customers to supply social security numbers. Our business data is separated from website operations by a variety of security layers including network segmentation, physical and logical access controls, firewalls, and many industry-accepted, best-practice information security controls.
We post our privacy policies on our websites so that our users can access and understand the terms and conditions applicable to the collection, storage and use of information collected from users.

We are subject to a number of government regulations, both domestic and foreign, that regulate our products and online service offerings, including content, copyright infringement, user privacy, advertising and promotional activities, taxation, access charges, liability for third-party activities and jurisdiction. In addition, federal, state, local and foreign governmental organizations have enacted and also are considering, and may consider in the future, other legislative and regulatory proposals that would regulate the Internet.

The interpretation of these privacy and data protection laws and various regulators’ approach to their enforcement, as well as our products and services, continue to evolve over time. We face the risk that these laws may be interpreted and applied in conflicting ways in different jurisdictions or in a manner that is not consistent with our current data protection practices, or that new and unclear laws will be enacted. There currently are a number of proposals pending before federal, state, and foreign legislative and regulatory bodies. In addition, the new European General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) will take effect in May 2018 and will apply to all of our European operations. The GDPR will include operational requirements for companies that receive or process personal data of residents of the European Union that are different than those currently in place in the European Union, and will include significant penalties for non-compliance. Similarly, there are a number of legislative proposals in the United States, at both the federal and state level, that could impose new obligations in areas affecting our business. In addition, some countries are considering or have passed legislation implementing data protection requirements or requiring local storage and processing of data or similar requirements.
Complying with these varying domestic and foreign requirements could cause us to incur additional costs and change our business practices. Further, any failure by us to adequately protect our users’ privacy and data could result in a loss of confidence in our products and services and, ultimately, in a loss of customers, which could have an adverse effect on our business.
Furthermore, favorable laws may change, including for example in the United States where the FCC recently voted to repeal net neutrality regulations. Given uncertainty around these rules, including changing interpretations, amendments or repeal, coupled with potentially significant political and economic power of local network operators, we could experience discriminatory or anti-competitive practices that could impede our growth, cause us to incur additional expense or otherwise negatively affect our business. 
The application of laws and regulations affecting online business to our products and services is often unclear, and these laws and how various jurisdictions interpret these laws continue to evolve. Compliance with these laws may be expensive and could harm our business. Any failure by the Company to comply with these laws and regulations could result in actions against us by governmental authorities or other entities, which could harm our business, including governmental or court orders that we cease certain activities.
See Item 1A. “Risk Factors-Our business is subject to U.S. and foreign government regulation of the Internet and taxation, which may have a material adverse effect on our business.”
