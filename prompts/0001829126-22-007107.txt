Description of Business
 
Ameriguard Security Services, Inc. (formerly known as Health Revenue Assurance Holdings, Inc.)

On February 10, 2012, HRAA entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger and Reorganization (the “Merger Agreement”) with Health Revenue Assurance Holdings, Inc. (formerly known as Anvex International, Inc., “HRAH”), a Nevada company, and its wholly-owned subsidiary Health Revenue Acquisition Corporation (“Acquisition Sub”), which was treated for accounting purposes as a reverse recapitalization with HRAA, considered the accounting acquirer. Each share of HRAA’s common stock was exchanged for the right to receive approximately 1,271 shares of HRAH’s common stock. Before their entry into the Merger Agreement, no material relationship existed between HRAH and Acquisition Sub or HRAA.
