Overview 
 Our mission is to cure Duchenne muscular dystrophy, or Duchenne, a genetic muscle-wasting disease predominantly affecting boys. Duchenne is a progressive, irreversible and ultimately fatal disease that affects approximately one in every 3,500 to 5,000 live male births and has an estimated prevalence of 5,000 to 15,000 cases in the United States alone. Duchenne is caused by mutations in the dystrophin gene, which result in the absence or near-absence of dystrophin protein. Dystrophin protein works to strengthen muscle fibers and protect them from daily wear and tear. Without functioning dystrophin and certain associated proteins, muscles suffer excessive damage from normal daily activities and are unable to regenerate, leading to the build-up of fibrotic, or scar, and fat tissue. There is no cure for Duchenne and, for the vast majority of patients, there are no satisfactory symptomatic or disease-modifying treatments. Our efforts are focused on our lead product candidate, SGT-001, a gene transfer candidate under investigation for its ability to drive functional dystrophin protein expression in patients’ muscles and improve the course of the disease, as well as SGT-003, our next-generation gene therapy candidate for the treatment of Duchenne. 
 For patients suffering from Duchenne, symptoms usually begin to manifest between three and five years of age, when they fail to reach developmental milestones or experience motor function challenges, such as difficulty walking or climbing stairs. As the disease progresses, patients with Duchenne experience frequent falls; can no longer run, play sports or perform most daily functions; and are further weakened by physical activity. By their early teens, Duchenne patients typically lose their ability to walk and ultimately become dependent on a wheelchair for mobility. By their 20s, patients essentially become paralyzed from the neck down and require a ventilator to breathe. Though disease severity and life expectancy vary, a Duchenne patient’s quality of life dramatically decreases over time, with death typically occurring by early adulthood from either cardiac or respiratory complications. 
 Our founders, who are personally touched by the disease, created a biotechnology company purpose-built to accelerate the discovery and development of meaningful therapies for all patients affected by Duchenne. Through this disease-focused business model, our research team, led by experts in Duchenne biology and drug development, along with key opinion leaders in Duchenne, continuously evaluate emerging science to identify high-potential product candidates. Our selection process includes extensive diligence and initial pharmacology research with highly specific, predefined criteria, which provide us with confidence in our development program decisions. Through this data-driven selection process, we have evaluated a number of programs and identified gene therapy as a potentially beneficial approach for Duchenne, and thus initiated development of our product candidates SGT-001 and SGT-003. 
 Our product candidates 
 SGT-001 and SGT-003 are gene transfer candidates. Gene transfer, a type of gene therapy, is designed to address diseases caused by mutated genes through the delivery of functional versions of those genes, called transgenes. The transgenes are then utilized by the body to produce proteins that are absent or not functional prior to treatment, potentially offering long-lasting beneficial clinical effects. SGT-001 and SGT-003 are designed to address the underlying genetic cause of Duchenne by delivering a synthetic transgene that produces dystrophin-like protein that is only expressed in muscles of the body, including cardiac and respiratory muscles. Our SGT-001 and SGT-003 vectors are derived from a naturally occurring, non-pathogenic virus called adeno-associated virus, or AAV, which were selected for their ability to efficiently enter skeletal, diaphragm and cardiac muscle tissues. The vectors are designed to carry a synthetic dystrophin transgene construct, called microdystrophin, that retains the most critical components of the full-size dystrophin gene yet is small enough to fit within AAV packaging constraints. These components not only include the domains necessary to confer protection against muscle damage, but also to drive the expression of key dystrophin associated proteins, such as neuronal Nitric Oxide Synthase, or nNOS. Inclusion of this nNOS coding region of the dystrophin protein may result in microdystrophin protein that has unique activity, restore nitric oxide production in the muscle and potentially provide important functional benefits such as diminished muscle fatigue and protection against ischemic muscle damage. 
 SGT-001
 SGT-001 is our lead gene transfer candidate and utilizes an AAV9 vector. In our Investigational New Drug Application, or IND, enabling preclinical program, we have studied the efficacy, safety and durability of SGT-001 in multiple preclinical models and its functional benefits in Duchenne animal studies. In contrast to some other therapeutic approaches, SGT-001 is not designed to target specific mutations in the dystrophin gene. 
 SGT-001 has been granted Rare Pediatric Disease Designation, and Fast Track Designation, in the United States and Orphan Drug Designations in both the United States and European Union. The safety and efficacy of SGT-001 are under evaluation in an open-label, single-ascending dose Phase I/II clinical trial called IGNITE DMD.
 1

We initiated IGNITE DMD in the fourth quarter of 2017 to evaluate SGT-001 in ambulatory and non-ambulatory males with Duchenne aged four to 17 years. The primary objectives of IGNITE DMD are to assess the safety and tolerability of SGT-001, as well as efficacy as defined by SGT-001 microdystrophin protein expression. The clinical trial is also designed to assess other parameters of muscle function and mass, respiratory and cardiovascular function, serum and muscle biomarkers associated with SGT-001 microdystrophin production, SGT-001 microdystrophin associated biochemical properties (e.g., nNOS binding) and patient and parent reported outcomes and quality of life measures, among other endpoints.
 Patient Dosing
 To date, nine patients have been dosed in IGNITE DMD with SGT-001. In 2021, we dosed three patients in February (Patient 7), April (Patient 8) and November (Patient 9) in the 2E14 vg/kg cohort with SGT-001. All three patients were dosed with our second generation manufacturing process. Patients 7 and 9 were safely dosed, with transient and manageable adverse events, none of which were serious. Patient 8 experienced a systemic inflammatory response which has since fully resolved. The event was classified as a serious adverse event, or SAE, and considered to be drug related. The type of event is described in our Investigators Brochure and is not considered unexpected. Following the dosing of Patient 8, we conducted an extensive review of all clinical data from IGNITE DMD, which resulted in a strengthened risk mitigation plan that was submitted to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or the FDA, and implemented prior to the dosing of the Patient 9. 
Clinical Data
 In 2021, we reported long-term biomarker data from biopsies of skeletal muscle from IGNITE DMD Patients 4-6 taken 24 months, 18 months and 12 months post-dosing, respectively. In addition, we reported interim safety and efficacy data for motor function as assessed by North Star Ambulatory Assessment, or NSAA, and 6-Minute Walk Test, or 6MWT, pulmonary function as assessed by pulmonary function tests, or PFTs, including forced vital capacity, or FVC, peak expiratory flow, or PEF, and forced expiratory volume in one second, or FEV1, as well as patient reported outcome measures, or PROMs, as assessed by the key functional domains of the Pediatric Outcomes Data Collection Instrument, or PODCI.
 In March 2022, we announced two-year interim safety and efficacy data from the first three Patients (Patients 4-6) treated with SGT-001 in the 2E14 vg/kg dose cohort of IGNITE DMD. Results suggested durable benefit 24-months post-administration of SGT-001, when compared to natural history. These data were consistent with results reported at the 12-month and 18-month time periods for the same patients. The average age of Patients 4-6 at the two year timepoint was 10.4 years. 
 Data from Patients 4-6 suggested sustained motor function at two years post-infusion, as assessed by 6MWT and NSAA, against expected natural history declines. In addition, the data suggested improved pulmonary function, as measured by FVC and PEF, and sustained or improved PROMs as assessed in key functional domains of the PODCI when compared to both baseline and natural history.

The following table summarizes the interim efficacy results of Patients 4-6 of the 2E14 vg/kg cohort in IGNITE DMD at 12-months, 18-months and 24-months post-dosing. Data are presented as mean change from baseline at each respective timepoint and as the mean change from natural history at the 24-month timepoint. Mean difference from natural history is calculated as the difference between mean change from baseline for Patients 4-6 at 24-months and the expected changes from baseline in each measure over 24 months, based on published natural history studies:

 In March 2022, we reported data from skeletal muscle biopsies collected three months after infusion of SGT-001 from the most recently dosed Patients 7-9.  The range by immunofluorescence of 1% to 50% and by western blot of Below the 5% Limit of Quantification (BLQ) to 6.8%, were within the range of previously dosed Patients 4-6 in the high dose cohort. Microdystrophin expression levels for all six patients dosed in the high dose cohort (Patients 4-9) ranged from 1 to 70% by immunofluorescence and BLQ to 17.5% by western blot. All six patients dosed with SGT-001 in the high dose cohort have demonstrated microdystrophin expression and proper membrane localization.
 No new drug-related safety findings have been identified in Patients 1-9 in post-dosing periods of 90 days to approximately four years. We continue to follow dosed patients and collect data to support the potential benefit of SGT-001.
 
Manufacturing
 Taking into account the prevalence and incidence of Duchenne and the anticipated dosing requirements for gene transfer, we anticipate that there will be a need for a substantial supply of SGT-001 for clinical trials and, if approved, for commercial markets. Through significant targeted investments to address this challenge, we have developed a manufacturing process that we believe can scale to adequately support our needs for clinical trials, commercial launch and beyond. Our in-house scientists are continuing to work to increase the productivity, efficiency and purity of our manufacturing process.
 
SGT-003
 SGT-003 is our next-generation gene transfer candidate. It is comprised of our nNOS binding domain microdystrophin transgene and muscle-specific promoter present in SGT-001 and uses a novel, rationally designed AAV capsid, candidate, selected for potentially enhanced muscle tropism, to deliver these components to target tissues. We believe that the properties of this novel capsid may allow for enhanced benefit over therapies using traditional capsids, potentially both in terms of efficacy and safety. 
 We plan to submit an Investigational New Drug, or IND, application for SGT-003 in early 2023 and initiate IND-enabling studies in 2022.
 We have selected a manufacturing process that we believe can scale to adequately support our needs for clinical trials, commercial launch and beyond. Our in-house scientists are continuing to work in close partnership with our Contract Development and Manufacturing, or CDMO, partner to increase both yield and quality of our manufacturing.

Platform technologies
 In addition to our gene transfer candidates, we have development programs focusing on platform technologies, including dual gene expression, a technology that allows us to package multiple transgenes into one vector, as well as novel capsids. These programs are part of our ongoing research efforts to develop innovative technologies that we believe may hold potential to translate into meaningful treatments and drive our future pipeline expansion.
 
Preclinical data in both wild-type and disease animal models demonstrate that we have developed a library of novel capsids that have shown increased muscle tropism with concomitant decreased liver biodistribution, resulting in improved efficiency compared to AAV9.  
 In conjunction with our development of SGT-001 and SGT-003, we believe it is critical to continue to investigate tools and technologies designed to help us more effectively understand Duchenne, accurately monitor disease progression and assist patients in daily life. As part of this goal, we are evaluating the use of sensor-based technologies that may allow us to identify biomarkers that measure the therapeutic impact of potential product candidates better and better measure the therapeutic impact of potential product candidates. 
 Who we are 
 Solid Biosciences was founded in 2013 by our Chief Executive Officer, Ilan Ganot, our former Chairman of the Board, Andrey Zarur, our former President, Gilad Hayeem, a former board member, Matthew Arnold, and our Vice President, Patient Advocacy, Annie Ganot, with the goal of developing meaningful therapies for patients with Duchenne. Solid is the English translation of Eytani, the Hebrew name of Ilan and Annie Ganot’s son, who was diagnosed with the disease in 2012. Our founders, unsatisfied with the existing therapeutic landscape, proceeded to raise funds to execute on our disease-focused business model. We assembled a passionate management team and scientific advisory board composed of individuals with extensive experience in Duchenne, gene therapy, product discovery, research and development, manufacturing, business strategy and finance. 
 In 2015, we began exclusively licensing the elements of the construct for SGT-001 and other elements of the SGT-001 gene transfer program from the University of Missouri and the University of Washington. Since then, we have continued to use our extensive network across the academic, business and patient communities to identify, vet and pursue high-potential complementary product candidates to address the needs of Duchenne patients. 
 Mission 
 Our mission, which guides our operations, is to cure Duchenne. Underscoring this mission, our disease-focused business model is founded on the following fundamental values: 
  
• | identify and develop meaningful therapies for all patients with Duchenne;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | bring together the leading experts in Duchenne, science, technology, disease management and care; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | be guided by the needs of Duchenne patients.

 About Duchenne muscular dystrophy 
 Duchenne is an X-chromosome-linked, muscle-wasting disease, predominantly affecting boys. Progressive, irreversible and ultimately fatal, Duchenne occurs in approximately one in every 3,500 to 5,000 live male births and has an estimated prevalence of 5,000 to 15,000 cases in the United States alone. In Duchenne, mutations in the dystrophin gene result in the body’s inability to produce functioning dystrophin protein, which works to strengthen muscle fibers and protect them from daily wear and tear. Dystrophin protein also serves as the cornerstone of the dystrophin glycoprotein complex, or DGC, a group of proteins that links the inner and outer components of muscle cells to ensure proper muscle function. 
 Without dystrophin and the DGC, muscles suffer excessive damage from normal daily activities and are unable to regenerate, leading to the build-up of scar and fat tissue. More than 1,000 dystrophin gene mutations, which can be inherited or can occur spontaneously, have been identified in people with Duchenne. 
 For patients suffering from Duchenne, symptoms usually begin to manifest between three and five years of age, when they fail to reach developmental milestones or experience motor function challenges, such as difficulty walking or climbing stairs. Muscle wasting initially presents in the legs and pelvic area, then in the muscles of the shoulders, neck and arms. As the disease progresses, patients with Duchenne experience frequent falls, can no longer run, play sports or perform most daily 
 4

functions, and are further weakened by physical activity. In addition to physical challenges, Duchenne also commonly involves cognitive difficulties and behavioral challenges. 
 By their early teens, Duchenne patients typically lose their ability to walk and become dependent on a wheelchair for mobility. By their 20s, patients essentially become paralyzed from the neck down and require a ventilator to breathe. Though disease severity and life expectancy vary, a patient’s quality of life dramatically decreases over time, with death typically occurring by early adulthood from either cardiac or respiratory complications. 
 Need for effective therapies 
 There is no cure for Duchenne and, for the vast majority of patients, there are no satisfactory symptomatic or disease-modifying treatments. 
 Glucocorticoid treatment, the current standard-of-care, has been shown to temporarily improve muscle strength, prolong the period of ambulation and slow the progression of Duchenne. However, glucocorticoid use is associated with well-known adverse events, such as severe weight gain, stunted growth, weakening of bone structure and metabolic dysfunctions, among others. The most commonly used glucocorticoids include prednisone and deflazacort (EMFLAZA). 
 In recent years, certain regulators have conditionally approved therapies which target specific mutations in the dystrophin gene. These therapies are indicated for only a small portion of the Duchenne patient population, and their respective efficacy profiles still need to be fully understood. 
 Current best practices for treating Duchenne patients also dictate a multidisciplinary approach to disease management, which includes physical and occupational therapy to preserve strength, function and flexibility, orthopedic management to reduce the risk of scoliosis and other bone and joint problems, pulmonary, cardiac and gastrointestinal management, and psychosocial management to support behavior and learning. 
 We are actively involved in engaging with the Duchenne patient, clinical and research communities to support advancement of therapies for patients with Duchenne. In November 2021, in collaboration with REGENXBIO Inc., we formally launched the Pathway Development Consortium, or the PDC, a multistakeholder initiative which aims to identify, develop, expand and maintain pathways to effective therapies for patients diagnosed early in life with rare diseases, including Duchenne. The PDC seeks to achieve these goals by bringing together a broad and diverse group of stakeholders from the rare disease and AAV gene therapy communities, including patients, industry, regulators, academia and payers, among others, for meaningful scientific and policy discussions.
 Burden of disease 
 Despite recent therapeutic advances, Duchenne represents a significant societal and economic burden. The economic burden, estimated at $1.2 billion annually in the United States (excluding costly mortality and end-of-life care expenses), includes costs associated with hospital admissions, medication, frequent doctor visits and investment in assistive devices, as well as indirect costs related to productivity losses for the caregivers and costs due to pain, anxiety and social handicap. Of this amount, approximately 45% is represented by indirect costs. Only a small proportion of Duchenne patients are employed and many caregivers reduce their hours or stop working altogether to care for their children, who progressively require more help with everyday tasks, such as eating, dressing and using the bathroom. In some cases, patients also experience serious mental health issues that require additional support and treatment. 
 Gene transfer—A corrective therapy 
 Gene therapy is a therapeutic approach that aims to address diseases caused by gene mutations. A gene is a portion of deoxyribonucleic acid, or DNA, that provides the instructions for the body to construct proteins that perform functions needed for life. Genes are prone to mutations, which can either be inherited or occur spontaneously. While many mutations are harmless, some lead to the absence of crucial proteins, resulting in serious genetic diseases like Duchenne. 
 Gene transfer, a type of gene therapy, is designed to address diseases caused by mutated genes through the delivery of functional versions of those genes, called transgenes. The transgenes are then utilized by the body to produce proteins that are absent or not functional prior to treatment, potentially offering long-lasting beneficial effects. 
 We have focused our efforts on gene transfer because we believe it has the greatest potential to address the root cause of Duchenne: the absence or near-absence of dystrophin protein. If successful, we believe gene transfer can slow or stop the 
 5

progression of Duchenne in a majority of patients, irrespective of their genetic mutation, by producing long-term, muscle-specific expression of a functional dystrophin-like protein. 
 Our gene transfer candidate, or vector, includes three components: 
  
• | a viral capsid—a protein shell utilized as a vehicle to deliver a transgene to cells in the body;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a transgene—a functional gene intended to produce a functional protein; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a promoter—a specialized DNA sequence that directs cells to produce the protein in specific tissues.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 SGT-001 
 SGT-001, our lead gene transfer candidate, is designed to preserve muscle function in Duchenne patients after a single administration and is based on some of the most recent understanding of dystrophin biology in the field. The SGT-001 vector is comprised of a functional transgene and a muscle-specific promoter, which are delivered via an AAV capsid.  We believe that the SGT-001 construct is differentiated from other gene transfer candidates and may provide unique clinical benefit.
 The vector is modified to no longer self-replicate, yet retains its ability to effectively introduce new genetic material directly into patients’ cells. AAV vectors have been extensively studied in human clinical trials in multiple disease indications, including in clinical trials of high-dose, systemically delivered AAV gene therapies being conducted by third parties.
 Capsid: The capsid of the SGT-001 vector is derived from a naturally occurring, non-pathogenic virus called AAV. There are several subtypes of AAV capsids that differ based on the proteins that make up their structure. These capsids have affinities for different sites in the body. We selected the AAV9 serotype capsid for clinical development based on our preclinical data, which demonstrated the capsid’s ability to efficiently enter skeletal, diaphragm and cardiac muscle tissues, as well as its favorable tolerability reported in other gene transfer clinical programs. 
 Transgene: Dystrophin, the largest gene in the body, exceeds the carrying capacity of AAV vectors. To overcome this challenge, we advanced development of the SGT-001 transgene, a synthetic, dystrophin-like gene that fits into AAV and has the ability to drive functional protein expression in skeletal, diaphragm and cardiac muscle tissue. 
 The concept of a modified therapeutic dystrophin gene originated from research on Becker muscular dystrophy, or BMD, where researchers discovered that certain BMD patients had mutations in the dystrophin gene that drove expression of a functional form of dystrophin protein, allowing patients to live relatively normal lives. This discovery led scientists to engineer a number of synthetic, dystrophin transgene constructs, called microdystrophins, that retained only the most critical components of the full-size dystrophin gene yet were small enough to fit within AAV packaging constraints. There are several types of microdystrophins that differ based on the configuration of their components. Microdystrophins were subsequently demonstrated to functionally protect muscle in mouse models of Duchenne. 
 Our SGT-001 microdystrophin construct is based on three decades of development and optimization work at the University of Missouri and the University of Washington as well as other academic institutions. In preclinical studies, the laboratories of Jeffrey Chamberlain, Ph.D., from the University of Washington, and Dongsheng Duan, Ph.D., from the University of Missouri, identified a proprietary configuration of genetic components that, when administered systemically, produces functional microdystrophin protein expression that not only stabilizes muscle membranes and protects muscle against injury, but also simultaneously restores the localization of DGC to the muscle membrane, notably increasing nNOS concentration. In subsequent published studies, Drs. Duan and Chamberlain demonstrated in animal models that, in comparison to earlier configurations, nNOS-restoring microdystrophins were more effective in improving muscle function and resistance to fatigue. We believe the unique functionality of our SGT-001 microdystrophin may result in functional benefits including diminished muscle fatigue and protection against ischemic muscle damage, which can lead to loss of functional muscle. 
 Promoter: The expression of the SGT-001 microdystrophin transgene is regulated by a modified, synthetic muscle-specific promoter cassette called CK8, which is derived from the naturally occurring muscle creatine kinase promoter. Regulatory cassettes, such as CK8, are used to prompt gene expression specifically in muscle tissues. In comparison to other regulatory cassettes, we chose CK8 due to its small size and its ability to drive microdystrophin transgene expression in skeletal, diaphragm and cardiac muscle tissues. In our preclinical studies in small and large animal models, CK8 restricted microdystrophin transgene expression to these muscles.

SGT-001 preclinical program 
 Our comprehensive preclinical program for SGT-001 was comprised of studies that inform efficacy, durability and safety, as well as dose response and the kinetics of transgene expression. Our program includes three different animal species: mice, dogs and non-human primates, or NHPs. Our preclinical studies were performed by third-party collaborators. 
 Well-established mouse and dog disease models for Duchenne offered us the opportunity to better evaluate the potential translatability of SGT-001 to humans. While studies in dystrophic mice, such as the mdx mouse, provide important efficacy rationale, we chose to perform additional functional studies in dystrophic dogs because they exhibit a more severe dystrophic phenotype and progress similarly to human patients at earlier stages of the disease. Dog models enabled us to assess various endpoints, including biodistribution, expression, durability and function in a large animal species. 
 Because Duchenne is a disease defined by a lack of dystrophin protein, it is important to reliably detect microdystrophin expression in muscle after SGT-001 treatment. As part of our core preclinical program, we developed well-characterized and well-recognized analytic approaches to confirm transgene expression and localization, using the following assays: 
  
• | Immunofluorescence: A qualitative method to determine if a transgene is expressed and localized to muscle membrane.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Western blot: A recognized method to quantify dystrophin expression.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Mass spectrometry: A highly sensitive analytical method to quantify transgene expression.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We also employed immunofluorescence to confirm if our microdystrophin construct restored the DGC, including key proteins such as sarcoglycan and nNOS. 
 Efficacy in dystrophic mice 
 Multiple studies in both dystrophic, or mdx, and healthy, or wild-type, mice have demonstrated that a single intravenous administration of SGT-001 induces measurable levels of microdystrophin protein expression. Muscle strength assessments in mild and severe mouse models of Duchenne demonstrated functional improvements in animals treated with SGT-001 in comparison to untreated dystrophic controls. In all studies, microdystrophin protein expression was measured using immunofluorescence, western blot and mass spectrometry. 
 In an mdx dose-response study, a clear dose-dependent pattern of transgene expression was observed at day 28 by all three assays. As an example, at a dose of 1E14 vg/kg, transgene expression as quantified by positive immunofluorescence staining in the quadriceps and heart muscle tissues was 50% and 80%, respectively, of the full-length dystrophin levels quantified in healthy wild-type control muscles. Similar levels of microdystrophin expression were found in all mdx studies completed to date. Efficacy studies performed in dystrophic mice treated with SGT-001 demonstrated significant, dose-responsive improvements in both muscle morphology and multiple physiological parameters. In a blinded efficacy study performed in mdx mice dosed at approximately six weeks of age, SGT-001 treatment showed statistically significant improvements in multiple muscle strength parameters as well as resistance to treadmill-induced fatigue. 
 Efficacy in dystrophic dogs 
 Two independent studies in dystrophic dogs assessed durability of microdystrophin expression and efficacy, respectively. These studies were performed in two distinct dystrophic dog models (mixed breed dystrophic dogs, or cDMD, and Golden Retriever Muscular Dystrophy, or GRMD), collectively encompassing a number of genetic mutations that lead to the absence of dystrophin protein. This enabled us to assess SGT-001 across multiple mutations, which is more reflective of the composition of the Duchenne patient population. Both studies used a canine-optimized version of the microdystrophin gene. 
 In a long-term dose-ranging study, five three-month-old, juvenile cDMD dogs received an intravenous dose of either 5E13 vg/kg (n=1), 1E14 vg/kg (n=2), 3E14 vg/kg (n=1) or 5E14 vg/kg (n=1). Robust transgene expression was detected by immunofluorescence at all biopsy time points and at all of the dose levels. In animals dosed with 1E14 vg/kg, approximately 70-90% of the muscle fibers were positive for microdystrophin and correlated to the restoration of DGC associated proteins, including nNOS. 
 7

A blinded dose-ranging study in the GRMD model assessed the general safety and efficacy of the canine construct of SGT-001. The three dose levels (1E13, 1E14 and 2E14 vg/kg) were administered at three months of age and animals were followed for three months following administration. 
 Dose-dependent transgene expression was detected in interim biopsies of skeletal muscles at day 28 and 45 and at the end of the study at day 91 in skeletal, diaphragm and cardiac muscles. A blinded histological evaluation of the muscle tissue revealed a reduction of dystrophic pathology at the higher dose levels. In the mid- and high-dose groups, all muscles biopsied at the end of the study exhibited improved pathology compared to low dose and untreated controls. Biodistribution studies demonstrated dose dependent transgene expression that was only detectable in the muscle tissues. 
 The observed dose response was detectable by both immunofluorescence and western blot. Quantification by western blot averaged less than 10% of wild-type in the low-dose (1E13 vg/kg) animals. In the mid-dose animals, the level of expression among the skeletal muscles ranged from an average of approximately 20% to approximately 50% of wild-type control muscles. At 2E14 vg/kg, the level of expression ranged from 30% to 70% of wild-type dystrophin. This data also correlates to quantification of microdystrophin via mass spectrometry. 
 Dose-dependent, sustained expression of microdystrophin not only correlated with histological improvements in muscle, but also provided statistically significant improvements in measures of muscle function. At day 90, muscle force generation was improved in both the 1E14 vg/kg and 2E14 vg/kg cohorts, indicating that the microdystrophin produced by SGT-001 is highly protective in a large animal dystrophic species. 
 The efficacy data collectively described above in both dystrophic mouse and dog models was incorporated into an overall nonclinical model to inform dose selection for our clinical program. All doses were well tolerated and there was no observed immune response to the transgene. 
 Manufacturing comparability 
 As part of our manufacturing process development, we have run comparability studies at each stage of our process scale-up. These comparability studies were carried out using in vivo mouse models to ensure that our drug product produced at different scales is comparable to each other. 
 Safety 
 As part of our preclinical program, we performed necessary good laboratory practices, or GLP, toxicology studies to establish the overall safety profile of SGT-001 in wild-type mice and NHPs. The data and our conclusions from these studies were included in our IND submission to the FDA. Systemic administration of SGT-001 was generally well tolerated in both species. We observed no evidence of test-article-related toxicity for up to 13 weeks after systemic administration of SGT-001 in either species that would prevent us from initiating clinical trials. In the NHP study, test-article-related effects were self-limited, mild chemistry and hematology changes with no microscopic correlates at the end of the study. There was a transient and asymptomatic increase in liver function enzymes observed in NHPs starting on day 9, which returned to normal levels by day 21. We believe there were no other relevant test-article-related adverse events associated with SGT-001 administration in either GLP study. In the NHP toxicology study, a single animal from the high dose cohort was euthanized after it did not recover from an anesthetic procedure. We believe this event was attributed to procedural errors. However, AAV vector cannot be completely ruled out as a contributing factor to the toxicity that gave rise to the event. 
 Clinical development of SGT-001 
 We are developing SGT-001 for the treatment of Duchenne through a single intravenous administration. In the fourth quarter of 2017, we announced the initiation of IGNITE DMD, as a randomized, controlled, open-label, single-ascending dose Phase I/II clinical trial designed to evaluate SGT-001 in ambulatory and non-ambulatory males with Duchenne aged four to 17 years. The primary objectives of IGNITE DMD are to assess the safety and tolerability of SGT-001, as well as efficacy as defined by microdystrophin protein expression. The clinical trial is also designed to assess muscle function and mass, respiratory and cardiovascular function, serum and muscle biomarkers associated with microdystrophin production, SGT-001 microdystrophin associated biochemical properties (e.g., nNOS binding), functional outcome, patient and parent reported outcomes and quality of life measures, among other endpoints. Key inclusion criteria include established clinical diagnosis of Duchenne and documented dystrophin gene mutation predictive of Duchenne phenotype; anti-AAV9 antibodies below pre-specified thresholds; stable cardiac and pulmonary function; and a stable daily dose of oral corticosteroids for 12 weeks. There is no enrollment restriction in the clinical trial protocol based on a patient’s underlying dystrophin gene mutation.

In the current IGNITE DMD protocol, as amended, participants are all assigned to open label treatment with SGT-001. The selection of the original starting dose in our first cohort, 5E13 vg/kg, was based on safety and efficacy data observed in our preclinical studies. Dose escalation and decisions regarding clinical trial progression occur after review by the data safety monitoring board, or the DSMB. Efficacy is being assessed by comparing microdystrophin protein expression in muscle biopsy before and 12 months after infusion for each patient. An intermediate biopsy at either 45 days, three months, six months or nine months will inform the time course of microdystrophin expression. Long-term follow up will continue per regulatory guidelines. 
 Patient Dosing and U.S. Regulatory Engagement
 To date, nine patients have been dosed in IGNITE DMD with SGT-001. The first three patients were infused with 5E13 vg/kg of SGT-001 (low dose cohort). The subsequent six patients were all dosed in the high dose cohort at 2E14vg/kg of SGT-001.
 In November 2019, we announced that the third patient in the 2E14 vg/kg cohort of IGNITE DMD, dosed in late October 2019, experienced an SAE deemed related to the study drug and that IGNITE DMD was placed on clinical hold by the FDA as a result of the SAE. The SAE was characterized by complement activation, thrombocytopenia, a decrease in red blood cell count, acute kidney injury, and cardio-pulmonary insufficiency. Neither cytokine- nor coagulopathy-related abnormalities were observed. In December 2019, we reported that the SAE had fully resolved and the patient had resumed his normal activities.  
 In April 2020, we submitted a response to the FDA that included changes to the clinical protocol designed to enhance patient safety, as well as information related to improvements to our manufacturing process. The FDA responded by maintaining the clinical hold and requesting further data and analyses relating to this manufacturing process.  In June 2020, we submitted a response to the FDA that provided data related to manufacturing process improvements. In July 2020, we announced that the FDA responded by maintaining the clinical hold and requesting further manufacturing information and updated safety and efficacy data for all patients dosed in the trial, as well as providing direction on the total viral load to be administered per patient. In October 2020, we announced that the FDA lifted the clinical hold placed on IGNITE DMD. In connection with the lifting of the clinical hold, we determined to reduce the maximum weight of the next two patients dosed in IGNITE DMD to 18 kg per patient, with safety outcomes from these two patients driving potential weight increase of patients dosed subsequently. This reduction, in conjunction with the delivery of fewer viral particles as a result of our manufacturing process improvements, will reduce patients’ total viral load while continuing dosing at the 2E14 vg/kg dose. Additionally, to mitigate the risk of serious drug-related adverse events, we amended the IGNITE DMD clinical protocol to include the prophylactic use of both anti-complement inhibitor eculizumab and C1 esterase inhibitor, and increase the prednisone dose in the first month post dosing.
 In March 2021, we announced that Patient 7 was safely dosed with SGT-001 in the 2E14 vg/kg cohort under the amended clinical protocol, with transient and manageable adverse events, none of which were serious.  
 In April 2021, Patient 8 was treated with SGT-001 in the 2E14 vg/kg cohort. The patient experienced a systemic inflammatory response which has since fully resolved. The event was classified as a serious adverse event and considered by the investigator to be drug related. This type of event is described in our Investigators Brochure and is not considered unexpected. Following dosing, we conducted an extensive review of all IGNITE DMD clinical data, resulting in an amended protocol with a strengthened risk mitigation plan including an optimized eculizumab regimen utilized prophylactically and in the first two weeks, elimination of the C1 esterase inhibitor, and new patient monitoring guidance, all of which was submitted to the FDA.        
 In January 2022, we announced that in November 2021 Patient 9 was safely dosed with SGT-001 in the 2E14 vg/kg cohort under the amended clinical protocol, with transient and manageable adverse events, none of which were serious.  
 No new drug-related safety findings have been identified in Patients 1-9 through nine in post-dosing periods of 90 days to approximately four years. We continue to follow dosed patients and collect data to support the potential benefit from dosing with SGT-001.
 Clinical Data
 In February 2019, we announced preliminary findings based on three-month biopsy data from the first three patients dosed with 5E13 vg/kg of SGT-001, the lowest dose outlined in the trial protocol. In one patient, SGT-001 microdystrophin was detected via western blot below the five percent level of quantification, or BLQ, of the assay and in approximately 10 
 9

percent of fibers via immunofluorescence.  Due to these findings, and in consultation with the DSMB, in May 2019 we announced that we had initiated dosing of the next cohort of patients at 2E14 vg/kg. In August 2019, we amended our protocol to remove the matched patient control arm for the rest of the 2E14 vg/kg cohort in the IGNITE DMD trial and to provide measures to potentially improve safety, such as initially proceeding to dose patients weighing 25 kg or less.
 In December 2019, we announced preliminary findings based on three-month biopsy data from the first two patients dosed with 2E14 vg/kg of SGT-001 (Patients 4 and 5). Using two independent immunofluorescence assays, 10% to 20% of microdystrophin positive muscle fibers were determined to express SGT-001 microdystrophin in Patient 4 and 50% to 70% of microdystrophin positive muscle fibers in Patient 5. Immunofluorescence also showed clear stabilization and co-localization of nNOS and beta-sarcoglycan with SGT-001 microdystrophin in both patients. Using western blot, the expression levels for Patient 4 were detectable and estimated to be near the assay’s level of quantification which is 5% of non-dystrophic control samples, with one assay replicate at 5.5%. Expression for Patient 5 was 17.5% of normal control samples. The levels of serum creatine kinase, a highly variable biochemical marker of muscle damage, declined from baseline in both patients. 
 In March 2020, we announced data from the third patient dosed in the 2E14 vg/kg dose cohort of IGNITE DMD (Patient 6), including three-month biopsy data. Using immunofluorescence assays, 50% to 70% of the muscle fibers were determined to express SGT-001 microdystrophin. Immunofluorescence also showed stabilization and co-localization of nNOS and beta-sarcoglycan with SGT-001 microdystrophin. Using western blot, microdystrophin expression was 8% of normal control samples. In addition, the level of serum creatine kinase decreased from baseline. 
 In March 2021 and September 2021, we announced interim data collected from the first six patients dosed in IGNITE DMD twelve months after treatment, including data from three patients (Patients 4-6) dosed at the high dose (2E14 vg/kg). Data from the delayed treatment cohort, analyzed as an untreated control cohort, was evaluated as was representative natural history data. The average age at baseline of Patients 4-6 was 8.4 years. Functional data collected included 6MWT, NSAA and PFTs, which provided evidence of potential benefit in functional endpoints one year after a single infusion of SGT-001 at a dose of 2E14 vg/kg. This data demonstrated stable or improved function compared to both baseline and natural history over the same time period.
 PROM assessments using the PODCI revealed a trend towards dose-response improvements in motor function subscales and fatigability assessments 12-months following infusion with SGT-001, providing real-world evidence to support the clinical and biomarker findings of varying degrees of benefit in high dose patients. 
 The March 2021 data also included the following biomarker data:
  
• | Biopsies of skeletal muscle three months after a single infusion of SGT-001 at a dose of 2E14vg/kg, demonstrated widespread distribution of microdystrophin-positive muscle fibers with co-localization of nNOS and β-sarcoglycan;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | CK assessments of the six patients provided physiological evidence of a positive or stabilizing effect after one year of treatment with a single high dose infusion of SGT-001. An average sustained CK decline of approximately 50% in patients in the high dose cohort was observed. In the low dose cohort, an average CK increase of approximately 166% was observed, and in the control group an average CK increase of approximately 17% was observed.

In May 2021, we reported long-term biopsy data collected from Patients 4-6, who were dosed at the 2E14 vg/kg dose level. Analyses of the biopsies, taken 24 months, 18 months and 12 months post-dosing, respectively, demonstrated durable and widespread expression of the microdystrophin protein. The long-term results were consistent with the day 90, interim data reported in March 2021 and continued to demonstrate the functionality of the SGT-001 microdystrophin, as highlighted by the recruitment of key dystrophin associated proteins: beta-sarcoglycan and neuronal nNOS. The long-term muscle biopsy results were analyzed by two methods, western blot and immunofluorescence.

 Further morphological analysis of the muscle biopsies indicated that sustained microdystrophin protein expression and function resulted in membrane stabilization, evidenced by minimal progression of muscle deterioration since the day 90 timepoint. These long-term pathophysiological improvements support the recently reported positive trends in the clinical biomarker and functional data.
 In September 2021, we announced interim data collected from the first three patients infused in the high dose cohort (2E14 vg/kg) in IGNITE DMD 18-months months after treatment. The average age at baseline of Patients 4-6 was 8.4 years. Data collected from 6MWT, NSAA and PFTs provided evidence of continued potential benefit in functional endpoints 18-months after a single infusion of SGT-001 at a dose of 2E14 vg/kg. Patient reported outcome measures showed meaningful sustained improvements at 18-months compared with baseline and natural history as assessed using the PODCI Global Functions, PODCI Transfer/Basic Mobility and PODCI Sports/Physical Functioning over the same period of time. These data are consistent with results reported at the 12-month time period for the same patients.
 The following table summarizes the interim efficacy results for Patients 4-6 in IGNITE DMD at 18-months post-doing:

 In March 2022, we announced two-year interim safety and efficacy data from the first three Patients (Patients 4-6) treated with SGT-001 in the 2E14 vg/kg dose cohort of IGNITE DMD. Results suggested durable benefit 24-months post-administration of SGT-001, when compared to natural history. These data were consistent with results reported at the 12-month and 18-month time periods for the same patients. The average age of Patients 4-6 at the two year timepoint was 10.4 years.

Data from Patients 4-6 suggested sustained motor function at two years post-infusion, as assessed by 6MWT and NSAA, against expected natural history declines. In addition, the data suggested improved pulmonary function, as measured by FVC and PEF, and sustained or improved PROMs as assessed in key functional domains of the PODCI when compared to both baseline and natural history.

 In March 2022, we reported data from skeletal muscle biopsies collected three months after infusion of SGT-001 from the most recently dosed Patients 7-9.  The range by immunofluorescence of 1% to 50% and by western blot of Below the 5% Limit of Quantification (BLQ) to 6.8%, were within the range of previously dosed Patients 4-6 in the high dose cohort. Microdystrophin expression levels for all six patients dosed in the high dose cohort (Patients 4-9) ranged from 1 to 70% by immunofluorescence and BLQ to 17.5% by western blot. All six patients dosed with SGT-001 in the high dose cohort have demonstrated microdystrophin expression and proper membrane localization.
 We believe the unique functionality of our SGT-001 microdystrophin may result in functional benefits including diminished muscle fatigue and protection against ischemic muscle damage, which can lead to loss of functional muscle. Collectively, we believe these data provide evidence supporting the biological activity of SGT-001 and provide support for continued development. Based on data from the clinical trial, we will determine next steps for SGT-001 clinical development, including additional clinical trials that may include other patient populations, as well as the need for larger confirmatory clinical trials. 
 No new drug-related safety findings have been identified in Patients 1-9 in post-dosing periods of 90 days to approximately four years. We continue to follow dosed patients and collect data to support the potential benefit of SGT-001.
The most common drug related clinical adverse reactions at the time of initial dosing were nausea, experienced by the nine patients dosed; fever experienced by seven of the nine patients dosed; and vomiting, experienced by eight of the nine patients dosed. The most common drug related laboratory abnormalities were thrombocytopenia, increased fibrin D-dimer, increased soluble C5b9, increased lactate dehydrogenase, and proteinuria. Activation of the terminal pathway (sC5b9) of the classical complement system occurred in all nine patients resulting in three serious adverse events, which were previously resolved. Two other serious adverse events included an episode of immune hepatitis four weeks post dosing which resolved rapidly after a transient increase of corticosteroids, and giardiasis determined to be unrelated to SGT-001.
 Manufacturing SGT-001 
 The prevalence and incidence of Duchenne, combined with average patient weight and anticipated dosing requirements for SGT-001, result in a substantial supply need for clinical trials and, if approved, for commercial markets. To address this challenge, we developed a manufacturing process that we believe will be scalable to support clinical and commercial production needs for SGT-001.
 13

Our suspension-based process is founded on seminal work by scientists at the University of Florida and has been optimized for manufacturability by our internal process development scientists with the support of our CDMO partners. The process consists of three steps. First, we produce two replication-incompetent Herpes Simplex Virus, or HSV, stocks, one containing our microdystrophin construct and the other containing the critical elements of the AAV9. Second, we then use these two HSV stocks to coinfect suspension-adapted human embryonic kidney cells (HEK-293). Third, these cells are then purified and concentrated in our downstream process to produce our gene transfer candidate. Our team has developed the analytical testing methods needed to support consistency and strict standards of quality and potency. We believe that this approach will increase our speed of development, ensure consistent quality and regulatory compliance, and reduce the risk of delay or unexpected production costs. 
 In 2020, we implemented our second generation manufacturing process which collectively includes improvements to our AAV manufacturing methods as well as the introduction of a refined set of analytical methods for product release. Our second generation AAV manufacturing process includes a scalable purification step which results in a significant enrichment of microdystrophin-containing “full” capsids and elimination of empty capsids. On average, drug product produced by the second generation manufacturing method contains 90% full capsids as measured by Transmission Electron Microscopy, whereas drug product produced by the first generation process is on average 50% full. This improvement in purification methods significantly reduces the total capsid load administered at any given dose level, allowing us to achieve the same effective dose of drug product with fewer total capsids. Since the first quarter of 2021, and following lift of the clinical hold, all patients dosed in IGNITE DMD have been dosed with material produced using our second generation manufacturing process.
 We believe that our decision to invest early in our manufacturing process was key to developing a scalable process designed to support clinical development and potential commercialization. We are supplying our clinical development program for SGT-001 with drug product produced at current good manufacturing practices, or cGMP, - compliant facilities located at partner CDMOs. We have operated at 250-liter scale and have successfully produced multiple drug product batches at this scale. Our in-house scientists are continuing to work to increase the productivity, efficiency and purity of our manufacturing process. 
 SGT-003
 SGT-003 is our next-generation gene transfer candidate. It is comprised of our nNOS binding domain microdystrophin transgene and muscle-specific promoter present in SGT-001 and uses a lead candidate novel, rationally designed AAV capsid, developed for enhanced muscle tropism, to deliver these components to target tissues. We believe that the properties of this novel capsid may allow for enhanced benefit over therapies using traditional capsids, potentially both in terms of efficacy and safety. 
 SGT-003 preclinical program 
 We identified a lead novel capsid candidate through evaluation of muscle tropic AAV screening, in which increased muscle transduction was observed.
 Translatability of in vitro data to in vivo systems was assessed in preclinical studies using the novel capsid. It was evaluated in a head-to-head study with AAV9-CK8-microdystrophin in the dystrophin-negative mouse model of DMD (mdx mouse). Separate groups of animals were administered a single intravenous dose of either construct and the biodistribution, microdystrophin protein expression, and biomarker analyses were performed at the conclusion of the study. Overall, the in vivo study data supported the results seen from in vitro assays and further demonstrated the potential benefits. The mdx mice dosed with the novel capsid showed increased biodistribution (vector genome copies) in representative muscle tissues and increased microdystrophin expression compared to those administered the AAV9 vector. In addition, lower vector genome copies in the liver compared to AAV9-administered animals, with the data supporting a preferential distribution of the novel capsid towards muscle tissue and away from the liver. These data supported the proof of concept for the novel capsid microdystrophin construct in Duchenne and formed a basis for establishing and advancing the SGT-003 program. We intend to initiate IND-enabling studies for SGT-003 in 2022 to support a planned IND submission in early 2023.
 Manufacturing SGT-003
 We selected a manufacturing process that we believe will be scalable to support clinical and commercial production needs for SGT-003. The transient transfection process was selected in order to efficiently advance SGT-003 along its 
 14

development timeline. . In October 2021, we announced a partnership with a cell and gene therapy-focused CDMO, for the development and clinical stage manufacture of SGT-003.
 Platform Technologies
 In addition to our gene transfer candidates, we have development programs focusing on platform technologies, including novel capsids and dual gene expression, a technology that allows us to package multiple transgenes into one vector. These programs are part of our ongoing research efforts to develop innovative technologies that we believe may hold potential to translate into meaningful treatments and drive our future pipeline expansion.
 Tools to accelerate discovery and development 
 In conjunction with our development of SGT-001 and SGT-003, we believe it is critical to continue to investigate tools and technologies designed to help us more effectively understand Duchenne, accurately monitor disease progression and assist patients in daily life. As part of this goal, we are evaluating the use of sensor-based technologies to potentially identify biomarkers that may allow us to better measure the therapeutic impact of potential product candidates. 
 
Novel Capsids
 We have developed a library of novel capsids through the insertion of unique peptide sequences into traditional capsids and initially evaluated these candidates through an in vitro screening platform. The primary goal of developing this library was to generate capsids that preferentially target and transduce muscle cells, compared to traditional capsids such as AAV9. Candidate novel capsids were packaged with our microdystrophin under the control of a muscle-specific promoter, such as CK8, and used to transduce muscle cells. Evaluation of microdystrophin expression from in vitro studies performed in mouse muscle cell lines showed multiple-fold increases in numerous novel capsid candidates over AAV9. Further in vitro characterization of these capsids was performed in human Duchenne muscle cell lines. Results from these studies showed similar findings of multiple-fold increases in expression for novel capsid candidates over AAV9. We are continuing to further develop our novel capsid library.
 Non-specific novel capsids were packaged comprised of a bioluminescent protein (luciferase) under the control of a ubiquitous promoter (CMV) able to allow expression across a wide range of tissue types. These constructs were further evaluated in vivo in both mdx and wild-type mice to understand the potential broader applicability of these capsids for other indications. Results from this study support preferential targeting of muscle, with increases in biodistribution and expression over AAV9 across muscle tissues and decreased biodistribution and expression compared to AAV9 in the liver, and the potential applicability  to a wide variety of indications that may benefit from such a targeting profile, in addition to Duchenne.

 In conjunction with our development of SGT-001 and SGT-003, we believe it is critical to continue to investigate tools and technologies designed to help us more effectively understand Duchenne, accurately monitor disease progression and assist patients in daily life. As part of this goal, we are evaluating the use of sensor-based technologies to potentially identify biomarkers that may allow us to better measure the therapeutic impact of potential product candidates. 
 Non-invasive biochemical and imaging biomarkers 
 We are working to identify non-invasive biochemical and imaging biomarkers that could potentially reduce or eliminate the need for muscle biopsies in clinical trials, reducing stress on patients and allowing better evaluation of potential product candidates. We are developing a platform technology that may enable the non-invasive measurement of changes associated with increased dystrophin and dystrophin-like protein expression in Duchenne patients by using established imaging techniques, as well as methods still under development. We are also currently using robust platforms to perform extensive analysis on patient samples to establish molecular signatures based on various stages of Duchenne disease progression. 
 Intellectual property 
 Our commercial success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain proprietary or intellectual property protection for our product candidates, including SGT-001 and SGT-003, our platform technologies and other know-how, to 
 15

operate without infringing, misappropriating or otherwise violating the intellectual property rights of others, and to prevent others from infringing, misappropriating or otherwise violating our intellectual property rights. We also rely on patents, trade secrets, know-how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our proprietary and intellectual property position. 
 As of February 16, 2022, we have filed three pending PCT international patent applications, two pending U.S. non-provisional patent applications and eighteen pending patent applications in foreign jurisdictions. For our gene transfer programs, we have exclusively licensed three issued U.S. patents, three pending U.S. non-provisional patent applications, and eleven granted patents and thirteen pending patent applications in foreign jurisdictions. The issued U.S. patents are projected to expire between 2023 and 2036, excluding any patent term adjustments and any patent term extensions, and any U.S. patents that may issue from the pending U.S. non-provisional patent applications would be projected to expire between 2036 and 2040, excluding any patent term adjustments and any patent term extensions. 
 With respect to our gene transfer programs, we exclusively licensed patent families that relate to microdystrophin genes. With respect to SGT-001 and SGT-003, we exclusively licensed two issued U.S. patents and two pending U.S. non-provisional patent applications, which generally claim the structural elements of SGT-001 and SGT-003 and the promoter sequences used in each. These issued U.S. patents are projected to expire in 2028 and 2036, excluding any patent term adjustments and any patent term extensions. 
 Relating to SGT-001, SGT-003 and our platform technologies, we also own three pending PCT international patent applications, two pending U.S. non-provisional patent applications and eighteen pending patent applications in foreign jurisdictions. Any patents that may be issued from the pending PCTs would be projected to expire between 2036 and 2041, excluding any patent term adjustments and any patent term extensions. Substantive prosecution of our patent applications has not yet commenced at the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO. We cannot predict whether such pending patent applications will result in the issuance of a patent that effectively protects SGT-001, SGT-003 and our platform technologies, or if such issued patent or any of our licensor’s issued patents will effectively prevent others from commercializing competitive products. In any event, patent prosecution is a lengthy process, during which the scope of the claims initially submitted for examination by the patent offices in various jurisdictions are often significantly narrowed by the time they issue, if they issue at all.
 The term of individual patents depends upon the legal term for patents in the countries in which they are obtained. In most countries, including the United States, the patent term is 20 years from the earliest filing date of a non-provisional patent application. In the United States, a patent’s term may be lengthened by patent term adjustment, which compensates a patentee for administrative delays by the USPTO in examining and granting a patent, or may be shortened if a patent is terminally disclaimed over an earlier filed patent. The term of a patent that covers a drug or biological product may also be eligible for patent term extension when FDA approval is granted, subject to certain limitations and provided statutory and regulatory requirements are met (for more information, please see “Business— Government regulation and product approval —U.S. patent term restoration and marketing exclusivity”). In the future, if and when our product candidates receive approval from the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities, we expect to apply for patent term extensions on issued patents we may obtain in the future covering those products, depending upon the length of the clinical trials for each product and other factors. There can be no assurance that any of our pending patent applications will issue or that we will benefit from any patent term extension or favorable adjustment to the term of any of our patents. 
 As with other biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, our ability to maintain and solidify our proprietary and intellectual property position for our product candidates will depend on our success in obtaining effective patent claims and enforcing those claims if granted. However, our owned and licensed pending patent applications, and any patent applications that we may in the future file or license from third parties may not result in the issuance of patents. We also cannot predict the breadth of claims that may be allowed or enforced in our patents. Any issued patents that we may receive in the future may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented. In addition, because of the extensive time required for clinical development and regulatory review of a product candidate we may develop, it is possible that, before any of our product candidates can be commercialized, any related patent may expire or remain in force for only a short period following commercialization, thereby limiting protection such patent would afford the respective product and any competitive advantage such patent may provide. 
 In addition to patents, we rely upon unpatented trade secrets and know-how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position. We seek to protect our proprietary information, in part, by executing confidentiality agreements with our collaborators and scientific advisors, and non-competition, non-solicitation, confidentiality, and invention assignment agreements with our employees and consultants. We have also executed agreements requiring assignment of inventions with selected scientific advisors and collaborators. The confidentiality agreements we enter into are designed to protect our proprietary information and the agreements or clauses requiring assignment of inventions to us are designed to grant us ownership of technologies that are developed through our relationship 
 16

with the respective counterparty. We cannot guarantee, however, that these agreements will afford us adequate protection of our intellectual property and proprietary information rights. 
 We also seek trademark protection in the United States and internationally where available and when appropriate. We currently own U.S. federal registrations for the marks SOLID, SOLID GT and SOLID BIOSCIENCES and a European Union registration for the mark SOLID BIOSCIENCES and SOLID GT. 
 Strategic partnerships and collaborations/licenses 
 We have certain obligations under licensing agreements with third parties that include annual maintenance fees and payments that are contingent upon achieving various development, commercial and regulatory milestones. Pursuant to many of these license agreements, we are required to make milestone payments if certain development, regulatory and commercial sales milestones are achieved, and may have certain additional research funding obligations. Also, pursuant to the terms of many of these license agreements, when and if commercial sales of a licensed product commence, we must pay royalties to our licensors on net sales of the respective licensed products. 
 University of Washington License Agreement 
 In 2015, we entered into a license agreement with the University of Washington, acting through UW CoMotion, under which we obtained an exclusive, royalty-bearing, sublicensable, worldwide license under certain patent applications owned by the University of Washington relating to novel micro-dystrophins to develop, manufacture, and commercialize products for use in the treatment of Duchenne and related disease indications caused by a lack of functional dystrophin. We have the right to grant sublicenses to third parties contingent upon written approval by the University of Washington prior to executing such sublicense, which approval may not be unreasonably withheld. 
 In consideration for the rights granted by the agreement, we paid a one-time, non-refundable license fee, which was recorded as a research and development expense in 2015. We are required to reimburse the University of Washington for costs incurred in applying for, prosecuting and maintaining patents and pay up to an aggregate of approximately $1 million upon the achievement of certain milestones. There were no milestones achieved during the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019. In October 2017, the first milestone was achieved under this agreement. The milestone payment was recorded as a research and development expense in the fourth quarter of 2017. In October 2020, the license agreement was amended such that we were required to pay the University of Washington $375 thousand in connection with the execution of the collaboration and license agreement with Ultragenyx, or the Collaboration Agreement, in October 2020. This payment was recorded as a research and development expense in the fourth quarter of 2020. The license agreement was also amended such that we are required to pay an aggregate of approximately $3.4 million upon the achievement of certain milestones. We must also pay royalties of a low single digit percentage of future sales by us and our sublicensees of products developed under the licensed patent rights. In addition, we must pay an annual maintenance fee until certain milestones are achieved, at which time a minimum annual royalty requirement will replace such maintenance fee and will apply to us and our sublicensees.
 We are obligated to use our commercially reasonable efforts, consistent with sound and reasonable business practices and judgment, to commercialize the inventions covered by the licensed patent rights and to make and sell products based on that patent as soon as practicable and maximize sales thereof. 
 The University of Washington controls the prosecution and maintenance of the licensed patents in consultation with us and at our expense. In countries in which we have not requested prosecution or maintenance of licensed patents, the University of Washington may prosecute and maintain such licensed patents at its own cost. We have the first right to enforce such licensed patents at our expense. However, we may not enter into any settlement in any manner relating to the licensed patents without the University of Washington’s prior written consent. 
 The license agreement remains in effect until the expiration of the last-to-expire patent licensed under the agreement. We may terminate the agreement at any time upon providing sixty days’ written notice to the University of Washington. The University of Washington may terminate the agreement upon our uncured, material breach of the agreement or if we enter into an insolvency-related event.

The University of Missouri License Agreement 
 In 2015, we entered into a license agreement with the Curators of the University of Missouri, or the University of Missouri, a public corporation of Missouri, under which we obtained an exclusive, royalty-bearing, sublicensable, worldwide license under certain patents and patent applications owned by the University of Missouri relating to a novel synthetic microdystrophin gene to make, sell and distribute products for use in the treatment of Duchenne and related disease indications resulting from a lack of functional dystrophin. 
 In consideration for the rights granted by the agreement, we paid a one-time, non-refundable license fee, which was recorded as a research and development expense in 2015. We were required to reimburse the University of Missouri for costs incurred in applying for, prosecuting and maintaining the licensed patents and pay up to an aggregate of approximately $1 million upon the achievement of certain milestones for each product developed based on the licensed patents. 
 Under the agreement, in the event we grant a sublicense to another party, we are required to pay the University of Missouri a percentage of the consideration received. The license agreement was amended such that we were required to pay, and did pay, the University of Missouri $0.8 million in February 2021 and $1.3 million in February 2022 as a result of the execution of the Collaboration Agreement with Ultragenyx in October 2020. These amounts were recorded as a research and development expense in the fourth quarter of 2020. The license agreement was also amended such that we are required to make aggregate milestone payments of approximately $1.9 million upon the achievement of certain milestones.
 There were no milestones achieved during the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019. We must pay a royalty of a low single digit percentage of future sales or by its sublicensees of products developed using the licensed patents. In addition, we must pay an annual maintenance fee until certain milestones are achieved, after which time a minimum annual royalty will replace such maintenance fee.
 Under the agreement, we granted the University of Missouri a non-exclusive, royalty-free, irrevocable, paid-up license, with the right to grant sublicenses to non-profit, academic, educational or governmental institutions, to practice and use improvements made by us using the licensed patent rights, solely for non-commercial research purposes. 
 We are obligated to use our reasonable best efforts to introduce products based on the licensed patent rights into the commercial market as soon as possible, consistent with sound and reasonable business practices and judgment, and thereafter to keep such products reasonably available to the public. 
 The University of Missouri controls the prosecution and maintenance of the licensed patents in consultation with us and at our expense. In countries in which we have not requested prosecution or maintenance of licensed patents, the University of Missouri may prosecute and maintain such licensed patents at its own cost. We have the first right to enforce such licensed patents at our expense. However, any settlement, consent judgment or other voluntary disposition of litigation that materially limits the scope, validity or enforceability of the licensed patent or admits fault or wrongdoing on the part of the University of Missouri must be pre-approved in writing by the University of Missouri. 
 The license agreement remains in effect until the expiration of the last-to-expire patent or the abandonment of the last to be abandoned patent application licensed under the agreement. The University of Missouri may terminate the agreement, or render the license granted thereunder non-exclusive, in individual countries if we and our sublicensees fail to achieve certain milestones. We may terminate the license agreement at any time upon providing six months’ written notice to the University of Missouri and paying a termination fee. Each of the University of Missouri and we may also terminate the agreement for an uncured default or breach of the agreement by the other party. Our ability to cure such breach only applies to the first two notices of such breach provided by the University of Missouri, and thereafter, the University of Missouri may terminate the agreement for our default or breach of the agreement upon thirty days’ written notice without an opportunity to cure such default or breach. 
 Harvard College License Agreements 
 In 2016 and 2017, we entered into license agreements with the President and Fellows of Harvard College, or Harvard College, under which we obtained non-exclusive, royalty-bearing, sublicensable, worldwide licenses to use certain intellectual property owned by Harvard College to develop, manufacture, and commercialize products for use in the treatment of Duchenne. 
 18

In consideration for the rights granted by each agreement, we paid one-time, non-refundable license fees, which were recorded as a research and development expense in 2016 and 2017. We are required to pay an annual license maintenance fee until certain milestones are achieved, after which time the annual maintenance fee will increase annually. Such annual maintenance fees will further increase if we grant certain rights to a sublicensee or strategic partner with whom we collaborate on the development and commercialization of licensed products. The annual maintenance fees are creditable against royalty payments. We also must pay milestone payments within thirty days after achieving certain milestones. There were no milestones achieved during the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 under either agreement. We must pay a royalty on future sales by us or our sublicensees of products developed using the licensed technology. 
 The license agreements each remain in effect for an initial term of fifteen years, with automatic three-year renewal periods thereafter unless one of the parties provides notice of non-renewal. We may terminate the license agreements at any time upon providing sixty days’ written notice to Harvard College. Harvard College may terminate the agreements in the event we become bankrupt or insolvent. Both Harvard College and we may also terminate the agreements for an uncured material breach of the agreements by the other party. 
 Ultragenyx Collaboration Agreement
 
On October 22, 2020, or the Effective Date, we entered into a collaboration and license agreement with Ultragenyx, to focus on the development and commercialization of new gene therapies for Duchenne. We granted Ultragenyx an exclusive worldwide license for any pharmaceutical product that expresses our proprietary microdystrophin construct from AAV8 and variants thereof in clade E for the treatment of Duchenne and other diseases resulting from the lack of functional dystrophin. We are conducting certain activities agreed to by the parties with respect to the development of licensed products. Ultragenyx will reimburse us for personnel and out-of-pocket costs that we incur in conducting such development activities. Otherwise, Ultragenyx has decision-making authority with respect to the development, manufacturing and commercialization of licensed products. We retain exclusive rights to all other uses of our microdystrophin proteins, including under our existing SGT-001 program.
 
We are conducting certain activities agreed to by the parties with respect to the development of licensed products. Ultragenyx is obligated to reimburse us for personnel and out-of-pocket costs that we incur in conducting such development activities. Otherwise, Ultragenyx has decision-making authority with respect to the development, manufacturing and commercialization of licensed products. In connection with the execution of the Collaboration Agreement, we also entered into a stock purchase agreement and an investor agreement with Ultragenyx, pursuant to which we issued and sold 7,825,797 shares of our common stock to Ultragenyx at a price of $5.1113 per share for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $40.0 million. The shares purchased by Ultragenyx are subject to a lock-up period until the earliest to occur of (i) 18 months from the closing date, (ii) the termination of the Collaboration Agreement or (iii) other specified events. Pursuant to the terms of the investor agreement, Ultragenyx agreed that, so long as it holds at least 10% of our outstanding common stock, the shares will be subject to a voting agreement, such that until the earliest to occur of certain specified events, and subject to specified conditions, Ultragenyx will, and will cause its permitted transferees to, vote in accordance with the recommendation of our Board of Directors with respect to specified matters. 
 
Ultragenyx also agreed to pay up to $255.0 million in cumulative milestone payments per product upon achievement of specified milestone events, and tiered royalties on worldwide net sales at low double digit to mid-teens percentages. Upon achievement of proof-of-concept, we have the right to opt-in to co-fund collaboration programs in return for participation in a profit share or increased royalty payments. None of the payments under the Collaboration Agreement are refundable. 
 
For each licensed product for which Ultragenyx decides to initiate a registrational trial in humans, we have the option to fund 30% of the development costs in the United States and European Union for such licensed product and forgo the development milestones and regulatory milestones, or the Development Option, and receive tiered royalties on a licensed product-by-licensed product and country-by-country basis ranging from a mid-teens percentage to a low twenties percentage based on Ultragenyx’s, and any of its affiliates’ and sublicensees’ annual worldwide net sales of each such licensed product.
 
For each Licensed Product for which we exercise the Development Option, we may also elect to share 30% of the net income and net losses on net sales of such Licensed Product in the United States and European Union, or the Income Share Option. For licensed products for which we have exercised the Income Share Option, we will not be entitled to milestone payments and Ultragenyx will pay us tiered royalties on a licensed product-by-licensed product and country-by-country basis ranging from a mid-teens percentage to a low twenties percentage based on Ultragenyx’s, and any of its affiliates’ and sublicensees’, annual net sales of each such licensed product outside of the United States and European Union.
 
19


We and Ultragenyx established a Joint Steering Committee, or the JSC. The JSC will, among other responsibilities, review and oversee certain development activities performed under the Collaboration Agreement, including reviewing the development plan and budget for the development activities to be performed by us.
 
The term of the Collaboration Agreement began on the Effective Date and expires upon the expiration of all payment obligations from Ultragenyx to us under the Collaboration Agreement. Ultragenyx also has the ability to terminate for convenience with prior written notice to us, and either party may terminate for an uncured material breach.
 
As described in Note 3, in October 2020, the Company entered into the Collaboration Agreement with Ultragenyx for the research, development and commercialization of other pharmaceutical products that express the Company’s MD5 nNOS binding domain form of microdystrophin protein.  Ultragenyx is a related party since Ultragenyx is one of the Company’s significant stockholders. During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company recognized revenue of $13.6 million associated with the Collaboration Agreement. As of December 31, 2021, there was $8.1 million of deferred revenue related to the Collaboration Agreement, which is classified as current in the consolidated balance sheets. The Company has made no payments to Ultragenyx during the year ended December 31, 2021. There is $0.1 million and $0 due from Ultragenyx as of December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively.
 Other License Agreements 
 In 2016, we entered into a license agreement with Life Technologies Corporation, or Life Technologies. In consideration for obtaining a non-exclusive, royalty-free, worldwide license to use certain technologies and associated know-how to develop our product candidates, we paid a one-time, non-refundable license fee. This fee was recorded as a research and development expense in 2016. The license agreement will remain effective in perpetuity unless earlier terminated. Life Technologies has the right to terminate the agreement upon our material, uncured breach of the agreement or in the event that it determines that continued performance of the agreement may violate any laws. We are obligated to diligently pursue regulatory approval necessary for the development, manufacture and sale of the licensed products. We have the right to terminate the agreement at any time upon providing thirty days’ written notice to Life Technologies. 
Competition 
 The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by rapidly changing technologies, significant competition and a strong emphasis on intellectual property. This is also true in treatments of Duchenne, as well as in gene therapy. While we believe that our focus, strength of team, expertise in gene therapy, scientific knowledge and intellectual property provide us with competitive advantages, we face competition from several different sources, including large and small biopharmaceutical companies, academic research institutions, government agencies and public and private research institutions. Not only must we compete with other companies that are focused on gene transfer technology, but any product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with existing therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future. 
 Many of our competitors have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, clinical trials, regulatory approvals and product marketing than we do. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel and establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. Smaller or early stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. 
 We are aware of several companies and research institutions conducting clinical trials of product candidates focused on systemic gene transfers for Duchenne, including Pfizer Inc. and Sarepta Therapeutics, Inc. with product candidates currently in Phase III clinical development,  Genethon with a product candidate currently in Phase I/II/III clinical trial development, and REGENXBIO Inc. which has announced that it intends to start a Phase I/II clinical trial with its gene transfer product in the first half of 2022.

Government regulation and product licensure
U.S. government regulation and product licensure 
 In the United States, biologic products including gene therapy products, such as our lead product candidate, are licensed for marketing by the FDA under the Public Health Service Act, or PHS Act, and regulated by the FDA under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FD&C Act, as well as by other federal, state and local statutes and regulations. Both the FD&C Act and the PHS Act and their corresponding rules and regulations govern, among other things, the testing, manufacturing, safety, efficacy, labeling, packaging, storage, record keeping, distribution, reporting, advertising and other promotional practices involving biologic products. FDA approval must be obtained before conducting human clinical testing of biologic products. Additionally, each clinical trial protocol for a gene therapy product candidate is reviewed by the FDA and, in limited instances, the U.S. National Institutes of Health, or the NIH, through its Office of Biotechnology Activities’ Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee, or RAC. FDA must license a biologic product before it may be marketed within the United States. 
 Within the FDA, the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, or the CBER, regulates gene therapy products. Within CBER, the review of gene therapy and related products is consolidated in the Office of Tissues and Advanced Therapies, or the OTAT, and the FDA has established the Cellular, Tissue and Gene Therapies Advisory Committee to advise CBER on its reviews. CBER, which works closely with the NIH and the RAC, makes recommendations to the NIH on gene therapy issues and engages in a public discussion of scientific, safety, ethical and societal issues related to proposed and ongoing gene therapy protocols. The FDA has licensed human gene therapies products for sale in the United States, and the agency has provided guidance for the development of other gene therapy products. This guidance includes a growing body of guidance documents on chemistry, manufacturing and control, or CMC, clinical investigations and other areas of gene therapy development, all of which are intended to facilitate the industry’s development of gene therapy products. 
 U.S. biologic products development process 
 The process required by the FDA before a biologic product may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following: 
  
• | completion of preclinical laboratory tests and in vivo studies according to the FDA’s GLP requirements and applicable requirements for the humane use of laboratory animals or other applicable regulations;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | design of a clinical protocol and submission to the FDA of an application for an IND, which allows human clinical trials to begin unless the FDA objects within 30 days;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | approval by an institutional review board, or IRB, reviewing each clinical site before each clinical trial may be initiated;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | approval by an institutional biosafety committee, or IBC, assessing the safety of the clinical research and identifying any potential risk to public health or the environment;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | performance of adequate and well controlled human clinical trials according to the FDA’s regulations commonly referred to as good clinical practices, or GCPs, and any additional requirements for the protection of human research subjects and their health information, to establish the safety, potency and purity of the proposed biologic product for its intended use;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | preparation and submission to the FDA of a biologics license application, or BLA, for marketing approval that includes substantive evidence of safety, purity and potency from results of preclinical testing and clinical trials, and detailed information about the CMC for the product, reports of the outcomes and full data sets of the clinical trials and proposed labeling and packaging for the product;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | review of the product candidate by an FDA advisory committee, if applicable;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities where the biologic product candidate is produced to assess compliance with cGMP requirements and to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the biologic product candidate’s identity, safety, strength, quality and purity;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | potential FDA audit of the nonclinical and clinical trial sites that generated the data in support of the BLA;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | payment of user fees;
--+----------------------


• | FDA review and licensure of the BLA; and
--+-----------------------------------------


• | compliance with any post-approval requirements, including the potential requirement to implement a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, and the potential requirement to conduct post-approval studies.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Preclinical Studies and Investigational New Drug Application
 Before testing any biologic product candidate in humans, including a gene therapy product candidate, the product candidate must undergo preclinical testing. Preclinical tests, also referred to as nonclinical studies, include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as in vivo studies to assess the potential safety and activity of the product candidate and to establish a rationale for therapeutic use. The conduct of certain nonclinical studies must comply with federal regulations and requirements, including GLPs and the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Animal Welfare Act, if applicable. 
 If a gene therapy trial is conducted at, or sponsored by, institutions receiving NIH funding for recombinant DNA research, prior to the submission of an IND to the FDA, a protocol and related documents must be submitted to, and the study registered with, the NIH Office of Biotechnology Activities, or OBA, pursuant to the NIH Guidelines for Research Involving Recombinant DNA Molecules, or NIH Guidelines. Compliance with the NIH Guidelines is mandatory for investigators at institutions receiving NIH funds for research involving recombinant DNA. However, many companies and other institutions, not otherwise subject to the NIH Guidelines, voluntarily follow them. NIH is responsible for convening the RAC that discusses protocols that raise novel or particularly important scientific, safety or ethical considerations at one of its quarterly public meetings. The OBA will notify the FDA of the RAC’s decision regarding the necessity for full public review of a gene therapy protocol. RAC proceedings and reports are posted to the OBA website and may be accessed by the public. 
 The clinical trial sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and a proposed clinical protocol, to the FDA as part of the IND. An IND is an exemption from the FD&C Act that allows an unapproved product to be shipped in interstate commerce for use in an investigational clinical trial and a request for FDA authorization to administer an investigational product to humans. Some preclinical tests may continue even after the IND is submitted. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA places the clinical trial on a full clinical hold or partial clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. With gene therapy protocols, if the FDA allows the IND to proceed, but the RAC decides that full public review of the protocol is warranted, the FDA will request at the completion of its IND review that the sponsor delay initiation of the protocol until after completion of the RAC review process. The FDA also may impose clinical holds on a biologic product candidate at any time before or during clinical trials due to safety concerns or non-compliance. If the FDA imposes a clinical hold, trials may not recommence without FDA authorization and then only under terms authorized by the FDA. 
 In addition, the FDA may impose a partial clinical hold at any time before or during clinical trials. A partial clinical hold is a delay or suspension of only part of the clinical work requested under the IND (e.g., a specific protocol or part of a protocol is not allowed to proceed; however, other protocols or parts of the protocol are allowed to proceed under the IND). If the FDA requires that progress to the next study is contingent on (i) FDA review of additional data and (ii) subsequent specific permission for the study to proceed, this represents a partial clinical hold. 
 Human clinical trials under an IND 
 Clinical trials involve the administration of the biologic product candidate to healthy volunteers or subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators, generally physicians not employed by, or under the control of, the trial sponsor. Clinical trials are conducted under written study protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria, and the parameters to be used to monitor subject safety, including stopping rules that assure a clinical trial will be stopped if certain adverse events should occur. Each protocol and any amendments to the protocol must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Clinical trials must be conducted and monitored in accordance with the FDA’s regulations comprising the GCP requirements, including the requirement that all research subjects provide informed consent. 
 Further, each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an IRB at or servicing each institution at which the clinical trial will be conducted. An IRB is charged with protecting the welfare and rights of trial participants and considers such items as whether the risks to individuals participating in the clinical trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB also approves the form and content of the informed consent that must be signed by each clinical trial subject or his or her legal representative, reviews and approves the study protocol and must monitor the clinical trial until completed.
 22

 Additionally, some trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the trial sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board or committee, or DSMB. This group provides authorization as to whether or not a trial may move forward at designated check points based on access that only the group maintains to available data from the study. Clinical trials involving recombinant DNA also must be reviewed by an IBC a local institutional committee that reviews and oversees basic and clinical research and utilizes recombinant DNA at that institution. The IBC assesses the safety of the research and identifies any potential risk to public health or the environment. 
 Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined: 
  
• | Phase I. The investigational biologic product is initially introduced into a small group of healthy human subjects and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution, excretion and, if possible, to gain an early understanding of its effectiveness. In the case of some product candidates for severe or life-threatening diseases, especially when the product candidate may be too inherently toxic to ethically administer to healthy volunteers, the initial human testing is often conducted in patients. Phase I clinical trials of gene therapies are typically conducted in patients rather than healthy volunteers.

• | Phase II. The biologic product candidate is evaluated in a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance, optimal dosage and dosing schedule.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase III. Phase III clinical trials are commonly referred to as “pivotal” studies, which typically denotes a study that presents the data that the FDA or other relevant regulatory agency will use to determine whether or not to approve a biologic product. In Phase III clinical trials, the investigational biologic product is administered to an expanded patient population, generally at multiple geographically dispersed clinical trial sites in adequate and well controlled clinical trials to generate sufficient data to statistically confirm the potency and safety of the product for approval. These clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit ratio of the product candidate and provide an adequate basis for product labeling.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Post-approval clinical trials, sometimes referred to as Phase IV clinical trials, may be conducted after initial approval. These clinical trials are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication, particularly for long-term safety follow-up. 
 A clinical trial may combine the elements of more than one phase and the FDA often requires more than one Phase III trial to support marketing approval of a product candidate. A company’s designation of a clinical trial as being of a particular phase is not necessarily indicative that the study will be sufficient to satisfy the FDA requirements of that phase because this determination cannot be made until the protocol and data have been submitted to and reviewed by the FDA. Generally, pivotal trials are Phase III trials, but they may be Phase II trials if the design provides a well-controlled and reliable assessment of clinical benefit, particularly in an area of unmet medical need.
 During all phases of clinical development, regulatory agencies require extensive monitoring and auditing of all clinical activities, clinical data and clinical trial investigators. Annual progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted to the FDA. In addition, sponsors are given opportunities to meet with the FDA at certain points in the clinical development program, including prior to the submission of an IND (Pre-IND meeting), at the end of a Phase II clinical trial and before a BLA is submitted.
 Written IND safety reports must be promptly submitted to the FDA, the NIH and the investigators for serious and unexpected adverse events, any findings from other trials, in vivo laboratory tests or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk for human subjects, or any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure. The sponsor must submit an IND safety report within 15 calendar days after the sponsor determines that the information qualifies for reporting. The sponsor also must notify the FDA of any unexpected fatal or life-threatening suspected adverse reaction within seven calendar days after the sponsor’s initial receipt of the information. 
 The FDA or the sponsor or its DSMB may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the biologic product candidate has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. 
 23

Finally, sponsors of clinical trials are required to register and disclose certain clinical trial information on a public registry (clinicaltrials.gov) maintained by the NIH.  In particular, information related to the product, patient population, phase of investigation, study sites and investigators and other aspects of the clinical trial is made public as part of the registration of the clinical trial. The NIH’s Final Rule on registration and reporting requirements for clinical trials became effective in 2017, and both NIH and the FDA have recently signaled the government’s willingness to begin enforcing those requirements against non-compliant clinical trial sponsors. The failure to submit clinical trial information to clinicaltrials.gov, as required, is a prohibited act under the FD&C Act with violations subject to potential civil monetary penalties of up to $10,000 for each day the violation continues.
  Expanded Access to an Investigational Drug for Treatment Use 
 Expanded access, sometimes called “compassionate use,” is the use of investigational new drug products outside of clinical trials to treat patients with serious or immediately life-threatening diseases or conditions when there are no comparable or satisfactory alternative treatment options. The rules and regulations related to expanded access are intended to improve access to investigational drugs for patients who may benefit from investigational therapies. FDA regulations allow access to investigational drugs under an IND by the company or the treating physician for treatment purposes on a case-by-case basis for: individual patients (single-patient IND applications for treatment in emergency settings and non-emergency settings); intermediate-size patient populations; and larger populations for use of the drug under a treatment protocol or Treatment IND Application. 
 When considering an IND application for expanded access to an investigational product with the purpose of treating a patient or a group of patients, the sponsor and treating physicians or investigators will determine suitability when all of the following criteria apply: patient(s) have a serious or immediately life-threatening disease or condition, and there is no comparable or satisfactory alternative therapy to diagnose, monitor, or treat the disease or condition; the potential patient benefit justifies the potential risks of the treatment and the potential risks are not unreasonable in the context or condition to be treated; and the expanded use of the investigational drug for the requested treatment will not interfere with initiation, conduct, or completion of clinical investigations that could support marketing approval of the product or otherwise compromise the potential development of the product.
 There is no obligation for a sponsor to make its investigational products available for expanded access; however, as required by the 21st Century Cures Act, or the Cures Act, passed in 2016, if a sponsor has a policy regarding how it responds to expanded access requests, it must make that policy publicly available. Although these requirements were rolled out over time, they have now come into full effect. Sponsors are required to make such policies publicly available upon the earlier of initiation of a Phase II or Phase III study; or 15 days after the drug or biologic receives designation as a breakthrough therapy, fast track product, or regenerative medicine advanced therapy. 
 In addition, on May 30, 2018, the Right to Try Act, was signed into law. The law, among other things, provides a federal framework for certain patients to access certain investigational new drug products that have completed a Phase I clinical trial and that are undergoing investigation for FDA approval. Under certain circumstances, eligible patients can seek treatment without enrolling in clinical trials and without obtaining FDA permission under the FDA expanded access program. There is no obligation for a drug manufacturer to make its drug products available to eligible patients as a result of the Right to Try Act, but the manufacturer must develop an internal policy and respond to patient requests according to that policy.

 Special Regulations and Guidance Governing Gene Therapy Products
 The FDA has defined a gene therapy product as one that mediates its effects by transcription and/or translation of transferred genetic material and/or by integrating into the host genome and which is administered as nucleic acids, viruses, or genetically engineered microorganisms. The products may be used to modify cells in vivo or transferred to cells ex vivo prior to administration to the recipient. Within the FDA, the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, or CBER, regulates gene therapy products. Within CBER, the review of gene therapy and related products is consolidated in the OTAT, and the FDA has established the Cellular, Tissue and Gene Therapies Advisory Committee to advise CBER on its reviews. CBER works closely with the Local Biosafety Board, a federal advisory committee, in reviewing proposed and ongoing gene therapy protocols and engaging in a public discussion of scientific, safety, ethical, and societal issues related to those protocols. The NIH and the Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee, or RAC, a federal advisory committee, also advise the FDA on gene therapy issues and other issues related to emerging technologies. The FDA and the NIH have published guidance documents with respect to the development and submission of gene therapy protocols.
 24

The FDA has issued various guidance documents regarding gene therapies, including final guidance documents released in January 2020 relating to chemistry, manufacturing and controls information for gene therapy INDs, gene therapies for rare diseases and gene therapies for retinal disorders, as well as draft guidance in January 2021 for Human Gene Therapy for Neurodegenerative Diseases. Although the FDA has indicated that these and other guidance documents it previously issued are not legally binding, we believe that our compliance with them is likely necessary to gain approval for any gene therapy product candidate we may develop. The guidance documents provide additional factors that the FDA will consider at each of the above stages of development and relate to, among other things, the proper preclinical assessment of gene therapies; the chemistry, manufacturing, and control information that should be included in an IND application; the proper design of tests to measure product potency in support of an IND or BLA application; and measures to observe delayed adverse effects in subjects who have been exposed to investigational gene therapies when the risk of such effects is high. Further, the FDA usually recommends that sponsors observe subjects for potential gene therapy-related delayed adverse events for a 15-year period, including a minimum of five years of annual examinations followed by 10 years of annual queries, either in person or by questionnaire.
 Further, to facilitate adverse event reporting and dissemination of additional information about gene therapy trials, the FDA and the NIH established the Genetic Modification Clinical Research Information System, or GeMCRIS. Investigators and sponsors of human gene transfer trials can utilize this web-based system to report serious adverse events and to provide annual reports. 
 Finally, for a gene therapy product, the FDA also will not approve the product if the manufacturer is not in compliance with good tissue practices, or GTP. These standards are found in FDA regulations and guidances that govern the methods used in, and the facilities and controls used for, the manufacture of human cells, tissues, and cellular and tissue based products, or HCT/Ps, which are human cells or tissue intended for implantation, transplant, infusion, or transfer into a human recipient. The primary intent of the GTP requirements is to ensure that cell and tissue-based products are manufactured in a manner designed to prevent the introduction, transmission, and spread of communicable disease. FDA regulations also require tissue establishments to register and list their HCT/Ps with the FDA and, when applicable, to evaluate donors through screening and testing. 
 Pediatric Studies
 Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act of 2003, or PREA, a BLA or supplement thereto must contain data that are adequate to assess the safety and effectiveness of the product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations, and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. Sponsors must also submit pediatric study plans prior to the assessment data. Those plans must contain an outline of the proposed pediatric study or studies the sponsor plans to conduct, including study objectives and design, any deferral or waiver requests, and other information required by regulation. The sponsor, the FDA, and the FDA’s internal review committee must then review the information submitted, consult with each other, and agree upon a final plan. The FDA or the sponsor may request an amendment to the plan at any time. 
 For products intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, the FDA must, upon the request of a sponsor, meet to discuss preparation of the initial pediatric study plan or to discuss deferral or waiver of pediatric assessments. In addition, the FDA will meet early in the development process to discuss pediatric study plans with sponsors and FDA must meet with sponsors by no later than the end-of-phase 1 meeting for serious or life-threatening diseases and by no later than 90 days after the FDA’s receipt of the study plan.
 The FDA may, on its own initiative or at the request of the sponsor, grant deferrals for submission of some or all pediatric data until after approval of the product for use in adults, or full or partial waivers from the pediatric data requirements. The law now requires the FDA to send a PREA Non-Compliance letter to sponsors who have failed to submit their pediatric assessments required under PREA, have failed to seek or obtain a deferral or deferral extension or have failed to request approval for a required pediatric formulation. It further requires the FDA to publicly post the PREA Non-Compliance letter and sponsor’s response.  Unless otherwise required by regulation, the pediatric data requirements do not apply to products with orphan designation, although FDA has recently taken steps to limit what it considers abuse of this statutory exemption. Additional requirements and procedures relating to deferral requests and requests for extension of deferrals are contained in the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act, or FDASIA.  The FDA also maintains a list of diseases that are exempt from the requirements PREA, due to low prevalence of disease in the pediatric population.
 25

Compliance with cGMP requirements 
 Manufacturers of biologics must comply with applicable cGMP regulations, including quality control and quality assurance and maintenance of records and documentation. Manufacturers and others involved in the manufacture and distribution of such products also must register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies. Both domestic and foreign manufacturing establishments must register and provide additional information to the FDA upon their initial participation in the manufacturing process. Establishments may be subject to periodic, unannounced inspections by government authorities to ensure compliance with cGMP requirements and other laws. Discovery of problems may result in a government entity placing restrictions on a product, manufacturer or holder of an approved BLA, and may extend to requiring withdrawal of the product from the market. The FDA will not approve a BLA unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specification. 
 Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional preclinical studies and must also develop additional information about the physical characteristics of the biologic product candidate as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product candidate in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. To help reduce the risk of the introduction of adventitious agents or of causing other adverse events with the use of biologic products, the PHS Act emphasizes the importance of manufacturing control for products whose attributes cannot be precisely defined. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other requirements, the sponsor must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality, potency and purity of the final biologic product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested, and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the biologic product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life. 
 Submission and filing of a BLA 
 After the completion of clinical trials of a biologic product, FDA licensure of a BLA must be obtained before commercial marketing of the biologic product. The BLA must include results of product development, laboratory and animal studies, human studies, information on the manufacture and composition of the product, proposed labeling and other relevant information. In addition, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, a BLA or supplement to a BLA must contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of the biologic product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDA may grant deferrals for submission of data or full or partial waivers. 
 Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, as amended, each BLA must be accompanied by a significant user fee. Under federal law, the submission of most NDAs is subject to an application user fee, which for federal fiscal year 2022 is approximately $3.1 million for an application requiring clinical data. The sponsor of an approved NDA is also subject to an annual program fee, which for federal fiscal year 2022 is more than $0.3 million. Fee waivers or reductions are available in certain circumstances, including a waiver of the application fee for the first application filed by a small business. Additionally, no user fees are assessed on BLAs for product candidates designated as orphan drugs, unless the product candidate also includes a non-orphan indication. 
 The FDA reviews a BLA within 60 days of submission to determine if it is substantially complete before the agency accepts it for filing, and it must so notify the sponsor of that determination within the 60 days. The FDA may refuse to file any BLA that it deems incomplete or not properly reviewable at the time of submission and may request additional information. In the event that FDA determines that an application does not satisfy this standard, it will issue a Refuse to File, or RTF, determination to the sponsor.  The BLA may be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application also is subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review of the BLA. 
 With filing of the application, the FDA reviews the BLA to determine, among other things, whether the proposed product is safe and potent, or effective, for its intended use, and has an acceptable purity profile, and whether the product is being manufactured in accordance with cGMP to assure and preserve the product’s identity, safety, strength, quality, potency and purity. The FDA may refer applications for novel biologic products or biologic products that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. 
 During the biologic product approval process, the FDA also will determine whether a REMS, is necessary to assure the safe use of the biologic product. REMS use risk minimization strategies beyond the professional labeling to ensure that the benefits of the product outweigh the potential risks. To determine whether a REMS is needed, the FDA will consider the size of the population likely to use the product, seriousness of the disease, expected benefit of the product, expected duration of 
 26

treatment, seriousness of known or potential adverse events and whether the product is a new molecular entity. A REMS could include medication guides, physician communication plans and elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. If the FDA concludes a REMS is needed, the sponsor of the BLA must submit a proposed REMS; the FDA will not approve the BLA without a REMS, if required. 
 In connection with its review of a BLA, the FDA will inspect the facilities at which the product candidate is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the product candidate unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving a BLA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure that the clinical trials were conducted in compliance with IND study requirements and GCP requirements to ensure the integrity of the clinical data. cGMP, GLP and GCP compliance requires significant expenditure of time, money and effort in the areas of training, recordkeeping, production and quality control.
 Decisions on a BLA
 After evaluating the application and all related information, including the advisory committee recommendations, if any, and inspection reports of manufacturing facilities and clinical trial sites, the FDA will issue either a Complete Response Letter, or CRL, or an approval letter.  To reach this determination, the FDA must determine that the expected benefits of the proposed product outweigh its potential risks to patients. This “benefit-risk” assessment is informed by the extensive body of evidence about the product in the BLA.
 A CRL indicates that the review cycle of the application is complete, and the application will not be approved in its present form. A CRL generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing or information in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. A CRL generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing or information in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. The deficiencies identified may be minor, for example, requiring labeling changes; or major, for example, requiring additional clinical trials. Additionally, the CRL may include recommended actions that the sponsor might take to place the application in a condition for approval. If a CRL is issued, the sponsor may either resubmit the BLA, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, or withdraw the application. 
 If a product receives regulatory approval, the FDA will issue an approval letter. The approval may be significantly limited to specific diseases and dosages or the indications for use may otherwise be limited, which could restrict the commercial value of the product. Further, the FDA may require that certain contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling. The FDA may impose restrictions and conditions on product distribution, prescribing or dispensing in the form of a REMS, or otherwise limit the scope of any approval. In addition, the FDA may require post-marketing clinical trials, sometimes referred to as Phase IV clinical trials, designed to further assess a biologic product’s safety and effectiveness, and testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products that have been commercialized. 
 The FDA has agreed to specified performance goals in the review of BLAs under the PDUFA. One such goal is to review standard BLAs in ten months after the FDA accepts the BLA for filing, and priority BLAs in six months, whereupon a review decision is to be made. The FDA does not always meet its PDUFA goal dates for standard and priority BLAs and its review goals are subject to change from time to time. The review process and the PDUFA goal date may be extended by three months if the FDA requests or the BLA sponsor otherwise provides additional information or clarification regarding information already provided in the submission within the last three months before the PDUFA goal date. 
 Biosimilars and exclusivity 
 The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the companion Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, or the Health Care Reform Law, which was signed into law on March 23, 2010, included a subtitle called the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009, or BPCIA. That Act established a regulatory scheme authorizing the FDA to approve biosimilars and interchangeable biosimilars. 
 Under the BPCIA, a manufacturer may submit an application for licensure of a biologic product that is “biosimilar to” or “interchangeable with” a previously approved biological product or “reference product.” In order for the FDA to approve a biosimilar product, it must find that there are no clinically meaningful differences between the reference product and proposed biosimilar product in terms of safety, purity and potency. For the FDA to approve a biosimilar product as interchangeable with a reference product, the agency must find that the biosimilar product can be expected to produce the same clinical results as the reference product, and (for products administered multiple times) that the biologic and the reference biologic may be switched after one has been previously administered without increasing safety risks or risks of diminished efficacy relative to exclusive use of the reference biologic. 
 27

Under the BPCIA, an application for a biosimilar product may not be submitted to the FDA until four years following the date of approval of the reference product. The FDA may not approve a biosimilar product until 12 years from the date on which the reference product was approved. Even if a product is considered to be a reference product eligible for exclusivity, another company could market a competing version of that product if the FDA approves a full BLA for such product containing the sponsor’s own preclinical data and data from adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to demonstrate the safety, purity and potency of their product. The BPCIA also created certain exclusivity periods for biosimilars approved as interchangeable products. There have been recent government proposals to reduce the 12-year reference product exclusivity period, but none has been enacted to date.  Since passage of the BPCIA, many states have passed laws or amendments to laws, which address pharmacy practices involving biosimilar products.
As of December 27, 2020 (enacted as part of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021), the “patent dance” lists became public information as listed in the Purple Book (FDA’s “Database of Licensed Biological Products”). In particular, reference product BLA holders must submit to the FDA within 30 days of exchanging a patent list (patents with expiry dates) with a biosimilar applicant, as well as any supplemental lists. This information was previously maintained a confidential as between the BLA holder and biosimilar applicant.  Despite publication of these lists, a BLA holder may assert other patents against future filers, and does not exclude enforcement of newly granted patents.
 Additionally, under the Act, the FDA must now publish in the Purple Book the following information about patented biological products:
  
• | a list of each biological product, by nonproprietary name, for which a biologics license is in effect;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the date of licensure and the application number;
--+--------------------------------------------------


• | the licensure status and, as available, the marketing status; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------


• | exclusivity periods.
--+---------------------

  The FDA must publish in the Purple Book all of the above information in the first instance within 180 days of enactment and update every 30 days.
 The FDA has approved a number of biosimilars and the first interchangeable biosimilar product was approved on July 30, 2021 and a second product previously approved as a biosimilar was designated as interchangeable in October 2021.  The FDA has also issued numerous guidance documents outlining its approach to reviewing and licensing biosimilars and interchangeable biosimilars under the PHSA, including a draft guidance issued in November 2020 that seeks to provide additional clarity to manufacturers of interchangeable biosimilars.
 Pediatric exclusivity 
 Pediatric exclusivity is another type of non-patent exclusivity in the United States and, if granted, provides for the attachment of an additional six months of regulatory exclusivity to the term of any existing regulatory exclusivity, including reference product and orphan exclusivity. This six-month exclusivity may be granted if an application sponsor submits pediatric data that fairly respond to a written request from the FDA for such data. The data do not need to show the product to be effective in the pediatric population studied; rather, if the clinical trial is deemed to fairly respond to the FDA’s request, the additional protection is granted. If reports of requested pediatric studies are submitted to and accepted by the FDA within the statutory time limits, whatever statutory or regulatory periods of exclusivity cover the product are extended by six months. Thus, pediatric exclusivity adds six months to existing exclusivity periods applicable to biological products under the BPCIA—namely, the four-year period during which the FDA will not consider an application for a biosimilar product, and the 12-year period during which the FDA will not approve a biosimilar application. 
 Orphan drug designation and exclusivity
 Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may designate a biologic product as an “orphan drug” if it is intended to treat a rare disease or condition (generally meaning that it affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more in cases in which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making a biologic product available in the United States for treatment of the disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product). Orphan product designation must be requested before submitting a BLA. After the FDA grants orphan product designation, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan product designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process. 
 28

If a product with orphan status receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan product exclusivity, meaning that the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug or biologic product for the same indication for seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as if the party holding the exclusivity fails to assure the availability of sufficient quantities of the drug to meet the needs of patients with the disease or condition for which the drug was designated.  In addition, the FDA may not approve other applications to market the same drug or biologic product for the same indication for seven years unless the sponsor of the other product demonstrates that its product is clinically superior to the product with orphan drug exclusivity.  Under Omnibus legislation enacted in December 2020, this clinical superiority requirement applies to drugs and biologics that received orphan drug designation before enactment of the FDA Reauthorization Act in 2017, but have not yet been approved or licensed by FDA. 
 Orphan exclusivity does not block the approval of a different product for the same rare disease or condition, nor does it block the approval of the same product for different indications.  In particular, the concept of what constitutes the "same drug" for purposes of orphan drug exclusivity remains in flux in the context of gene therapies, and the FDA issued final guidance in September 2021 suggesting that it would not consider two gene therapy products to be different drugs solely based on minor differences in the transgenes or vectors. If a product designated as an orphan drug ultimately receives marketing approval for an indication broader than what was designated in its orphan drug application, it may not be entitled to exclusivity. Orphan medicinal product status in the European Union has similar, but not identical, benefits. 
 In September 2021, the Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit held that, for the purpose of determining the scope of market exclusivity, the term “same disease or condition” in the statute means the designated “rare disease or condition” and could not be interpreted by the FDA to mean the “indication or use.” Thus, the court concluded, orphan drug exclusivity applies to the entire designated disease or condition rather than the “indication or use.” It is unclear how this court decision will be implemented by the FDA.
 Expedited development and review programs 
 The FDA is authorized to expedite the review of BLAs in several ways. Under the Fast Track program, the sponsor of a biologic product candidate may request the FDA to designate the product for a specific indication as a Fast Track product concurrent with or after the filing of the IND. Biologic products are eligible for Fast Track designation if they are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening condition and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the condition. Fast Track designation applies to the combination of the product candidate and the specific indication for which it is being studied. In addition to other benefits, such as the ability to have greater interactions with the FDA, the FDA may initiate review of sections of a Fast Track BLA before the application is complete, a process known as rolling review. 
 Any product submitted to the FDA for marketing, including under a Fast Track program, may be eligible for other types of FDA programs intended to expedite development and review, such as breakthrough therapy designation, priority review and accelerated approval. 
  
• | Breakthrough therapy designation. To qualify for the breakthrough therapy program, product candidates must be intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence must indicate that such product candidates may demonstrate substantial improvement on one or more clinically significant endpoints over existing therapies. The FDA will seek to ensure the sponsor of a breakthrough therapy product candidate receives intensive guidance on an efficient drug development program, intensive involvement of senior managers and experienced staff on a proactive, collaborative and cross-disciplinary review and rolling review.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Priority review. A product candidate is eligible for priority review if it treats a serious condition and, if approved, it would be a significant improvement in the safety or effectiveness of the treatment, diagnosis or prevention compared to marketed products. FDA aims to complete its review of priority review applications within six months as opposed to 10 months for standard review.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Accelerated approval. Drug or biologic products studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening illnesses and that provide meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing treatments may receive accelerated approval. Accelerated approval means that a product candidate may be approved on the basis of adequate and well controlled clinical trials establishing that the product candidate has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict a clinical benefit, or on the basis of an effect on a clinical endpoint other than survival or irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity and prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require that a sponsor of a drug or biologic product candidate receiving accelerated
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 29

 
approval perform adequate and well controlled post-marketing clinical trials. In addition, the FDA currently requires as a condition for accelerated approval pre-approval of promotional materials.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Regenerative advanced therapy. With passage of the Cures Act in December 2016, Congress authorized the FDA to accelerate review and approval of products designated as regenerative advanced therapies. A product is eligible for this designation if it is a regenerative medicine therapy that is intended to treat, modify, reverse or cure a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product candidate has the potential to address unmet medical needs for such disease or condition. The benefits of a regenerative advanced therapy designation include early interactions with the FDA to expedite development and review, benefits available to breakthrough therapies, potential eligibility for priority review and accelerated approval based on surrogate or intermediate endpoints.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 None of these expedited programs change the standards for approval but they may help expedite the development or approval process of product candidates. 
 Rare Pediatric Disease Designation and Priority Review Vouchers
 In 2012, Congress enacted the FDASIA, requiring the FDA to award priority review vouchers, or PRVs, to sponsors of certain rare pediatric disease product applications. This program is designed to encourage development of new drug and biological products for prevention and treatment of “rare pediatric diseases” by, upon initial approval of an application meeting certain specified criteria, providing companies with a voucher that can be redeemed to receive a priority review of a subsequent marketing application for a different product. The sponsor of a rare pediatric disease product receiving a PRV may sell or otherwise transfer the voucher to another company. The voucher may be further transferred any number of times before the voucher is used, as long as the sponsor making the transfer has not yet submitted an application relying on the priority review voucher. The FDA may also revoke any PRV if the rare pediatric disease product for which the voucher was awarded is not marketed in the United States within one year following the date of approval.
 In order to receive a PRV upon BLA or NDA approval, the product must receive designation from the FDA as a product for a rare pediatric disease prior to submission of the marketing application. A “rare pediatric disease” is a disease that is serious or life-threatening, in which the serious or life-threatening manifestations primarily affect individuals aged from birth to 18 years and affects fewer than 200,000 people in the United States, or affects more than 200,000 people in the United States but there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making available in the United States a product for such disease or condition will be recovered from sales in the United States of such product.  In addition to receiving rare pediatric disease designation, in order to receive a PRV, the NDA or BLA must be given priority review, rely on clinical data derived from studies examining a pediatric population and dosages of the product intended for that population, not seek approval for a different adult indication in the original rare pediatric disease product application and be for a product that does not include a previously approved active ingredient.
 The Rare Pediatric Disease PRV program was scheduled to expire after September 30, 2020. After that, only drugs designated as rare pediatric treatments and approved by the FDA by October 1, 2022, could receive a voucher.  In December 2020, however, Congress renewed the program as part of the 2021 Coronavirus Response and Relief Supplemental Consolidated Appropriations Act through the federal fiscal year 2024.  Thus, under the current statutory sunset provisions, FDA may only award PRVs for approved rare pediatric disease product applications if sponsors have rare pediatric disease designation for the drug granted by September 30, 2024.   The FDA may not award any rare pediatric disease PRVs after September 30, 2026.
 Post-approval requirements 
 After regulatory approval of a product is obtained, there may be a number of post-approval requirements. For example, as a condition of approval of a BLA, the FDA may require post-marketing testing and surveillance to monitor the product’s safety or efficacy. In addition, holders of an approved BLA are required to keep extensive records, to report certain adverse reactions and production problems to the FDA, to provide updated safety and efficacy information and to comply with requirements concerning advertising and promotional labeling for their products. Also, quality control and manufacturing procedures must continue to conform to cGMP regulations and practices, as well as the manufacturing conditions of approval set forth in the BLA. The FDA periodically inspects manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with cGMP requirements, which impose certain procedural, substantive and recordkeeping requirements. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMP and other aspects of regulatory compliance.

The FDA strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of products that are placed on the market. Products may be promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability. If a company is found to have promoted off-label uses, it may become subject to adverse public relations and administrative and judicial enforcement by the FDA, the Department of Justice, or the Office of the Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services, as well as state authorities. This could subject a company to a range of penalties that could have a significant commercial impact, including civil and criminal fines and agreements that materially restrict the manner in which a company promotes or distributes drug products. In September 2021, the FDA published final regulations which describe the types of evidence that the agency will consider in determining the intended use of a biologic product.
 U.S. patent term restoration and marketing exclusivity 
 Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of FDA approval of product candidates, some of a sponsor’s U.S. patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, or the Hatch-Waxman Amendments. The Hatch-Waxman Amendments permit a patent restoration term of up to five years as compensation for patent terms lost during product development and FDA regulatory review process. However, patent term restoration cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date. The patent term restoration period generally is one-half the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of a BLA plus the time between the submission date of a BLA and the approval of that application. Only one patent applicable to an approved biologic product is eligible for the extension, the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent, and only those claims covering the approved drug, a method for using it or a method for manufacturing it may be extended. Moreover, a given patent may only be extended once based on a single product. The USPTO in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration. 
 Government regulation outside of the U.S. 
 In addition to regulations in the United States, a manufacturer is subject to a variety of regulations in foreign jurisdictions to the extent it chooses to sell any products in those foreign countries. Even if a manufacturer obtains FDA approval of a product, it must still obtain the requisite approvals from regulatory authorities in foreign countries prior to the commencement of clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. Because biologically sourced materials are subject to unique contamination risks, their use may also be restricted in some countries. 
 Clinical trial approval in the European Union 
 On January 31, 2022, the new Clinical Trials Regulation (EU) No 536/2014 became effective in the European Union and replaced the prior Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC. The new regulation aims at simplifying and streamlining the authorization, conduct and transparency of clinical trials in the European Union. Under the new coordinated procedure for the approval of clinical trials, the sponsor of a clinical trial to be conducted in more than one Member State of the European Union, or EU Member State, will only be required to submit a single application for approval. The submission will be made through the Clinical Trials Information System, a new clinical trials portal overseen by the EMA and available to clinical trial sponsors, competent authorities of the EU Member States and the public. 
 The new regulation did not change the preexisting requirement that a sponsor must obtain prior approval from the competent national authority of the EU Member State in which the clinical trial is to be conducted. If the clinical trial is conducted in different EU Member States, the competent authorities in each of these EU Member States must provide their approval for the conduct of the clinical trial. Furthermore, the sponsor may only start a clinical trial at a specific study site after the applicable ethics committee has issued a favorable opinion.
 Parties conducting certain clinical studies must, as in the U.S., post clinical trial information in the European Union at the EudraCT website: https://eudract.ema.europa.eu.
 PRIME designation 
 In March 2016, the EMA, launched the PRIority MEdicines, or PRIME, initiative to foster research and development of medicines that may offer a major therapeutic advantage over existing treatments, or benefit patients without treatment options. PRIME aims to strengthen clinical trial designs to facilitate the generation of high-quality data for the evaluation of 
 31

an application for marketing authorization. To be accepted for PRIME, a medicine has to show its potential to benefit patients with unmet medical needs based on preclinical and/or early clinical data. These medicines are considered priority medicines within the European Union. 
 After an investigational candidate has been selected for PRIME, developers are assigned a rapporteur from the Committee for Human Medicinal Products, or CHMP, to provide continuous support and help to build knowledge ahead of a marketing authorization application, or MAA. A multidisciplinary group of experts will provide broader guidance on the overall development plan and regulatory strategy of the product. Companies are also eligible for accelerated assessment at the time of their regulatory application.
 
Pediatric Studies
 Sponsors developing a new medicinal product must agree upon a Pediatric Investigation Plan, or PIP, with the EMA’s pediatric committee, or PDCO, and must conduct pediatric clinical trials in accordance with that PIP, unless a waiver applies (e.g., because the relevant disease or condition occurs only in adults). The PIP sets out the timing and measures proposed to generate data to support a pediatric indication of the drug for which marketing authorization is being sought. The marketing authorization application for the product must include the results of pediatric clinical trials conducted in accordance with the PIP, unless a waiver applies, or a deferral has been granted by the PDCO of the obligation to implement some or all of the measures of the PIP until there are sufficient data to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of the product in adults, in which case the pediatric clinical trials must be completed at a later date.
 Marketing authorization 
 In the European Union, marketing authorizations for medicinal products may be obtained through several different procedures founded on the same basic regulatory process. 
 The centralized procedure provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization by the European Commission that is valid across the European Economic Area (i.e. the EU as well as Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway). The centralized procedure is compulsory for medicinal products produced by certain biotechnological processes, products designated as orphan medicinal products, and products with a new active substance indicated for the treatment of certain diseases. It is optional for those products that are highly innovative or for which a centralized process is in the interest of patients. Under the centralized procedure in the European Union, the maximum timeframe for the evaluation of an MAA is 210 days, excluding clock stops, when additional written or oral information is to be provided by the sponsor in response to questions asked by the CHMP. Accelerated evaluation may be granted by the CHMP in exceptional cases. These are defined as circumstances in which a medicinal product is expected to be of a “major public health interest.” Three cumulative criteria must be fulfilled in such circumstances: the seriousness of the disease, such as severely disabling or life-threatening diseases, to be treated; the absence or insufficiency of an appropriate alternative therapeutic approach; and anticipation of high therapeutic benefit. In these circumstances, the EMA ensures that the opinion of the CHMP is given within 150 days. 
 The EMA’s Committee for Advanced Therapies, or CAT, is responsible for assessing the quality, safety and efficacy of advanced-therapy medicinal products. Advanced-therapy medical products include gene therapy medicine, somatic cell therapy medicines and tissue-engineered medicines. The role of the CAT is to prepare a draft opinion on an application for marketing authorization for a gene therapy medicinal candidate that is submitted to the EMA. In the EU, the development and evaluation of a gene therapy medicinal product must be considered in the context of the relevant EU guidelines. The EMA may issue new guidelines concerning the development and marketing authorization for somatic cell therapy medicinal products and require that we comply with these new guidelines. Similarly, complex regulatory environments exist in other jurisdictions in which we might consider seeking regulatory approvals for our product candidates, further complicating the regulatory landscape. As a result, the procedures and standards applied to gene therapy products and cell therapy products may be applied to any of our gene therapy or genome editing product candidates, but that remains uncertain at this point.
 Specifically, the grant of marketing authorization in the European Union for products containing viable human tissues or cells such as gene therapy medicinal products is governed by Regulation 1394/2007/EC on advanced therapy medicinal products, read in combination with Directive 2001/83/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council, commonly known as the Community code on medicinal products. Regulation 1394/2007/EC includes specific rules concerning the authorization, supervision, and pharmacovigilance of gene therapy medicinal products, somatic cell therapy medicinal products, and tissue engineered products. Manufacturers of advanced therapy medicinal products must demonstrate the quality, safety, and efficacy of their products to EMA which provides an opinion regarding the MAA. The European Commission grants or refuses marketing authorization in light of the opinion delivered by EMA. 
 32

The decentralized procedure provides for approval by one or more other concerned EU Member States of an assessment of an application for marketing authorization conducted by one EU Member State, known as the reference EU Member State. In accordance with this procedure, a sponsor submits an application for marketing authorization to the reference EU Member State and the concerned EU Member States. This application is identical to the application that would be submitted to the EMA for authorization through the centralized procedure. The reference EU Member State prepares a draft assessment and drafts of the related materials within 120 days after receipt of a valid application. The resulting assessment report is submitted to the concerned EU Member States which, within 90 days of receipt, must decide whether to approve the assessment report and related materials. 
 If a concerned EU Member State cannot approve the assessment report and related materials due to concerns relating to a potential serious risk to public health, disputed elements may be referred to the European Commission, whose decision is binding on all EU Member States. In accordance with the mutual recognition procedure, the sponsor applies for national marketing authorization in one EU Member State. Upon receipt of this authorization the sponsor can then seek the recognition of this authorization by other EU Member States. Authorization in accordance with either of these procedures will result in authorization of the medicinal product only in the reference EU Member State and in the other concerned EU Member States. 
 A marketing authorization may be granted only to a sponsor established in the European Union. Regulation No. 1901/2006 provides that, prior to obtaining a marketing authorization in the European Union, a sponsor must demonstrate compliance with all measures included in a Pediatric Investigation Plan, or PIP, approved by the Pediatric Committee of the EMA, covering all subsets of the pediatric population, unless the EMA has granted a product-specific waiver, class waiver, or a deferral for one or more of the measures included in the PIP. 
 In specific circumstances, E.U. legislation on Conditional Marketing Authorizations for Medicinal Products for Human Use, or conditional marketing authorization, enables sponsors to obtain a conditional marketing authorization prior to obtaining the comprehensive clinical data required for an application for a full marketing authorization. Such conditional approvals may be granted for product candidates (including medicines designated as orphan medicinal products) if the risk-benefit balance of the product candidate is positive, it is likely that the sponsor will be in a position to provide the required comprehensive clinical trial data, the product fulfills unmet medical needs and the benefit to public health of the immediate availability on the market of the medicinal product concerned outweighs the risk inherent in the fact that additional data are still required. A conditional marketing authorization may contain specific obligations to be fulfilled by the marketing authorization holder, including obligations with respect to the completion of ongoing or new studies, and with respect to the collection of pharmacovigilance data. 
 Conditional marketing authorization 
 Conditional marketing authorizations are valid for one year, and may be renewed annually, if the risk-benefit balance remains positive, and after an assessment of the need for additional or modified conditions and/or specific obligations. The timelines for the centralized procedure described above also apply with respect to the review by the CHMP of applications for a conditional marketing authorization. 
 The requirements and processes governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. In all cases, the clinical trials are conducted in accordance with GCPs and the applicable regulatory requirements of the country or countries in which the clinical trial is performed, as well as the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki (whichever provides the greater protection to the clinical trial participants). 
  General Data Protection Regulation
 The collection, use, disclosure, transfer, or other processing of personal data regarding individuals in the EU, including personal health data, is subject to the EU General Data Protection Regulation, or the GDPR, which became effective on May 25, 2018. The GDPR is wide-ranging in scope and imposes numerous requirements on companies that process personal data, including requirements relating to processing health and other sensitive data, obtaining consent of the individuals to whom the personal data relates, providing information to individuals regarding data processing activities, implementing safeguards to protect the security and confidentiality of personal data, providing notification of data breaches, and taking certain measures when engaging third-party processors. The GDPR also imposes strict rules on the transfer of personal data to countries outside the EU, including the U.S., and permits data protection authorities to impose large penalties for violations of the GDPR, including potential fines of up to €20 million or 4% of annual global revenues, whichever is greater. The GDPR also confers a private right of action on data subjects and consumer associations to lodge complaints with supervisory authorities, seek judicial remedies, and obtain compensation for damages resulting from violations of the GDPR.  Compliance with the GDPR will be a rigorous and time-intensive process that may increase the cost of doing business or require companies to change their business practices to ensure full compliance.
 33

Orphan Drug Designation and Exclusivity
 The criteria for designating an orphan medicinal product in the EU are similar in principle to those in the United States.  Under Article 3 of Regulation (EC) 141/2000, a medicinal product may be designated as orphan if (1) it is intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of a life- threatening or chronically debilitating condition, (2) either (a) such condition affects no more than five in 10,000 persons in the EU when the application is made, or (b) the product, without the benefits derived from orphan status, would not generate sufficient return in the EU to justify investment and (3) there exists no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention or treatment of such condition authorized for marketing in the EU, or if such a method exists, the product will be of significant benefit to those affected by the condition.  The term “significant benefit” is defined in Regulation (EC) 847/2000 to mean a clinically relevant advantage or a major contribution to patient care.
 Orphan medicinal products are eligible for financial incentives such as reduction of fees or fee waivers and are, upon grant of a marketing authorization, entitled to ten years of market exclusivity for the approved therapeutic indication. During this ten year market exclusivity period, the EMA or the competent authorities of the Member States of the European Economic Area, or EEA, cannot accept an application for a marketing authorization for a similar medicinal product for the same indication. A similar medicinal product is defined as a medicinal product containing a similar active substance or substances as contained in an authorized orphan medicinal product, and which is intended for the same therapeutic indication. The application for orphan designation must be submitted before the application for marketing authorization. The sponsor will receive a fee reduction for the marketing authorization application if the orphan designation has been granted, but not if the designation is still pending at the time the marketing authorization is submitted. Orphan designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process.
 The ten-year market exclusivity in the EU may be reduced to six years if, at the end of the fifth year, it is established that the product no longer meets the criteria for orphan designation, for example, if the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity. Additionally, marketing authorization may be granted to a similar product for the same indication at any time if: (1) the second sponsor can establish that its product, although similar, is safer, more effective or otherwise clinically superior; (2) the sponsor consents to a second orphan medicinal product application; or (3) the sponsor cannot supply enough orphan medicinal product.
 
Pediatric Exclusivity
 Products that are granted a marketing authorization with the results of the pediatric clinical trials conducted in accordance with the PIP are eligible for a six month extension of the protection under a supplementary protection certificate (if any is in effect at the time of approval) even where the trial results are negative. In the case of orphan medicinal products, a two-year extension of the orphan market exclusivity may be available. This pediatric reward is subject to specific conditions and is not automatically available when data in compliance with the PIP are developed and submitted.
 Brexit and the Regulatory Framework in the United Kingdom
 The United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the EU took place on January 31, 2020. The EU and the United Kingdom reached an agreement on their new partnership in the Trade and Cooperation Agreement, or the Agreement, which was applied provisionally beginning on January 1, 2021 and which entered into force on May 1, 2021. The Agreement focuses primarily on free trade by ensuring no tariffs or quotas on trade in goods, including healthcare products such as medicinal products. Thereafter, the EU and the United Kingdom will form two separate markets governed by two distinct regulatory and legal regimes. As such, the Agreement seeks to minimize barriers to trade in goods while accepting that border checks will become inevitable as a consequence that the United Kingdom is no longer part of the single market. As of January 1, 2021, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency, or the MHRA, became responsible for supervising medicines and medical devices in Great Britain, comprising England, Scotland and Wales under domestic law whereas Northern Ireland continues to be subject to EU rules under the Northern Ireland Protocol. The MHRA will rely on the Human Medicines Regulations 2012 (SI 2012/1916) (as amended), or the HMR, as the basis for regulating medicines. The HMR has incorporated into the domestic law the body of EU law instruments governing medicinal products that pre-existed prior to the United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the EU.
 Furthermore, while the Data Protection Act of 2018 in the United Kingdom that “implements” and complements the GDPR, achieved Royal Assent on May 23, 2018 and is now effective in the United Kingdom, it is still unclear whether transfer of data from the EEA to the United Kingdom will remain lawful under the GDPR. The Trade and Cooperation Agreement provides for a transitional period during which the United Kingdom will be treated like a European Union member state in relation to processing and transfers of personal data for four months from January 1, 2021.  This may be extended by two further months. After such period, the United Kingdom will be a “third country” under the GDPR unless the European Commission adopts an adequacy decision in respect of transfers of personal data to the United Kingdom. The United Kingdom has already determined that it considers all of the 27 EU member states and EEA member states to be adequate for the purposes of data protection, ensuring that data flows from the United Kingdom to the EU/EEA remain unaffected.

Healthcare law and regulation 
 Healthcare providers and third-party payors play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of products that are granted marketing approval. Arrangements with providers, consultants, third-party payors and customers are subject to broadly applicable fraud and abuse, anti-kickback, false claims laws, reporting of payments to physicians and teaching physicians and patient privacy laws and regulations and other healthcare laws and regulations that may constrain business and/or financial arrangements. Restrictions under applicable federal and state healthcare laws and regulations, include the following: 
  
• | the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons and entities from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, paying, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, any good or service, for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, under a federal healthcare program such as Medicare and Medicaid;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the federal civil and criminal false claims laws, including the civil False Claims Act, and civil monetary penalties laws, which prohibit individuals or entities from, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, to the federal government, claims for payment that are false, fictitious or fraudulent or knowingly making, using or causing to made or used a false record or statement to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, which created additional federal criminal laws that prohibit, among other things, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or making false statements relating to healthcare matters;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, and their respective implementing regulations, including the Final Omnibus Rule published in January 2013, which impose obligations, including mandatory contractual terms, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the federal false statements statute, which prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the federal transparency requirements known as the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act, under the Health Care Reform Law, which requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies to report annually to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, within the United States Department of Health and Human Services, information related to payments and other transfers of value made by that entity to physicians, other healthcare professionals and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians, other healthcare professionals and their immediate family members; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | analogous state and foreign laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws, which may apply to healthcare items or services that are reimbursed by non-governmental third-party payors, including private insurers.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Some state laws require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government in addition to requiring manufacturers to report information related to payments to physicians and other health care providers or marketing expenditures. State and foreign laws also govern the privacy and security of health information in some circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts. 
 35

Pharmaceutical insurance coverage and health care reform 
 In the United States and markets in other countries, patients who are prescribed treatments for their conditions and providers performing the prescribed services generally rely on third-party payors to reimburse all or part of the associated health care costs. Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of products approved by the FDA and other government authorities. Thus, even if a product candidate is approved, sales of the product will depend, in part, on the extent to which third-party payors, including government health programs in the United States such as Medicare and Medicaid, commercial health insurers and managed care organizations, provide coverage and establish adequate reimbursement levels for, the product. The process for determining whether a payor will provide coverage for a product may be separate from the process for setting the price or reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the product once coverage is approved. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged, examining the medical necessity and reviewing the cost-effectiveness of medical products and services and imposing controls to manage costs. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific products on an approved list, also known as a formulary, which might not include all of the approved products for a particular indication. 
 By way of example, the United States and state governments continue to propose and pass legislation designed to reduce the cost of healthcare. In March 2010, the United States Congress enacted the Health Care Reform Law, which, among other things, includes changes to the coverage and payment for products under government health care programs.  In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the Health Care Reform Law was enacted. In August 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011, among other things, created measures for spending reductions by Congress. A Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, tasked with recommending a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2013 through 2021, was unable to reach required goals, thereby triggering the legislation’s automatic reduction to several government programs. These changes included aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect in April 2013 and will remain in effect through 2031 under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act.  These Medicare sequester reductions have been suspended through the end of March 2022. From April 2022 through June 2022, a 1% sequester cut will be in effect, with the full 2% cut resuming thereafter.  
 The American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, among other things, reduced Medicare payments to several providers and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. Additionally, the 2020 federal spending package permanently eliminated, effective January 1, 2020, the Health Care Reform Law-mandated “Cadillac” tax on high-cost employer-sponsored health coverage and medical device tax and, effective January 1, 2021, also eliminates the health insurer tax.  Further, the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, among other things, amended the Health Care Reform Law, effective January 1, 2019, to increase from 50 percent to 70 percent the point-of-sale discount that is owed by pharmaceutical manufacturers who participate in Medicare Part D and to close the coverage gap in most Medicare drug plans, commonly referred to as the “donut hole.”  These laws may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding and otherwise affect the prices we may obtain for any of our product candidates for which we may obtain regulatory approval or the frequency with which any such product candidate is prescribed or used. 
 Since enactment of the Health Care Reform Law, there have been, and continue to be, numerous legal challenges and Congressional actions to repeal and replace provisions of the law. For example, with enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, or the TCJA, Congress repealed the “individual mandate.” The repeal of this provision, which requires most Americans to carry a minimal level of health insurance, became effective in 2019.  On December 14, 2018, a U.S. District Court judge in the Northern District of Texas ruled that the individual mandate portion of the Health Care Reform Law is an essential and inseverable feature of the Health Care Reform Law, and therefore because the mandate was repealed as part of the TCJA, the remaining provisions of the Health Care Reform Law are invalid as well. The U.S. Supreme Court heard this case on November 10, 2020 and, on June 17, 2021, dismissed this action after finding that the plaintiffs do not have standing to challenge the constitutionality of the Health Care Reform Law.  Litigation and legislation over the Health Care Reform Law are likely to continue, with unpredictable and uncertain results.
 Although the previous administration took executive actions to undermine or delay implementation of the Health Care Reform Law, President Biden rescinded those actions with the issuance of an Executive Order on January 28, 2021 which directs federal agencies to reconsider rules and other policies that limit Americans’ access to health care, and consider actions that will protect and strengthen that access.  Under this Order, federal agencies are directed to re-examine: policies that undermine protections for people with pre-existing conditions, including complications related to COVID-19; demonstrations and waivers under Medicaid and the Health Care Reform Law that may reduce coverage or undermine the programs, including work requirements; policies that undermine the Health Insurance Marketplace or other markets for health insurance; policies that make it more difficult to enroll in Medicaid and the Health Care Reform Law; and policies that reduce affordability of coverage or financial assistance, including for dependents. 
 The prices of prescription pharmaceuticals have also been the subject of considerable discussion in the United States. There have been several recent U.S. congressional inquiries, as well as proposed and enacted state and federal legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to pharmaceutical pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reduce the costs of pharmaceuticals under Medicare and Medicaid.  In 2020, CMS issued an interim final rule implementing a most favored nation model for prices that would tie Medicare Part B payments for 
 36

certain physician-administered pharmaceuticals to the lowest price paid in other economically advanced countries, effective January 1, 2021. That rule, however, has been subject to a nationwide preliminary injunction and, on December 29, 2021, CMS issued a final rule to rescind it. With issuance of this rule, CMS stated that it will explore all options to incorporate value into payments for Medicare Part B pharmaceuticals and improve beneficiaries' access to evidence-based care.
 In addition, in October 2020, the Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, and the FDA published a final rule allowing states and other entities to develop a Section 804 Importation Program, or SIP, to import certain prescription drugs from Canada into the United States. The final rule is currently the subject of ongoing litigation, but at least six states (Vermont, Colorado, Florida, Maine, New Mexico, and New Hampshire) have passed laws allowing for the importation of drugs from Canada with the intent of developing SIPs for review and approval by the FDA.  Further, on November 20, 2020, HHS finalized a regulation removing safe harbor protection for price reductions from pharmaceutical manufacturers to plan sponsors under Part D, either directly or through pharmacy benefit managers, unless the price reduction is required by law. The implementation of the rule has been delayed by the Biden administration from January 1, 2022 to January 1, 2023 in response to ongoing litigation. The rule also creates a new safe harbor for price reductions reflected at the point-of-sale, as well as a new safe harbor for certain fixed fee arrangements between pharmacy benefit managers and manufacturers, the implementation of which have also been delayed by the Biden administration until January 1, 2023.
 At the state level, individual states are increasingly aggressive in passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. A number of states, for example, require drug manufacturers and other entities in the drug supply chain, including health carriers, pharmacy benefit managers, wholesale distributors, to disclose information about pricing of pharmaceuticals.  In addition, regional health care authorities and individual hospitals are increasingly using bidding procedures to determine what pharmaceutical products and which suppliers will be included in their prescription drug and other health care programs. These measures could reduce the ultimate demand for our products, if approved, or put pressure on our product pricing. We expect that additional state and federal healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services, which could result in reduced demand for our product candidates or additional pricing pressures.
 Environmental regulations 
 We are also subject to regulation under the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Environmental Protection Act, the Toxic Substances Control Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and other present and potential federal, state or local regulations. These and other laws govern our use, handling and disposal of various biological and chemical substances used in, and waste generated by, our operations. Our research and development involves the controlled use of hazardous materials, chemicals and viruses. 
 Human Capital 
 In January 2020, we announced a reduction in workforce by approximately one third as part of a strategic plan designed to create a leaner company focused on advancing SGT-001. As of December 31, 2021, we employed 104 full-time employees, including 76 in research and development and 28 in general and administrative positions. Nineteen of our employees hold Ph.D. or M.D. degrees.  
 We recognize that attracting, motivating and retaining talented employees is vital to our success. We value the health and wellness of our employees and their families. It is our goal to deliver innovative programs that provide choice, quality and value. We aim to create an equitable, inclusive and empowering environment in which our employees can grow and advance their careers, with the overall goal of developing, expanding and retaining our workforce to support our current pipeline and future business goals. Our success also depends on our ability to attract, engage and retain a diverse group of employees. Our efforts to recruit and retain a diverse and passionate workforce include providing competitive compensation and benefits packages.
 Our human capital resources objectives include, as applicable, identifying, recruiting, retaining, incentivizing and integrating our existing and additional employees. The principal purposes of our equity incentive plans are to attract, retain and motivate selected employees, consultants and directors through the granting of stock-based compensation awards. We offer a comprehensive benefits program that provides resources to help employees manage their health, finances, and life outside of work.
