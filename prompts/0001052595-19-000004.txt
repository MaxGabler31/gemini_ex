General 
We are a NYSE-listed hospitality and leisure company (ticker symbol: RLH) doing business as RLH Corporation and primarily engaged in the franchising and ownership of hotels under the following proprietary brands: Hotel RL, Red Lion Hotels, Red Lion Inn & Suites, GuestHouse, Settle Inn, Americas Best Value Inn, Canadas Best Value Inn, Signature and Signature Inn, Knights Inn, and Country Hearth Inns & Suites.
All our properties strive to highlight friendly service and reflect the local flair of their markets. The upscale and midscale RLH Corporation brands of Hotel RL, Red Lion Hotel and Red Lion Inn & Suites offer a unique local spin on the expected travel experience in an environment that allows customers to feel welcome and at home. Our focus is to anticipate guest needs and pleasantly surprise them with our distinctive Pacific Northwest-inspired customer service. Warm and authentic, our commitment 
1

to customer service includes a focus on delivering the guest locally inspired, friendly and personalized signature moments. This is intended to position each RLH Corporation brand hotel as an advocate to our traveling guests, creating brand relevance and loyalty, differentiating us from our competition.
Hotel RL, our upscale lifestyle brand launched in October 2014, is a full-service conversion brand that is targeted for the top 80 U.S. urban markets, inspired by the spirit of the Pacific Northwest and designed for consumers with a millennial mindset. With Hotel RL we have a hotel product that is intended to be flexible enough to allow adaptive reuse projects, conversions and new builds, to a lesser extent, while giving owners a more free-form approach to adapt the hotel to their unique markets and locations. The flat fee structure is a true differentiator in this segment to establish the Hotel RL brand, which provides a predictable cost structure for our franchisees with the opportunity to leverage a greater proportion of their top-line growth to superior hotel performance. There are seven hotels currently open in the Hotel RL brand and seven more expected to open in 2019 through 2021. The currently open hotels are located in Baltimore Inner Harbor, Maryland; Washington DC; Olympia, Washington; Salt Lake City, Utah; Brooklyn, New York; New Orleans, Louisiana and Fort Walton, Florida.
Our economy brands are focused on delivering our guests a consistent experience with exceptional comfort, quality and service at an affordable rate, with approximately 1,300 locations in 47 states, the District of Columbia, and two countries outside the United States.

On May 14, 2018, Red Lion Hotels Franchising, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of RLH Corporation (RLH Franchising) completed the purchase of all of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of Knights Franchise Systems, Inc. (KFS), and the purchase of certain operating assets from, and assumption of certain liabilities relating to the business of franchising Knights Inn branded hotels to hotel owners from Wyndham Hotel Group Canada, ULC and Wyndham Hotel Group Europe Limited, pursuant to an Amended and Restated Purchase Agreement, dated May 1, 2018. The aggregate purchase price was $27.2 million. 
On October 5, 2017, we announced that we would be marketing for sale 11 of our owned hotels held by our consolidated joint venture, RL Venture. This is consistent with the Company’s previously stated business strategy to focus on moving towards operations as primarily a franchise company. As of December 31, 2018, nine of the properties have been sold. Using proceeds from the sale of the hotels and the release of restricted cash associated with the debt, RL Venture repaid the remaining principal balance outstanding under its loan agreement with Pacific Western Bank in July 2018. On August 9, 2018, we announced that we would be marketing for sale our leasehold interests in our Anaheim, California and Kalispell, Montana hotels and the hotel in Atlanta, Georgia owned by our consolidated joint venture, RLH Atlanta LLC (RLH Atlanta).

On October 3, 2017, we completed the sale of certain specified liabilities and substantially all of the assets of our entertainment segment, previously composed of WestCoast Entertainment and TicketsWest, including ticketing agreements and engagement agreements with various entertainment venues, teams and artists located throughout the Western United States. As such, the results of the entertainment segment are reported as discontinued operations, and the assets and liabilities are classified as held for sale as of December 31, 2017 in this annual report on Form 10-K. The loss on sale of the entertainment segment included in the 2017 financial statements was $0.2 million, net of tax. See Note 17, Acquisitions and Dispositions within Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for further discussion of the transactions discussed above.
Operations 
We operate in two reportable segments: 

• | The franchised hotels segment is engaged primarily in licensing our brands to franchisees. This segment generates revenue from royalty, marketing, and other fees that are primarily based on a percentage of room revenue or on room count or on transaction count and are charged to hotel owners in exchange for the use of our brand and access to our marketing and central services programs. These central services and marketing programs include our reservation system, guest loyalty program, national and regional sales, revenue management tools, quality inspections, advertising and brand standards.


• | The company operated hotel segment derives revenues primarily from guest room rentals and food and beverage offerings at owned and leased hotels for which we consolidate results. Revenues have also been derived from management fees and related charges for hotels with which we contract to perform management services, however our last management agreement terminated in February 2019.

Our remaining activities, none of which constitutes a reportable segment, have been aggregated into "other". 
We have two measures of segment performance under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (GAAP): revenue and operating income. In addition, the following non-GAAP measurements are used to evaluate the performance of our franchise segment: 
•Revenue per available room (RevPAR) 
•Average daily rate (ADR)
•Occupancy
•Room count
Intersegment revenues are minimal. Certain operating expenses are allocated to the operating segments based upon internally established allocation methodologies. Income tax provision (benefit) and certain corporate operating expenses are neither allocated to the segments nor included in the measures of segment performance. See Item 7. Non-GAAP Financial Measures for information about our non-GAAP measures and reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP measures. 
Overview
Company Strategy 
Our strategy is to grow our brands and profitability by expanding our franchise hotel network with additional hotels. In 2018 we executed 167 franchise agreements. Also during 2018, 180 franchise agreements in our network terminated, partially due to our focus on eliminating hotels that did not meet RLH Corporation's hotel standards. 
By segmenting our upscale, midscale and economy brands with clear distinctions between each offering, we are uniquely positioned to provide an appealing alternative for a variety of owners. Our strategy for our upscale and midscale hotel brands is to identify larger urban metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs) that are saturated by larger brands in order to become the conversion brand of choice for owners of established hotels looking for alternatives in those markets. We believe our upscale and midscale brands have strong name recognition in the Western U.S. markets provide us with an opportunity to expand our hotel network into markets across North America where our brands will be a unique and new value proposition for current and potential hotel owners in markets saturated by competitor brands. To assist in our ability to grow our hotel network in larger metropolitan cities, we may consider special incentives, minority equity, joint venture opportunities with hotel owners and investors, or adding additional brand options. Our economy hotel brands have strong national brand name recognition and provide hotel owners an affordable alternative to traditional franchise programs with primarily flat fees, sensible property improvement plans and a wealth of resources and programs to support owners. In addition to conversion from other brands, independently branded hotel operations may also benefit

from the RLH Corporation central services programs. For all of our properties, we strive to provide hotel owners leading demand distribution technology and sales support as part of our brand support programs. 
Franchised Hotels
As of December 31, 2018 our network of hotels included 1,318 hotels under franchise agreements, representing approximately 83,800 rooms. We are growing our franchise network of hotels through execution of franchise agreements with hotel owners and through acquisitions of hotel brands and/or companies.
In March 2019, we announced the creation of a new subsidiary, RLabs, Inc. RLabs was formed to be a travel technology-based innovator that houses and builds on the groundbreaking technology platform the company has created, including RevPak. RLabs will focus on new revenue verticals, and on developing unique technology and system offerings for the hospitality industry including software, robotics, and artificial intelligence. The first offering from RLabs is Canvas Integrated Systems, an all-in-one cloud-based hospitality management suite featuring a collection of seamlessly-integrated tools designed to drive revenue, secure more revenue opportunities, automate channel management and reduce cost and friction for independent hotel owners.
In May 2018, we acquire the Knights Inn brand and related franchise agreements for approximately 350 hotels operating under the brand. See Note 17 for discussion of Acquisitions and Dispositions within Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.
In December 2017, we announced the launch of franchiseasysm, a re-imagined franchise process to appeal to owners of independent hotels or hotels that don't fit a traditional franchise. The process provides a straightforward and flexible website application process for hoteliers looking to operate as independent or under the nationwide Country Hearth brand. Applications can be completed from a mobile device, and agreements offer an associated simplified fee structure. 
In September 2016, we acquired over 1,000 hotel franchise and membership license agreements, as well as multiple brand names, including Americas Best Value Inn, Canadas Best Value Inn, Lexington Hotels & Inns, America's Best Inns & Suites, Jameson Inns, Country Hearth Inns & Suites, Vantage Hotels, Value Inn Worldwide, Value Hotel Worldwide, 3 Palms Hotels and Resorts and Signature Inn. These acquired brands substantially increased our number of franchise properties and provided us with a broader presence in the United States and Canada. 
We are also investing in technology and sales and marketing talent to improve our ability to manage the various channels that drive occupancy and average daily rate at our hotels, including transient, group and preferred corporate business. We continue to improve and implement our guest management ecosystem, RevPak, which includes a number of industry revenue generation systems fully integrated to provide comprehensive information on customer acquisition, customer management and customer retention. This suite of products is flexible and dynamic and can be tailored to the needs of individual hotel brands. It also delivers dynamic and personalized communications and promotions tailored to individual guest travel needs and habits.
Our focus on providing improved e-commerce revenue generation to our hotel owners includes investing in our rlhco.com website, enhanced and economical guest loyalty program, and improved and targeted digital marketing utilizing information generated through our RevPak reservation and distribution system.
Company Operated Hotels
We operated nine hotels as of December 31, 2018. These include one wholly owned hotel, four hotels owned or operated under a land lease through joint venture (JV) entities, in each of which we have a majority ownership interest and consolidate as the primary beneficiary, three hotels operated under land and/or property leases held directly by the Company, and one hotel we operate under a management agreement. 
Our Baltimore Hotel RL is a wholly owned hotel as of December 31, 2018. Previously, the hotel was held in its own JV entity, RLS Balt Venture, LLC, of which we owned 73%, until we purchased the remaining noncontrolling interest in October 2018. 
As of December 31, 2018, our Hotel RL Salt Lake City and Hotel RL Olympia hotels are held in RL Venture, LLC, of which we own a 55% interest. During 2018, nine of the RL Venture properties were sold and we paid off the RL Venture debt agreement. 
Our Red Lion Hotel Atlanta Airport is held in its own JV entity, RLS Atla Venture, LLC, of which we own 55%. The obligation for our debt under the JV loan agreement at RL Alta Venture, LLC is generally non-recourse to RLH Corporation, except for instances of fraud, criminal activity, waste, misappropriation of revenues, and breach of environmental representations.

Our Washington DC Hotel RL is held in its own JV entity, RLS DC Venture, LLC, of which we own 55%. 
We have a leasehold interest in our Anaheim, Seatac, and Kalispell hotel properties. These leases have expiration dates in 2021, 2024, and 2028, respectively. The Anaheim lease has 17 five-year renewal options remaining and the Kalispell lease has three five-year renewal options remaining. 
We operate the Bellevue hotel under a management agreement. This agreement has expired in February 2019. 
Revenues
In the fourth quarter of 2018, we disaggregated and reclassified the presentation of certain items in the Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss). Results for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 and interim periods for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 have been reclassified to conform to our current year presentation. We have disaggregated royalty revenues from other franchise revenues, and combined revenues from company operated hotels and other revenues from managed properties. 
We believe these classifications better reflect our results of operations as we have changed our business model to focus on the franchising of hotels. Additionally, we believe these reclassifications will allow better comparison with financial statements of peer companies. The reclassifications had no impact on total revenue for any period. See Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies within Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for further discussion of the impact of these reclassifications on our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss). 
A summary of our reporting segment revenues is provided below (in thousands, except for percentages). For further information regarding our reportable segments, see Note 3, Business Segments within Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.

Employees
At December 31, 2018, we employed approximately 540 people on a full-time or part-time basis. Our total number of employees fluctuates seasonally, primarily due to company operated hotel activity. At December 31, 2018, approximately 11% of our total workforce was covered by various collective bargaining agreements providing, generally, for basic pay rates, working hours, other conditions of employment and organized settlement of labor disputes. At February 28, 2019, we employed approximately 410 people on a full-time or part-time basis. Our employee count has declined over time as we have disposed of a number of our company operated hotels and entered into third party management agreements for many of our remaining company operated hotels. At February 28, 2019, none of our workforce was covered by collective bargaining agreements. We believe our employee relations are positive.
