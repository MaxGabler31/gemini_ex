The Company
 
Microbot is a pre-clinical medical device company specializing in the research, design and development of next generation robotic endoluminal surgery devices targeting the minimally invasive surgery space. Microbot is primarily focused on leveraging its micro-robotic technologies with the goal of redefining surgical robotics while improving surgical outcomes for patients.
 
Microbot’s current technological platforms, ViRobTM, TipCATTM, LIBERTY® and certain CardioSert assets, are comprised of proprietary innovative technologies. Using the ViRob platform, Microbot is currently developing the Self-Cleaning Shunt, or SCSTM, for the treatment of hydrocephalus and Normal Pressure Hydrocephalus, or NPH. Utilizing the LIBERTY and CardioSert platforms, Microbot is developing the first ever fully disposable robot for various endovascular interventional procedures. In addition, the Company is focused on the development of a Multi Generation Pipeline Portfolio utilizing all of its proprietary technologies.
 
Microbot has a patent portfolio of 47 issued/allowed patents and 29 patent applications pending worldwide.
 
We were incorporated on August 2, 1988 in the State of Delaware under the name Cellular Transplants, Inc. The original Certificate of Incorporation was restated on February 14, 1992 to change our name to CytoTherapeutics, Inc. On May 24, 2000, the Certificate of Incorporation as restated was further amended to change our name to StemCells, Inc. On November 28, 2016, C&RD Israel Ltd., a wholly-owned subsidiary of ours, completed its merger with and into Microbot Medical Ltd., or Microbot Israel, an Israeli corporation that then owned our assets and operated our current business, with Microbot Israel surviving as a wholly-owned subsidiary of ours. We refer to this transaction as the Merger. On November 28, 2016, in connection with the Merger, we changed our name from “StemCells, Inc.” to Microbot Medical Inc., and each outstanding share of Microbot Israel capital stock was converted into the right to receive shares of our common stock. In addition, all outstanding options to purchase the ordinary shares of Microbot Israel were assumed by us and converted into options to purchase shares of the common stock of Microbot Medical Inc. On November 29, 2016, our common stock began trading on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol “MBOT”. Prior to the Merger, we were a biopharmaceutical company that operated in one segment, the research, development, and commercialization of stem cell therapeutics and related technologies. Substantially all of the material assets relating to the stem cell business were sold on November 29, 2016.
 
Technological Platforms
 
ViRob
 
The ViRob is an autonomous crawling micro-robot which can be controlled remotely or within the body. Its miniature dimensions are expected to allow it to navigate and crawl in different natural spaces within the human body, including blood vessels, the digestive tract and the respiratory system as well as artificial spaces such as shunts, catheters, ports, etc. Its unique structure is expected to give it the ability to move in tight spaces and curved passages as well as the ability to remain within the human body for prolonged time. The SCS product was developed using the ViRob technology.
 
TipCAT
 
The TipCAT is a disposable self-propelled locomotive device that is specially designed to advance in tubular anatomies. The TipCAT is a mechanism comprising a series of interconnected balloons at the device’s tip that provides the TipCAT with its forward locomotion capability. The device can self-propel within natural tubular lumens such as the blood vessels, respiratory and the urinary and GI tracts. A single channel of air/fluid supply sequentially inflates and deflates a series of balloons creating an inchworm like forward motion. The TipCAT maintains a standard working channel for treatments. Unlike standard access devices such as guidewires, catheters for vascular access and endoscopes, the TipCAT does not need to be pushed into the patient’s lumen using external pressure; rather, it will gently advance itself through the organ’s anatomy. As a result, the TipCAT is designed to be able to reach every part of the lumen under examination regardless of the topography, be less operator dependent, and greatly reduce the likelihood of damage to lumen structure. The TipCAT thus offers functionality features equivalent to modern tubular access devices, along with advantages associated with its physiologically adapted self-propelling mechanism, flexibility, and design.

One & DoneTM (CardioSert) Technology
 
On April 8, 2018, Microbot acquired a patent-protected technology from CardioSert Ltd., a privately-held medical device company based in Israel that was part of a technological incubator supported by the Israel Innovation Authorities. The CardioSert technology contemplates a combination of a guidewire and microcatheter, technologies that are broadly used for surgery within a tubular organ or structure such as a blood vessel or duct. The CardioSert technology features a unique guidewire delivery system with steering and stiffness control capabilities which when developed is expected to give the physician the ability to control the tip curvature, to adjust tip load to varying degrees of stiffness in a gradually continuous manner. The CardioSert technology was originally developed to support interventional cardiologists in crossing chronic total occlusions (CTO) during percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) procedures and has the potential to be used in other spaces and applications, such as peripheral intervention, and neurosurgery. Our CardioSert tool is now trademarked as “One & DoneTM”.
 
LIBERTY®
 
On January 13, 2020, Microbot unveiled what it believes is the world’s first fully disposable robotic system for use in endovascular interventional procedures, such as cardiovascular, peripheral and neurovascular. The LIBERTY robotic system features a unique compact design with the capability to be operated remotely, reduce radiation exposure and physical strain to the physician, reduce the risk of cross contamination, as well as the potential to eliminate the use of multiple consumables when used with its “One & Done” capabilities, which would be based in part on the CardioSert platform or possibly other guidewire/microcatheter technologies.
 
LIBERTY is designed to maneuver guidewires and over-the-wire devices (such as microcatheters) within the body’s vasculature. It eliminates the need for extensive capital equipment requiring dedicated Cath-lab rooms as well as dedicated staff. In addition, when combined with CardioSert technology or possibly other guidewire/microcatheter technologies, it is being designed to streamline Cath-lab procedures with tools that combines guidewire and microcatheter into a single device. With control over tip curvature and stiffness for maneuverability and access – and without the need for constant tool exchanges – when integrated into the LIBERTY device, the device may drastically reduce procedure time and costs while enhancing the operator experience.
 
On August 17, 2020, Microbot announced the successful conclusion of its feasibility animal study using the LIBERTY robotic system. The study met all of its end points with no intraoperative adverse events, which supports Microbot’s objectives to allow physicians to conduct a catheter-based procedure from outside the catheterization laboratory (cath-lab), avoiding radiation exposure, physical strain and the risk of cross contamination. The study was performed by two leading physicians in the neuro vascular and peripheral vascular intervention spaces, and the results demonstrated robust navigation capabilities, intuitive usability and accurate deployment of embolic agents, most of which was conducted remotely from the cath-lab’s control room.
 
On December 22, 2021, we entered into a strategic collaboration agreement for technology co-development with Stryker Corporation, acting through its Neurovascular Division. Pursuant to the agreement, the collaborative development program between Stryker and us aims to integrate certain of Stryker’s instruments with our LIBERTY Robotic System to address certain neurovascular procedures. The activities contemplated by the Agreement shall be specified in one or more development plans derived from the terms and conditions set forth in the Agreement.
 
We are continuously exploring and evaluating additional innovative guidewire/microcatheter technologies to be integrated and combined with the LIBERTY robotic platform.
 
Industry Overview
 
CSF Management
 
Hydrocephalus is a medical condition in which there is an abnormal accumulation of cerebrospinal fluid, or CSF, in the brain that can cause increased intracranial pressure. It is estimated that one in every 500 babies are born with hydrocephalus, and over 1,000,000 people in the United States currently live with hydrocephalus.
 
Symptoms of hydrocephalus vary with age, disease progression and individual tolerance to the condition, but they can include convulsion, tunnel vision, mental disability or dementia-like symptoms and even death. NPH is a type of hydrocephalus that usually occurs in older adults. NPH is generally treated as distinct from other types of hydrocephalus because it develops slowly over time. In NPH, the drainage of CSF is blocked gradually and the excess fluid builds up slowly. This slow accumulation means that the fluid pressure may not be as high as in other types of hydrocephalus. It is estimated that more than 700,000 Americans have NPH, but less than 20% receive an appropriate diagnosis.
 
Hydrocephalus is most often treated by the surgical insertion of a shunt system. The shunt system diverts the flow of CSF from the brain’s ventricles (or the lumbar subarachnoid space) to another part of the body where the fluid can be more readily absorbed. Hydrocephalus shunt designs have changed little since their introduction in the 1950s. A shunt system typically consists of three parts: the distal tubing or shunt (a flexible and sturdy plastic tube), the ventricular catheter (the proximal catheter), and a valve. The end of the shunt system with the proximal catheter is placed in the ventricles (within the CSF) and the distal catheter is placed in the site of the body where the CSF can be drained. A valve is located along the shunt to maintain and regulate the rate of CSF flow. Current systems can be created from separate components or bought as complete units.

The treatment of hydrocephalus with existing shunt systems often includes complications. For example, approximately 50% of shunts used in the pediatric population fail within two years of placement and repeated neurosurgical operations are often required. Ventricular catheter blockage, or occlusion, is by far the most frequent event that results in shunt failure. Shunt occlusion occurs when there is a partial or complete blockage of the shunt that causes it to function intermittently or not at all. Such a shunt blockage can be caused by the accumulation of blood cells, tissue, or bacteria in any part of the shunt system. In the event of shunt occlusion, CSF begins to accumulate in the brain or lumbar region again and the symptoms of untreated hydrocephalus can reappear until a shunt replacement surgery is performed.
 
Although several companies are active in the field of hydrocephalus treatment and the manufacturing of shunt systems and shunt components, Microbot believes that the majority of those companies are focusing on the development of valves. The development of a “smart shunt” – a shunt that could provide data to the physician on patient conditions and shunt function with sensor-based controls, or correct the high failure rate of existing shunt systems – is for the most part at an academic and conceptual level only. Reports of smart shunt technologies are typically focused on a subset of components with remaining factors left unspecified, such as hardware, control algorithms or power management. Microbot does not believe that a smart shunt that can prevent functional failures has been developed to date. Because of the limited innovation in this area, Microbot believes an opportunity exists to provide patients suffering from hydrocephalus or NPH with a more effective instrument for treating their condition.
 
An alternative, short-term solution to hydrocephalus is the implantation of an External Ventricular Drainage, or EVD, an implanted device used in neurosurgery for the short-term treatment and monitoring of elevated intracranial pressure when the normal flow of CSF inside the brain is obstructed. If after using an EVD, the underlying hydrocephalus does not eventually resolve, the EVD may then be replaced with a cerebral shunt, a fully internalized, long-term treatment for hydrocephalus.
 
EVDs are also used in other instances when the normal flow of CSF inside the brain is obstructed, such as a result of head trauma, intracerebral hemorrhage, brain tumors and infection. The EVD serves to divert excess fluids from the brain and allows for the monitoring of intracranial pressure. An EVD must be placed in a center with full neurosurgical capabilities because immediate neurosurgical intervention may be needed if a complication of EVD placement, such as bleeding, is encountered. EVD is one of the most commonly used and most important life-saving procedures in the neurologic ICU, with more than 200,000 neuro-intensive patients requiring EVD insertions annually.
 
Similar to shunts, EVDs are also prone to occlusion, mostly due to cellular debris, such as blood clots and/or tissue fragments. Studies have shown that approximately 1-7% of EVDs require replacement secondary to occlusion. Current solutions for EVD occlusion include irrigation and replacement, which we believe may be ineffective (in the case of irrigation) or costly (in the case of replacement) and in either case, put the patient at risk of unintended side effects. Microbot believes that with its portfolio of technologies, and its initial pre-clinical results, it is well-positioned to explore and expand its offerings as an alternative solution for EVD occlusion.
 
Minimally Invasive Robot-Assisted Endovascular Interventions
 
Minimally Invasive Surgery, or MIS, refers to surgical procedures performed through tiny incisions instead of a single large opening. Because the incisions are small, patients tend to have quicker recovery times and experience less trauma than with conventional surgery. The global MIS surgery is expected to grow from $24 billion in 2020 to $42 billion in 2026, representing a CAGR of 9.85%. MIS involves three major categories of devices: surgical, monitoring and visualization, and endoscopy. The market for surgical devices, including ablation, electrosurgery and medical robotic systems, accounts for the largest share of revenue and is also expected to show the highest rate of growth. According to the Society of Robotic Surgery, the US market growth in endoluminal robotic surgery is projected to be 15-25% by 2025.
 
Vascular disease is the most common precursor to ischemic heart disease and stroke, which are two of the leading causes of death worldwide. Advances in endovascular intervention in recent years have transformed patient survival rates and post-surgical quality of life. It is estimated that more than three million percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI) and over two million of peripheral vascular interventions are performed annually worldwide. The incidence of stroke in the US alone is estimated at 900,000 cases annually. Compared to open surgery, it has the advantages of faster recovery, reduced need for general anesthesia, reduced blood loss and significantly lower mortality. However, the current practice of endovascular procedures, which virtually has remained unchanged since the introduction of Intervention four decades ago, is limited by a number of factors, including physical strain and exposure to X-Ray radiation of the operator, and involves complex maneuvering of intervention tools, such as guidewires and catheters, to reach target areas in the vasculature. Despite recent advancements in technology and devices, manual procedures are still highly dependent on the technical skills and training of the operator, what makes the access to expert medical centers and advanced emergent treatments, such as endovascular thrombectomy for acute ischemic stroke, geographically limited. In addition, we believe that demand for physicians continues to grow faster than supply.

Endovascular robotic systems are aimed to increase the stability and precision of guidewires and catheters, protecting the physicians from ionizing radiation and physical strain by removing them from the radiation source, helping in closing shortages of skilled physicians and skill gaps and enable tele-interventions (e.g. the Hub & Spoke hospital model).
 
Today, there are only a few commercially available robotic systems for endovascular interventions. We believe these systems have major drawbacks, such as limited maneuverability, the requirement to exchange and use multiple expensive surgical tools, being cumbersome to set-up and operate, and requiring significant capital expenditures.
 
Navigating and placing access devices through tortuous and highly delicate brain arteries is a complex procedure that requires high-level surgical skills with specialist training. In many procedures, surgeons exchange numerous access devices before reaching the target and applying the therapeutic agent or device, increasing the risk of adverse events and the exposure of both patient and physician to radiation. Adverse events, such as perforation of brain arteries or the release of embolies from a thrombus or atherosclerotic lesion can have devastating or even fatal results.
 
Microbot believes that with its portfolio of CardioSert and LIBERTY technologies, it is well-positioned to explore and develop such technologies as neurovascular access devices, with a focus on improving the ease and access and enhancing the safety of endovascular interventions.
 
Our Product Pipeline
 
Self-Cleaning Shunt
 
The SCS device is designed to act as the ventricular catheter portion of a CSF shunt system that is used to treat hydrocephalus and NPH. It is designed to work as an alternative to any ventricular catheter options currently on the market and to connect to all existing shunt system valves currently on the market; therefore, the successful commercialization of the SCS is not dependent on any single shunt system. Initially, Microbot expects the SCS device to be an aftermarket purchase that would be deployed to modify existing products by the end user. Microbot believes that the use of its SCS device will be able to reduce, and potentially eliminate, shunt occlusions, and by doing so, Microbot believes its SCS has the potential to become the gold standard ventricular shunt in the treatment of hydrocephalus and NPH.
 
The SCS device embeds an internal robotic cleaning mechanism in the lumen, or inside space, of the ventricular catheter which prevents cell accumulation and tissue ingrowth into the catheter. The SCS device consists of a silicone tube with a perforated titanium tip, which connects to a standard shunt valve at its distal end. The internal cleaning mechanism is embedded in the lumen of the titanium tip. Once activated, the cleaning mechanism keeps tissue from entering the catheter perforations while maintaining the CSF flow in the ventricular catheter.
 
The internal cleaning mechanism of the SCS device is activated by means of an induced magnetic field, which is currently designed to be externally generated by the patient through a user-friendly headset that transmits the magnetic field at a pre-determined frequency and operating sequence protocol. The magnetic field that is created by the headset is then captured by a flexible coil and circuit board that is placed just under the patient’s scalp in the location where the valve is located. The circuit board assembly converts the magnetic field into the power necessary to activate the cleaning mechanism within the proximal part of the ventricular catheter.
 
Microbot has completed the development of an SCS prototype and is currently continuing the safety testing, general proof of concept testing and performance testing for the device, which Microbot began in mid-2013. In May 2018, Microbot announced the results of two pre-clinical studies assessing the SCS, an in-vitro study and a small animal study. The in-vitro study, which was performed at Wayne State University by Dr. Carolyn Harris, supports the SCS’s potential as a viable technology for preventing occlusion in shunts used to treat hydrocephalus. The first stage animal study designed to assess the safety profile of the SCS, which was performed by James Patterson McAllister, PhD, a Professor of Neurosurgery at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, met the primary goal to determine the safety of the SCS device that aims to prevent obstruction in CSF catheters. Following the completion of the first stage initial studies, Microbot commenced a follow-up study to further evaluate the safety of the SCS. The follow-up study was also conducted by leading hydrocephalus experts at Washington University. The study, included a larger sample size compared to the initial studies and the primary and secondary endpoints were to validate the safety of the activated SCS in-vivo (animal) models. In that in-vivo study the major finding was that the SCS system is as safe to use as currently marketed devices. The study also mentions, that in the animal model, contact of the shunt with the choroid plexus is impossible to avoid and that it may lead to shunt obstruction due to hemorrhage of this highly vascular structure.

In parallel with the in-vivo study, Microbot also contracted with Envigo CRS Israel, a leading provider of non-clinical contract research services, to conduct an in-vitro study designed to evaluate the operational performance of the SCS. Human brain glioblastoma cells were used in order to assess performance of the SCSTM in a test system with accelerated cell growth, accumulation and obstruction rates. In 2018, Microbot and Envigo conducted an in-vitro trial that its final conclusion was:
 
While significant cell growth and accumulation were seen in the non-operating SCS™ group after 30 days, the shunt openings remained clear in the constantly operating SCS™ group, with little to no cell attachment on the robotic cleaning mechanism (the ViRob™ system) and on the shunt openings.
 
The SCS™ was further validated in a broader follow-up in-vitro study which commenced in July 2019 and concluded on August 14, 2019 and clearly demonstrated that the SCS™ prevented shunt occlusions under the parameters of that study. This follow-up study was also conducted by Envigo CRS Israel using Human brain glioblastoma cells Specifically, the study demonstrated:
 

● | Significant cell growth and accumulation in a non-operating SCS™ as well as in a standard of care ventricular catheters (control group). 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | A significant inhibition in cell growth in daily (5-10 minutes) or weekly (up to 2 hours over the week) operating regimes of the SCS™, with little cell attachment on the ViRob mechanism. 
● | The effectiveness of the SCS™ device in preventing cells blockage as compare to standard of care surgical ventricular catheters. 

 
To further investigate the efficacy of the SCS™, Microbot conducted a follow-up in-vitro study at Wayne State University. The study included a larger sample size compared to the initial study and the primary and secondary end points aimed to validate the efficacy of the SCS in comparison to commercially available devices. After careful analysis of the results the final conclusion was that the data from this study did not reveal statistically significant differences between the study’s groups.
 
Microbot used the findings of the second stage of the animal study combined with additional experimental data that was acquired in the past year for initial regulatory FDA pre-submissions.
 
On January 27, 2021, we announced the completion of successful discussions with the FDA, for the SCSTM. After review of Microbot existing pre-clinical data, the FDA’s feedback will allow us to apply for the EFS (Early Feasibility Study) without further animal studies.
 
We expect to continue to work with the FDA towards finalizing the SCSTM design, and to incorporate their feedback prior to submitting the IDE to seek authorization to begin the EFS clinical trial. While there can be no assurance that the FDA will approve the EFS study, the agency’s recent feedback indicates that the agency will be receptive to allowing a first-in-human study to proceed based on existing data. After completing the EFS, we would then seek FDA input on the device design as finalized through the EFS process in a subsequent IDE filing for approval of a clinical study proposal. Consequently, the timeline for the submission of the IDE for First-in-Human clinical trial under the EFS is expected to commence in the first quarter of 2023.
 
In spite of the above, there is still a possibility that Microbot may conduct clinical trials if they are requested by the FDA or if Microbot decides that the data from such trials would improve the marketability of the product candidate.
 
The proposed indication for use of the SCS™ device would be for the treatment of hydrocephalus and/or NPH as a component of commercially available shunt systems. It continues to be possible that the FDA could require us to conduct a human clinical study to support the safety and efficacy of the SCS and that such clinical data would need to be part of the future regulatory submission to authorize marketing of the medical device in the U.S.
 
TipCAT
 
A TipCAT prototype was shown to self-propel and self-navigate in curved plastic pipes and curved ex-vivo colon. In addition, in its first feasibility study, the prototype device was tested in a live animal experiment and successfully self-propelled through segments of the animal’s colon, with no post-procedural damage. All tests were conducted at AMIT (Alfred Mann Institute of Technology at the Technion), prior to the licensing of TipCAT by Microbot.
 
Currently, Microbot is not pursuing the development of the TipCAT as a colonoscopy tool due to its focus on the neurosurgical and endovascular intervention spaces, and as such it is currently exploring the use of the TipCAT for minimally invasive neurosurgical and endovascular applications to complement its other technologies.

LIBERTY
 
The LIBERTY robotic system features a unique compact design with the capability to be operated remotely, reduce radiation exposure and physical strain to the physician, reduce the risk of cross contamination, as well as the potential to eliminate the use of multiple consumables when used with the One & DoneTM tool or possibly other guidewire/microcatheter technologies. LIBERTY is being designed to have the following attributes:

● | Compact size - Eliminates the need for large capital equipment in dedicated cath-lab rooms with dedicated staff. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Fully disposable - To our knowledge, the first and only fully disposable, robotic system for endovascular procedures. 
● | Streamlines Cath-lab procedures - Compatible with Microbot’s unique One & DoneTM tool or possibly other guidewire/microcatheter technologies, that combines guidewire and microcatheter into a single device. The “One & Done” tool, when integrated into the system, is expected to provide full control over tip curvature and stiffness for maneuverability and access without the need for constant tool exchanges, while enhancing the operator experience. 
● | State of the art maneuverability - Provides linear, rotational and tip control of its One & DoneTM tool when integrated into the system, as well as linear motion for an additional “over the wire” device. 
● | Compatibility with a wide range of commercially-available guidewires, microcatheters and guide-catheters. 
● | Enhanced operator safety and comfort - Reduces exposure to ionizing radiation and the need for heavy lead vests otherwise to be worn during procedures, as well as reducing the exposure to Hospital Acquired Infections (HAI). 
● | Ease of use - LIBERTY’s intuitive remote controls simplify advanced procedures while shortening the physician’s learning curve. 
● | Telemedicine compatible - Capable of tele-catheterization, carried out remotely by highly trained specialists. 

 
We are continuing our feasibility animal trials with respect to the LIBERTY device, with a planned pre-submission to the FDA as early as the first quarter of 2022, and planned submission to the FDA in the first half of 2023.
 
Strategy
 
Microbot’s goal is to generate sales of its products, once they have received regulatory approval, by establishing SCS, LIBERTY and additional devices from its technological platforms, as the standard-of-care in the eyes of doctors, surgeons, patients and medical facilities, as well as getting the support of payors and insurance companies. Microbot believes that it can achieve this objective by working with hospitals to demonstrate the key benefits of its products. Microbot’s strategy includes the following key elements:

● | Continue to refine existing product candidates and develop additional micro-robotic solutions. As Microbot prepares to bring its initial product candidates through pre-clinical and clinical trials, if necessary, and eventually to market, it continues to focus on improving its product candidates to respond to clinical data and patient and physician feedback. Microbot also expects to continue to innovate in the micro-robotics field by continuing to find ways of using its technology to solve unmet needs, with the overarching goal of providing a safer, more effective and more efficient surgical environment for patients and physicians. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Establish and leverage relationships with key institutions and leading clinicians. Microbot’s objective will be to maintain clinical focus with leading hospitals and clinics so as to establish the SCS, LIBERTY, as well as other future products, as the standard of care in such institutions for their respective procedures. Microbot also expects to identify key clinicians with the relevant specialties (for instance, neurosurgery or interventional radiology) with the expectation that such clinical focus will accelerate the adoption of its candidate products. 
● | Continuously invest in research and development. Microbot’s most significant expense has historically been research and development, and Microbot expects that this will continue in the foreseeable future, including expenses it expects to incur to improve on its prototype products in order to respond to clinical data, to develop additional applications using its technologies and to develop future product candidates. 
● | Explore partnerships for the introduction of Microbot’s products. Microbot intends to focus its marketing and sales efforts initially on pursuing collaborations with global medical device companies that have established sales and distribution networks. Microbot will seek to enter collaborations and partnerships with strategic players that offer synergies with Microbot’s product candidates and expertise. 
● | Seek additional IP and technologies to complement and strengthen Microbot’s current IP portfolio. Microbot intends to continue exploring new technologies, IP and know-how to add to its current portfolio through licensing, mergers and/or acquisitions and to allow Microbot to enter new spaces and strengthen its overall product portfolio.

SCS Opportunities
 
The SCS is designed to prevent shunt occlusions in hydrocephalus and NPH patients who have undergone or are undergoing the surgical insertion of a shunt system. For purposes of its marketing strategy, Microbot has split the market for shunt systems into two sub-markets:
 

● | Primary shunt placement; and 
--+---------------------------------
● | Shunt replacement. 

 
Microbot’s SCS device is universal (meaning that it is designed to be attachable to any valve on the market); therefore, Microbot’s initial go-to-market strategy is the development of strategic partnerships with leading global medical device companies with ready sales and distribution channels. Outside of a strategic partnership, it is most likely that Microbot’s SCS product will be initially used in shunt replacement surgeries to replace occluded ventricular catheters. Accordingly, Microbot intends to establish key hospital and clinic relationships that will allow it to diffuse the technology among experts and other stakeholders. Microbot is also planning to apply for the SCS device to be covered under the current reimbursement codes in the United States for use in hydrocephalus and NPH shunt procedures.
 
TipCAT Opportunities
 
Microbot is currently exploring the use of the TipCAT for minimally invasive neurological and endovascular applications.
 
One & DoneTM (CardioSert) Opportunities
 
Microbot is currently exploring the integration of the One & DoneTM technology into the LIBERTY endovascular robotic system for a range of potential applications in the cardiovascular, peripheral vascular and neurovascular spaces.
 
LIBERTY Opportunities
 
The LIBERTY endovascular robotic system is being designed to remotely maneuver guidewires, microcatheters and over-the-wire devices within the body’s vasculature. The device is being designed to be the size of a hand-held personal device and to be fully disposable and affordable. We are aiming LIBERTY to be capable of supporting whole-endovascular procedures by providing solutions which would be based in part on the One & DoneTM proprietary technology or possibly other guidewire/microcatheter technologies. With control over tip curvature and stiffness for maneuverability and access – and without the need for constant tool exchanges – the One & DoneTM tool, when integrated into the system, is expected to drastically reduce the procedure time and costs, while enhancing the operator experience. We believe LIBERTY’s addressable markets are the Interventional Cardiology, Interventional Radiology and Interventional Neuroradiology markets.
 
The unique characteristics of LIBERTY – compact, mobile, disposable and remotely controlled - open the opportunity of expanding telerobotic interventions to patients with limited access to life-saving procedures, such as mechanical thrombectomy in ischemic stroke.
 
Competition
 
SCS Competitive Landscape
 
Several academic research groups, such as at the New Jersey Institute of Technology, are currently researching sensing and obstruction-resistant catheter designs, and the Smart Sensors and Integrated Microsystems (SSIM) Program at Wayne State University has publicized that it is engaging in smart shunt development activity. However, based in part on its knowledge of the patented technologies, Microbot believes that these technologies are still early in the research and development cycle. Although we believe the SCS may face direct competition from Anuncia Inc., a spin-off of Alycone Lifesciences Inc., which received a CE Mark and FDA 510k clearance for the Alivio ReFlow™ Ventricular System for the treatment of hydrocephalus, the commercialization status of the device is not clear. The SCS also faces non-direct competition from Aqueduct Neurosciences, Inc., which we believe is developing a non-shunt, electro-mechanical technology platform to control the draining of cerebrospinal fluid, and from Cerevasc Inc., which is developing the eShuntTM System that aims to eliminate the need for passing a rigid catheter through cerebral cortex and subcortical white matter.
 
Microbot does not expect its SCS device to directly compete against shunt systems currently available in the market. The SCS device is designed to replace a component of existing shunt systems and is expected to be an aftermarket purchase that would be used to modify existing products by the end user. However, there can be no assurance that Microbot’s product candidate will be accepted by the shunt market as an alternative component.

TipCAT Competitive Landscape
 
Microbot has not at this time completed its evaluation of the current competitive landscape in the endovascular space for potential uses of the TipCAT.
 
One & DoneTM (CardioSert) Competitive Landscape
 
Competition includes moveable-core guidewires from companies such as Boston Scientific and Rapid Medical, and steerable and deflectable sheaths and catheters from companies such as Bendit Technologies, Agile Devices and Merit Medical. To our knowledge, the CardioSert device is the only device that combines an inner moveable guidewire and an outer microcatheter, with the ability to control the shape and stiffness of the distal tip in a continuous, gradual manner, and intends to compete on that basis.
LIBERTY Competitive Landscape
 
We believe the main competitor to the LIBERTY system is the CorPath GRX vascular robotics system by Corindus Vascular Robotics, a Siemens Healthineers company. The CorPath GRX system has FDA approvals for percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI) and peripheral vascular interventions (PVI) and is pending an approval for neurovascular interventions. Other competitors include Robocath (CE Marked for PCI only) and Hansen Medical (a J&J Company with FDA approval for PVI). We believe these systems have drawbacks, such as limited maneuverability, the requirement to exchange and use multiple expensive surgical tools, being cumbersome to set-up and operate, and requiring significant capital expenditures. We further believe that these systems have captured a marginal market share to date.
 
Microbot’s existing and planned products could also be rendered obsolete or uneconomical by technological advances developed in the future by existing or new competitors. Some of Microbot’s competitors currently have significantly greater resources than Microbot does; have established relationships with healthcare professionals, customers and third-party payors; and have long-term contracts with group purchasing organizations in the United States. In addition, many of Microbot’s competitors have established distributor networks, greater resources for product development, sales and marketing, additional lines of products and the ability to offer financial incentives such as rebates, bundled products or discounts on other product lines that Microbot cannot provide.
 
Intellectual Property
 
General
 
The SCS and TipCAT are based on technological platforms licensed from The Technion Research and Development Foundation Ltd., or TRDF, as further discussed below. The LIBERTY platform core technology is co-owned by Microbot and TRDF. The One & DoneTM device is based on technologies acquired by Microbot from CardioSert. Microbot plans to develop other medical-robotic solutions through internal research and development, to strengthen its intellectual property position, and to continue exploring strategic collaborations and accretive acquisition opportunities. Microbot currently holds an intellectual property portfolio of 47 patents issued/allowed and 29 patent applications pending worldwide. It also has registered trademarks in Israel, Europe and the US relating to its LIBERTY platform, and also has trademarks relating to its proprietary Microbot Medical tradename and logo registered in Israel, Europe, and the UK, and pending in the US and China, in addition to having registered trademarks for the “One & Done” name in Israel, allowed in Europe and pending in the US, UK, China, and Japan.
 
Microbot relies or intends to rely on intellectual property licensed or developed, including patents, trade secrets, trademarks, technical innovations, laws of unfair competition and various licensing agreements, to provide its future growth, to build its competitive position and to protect its technology. As Microbot continues to expand its intellectual property portfolio, it is critical for Microbot to continue to invest in filing patent applications to protect its technology, inventions, and improvements.
 
Microbot requires its employees and consultants to execute confidentiality agreements in connection with their employment or consulting relationships with Microbot. Microbot also requires its employees and consultants who work on its product candidates to agree to disclose and assign to Microbot all inventions conceived during the term of their service, while using Microbot property, or which relate to Microbot’s business.

Patent applications in the United States and in foreign countries are maintained in secrecy for a period of time after filing, which results in a delay between the filing date of the patent applications and the time when they are published. Patents issued and patent applications filed relating to medical devices are numerous, and there can be no assurance that current and potential competitors and other third parties have not filed or in the future will not file applications for, or have not received or in the future will not receive, patents or obtain additional proprietary rights relating to product candidates, products, devices or processes used or proposed to be used by Microbot. Microbot believes that the technologies it employs in its products and systems do not infringe the valid claims of any third-party patents. There can be no assurance, however, that third parties will not seek to assert that Microbot devices and systems infringe their patents or seek to expand their patent claims to cover aspects of Microbot’s products and systems.
 
The medical device industry in general has been characterized by substantial litigation regarding patents and other intellectual property rights. Any such claims, regardless of their merit, could be time-consuming and expensive to respond to and could divert Microbot’s technical and management personnel. Microbot may be involved in litigation to defend against claims of infringement by other patent holders, to enforce patents issued to Microbot, or to protect Microbot’s trade secrets. If any relevant claims of third-party patents are upheld as valid and enforceable in any litigation or administrative proceeding, Microbot could be prevented from practicing the subject matter claimed in such patents, or would be required to obtain licenses from the patent owners of each such patent, or to redesign Microbot’s products, devices or processes to avoid infringement. There can be no assurance that such licenses would be available or, if available, would be available on terms acceptable to Microbot or that Microbot would be successful in any attempt to redesign products or processes to avoid infringement. Accordingly, an adverse determination in a judicial or administrative proceeding or failure to obtain necessary licenses, could potentially prevent Microbot from manufacturing and selling its products.
 
Microbot’s issued U.S. patents, which cover Microbot’s product candidates, will expire between 2026 and 2040, not including any patent term adjustments that may be available. Issued patents outside of the United States directed to Microbot’s product candidates will expire between 2026 and 2036.
 
License Agreement with the Technion
 
In June 2012, Microbot entered into a license agreement with TRDF, the technology transfer subsidiary of The Technion Institute of Technology, pursuant to which it obtained an exclusive, worldwide, royalty-bearing, sub-licensable license to certain patents and inventions relating to the SCS and TipCAT technology platforms invented by Professor Moshe Shoham, a former director of and an advisor to the Company, and in certain circumstances other TRDF-related persons. Pursuant to the terms of the license agreement, in order to maintain the license with respect to each platform, Microbot must use commercially reasonable efforts to develop products covered by the license, including meeting certain agreed upon development milestones. The milestones for both SCS and TipCAT include commencing first in human clinical trials by December 2021. Failure to meet any development milestone will give TRDF the right to terminate the license with respect to the technology underlying the missed milestone.
 
As partial consideration for the grant of the licenses under the agreement, Microbot issued a number of shares to TRDF equal to 3% of its issued and outstanding shares at such time on a fully diluted basis. Such shares were initially subject to antidilution protections but are no longer subject to adjustment. In addition, as partial consideration for the licenses granted, Microbot agreed to pay TRDF royalties of between 1.5% and 3.0% of net sales of products covered by the licenses, subject to certain reductions, and certain percentages of amounts received by Microbot in the event of sublicensing.
 
In the case of termination of the license by Microbot without cause or by TRDF for cause, TRDF has the right to receive a non-exclusive license from Microbot with respect to improvements to the licensed technologies made by Microbot. In such cases, TRDF would pay a royalty of 10% of the income received by TRDF in connection its sublicensing of such patent right and related intellectual property. If the license from TRDF were to be terminated with respect with either of the technology platforms underlying the SCS or the TipCAT, Microbot would no longer be able to continue its development of the related product candidate. However, Microbot believes that its current intellectual property portfolio, and its ongoing efforts to expand into other micro-robotic surgical technologies, will give it the flexibility to shift its resources towards developing and commercializing related products.
 
In addition to the licensed SCS and TipCAT technologies, the LIBERTY platform, which was invented by employees of Microbot together with Professor Moshe Shoham of the Technion, in his capacity as a consultant to Microbot, is co-owned by Microbot and TRDF, and a process is being conducted for establishing the LIBERTY platform as a “Joint Invention” in accordance with the terms of the License Agreement. Once the Joint Invention is established, Microbot will have to pay TRDF royalties of between 1.5% and 3.0% of net sales of products covered by this Joint Invention.
 
Research and Development
 
Microbot’s research and development programs are generally pursued by engineers and scientists employed by Microbot in its offices in Israel on a full-time basis or as consultants, or through partnerships with industry leaders in manufacturing and design and researchers in academia. Microbot is also working with subcontractors in developing specific components of its technologies.
 
The primary objectives of Microbot’s research and development efforts are to continue to introduce incremental enhancements to the capabilities of its candidate products and to advance the development of proposed products.

Microbot has obtained grants from the Israeli Innovation Authority (“IIA”) for participation in research and development activities since 2013 through 2021. During this time, Microbot has received grant revenues of approximately $1,500,000. In return, Microbot is obligated to pay royalties amounting to 3%-3.5% of its future sales up to the amount of the grant. The grant is linked to the exchange rate of the dollar to the New Israeli Shekel and bears interest of USD LIBOR per annum.
 
Under the terms of the grants and applicable law, Microbot is restricted from transferring any technologies, know-how, manufacturing or manufacturing rights developed using the grant outside of Israel without the prior approval of the Israel Innovation Authority. Microbot has no obligation to repay the grant, if the SCS project fails, is unsuccessful or aborted before any sales are generated. The financial risk is assumed completely by the IIA.
 
Microbot expects to continue to access government funding in the future.
 
For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, Microbot incurred research and development expenses of approximately $6,153,000 compared to approximately $3,396,000.
 
SCS
 
Microbot has already made plans to develop a second version of its SCS device that will have an embedded controller and battery, initially to support its animal trials. This alternative design will allow the cleaning mechanism to be automatically activated, without the need for the patient’s involvement in the activation process.
 
Microbot has completed the development of an SCS prototype and is currently continuing the safety testing, general proof of concept testing and performance testing for the device, which Microbot began in mid-2013. In May 2018, Microbot previously announced the results of two pre-clinical studies assessing the SCS, an in-vitro study and a small animal study. The in-vitro study, which was performed at Wayne State University, supports the SCS’s potential as a viable technology for preventing occlusion in shunts used to treat hydrocephalus. The animal study designed to assess the safety profile of the SCS, which was performed at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, met the primary goal to determine the safety of the SCS device that aims to prevent obstruction in CSF catheters. Since the completion of these initial studies, Microbot conducted a follow-up study to further evaluate the safety of the SCS. The follow-up study was also conducted by leading hydrocephalus experts at Washington University and Wayne State University. The study included a larger sample size compared to the initial studies and the primary and secondary endpoints seek to validate the safety and efficacy of the SCS that will be activated in both in-vitro (lab) and in-vivo (animal) models. In that in-vivo study, the major finding was that the SCS system is as safe to use as currently marketed devices.
 
In conjunction with conducting the follow-up study, Microbot also contracted with Envigo CRS Israel, to conduct an in-vitro study designed to evaluate the operational performance of the SCS. The first Envigo study that was conducted in 2018 used human brain glioblastoma cells to assess the performance of the SCS in a test system with accelerated cell growth, accumulation, and obstruction rates. The performance of a constantly activated (always-on) SCS to prevent shunt occlusion in the laboratory study was compared with a non-operating SCS after 30 days, and the results were captured with photographs shared by Microbot in a press release issued on January 14, 2019. While significant cell growth and accumulation was seen in the cell cultures with a non-operating SCS, the shunt openings within the cells seeded with a constantly operating SCS remained clear, with little to no cell attachment on the robotic brush (ViRob) and on the opening where the robotic brush (ViRob) operates after 30 days of cell culturing and growth. We believe this experiment validates the operational effectiveness of the SCS to prevent shunt occlusion and provides additional data to support the device’s proof of concept. We believe the in-vitro laboratory study further confirms that the SCS has the ability to operate after cells have accumulated on the catheter holes and the robotic brush (ViRob) and to potentially disintegrate existing occlusions formed on the robotic brush (ViRob) and on the opening where the robotic brush (ViRob) operates, based on the results from a third test group in which cells were allowed to grow for four weeks and then exposed to an activated SCS device. We believe the images captured by Envigo and Microbot demonstrate that the cleaning mechanism of the SCS is powerful enough to clear accumulated cells at blocked pores, as significant improvements were observed in the degree of shunt obstruction after only a short period of time following activation of the SCS.
 
The SCS was further validated in a broader follow-up in-vitro lab study which commenced in July 2019 and concluded on August 14, 2019 and clearly demonstrated the device prevented shunt occlusion under the parameters of that study. This follow-up study was also conducted by Envigo CRS Israel. Human brain glioblastoma cells were used in order to assess performance of the SCS in a test system with accelerated cell growth rate, accumulation and obstruction rates. Specifically, the study demonstrated:
 

● | Significant cell growth and accumulation in a non-operating SCS as well as a standard of care surgical shunt. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | A significant inhibition in cell growth in daily (5-10 minutes) or weekly (up to 2 hours over the week) operating SCS with little cell attachment on the robotic brush (ViRob) and on the opening where the robotic brush (ViRob) operates. 
● | The effectiveness of the Company’s SCS devices in preventing cells blockage as compare to standard of care surgical shunts.

The follow-up in vitro (lab) study at Wayne State University included a larger sample size compared to the initial study and the primary and secondary end points seek to validate the efficacy of the SCS while being activated in-vitro (lab). Generally, the data from this study did not reveal statistically significant trends indicating a strong preference for any of the designs tested, including the SCS; therefore, these tests as they stand are inconclusive but have provided us with trends which Microbot may decide to further explore.
 
After submitting the existing data to the FDA, on January 27, 2021 we announced the completion of successful discussions with the FDA, for the SCSTM. After review of our existing pre-clinical data, the FDA’s feedback will allow us to apply for the EFS. We expect to continue to work with the FDA towards finalizing the SCSTM design, and to incorporate their feedback prior to submitting the IDE to seek authorization to begin the EFS clinical trial. While there can be no assurance that the FDA will approve the EFS study, the agency’s recent feedback indicates that the agency will be receptive to allowing a first-in-human study to proceed based on existing data. After completing the EFS, we would then seek FDA input on the device design as finalized through the EFS process in a subsequent IDE filing for approval of a clinical study proposal. Consequently, the timeline for the submission of the IDE for First-in-Human clinical trial under the EFS is expected to commence in the first quarter of 2023.
 
Although the FDA agreed that the SCS is suitable to apply for an EFS program, we can give no assurance that the FDA will agree that an EFS is warranted, in which case we will have to re-commence animal trials or otherwise re-evaluate the FDA approval process, which could delay and hinder our ability to commercialize the SCS device.
 
LIBERTY
 
The LIBERTY prototype system was tested at our laboratories in an in-vitro silicone model, using off-the-shelf guidewires and microcatheters, and showing an ability to successfully provide linear and rotational movements of the guidewires and linear motion of the microcatheters. We also conducted a single preliminary animal trial with the LIBERTY prototype.
 
The LIBERTY prototype is designed to control the One & DoneTM tool; however, the One & DoneTM tool is not currently expected to be integrated into the next version of the LIBERTY device. Additionally, we are exploring and evaluating additional innovative guidewire/microcatheter technologies to be integrated and combined with the LIBERTY robotic platform to further enhance the performance of the system.
 
Since the One & DoneTM tool was originally designed for chronic total occlusion, we are currently working with subcontractors and guidewire design-houses to perfect the performance of the One & DoneTM tool to the indication that will be selected for the LIBERTY platform. These may include procedures in the peripheral, coronary or neurovascular spaces.
 
Manufacturing
 
Microbot does not have any manufacturing facilities or manufacturing personnel. Microbot currently relies, and expects to continue to rely, on third parties for the manufacturing of its product candidates for preclinical and clinical testing, as well as for commercial manufacturing if its product candidates receive marketing approval.
Commercialization
 
Microbot has not yet established a sales, marketing or product distribution infrastructure for its product candidates, which are still in development stages. Microbot plans to access the U.S. markets with its initial device offerings through strategic partnerships but may develop its own focused, specialized sales force or distribution channels once it has several commercialized products in its portfolio. Microbot has not yet developed a commercial strategy outside of the United States.
Government Regulation
 
General
 
Microbot’s medical technology products and operations are subject to extensive regulation in the United States and other countries. Most notably, if Microbot seeks to sell its products in the United States, its products will be subject to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA) as implemented and enforced by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The FDA regulates the development, bench and clinical testing, manufacturing, labeling, storage, record-keeping, promotion, marketing, sales, distribution and post-market support and reporting of medical devices in the United States to ensure that medical products distributed domestically are safe and effective for their intended uses. Regulatory policy affecting its products can change at any time.

-13-
----


Advertising and promotion of medical devices in the United States, in addition to being regulated by the FDA, are also regulated by the Federal Trade Commission and by state regulatory and enforcement authorities. Recently, promotional activities for FDA-regulated products of other companies have been the subject of enforcement action brought under healthcare reimbursement laws and consumer protection statutes. In addition, under the federal Lanham Act and similar state laws, competitors and others can initiate litigation relating to advertising claims.
 
Foreign countries where Microbot wishes to sell its products may require similar or more onerous approvals to manufacture or market its products. Government agencies in those countries also enforce laws and regulations that govern the development, testing, manufacturing, labeling, advertising, marketing and distribution, and market surveillance of medical device products. These regulatory requirements can change rapidly with relatively short notice.
 
Other regulations Microbot encounters in the United States and in other jurisdictions are the regulations that are common to all businesses, such as employment legislation, implied warranty laws, and environmental, health and safety standards, to the extent applicable. In the future, Microbot will also encounter industry-specific government regulations that would govern its products, if and when they are developed for commercial use.
 
U.S. Regulation
 
The FDA governs the following activities that Microbot performs, will perform, upon the clearance or approval of its product candidates, or that are performed on its behalf, to ensure that medical products distributed domestically or exported internationally are safe and effective for their intended uses:
 

● | product design, and development; 
--+---------------------------------------------------
● | product safety, testing, labeling and storage; 
● | record keeping procedures; and 
● | product marketing. 

 
There are numerous FDA regulatory requirements governing the approval or clearance and subsequent commercial marketing of Microbot’s products. These include:
 

● | the timely submission of product listing and establishment registration information, along with associated establishment user fees; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | continued compliance with the Quality System Regulation, or QSR, which require specification developers and manufacturers, including third-party manufacturers, to follow stringent design, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures during all aspects of the manufacturing process; 
● | labeling regulations and FDA prohibitions against the promotion of products for uncleared, unapproved or off-label use or indication; 
● | clearance or approval of product modifications that could significantly affect the safety or effectiveness of the device or that would constitute a major change in intended use; 
● | Medical Device Reporting regulations (MDR), which require that manufacturers keep detailed records of investigations or complaints against their devices and to report to the FDA if their device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if it were to recur; 
● | adequate use of the Corrective and Preventive Actions process to identify and correct or prevent significant systemic failures of products or processes or in trends which suggest same; 
● | post-approval restrictions or conditions, including post-approval study commitments; 
● | post-market surveillance regulations, which apply when necessary to protect the public health or to provide additional safety and effectiveness data for the device; and 
● | notices of correction or removal and recall regulations.

Unless an exemption applies, before Microbot can commercially distribute medical devices in the United States, Microbot must obtain, depending on the classification of the device, either prior 510(k) clearance, 510(k) de-novo clearance or premarket approval (PMA), from the FDA. The FDA classifies medical devices into one of three classes based on the degree of risk associated with each medical device and the extent of regulatory controls needed to ensure the device’s safety and effectiveness:
 

● | Class I devices, which are low risk and subject to only general controls (e.g., registration and listing, medical device labeling compliance, MDRs, Quality System Regulations, and prohibitions against adulteration and misbranding) and, in some cases, to the 510(k) premarket clearance requirements; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Class II devices, which are moderate risk and generally require 510(k) or 510(k) de-novo premarket clearance before they may be commercially marketed in the United States as well as general controls and potentially special controls like performance standards or specific labeling requirements; and 
● | Class III devices, which are devices deemed by the FDA to pose the greatest risk, such as life-sustaining, life-supporting or implantable devices, or devices deemed not substantially equivalent to a predicate device. Class III devices generally require the submission and approval of a PMA supported by clinical trial data. 

 
Microbot expects the medical products in its pipeline currently to be classified as Class II. Class II devices are those for which general controls alone are insufficient to provide reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness and there is sufficient information to establish special controls. Special controls can include performance standards, post-market surveillance, patient histories and FDA guidance documents. Premarket review and clearance by the FDA for these devices is generally accomplished through the 510(k) or 510(k) de-novo premarket notification process. As part of the 510(k) or 510(k) de-novo notification process, FDA may require the following:
 

● | Development of comprehensive product description and indications for use; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Comprehensive review of predicate devices and development of data supporting the new product’s substantial equivalence to one or more predicate devices; and 
● | If appropriate and required, certain types of clinical trials (IDE submission and approval may be required for conducting a clinical trial in the US). 

 
When clinical evidence is necessary because non-clinical or animal testing is unavailable or inadequate to provide the information needed to advance device development, an Early Feasibility Study (EFS) for a limited clinical investigation of the device may be applicable and which we are evaluating with respect to the SCS device. If the FDA agrees to the EFS approach in general, we will work to finalize the design of the device, to resolve any questions from the FDA, and to incorporate the FDA’s feedback prior to submitting the IDE to seek authorization to begin the EFS clinical trial. After completing the EFS study, we will then seek FDA input on the device design as finalized through the EFS process in a subsequent IDE filing for approval of a pivotal clinical study proposal.
 
Clinical trials involve use of the medical device on human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with current Good Clinical Practices (GCPs), including the requirement that all research subjects provide informed consent for their participation in the clinical study. A written protocol with predefined end points, an appropriate sample size and pre-determined patient inclusion and exclusion criteria, is required before initiating and conducting a clinical trial. All clinical investigations of devices to determine safety and effectiveness must be conducted in accordance with the FDA’s Investigational device Exemption, or IDE, regulations that among other things, govern investigational device labeling, prohibit promotion of the investigational device, and specify recordkeeping, reporting and monitoring responsibilities of study sponsors and study investigators. If the device presents a “significant risk,” as defined by the FDA, the agency requires the device sponsor to submit an IDE application, which must become effective prior to commencing human clinical trials. The IDE will automatically become effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA denies the application or notifies the company that the investigation is on hold and may not begin. If the FDA determines that there are deficiencies or other concerns with an IDE that requires modification, the FDA may permit a clinical trial to proceed under a conditional approval. In addition, the study must be approved by, and conducted under the oversight of, an Institutional Review Board (IRB) for each clinical site. If the device presents a non-significant risk to the patient, a sponsor may begin the clinical trial after obtaining approval for the trial by one or more IRBs without separate approval from the FDA, but it must still follow abbreviated IDE requirements, such as monitoring the investigation, ensuring that the investigators obtain informed consent, and labeling and record-keeping requirements. 510(k) clearance typically involves the following:
 

● | Assuming successful completion of all required testing, a detailed 510(k) premarket notification or 510(k) de-novo is submitted to the FDA requesting clearance to market the product. The notification includes all relevant data from pertinent preclinical and clinical trials, together with detailed information relating to the product’s manufacturing controls and proposed labeling, and other relevant documentation. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


-15-
----


● | A 510(k) clearance letter from the FDA will authorize commercial marketing of the device for one or more specific indications for use. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | After 510(k) clearance, Microbot will be required to comply with a number of post-clearance requirements, including, but not limited to, Medical Device Reporting and complaint handling, and, if applicable, reporting of corrective actions. Also, quality control and manufacturing procedures must continue to conform to QSRs. The FDA periodically inspects manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with QSRs, which impose extensive procedural, substantive, and record keeping requirements on medical device manufacturers. In addition, changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated, and, depending on the change, validation activities may need to be performed. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain compliance with QSRs and other types of regulatory controls. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | After a device receives 510(k) clearance from the FDA, any modification that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a major change in its intended use or technological characteristics, requires a new 510(k) clearance or could require a PMA. The FDA requires each manufacturer to make the determination of whether a modification requires a new 510(k) notification or PMA in the first instance, but the FDA can review any such decision. If the FDA disagrees with a manufacturer’s decision not to seek a new 510(k) clearance or PMA for a particular change, the FDA may retroactively require the manufacturer to seek 510(k) clearance or PMA. The FDA can also require the manufacturer to cease U.S. marketing and/or recall the modified device until additional 510(k) clearance or PMA approval is obtained. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The FDA and the Federal Trade Commission, or FTC, will also regulate the advertising claims of Microbot’s products to ensure that the claims Microbot makes are consistent with its regulatory clearances, that there is scientific data to substantiate the claims and that product advertising is neither false nor misleading. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
To obtain 510(k) clearance, Microbot must submit a notification to the FDA demonstrating that its proposed device is substantially equivalent to a predicate device (i.e., a device that was in commercial distribution before May 28, 1976, a device that has been reclassified from Class III to Class I or Class II, or a 510(k)-cleared device). The FDA’s 510(k) clearance process generally takes from three to 12 months from the date the application is submitted but also can take significantly longer. If the FDA determines that the device or its intended use is not substantially equivalent to a predicate device, the device is automatically placed into Class III, requiring the submission of a PMA.
 
There is no guarantee that the FDA will grant Microbot 510(k) clearance for its pipeline medical device products, and failure to obtain the necessary clearances for its products would adversely affect Microbot’s ability to grow its business. Delays in receipt or failure to receive the necessary clearances, or the failure to comply with existing or future regulatory requirements, could reduce its business prospects.
 
Devices that cannot be cleared through the 510(k) process due to lack of a predicate device but would be considered low or moderate risk may be eligible for the 510(k) de-novo process. In 1997, the Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act, or FDAMA added the de novo classification pathway now codified in section 513(f)(2) of the FD&C Act. This law established an alternate pathway to classify new devices into Class I or II that had automatically been placed in Class III after receiving a Not Substantially Equivalent, or NSE, determination in response to a 510(k) submission. Through this regulatory process, a sponsor who receives an NSE determination may, within 30 days of receipt, request FDA to make a risk-based classification of the device through what is called a “de novo request.” In 2012, section 513(f)(2) of the FD&C Act was amended by section 607 of the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act (FDASIA), in order to provide a second option for de novo classification. Under this second pathway, a sponsor who determines that there is no legally marketed device upon which to base a determination of substantial equivalence can submit a de novo request to FDA without first submitting a 510(k).
 
In the event that Microbot receives a Not Substantially Equivalent determination for either of its device candidates in response to a 510(k) submission, the Microbot device may still be eligible for the 510(k) de-novo classification process.
 
Devices that cannot be cleared through the 510(k) or 510(k) de-novo classification process require the submission of a PMA. The PMA process is much more time consuming and demanding than the 510(k) notification process. A PMA must be supported by extensive data, including but not limited to data obtained from preclinical and/or clinical studies and data relating to manufacturing and labeling, to demonstrate to the FDA’s satisfaction the safety and effectiveness of the device. After a PMA application is submitted, the FDA’s in-depth review of the information generally takes between one and three years and may take significantly longer. If the FDA does not grant 510(k) clearance to its products, there is no guarantee that Microbot will submit a PMA or that if Microbot does, that the FDA would grant a PMA approval of Microbot’s products, either of which would adversely affect Microbot’s business.
 
Microbot is currently evaluating whether it is appropriate for it to seek 510(k) clearance, given the technological features of the SCS device and the FDA’s recent announcements about enhancing the 510(k) process to further ensure safety and efficacy. However, the Company believes that given the similarities between the SCS and some cleared predicate devices, there is a reasonable likelihood that a de novo application might be acceptable to the FDA.

Foreign Regulation
 
In addition to regulations in the United States, Microbot will be subject to a variety of foreign regulations governing clinical trials, marketing authorization and commercial sales and distribution of its products in foreign countries. The approval process varies from country to country, and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval or clearance. The requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary greatly from country to country.
 
International sales of medical devices are subject to foreign governmental regulations which vary substantially from country to country. Whether or not Microbot obtains FDA approval or clearance for its products, Microbot will be required to make new regulatory submissions to the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries before Microbot can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in such countries. The time required to obtain certification or approval by a foreign country may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA clearance or approval, and the requirements may differ. Below are summaries of the regulatory systems for medical devices in Europe and Israel, where Microbot currently anticipates marketing its products. However, its products may also be marketed in other countries that have different systems or minimal requirements for medical devices.
 
Europe. The primary regulatory body in Europe is the European Union, or E.U., which consists of 27 member states and has a coordinated system for the authorization of medical devices.
 
The E.U. has adopted legislation, in the form of directives to be implemented in each member state, concerning the regulation of medical devices within the European Union. The directives include, among others, the Medical Device Regulation, or MDR, that establishes certain requirements with which medical devices must comply before they can be commercialized in the European Economic Area, or EEA (which comprises the member states of the E.U. plus Norway, Liechtenstein and Iceland). Under the MDR, medical devices are classified into four Classes, I, IIa, IIb, and III, with Class I being the lowest risk and Class III being the highest risk.
 
In order to commercialize medical devices in the European Union, a CE Mark certificate is needed. This certification verifies that a device meets all regulatory requirements for medical devices, which will soon change under the new Medical Devices Regulation (MDR 2017/745). The CE approval process in Europe is summarized below:
 

1. | To obtain CE Marking certification, comply with European Commission Regulation (EU) No. 2017/745, commonly known as the Medical Device Regulation (MDR). 
----+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. | Appoint a Person Responsible for regulatory compliance. Determine classification of device - Class I (self-certified); Class I (sterile, measuring or reusable surgical instrument); Class IIa, Class IIb, or Class III. 
3. | For all devices except Class I (self-certified), implement a Quality Management System (QMS) in accordance with the MDR. Companies usually apply the EN ISO 13485 standard to achieve compliance. The QMS must include Clinical Evaluation, Post-Market Surveillance (PMS) and Post Market Clinical Follow-up (PMCF) plans. Make arrangements with suppliers about unannounced Notified Body audits. For Class I (self-certified), implement a QMS though Notified Body intervention is not required. 
4. | Prepare a CE Technical File or Design Dossier (Class III) providing information about the device and its intended use plus testing reports, Clinical Evaluation Report (CER), risk management file, Instruction For Use (IFU), labeling and more. Obtain a Unique Device Identifier (UDI) for the device. All devices, even legacy products in use for decades, will require clinical data. Most of these data should refer to the subject device. Clinical studies are generally required for implantable and Class III devices. Existing clinical data may be acceptable. Clinical trials in Europe must be pre-approved by a European Competent Authority. 
5. | If the company does not have a location in Europe, appoint an Authorized Representative (EC REP) located in the EU who is qualified to handle regulatory issues. Place the EC REP name and address on device label. Obtain a Single Registration Number from the regulators. 
6. | For all devices except Class I (self-certified), the QMS and Technical File or Design Dossier must be audited by a Notified Body, a third party accredited by European authorities to audit medical device companies and products. 
7. | For all devices except Class I (self-certified), the company will be issued a European CE Marking Certificate for the device and an ISO 13485 certificate for the company’s facility following successful completion of the Notified Body audit. ISO 13485 certification must be renewed every year. CE Marking certificates are typically valid for a maximum of 5 years, but are typically reviewed during the annual surveillance audit. 
8. | Prepare a Declaration of Conformity, a legally binding document prepared by the manufacturer stating that the device is in compliance with the applicable European requirements. At this time, the CE Marking may be affixed. 
9. | Register the device and its Unique Device Identifier (UDI) in the EUDAMED database. UDI must be on label and associated with the regulatory documents. 
10. | For Class I (self-certified), annual NB audits are not required. However, CER, Technical File, and PMS activities must be kept updated. For all other classes, the company will be audited each year by a Notified Body to ensure ongoing compliance with the MDR. Failure to pass the audit will invalidate the CE Marking certificate. The company must perform Clinical Evaluation, PMS, and PMCF.

Israel. Israel’s Medical Devices Law generally requires the registration of all medical products with the Ministry of Health, or MOH, Registrar as a precondition for production and distribution in Israel. Special exemptions may apply under limited circumstances and for purposes such as the provision of essential medical treatment, research and development of the medical device, and personal use, among others.
 
Registration of medical devices requires the submission of an application to the Ministry of Health Medical Institutions and Devices Licensing Department, or AMAR. An application for the registration of a medical device includes the following:
 

● | Name and address of the manufacturer, and of the importer as applicable; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Description of the intended use of the medical device and of its medical indications; 
● | Technical details of the medical device and of its components, and in the event that the device or the components are not new, information should be provided on the date or renovation; 
● | Certificate attesting to the safety of the device, issued by a competent authority of one of the following countries: Australia, Canada, European Community (EC), Member States (MSs), Israel, Japan, or the United States; 
● | Information on any risk which may be associated with the use of the device (including precautionary measures to be taken); 
● | Instructions for use of the device in Hebrew; the MOH may allow the instructions to be in English for certain devices; 
● | Details of the standards to which the device complies; 
● | Description of the technical and maintenance services, including periodic checks and inspections; and 
● | Declaration, as appropriate: of the local manufacturer/importer, and of the foreign manufacturer. 

 
If the application includes a certificate issued by a competent authority of one of the following “recognized” countries: Australia, Canada, European Community (CE) Member States (MSs), Japan, or the United States, the registration process is generally expedited, but could still take 6-9 months for approval. If such certificate is not available, the registration process will take significantly longer and a license is rarely issued. Furthermore, the MOH will determine what type of testing is needed. In general, in the case of Israeli manufactured devices that are not registered or authorized in any “recognized” country, the application requires presentation of a risk analysis, a clinical evaluation, a summary of the clinical trials, and expert opinions regarding the device’s safety and effectiveness. Additional requirements may apply during the registration period, including follow-up reviews, to improve the quality and safety of the devices.
 
According to regulations issued by Israel’s Minister of Health in June 2013, a decision on a request to register a medical device must be delivered by AMAR within 120 days from the date of the request, although this rarely occurs. The current rules for the registration of medical devices do not provide for an expedited approval process.
 
Once granted by the MOH, a license (marketing authorization) for a medical device is valid for five years from the date of registration of the device, except for implants with a life-supporting function, for which the validity is for only two years from the date of registration. Furthermore, the holder of the license, the Israeli Registration Holder, or IRH, must do the following to maintain its license:
 

● | Reside and maintain a place of business in Israel and serve as the regulatory representative. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Respond to questions from AMAR concerning the registered products. 
● | Report adverse events to AMAR. 
● | Renew the registration on time to keep the market approval active.
