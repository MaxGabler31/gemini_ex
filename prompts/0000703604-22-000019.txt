ITEM 1. BUSINESS.
Lawson Products, Inc. (“Lawson”, the “Company”, “we”, “our”, or “us”) was incorporated in Illinois in 1952, and reincorporated in Delaware in 1982. Lawson serves the industrial, commercial, institutional and government Maintenance, Repair and Operations ("MRO") market. 
Vision
Our vision is to be our customers' first choice for maintenance, repair and operational solutions that improve their operating performance. We plan to achieve our vision by working closely with our customers to maintain and enhance their operations by providing them with quality products, superior service and innovative solutions. 
Industry and Competition
The MRO market is comprised of companies that buy and stock products in bulk and supply these products to customers on an as needed basis. The customer benefits from our knowledge and the convenience of ordering smaller quantities maintained by us. We estimate that total current annual revenue generated by the North American MRO marketplace exceeds $150 billion. 
There is a significant amount of competitive fragmentation by geography and product within the industry. We encounter competition from several national distributors and manufacturers and a large number of regional and local distributors. Some competitors have greater financial and personnel resources, handle more extensive lines of merchandise, operate larger facilities and price some merchandise more competitively than we do. 
Segments
We operate in two reportable segments: the Lawson operating segment and the Bolt operating segment.
Lawson Segment
Through the Lawson operating segment, we deliver quality products to our customers and offer them extensive product knowledge, product application expertise and Vendor Managed Inventory ("VMI") services. Our broad geographic sales coverage allows us to serve large multi-location customers throughout the U.S. and Canada. We compete for business primarily by offering a value-added service approach in which our highly trained sales representatives manage the product inventory for our customers. The VMI model makes it less likely that our customers will unintentionally run out of a product while optimizing their inventory levels. 
Sales orders are primarily generated from our sales representatives on behalf of customers; however, customers can also order directly from our website or through our customer service team via fax or phone. We ship products to customers in all 50 states, Puerto Rico, Canada, Mexico and the Caribbean. We normally ship to our customers within one day of order placement. 
Our MRO distribution process normally entails the purchase of product from suppliers in bulk for delivery to our packaging and distribution facility in McCook, Illinois (“McCook Facility”) for possible repackaging, labeling or cross-docking. Product is then either stocked at the McCook Facility or delivered to one of our strategically located distribution centers. As orders are received, product is picked, packed and shipped to our customers. Many factors affect the efficiency of this process including the physical design of the distribution centers, the extent of automation, routing logistics, the number of times the product needs to be handled, transportation costs and the flexibility to meet the specific requirements of our customers.

Bolt Segment
The Bolt operating segment primarily delivers products to its customers through 14 branches located in Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, and British Columbia, Canada. Bolt generates sales from walk up business at its branch locations and through its sales team, phone, fax or the Internet. Bolt inventory is delivered to the packaging and distribution facility in Calgary, Alberta, and then distributed to each branch location. Sales generated via its sales team or through phone, fax or Internet orders are primarily shipped from one of the branch locations to the customer. The majority of Bolt's customers are located in the geographic vicinity of the branches. Bolt generally does not offer VMI services to its customers. Bolt generated 11.0% of the Company's annual 2021 sales. Bolt product offerings are listed on the Bolt website and are available in each of the branch locations. 
Proposed Combination with TestEquity and Gexpro Services
On December 29, 2021, Lawson entered into:
•an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “TestEquity Merger Agreement”) by and among (1) LKCM TE Investors, LLC (the “TestEquity Equityholder”), (2) TestEquity Acquisition, LLC, an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of the TestEquity Equityholder (“TestEquity”), (3) Lawson and (4) Tide Sub, LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Lawson (“Merger Sub 1”), pursuant to the terms and subject to the conditions of which Merger Sub 1 will merge with and into TestEquity, with TestEquity surviving the merger as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Lawson (the “TestEquity Merger”); and
•an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Gexpro Services Merger Agreement” and, together with the TestEquity Merger Agreement, the “Merger Agreements”) by and among (1) 301 HW Opus Investors, LLC, (the “Gexpro Services Stockholder”), (2) 301 HW Opus Holdings, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Gexpro Services Stockholder (“Gexpro Services”), (3) Lawson and (4) Gulf Sub, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Lawson (“Merger Sub 2”), pursuant to the terms and subject to the conditions of which Merger Sub 2 will merge with and into Gexpro Services, with Gexpro Services surviving the merger as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Lawson (the “Gexpro Services Merger” and, together with the TestEquity Merger, the “Mergers”).
TestEquity is a distributor of parts and services to the industrial, commercial, institutional and governmental electronics manufacturing and test and measurement market. TestEquity operates through three brands, TestEquity, Jensen Tools and Techni-Tool.
Gexpro Services is a provider of supply chain solutions, specializing in developing and implementing Vendor Managed Inventory (VMI) and kitting programs to high-specification manufacturing customers. Gexpro Services provides critical products and services to customers throughout the lifecycle of highly technical Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) products.
The combination of Lawson, TestEquity and Gexpro Services (the “Combined Company”) is intended to bring together three complementary distribution businesses under a holding company structure. We believe that the Mergers and related transactions will advance our strategic objectives of expanding our offerings and services into the large, fragmented distribution industry and thereby enhance our financial performance, including through revenue and earnings growth driven by acquisition opportunities, organic revenue growth opportunities and cost synergies expected to be available to the Combined Company following the Mergers. We expect that the holding company structure will enable each of Lawson, TestEquity and Gexpro Services to maintain their respective high-touch, value-added service delivery models and customer relationships in their specialty distribution businesses under the leadership of their separate business unit management teams, with oversight from our leadership team. At the same time, we expect that the Mergers and the holding structure will enable us to leverage best practices, back-office resources and technologies across the three companies to help drive cost synergies and efficiencies and that the Combined Company will have the ability to utilize its combined financial resources to accelerate a strategy of expansion through both business acquisitions and organic growth across the new platform.
Pursuant to the Merger Agreements, Lawson has agreed to issue up to an aggregate of 12,000,000 shares of Lawson common stock in consideration for the Mergers as follows:
•TestEquity Merger: In connection with the TestEquity Merger, 3,300,000 shares of Lawson common stock would be issued to the TestEquity Equityholder upon the closing of the TestEquity Merger, and up to an additional 700,000 shares of Lawson common stock would potentially be issuable to the TestEquity Equityholder on or after the closing date of the TestEquity Merger upon satisfaction of the conditions of, and in accordance with, two earnout mechanisms.
6 


•Gexpro Services Merger: In connection with the Gexpro Services Merger, 7,000,000 shares of Lawson common stock would be issued to the Gexpro Services Stockholder upon the closing of the Gexpro Services Merger, and up to an additional 1,000,000 shares of Lawson common stock would potentially be issuable to the Gexpro Services Stockholder on or after the closing date of the Gexpro Services Merger upon satisfaction of the conditions of, and in accordance with, two earnout mechanisms.
The Mergers, if completed, will be consummated substantially concurrently. We refer to the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreements, including the Mergers and the share issuances, as the “Transactions.”
Entities affiliated with Luther King Capital Management Corporation (“LKCM”) and J. Bryan King, including private investment partnerships for which LKCM serves as investment manager, beneficially own a majority of the ownership interests in the TestEquity Equityholder (which will be entitled to receive all of the shares of Lawson common stock issued by Lawson as consideration in the TestEquity Merger) and the Gexpro Services Stockholder (which will be entitled to receive all of the shares of Lawson common stock issued by Lawson as consideration in the Gexpro Services Merger).
The consummation of the Mergers is subject to certain closing conditions, including, among others, (1) receipt of the requisite Lawson stockholder approvals under the Merger Agreements and (2) receipt of proceeds of debt financing in an amount sufficient for the payment of certain payoff indebtedness, transaction expenses and other fees and expenses in connection with the Mergers.
On February 22, 2022, the waiting periods under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, expired with respect to the Mergers.
The Merger Agreements contain certain termination rights for the parties, including, among other rights, termination rights if the Mergers are not completed on or before September 30, 2022 (subject to certain limitations) or any of the requisite Lawson stockholder approvals are not obtained at a duly convened stockholders meeting. If the TestEquity Merger Agreement is terminated under certain circumstances, Lawson will be obligated to pay TestEquity a termination fee of $4,000,000, and if the Gexpro Services Merger Agreement is terminated under certain circumstances, Lawson will be obligated to pay Gexpro Services a termination fee of $6,000,000.
Lawson expects to complete the Mergers in the second quarter of 2022.
Debt Financing Commitment Letter
In contemplation of the Mergers, on February 7, 2022 Lawson entered into an amended and restated commitment letter (the “Debt Financing Commitment Letter”) with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (the “Initial Arranger”). Through the Debt Financing Commitment Letter, Lawson has requested that the Initial Arranger agree to arrange and syndicate senior secured credit facilities in an aggregate principal amount of up to $500 million for Lawson and certain of its affiliates, consisting of a revolving credit facility in an initial aggregate principal amount of $200 million, an initial term loan facility in an initial aggregate principal amount of $250 million and a delayed draw term loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of $50 million. Pursuant to the Debt Financing Commitment Letter, the Initial Arranger agreed to (1) provide up to $125 million of the facilities and (2) use commercially reasonable efforts to assemble a syndicate of financial institutions identified by the Initial Arranger and agreed to by Lawson to provide the balance of the necessary commitments for the facilities, in each case upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Debt Financing Commitment Letter.
Lawson would intend to use the proceeds of the initial term loan facility and the revolving facility, if executed, to refinance Lawson’s existing credit agreement and certain existing indebtedness of TestEquity and Gexpro Services in connection with the closing of the Mergers, finance the working capital needs and general corporate purposes of Lawson and its subsidiaries (including TestEquity and Gexpro Services) after the Mergers and pay certain fees and expenses. Lawson would intend to use the proceeds of the delayed draw term loan facility, if executed, to finance certain potential acquisitions by TestEquity and/or Gexpro Services, if completed, and pay certain fees and expenses.
The commitments of the Initial Arranger are subject to (1) the condition that the portion of the facilities not being provided by the Initial Arranger (which remaining portion is $375 million) shall be provided by other lenders identified by the Initial Arranger in consultation with Lawson and reasonably acceptable to Lawson and (2) various other conditions.
The Transactions subject us to a number of risks that are more fully discussed in Item 1A. Risk Factors, "Risk Factors Relating to the Merger Transactions” and “Risk Factors Relating to the Debt Financing Expected to be Incurred in Connection with the Merger” below.

Customers
During 2021, the Lawson segment sold products to over 69,000 distinct customers and the Bolt segment sold products to approximately 12,000 distinct customers in addition to the walk up customers at its 14 branch locations. Our largest customer accounted for approximately three percent of consolidated net sales. In 2021, approximately 81% of our consolidated net sales were generated in the United States and approximately 19% in Canada. Our customers operate in a variety of industries including automotive repair, commercial vehicle maintenance, government, manufacturing, food processing, distribution, construction, oil and gas, mining, wholesale, service and others. Although seasonality is not significant in our business, due to fewer selling days and less activity during the holiday season, net sales in the fourth quarter are historically lower than the first three quarters of the year.
Our customers include a wide range of purchasers of industrial supply products from small repair shops to large national and governmental accounts. Historically, we have been very effective selling to and servicing small and medium sized customer locations that value our service approach. 
Products
Our product offerings are listed on our websites and in catalogs distributed to our customers. Sales percentages by broad product categories of our product mix in 2021 were as follows:

Product Category | Percentage
Fastening systems | 22% 
Cutting tools and abrasives | 15% 
Fluid power | 13% 
Specialty chemicals | 10% 
Electrical | 10% 
Aftermarket automotive supplies | 7% 
Safety | 5% 
Welding and metal repair | 2% 
Other | 16% 
 | 100% 

The Lawson segment offers over 192,000 different products for sale of which over 135,000 products are maintained in our distribution centers. We strive to carry sufficient inventory to ensure product availability and rapid processing of customer orders. Accurate forecasting of customer demand is essential to establish the proper level of inventory for each product. Inventory levels need to be sufficient to meet customer demand while avoiding the costs of stocking excess items. 
During 2021, our Lawson segment purchased products from approximately 3,000 suppliers and no single supplier accounted for more than three percent of our purchases. The loss of one of our core suppliers could affect our operations by hindering our ability to provide full service to our customers.
Our quality control department tests our product offerings to ensure they meet our customers' specifications. We recommend solutions to help customers maximize product performance and avoid costly product failures. Our engineering department provides technical support for our products and offers on-site problem solutions. It also develops and presents product safety and technical training seminars tailored to meet our customers' needs. Safety Data Sheets are maintained electronically and are available to our customers on our website. 
Bolt offers approximately 40,000 different core products for sale of which approximately 19,000 products are maintained in the Calgary distribution center. The majority of inventory is kept in the Calgary distribution center, with each branch maintaining appropriate inventory levels for their business needs.

General Employee Information
Our organization supports a culture of continuous improvement and emphasizes the importance of addressing the needs of our customers. We require our employees to act with integrity in every aspect of our business while encouraging them to be results driven, team oriented and progressive. 
As of December 31, 2021, our combined workforce included approximately 1,840 individuals, comprised of approximately 1,230 in sales and marketing, approximately 480 in operation and distribution and approximately 130 in management and administration. Approximately 1,680 of the 1,840 individuals are within the Lawson segment and the remaining are within Bolt. Approximately 9% of the workforce is covered by two collective bargaining agreements. We believe that our relations with our employees and their collective bargaining organizations are good. 
Sales Team
On December 31, 2021, the Lawson sales and marketing team consisted of approximately 1,230 individuals focused on servicing existing customers, identifying new customers, providing customer service support and providing on-site customer service. Of the total sales team, 1,037 are sales representatives who are primarily organized into geographical regions. The performance of each region is the responsibility of a Regional Sales Director. Each region is further divided into geographically defined districts. The performance of each district is the responsibility of a District Sales Manager who reports to the Regional Sales Director. Our District Sales Managers work with the sales representatives to generate sales from new and existing customers. Lawson also has a team dedicated to the acquisition of larger national and mid-market accounts and a team dedicated to serving governmental accounts. The national accounts are comprised of multi-location customers with a national scope.
Sales force growth is a driver of our business. Increased sales coverage throughout the United States and Canada directly impacts our success as an organization. The Company is focused on identifying and recruiting individuals who are a good fit for our sales organization and providing them the tools needed to succeed. When these employees are hired, they participate in a training program to learn the products and processes of Lawson and also the history, values and culture of the Company. This sales training program allows the new sales representatives to assimilate into the Company and learn the most successful ways to call on potential customers, maintain relationships with existing customers, and provide the proper products and VMI services to ensure that the customers' needs are met. 
The Lawson sales team receives education in the best uses of products, enabling them to provide customized solutions to address customers' needs including technical expertise and on-site problem resolution. The VMI services Lawson offers primarily consist of ordering the right products in the optimal quantity for the customer and stocking the product for customers when the product is delivered. The sales team also periodically provides product presentations to customers that are designed to demonstrate how the products can improve their productivity. Additionally, Lawson sales representatives offer customized storage systems for improved organization and a more efficient work-flow. 
While recruitment of new sales representatives is important, the goal of this process is to ensure the sales representatives who are brought on board will be members of the Lawson team for the long term. Our experience has proven that a sales representative becomes more successful and generates more sales for the Company the longer they are a part of Lawson. Longer tenured sales representatives form deeper relationships with customers, which results in customers relying on the Lawson sales representative for a larger share of their MRO needs. Reducing sales force churn and ensuring sales representatives can grow and reach their full potential over the long term is a focus of the Lawson leadership team. The sales leadership team is in regular contact with Regional Sales Directors, District Sales Managers and experienced sales representatives to discuss the challenges our sales representatives face in generating sales and how the Company can support them. The Company regularly reviews the performance of sales representatives and determines how to manage underperforming sales representatives and territories. 
The majority of Bolt sales are made from its 14 branch locations. Bolt has approximately 24 sales territory managers who serve companies and professional tradespeople throughout Western Canada. In 2017, Bolt began requiring members of the sales teams to be certified as Certified Sales Professionals for the Canadian Professional Sales Association. All newly-hired sales team members are required to receive and maintain the same certification. 
In response to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the Company continues to have the majority of its corporate workforce work remotely and the Company monitors local, state and federal COVID-19 requirements so that its business operations and sales representative activities operate in accordance with these rules. The Company will continue to navigate through the COVID-19 pandemic with a focus on the safety of its team members.

Strategic Focus
In 2022, we intend to grow our sales organically, pursue acquisitions and further improve our operations to make Lawson our customers' first choice for MRO products, VMI services and solutions that improve their operating performance.
Our sales are impacted by the size of our sales team, their productivity and their territorial coverage. Our plan to expand the sales force is designed by identifying under-served territories that offer the greatest growth potential, locate and recruit talented sales representatives, provide them with the proper training, and successfully integrate them into our organization.
To acquire the best new sales talent and prepare them for success, we have developed an extensive talent acquisition strategy. We use both internal and external resources to identify and recruit the best available sales talent. As we increase our sales coverage, we anticipate a short-term decrease in average sales per day per sales representative, as new representatives build customer relationships in their territories. However, we believe that these short-term investments will result in future opportunities as we leverage the positive impact of top-line growth against our operating costs which are fixed to a significant extent.
We are also focused on increasing the productivity of our sales representatives. We strive to empower our sales representatives with the training, technology and support they need to maximize their sales potential while providing our customers with superior service and making it easy for them to do business with us. 
In addition to organic growth, we plan to continue to actively pursue acquisition opportunities that we believe will be financially accretive to our organization. Lawson plans to continue to explore growth opportunities in the MRO space that provide different channels to reach customers, increase sales and generate positive results. 
In order to improve our operations, we utilize a Lean Six Sigma approach, which is a set of tools that allow a project team to analyze and improve selected business processes. The project teams work with the process owners to develop statistical measures to evaluate the effectiveness of the process, document the current components and process flow, examine the root cause of defects and effect on current operations, design and implement new ways to improve performance and then measure the results for effectiveness. The Lean Six Sigma process is ingrained in our culture as we have had over 120 employees complete Lean Six Sigma training over the past six years and plan to continue this training program in the years to come. 
 We believe our emphasis on continuous improvement will lead to further reductions in error rates, increased processing speed, reduction in cycle times, standardization of procedures and elimination of waste. This will enable us to become a more efficient and effective organization which provides our customers with the best purchasing experience possible.
