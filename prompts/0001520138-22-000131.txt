The Market
 
Bergamot
 
BergaMet, LLC holds the rights to distribute BergaMet products in the United States, Canada, Mexico, and South Korea pursuant to a Supply Agreement with H&AD S.r.L., an Italian limited company. The Supply Agreement was entered into on January 1, 2019, has a term of five (5) years, and is renewable for up to four (4) additional and successive three (3) year terms.
 
Bergamot, or citrus bergamia, is a rare citrus fruit native to the Calabrian region of Southern Italy. Due to sensitivity to the weather and soil conditions, this region accounts for 80 percent of the worldwide production of bergamot. This superfruit has been used for decades in the Calabrian regions for its beneficial effects in promoting overall health - particularly, in support of cholesterol, cardiovascular, and metabolic health1. Citrus bergamot contains five unique antioxidant polyphenols in unusually concentrated amounts, which help protect your bodys trillions of cells from free radical damage. The juice and albedo of bergamot has a unique profile of flavanoid and glycosides, such as neoeriocitrin, neohesperidin, naringin, rutin, neodesmin, rhoifolin, and poncirin. Naringin has been shown to be beneficial in animal models of atherosclerosis, while neoeriocitrin and rutin have been found to exhibit a strong capacity to prevent LDL from oxidation. Importantly, bergamot juice is rich in brutieridine and melitidine with an ability to inhibit HMG-CoA reductase, which inhibits the livers ability to produce LDL, resulting in reduced cholesterol levels in liver cells.
 
BergaMet sells its bergamot products in capsule form on its website and on distribution sites such as Amazon.

We are currently in the research and development phase on a UBN product called Ultimate Brain Nutrients with its proprietary Fuel for Thought (F4T) formulations. BergaMet has been covering the costs of the product creation and development with our product manufactures, due to UBNs lack of positive cash flow. As we create and test new flavors of F4T, and once we have product production in place, UBN will begin to sell the product in April 2022. We have been accounting for these costs as inter-company loans.
 
Patents and Intellectual Property Rights
 
Our subsidiary, UBN, has four unique patent-pending formulations and two patents issued. We have not otherwise filed for any intellectual property protection. However, we rely on intellectual property law that may include a combination of copyright, trade secret and confidentiality agreements to protect our intellectual property. Our employees and independent contractors will be required to sign agreements acknowledging that all inventions, trade secrets, works of authorship, developments and other processes generated by them on our behalf are our property, and assigning to us any ownership that they may claim in those works. Despite our precautions, it may be possible for third parties to obtain and use without consent intellectual property that we own. Unauthorized use of our intellectual property by third parties, and the expenses incurred in protecting our intellectual property rights, may adversely affect our business.

From time to time, we may encounter disputes over rights and obligations concerning intellectual property. While we believe that our product and service offerings do not infringe the intellectual property rights of any third party, we cannot assure you that we will prevail in any intellectual property dispute. If we do not prevail in such disputes, we may lose some or all of our intellectual property protection, be enjoined from further sales of the applications determined to infringe the rights of others, and/or be forced to pay substantial royalties to a third party.
 
Governmental Controls, Approval and Licensing Requirements
 
Federal laws related to the advertising, distribution and sale of health supplements.
 
We expect that the formulation, manufacturing, packaging, labeling, advertising, distribution and sale (hereafter, sale or sold may be used to signify all of these activities) of our vitamin and nutritional supplement products will be subject to regulation by one or more federal agencies, primarily the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), and to a lesser extent the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC), the United States Department of Agriculture, and the Environmental Protection Agency. Our activities are also regulated by various governmental agencies for the states and localities in which our products are sold, as well as by governmental agencies in certain countries outside the United States in which our products are sold. Among other matters, regulation by the FDA and the FTC is concerned with product safety and claims made with respect to a products ability to provide health-related benefits. Specifically, the FDA, under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA), regulates the formulation, manufacturing, packaging, labeling, distribution, and sale of food, including dietary supplements and over-the-counter (OTC) drugs. The FTC regulates the advertising of these products. The National Advertising Division (NAD) of the Council of Better Business Bureaus oversees an industry-sponsored, self-regulatory system that permits competitors to resolve disputes over advertising claims. The NAD has no enforcement authority of its own, but may refer matters that appear to violate the FTC Act or the FDCA to the FTC or the FDA for further action, as appropriate.
 
Most of the nutritional supplement products that we plan to sell are classified as dietary supplements. The FDAs revision of nutrition labeling requirements also affects the nutrition labeling of certain dietary supplements.  Our affected manufacturers may have to revise labels on some of their dietary supplements in the next two years. Moreover, these manufacturers may need to reformulate their products to maintain eligibility for certain marketing claims.

The Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act (DSHEA) was enacted in 1994, amending the FDCA. Among other things, DSHEA prevents the FDA from regulating dietary ingredients in dietary supplements as food additives and allows the use of statements of nutritional support on product labels and in labeling. DSHEA establishes a statutory class of dietary supplements, which includes vitamins, minerals, herbs, amino acids and other dietary ingredients for human use to supplement the diet. Dietary ingredients marketed in the United States before October 15, 1994 may be marketed without the submission of a new dietary ingredient (NDI) premarket notification to the FDA. Dietary ingredients not marketed in the United States before October 15, 1994 may require the submission, at least 75 days before marketing, of an NDI notification containing information establishing that the ingredient is reasonably expected to be safe for its intended use. The FDA has issued final regulations under DSHEA.
 
As required by Section 113(b) of the Food Safety Modernization Act, the FDA published in July 2011 a draft guidance document clarifying when the FDA believes a dietary ingredient is an NDI, when a manufacturer or distributor must submit an NDI premarket notification to the FDA, the evidence necessary to document the safety of an NDI and the methods for establishing the identity of an NDI. Industry strongly objected to several aspects of the draft guidance. In 2016, the FDA issued revised draft guidance on what constitutes an NDI and NDI notification requirements. Regardless of whether the FDA finalizes this draft guidance, the FDA has recently acted more aggressively to remove ingredients from the market that the FDA views as unlawful dietary ingredients. This trend, if it continues, may limit the dietary supplement market. Several bills to amend DSHEA in ways that would make this law less favorable to consumers and industry have been proposed in Congress.
 
The FDA issued a Final Rule on GMPs for dietary supplements on June 22, 2007. The GMPs cover manufacturers and holders of finished dietary supplement products, including dietary supplement products manufactured outside the United States that are imported for sale into the United States. Among other things, the new GMPs: (a) require identity testing on all incoming dietary ingredients, (b) call for a scientifically valid system for ensuring finished products meet all specifications, (c) include requirements related to process controls, including statistical sampling of finished batches for testing and requirements for written procedures and (d) require extensive recordkeeping. We have reviewed the GMPs and have taken steps to ensure compliance. While we believe we are in compliance, there can be no assurance that our operations or those of our suppliers will be in compliance in all respects at all times. Additionally, there is a potential risk of increased audits as the FDA and other regulators seek to ensure compliance with the GMPs.
 
On December 22, 2006, Congress passed the Dietary Supplement and Nonprescription Drug Consumer Protection Act, which went into effect on December 22, 2007. The law requires, among other things, that companies that manufacture or distribute nonprescription drugs or dietary supplements report serious adverse events allegedly associated with their products to the FDA and institute recordkeeping requirements for all adverse events (serious and non-serious). There is a risk that consumers, the press and government regulators could misinterpret reported serious adverse events as evidence of causation by the ingredient or product complained of, which could lead to additional regulations, banned ingredients or products, increased insurance costs and a potential increase in product liability litigation, among other things.
 
All states regulate foods and drugs under laws that generally parallel federal statutes. We are also subject to state consumer health and safety regulations, such as the California Safe Drinking Water and Toxic Enforcement Act of 1986 (Proposition 65). Violation of Proposition 65 may result in substantial monetary penalties and compliance with Proposition 65 is a major focus. Contemplated changes in the Proposition 65 labeling requirements could potentially lead to substantial costs. Current legislation in Massachusetts regarding restrictions on weight loss and sports nutrition products could also impact the marketing of dietary supplements generally. Further, state attorneys general have pressured industry to adopt DNA testing for herbal-based products to assure plant identity, and have taken other actions relating to dietary ingredient status. It is uncertain whether these efforts will have a material impact on the dietary supplement market.

Competition
 
Nutritional Supplements
 
We compete with other manufacturers, distributors and marketers of vitamins, minerals, herbs, and other nutritional supplements both within and outside the U.S. The nutritional supplement industry is highly fragmented and competition for the sale of nutritional supplements comes from many sources. These products are sold primarily through retailers (drug store chains, supermarkets, and mass market discount retailers), health and natural food stores, and direct sales channels (network marketing and internet sales).
 
The nutritional supplement industry is highly competitive and we expect the level of competition to remain high over the near term. We do not believe it is possible to accurately estimate the total number or size of our competitors. The nutritional supplement industry has undergone consolidation in the recent past and we expect that trend may continue in the near term.
 
Employees
 
As of the date hereof, we do not have any employees other than our officers and directors. BergaMet has 2 employees, and UBN does not have any employees but uses outside contract help on an as-needed basis. Our officers and directors will continue to work for us for the foreseeable future. We anticipate hiring appropriate personnel on an as-needed basis, and utilizing the services of independent contractors as needed.
