ITEM 1.   BUSINESS
Introduction
The Toro Company was incorporated in Minnesota in 1935 as a successor to a business founded in 1914 and reincorporated in Delaware in 1983. Unless the context indicates otherwise, the terms "company," "Toro," "we," "our," or "us" refer to The Toro Company and its consolidated subsidiaries. Our executive offices are located at 8111 Lyndale Avenue South, Bloomington, Minnesota, 55420-1196, and our telephone number is (952)-888-8801. Our web site for corporate and investor information is www.thetorocompany.com, which also contains links to our branded product sites. The information contained on our web sites or connected to our web sites is not incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K (this "report") and should not be considered part of this report.
We design, manufacture, and market professional turf maintenance equipment and services, turf irrigation systems, landscaping equipment and lighting products, snow and ice management products, agricultural irrigation systems ("ag-irrigation"), rental and specialty construction equipment, and residential yard and snow thrower products. We produced our first mower for golf course use in 1919 when we mounted five reel mowers on a Toro tractor, and we introduced our first lawn mower for residential use in 1938. We have continued to enhance our product lines over the more than 100 years we have been in business. We classify our operations into two reportable business segments: Professional and Residential. Our remaining activities are presented as "Other" due to their insignificance. These Other activities consist of earnings (loss) from our wholly-owned domestic distribution company, corporate activities, and the elimination of intersegment revenues and expenses. Net sales of our reportable segments and Other activities accounted for the following percentages of our consolidated net sales for fiscal 2018: Professional, 74 percent; Residential, 25 percent; and Other, 1 percent.
Our products are advertised and sold worldwide through a network of distributors, dealers, mass retailers, hardware retailers, home centers, as well as online (direct to end-users) under the primary trademarks of Toro®, Exmark®, BOSS®, Irritrol®, Hayter®, Pope®, PERROT®, Unique Lighting Systems®, and Lawn-Boy® most of which are registered in the United States ("U.S.") and/or in the primary countries outside the U.S. where we market such products. This report also contains trademarks, trade names, and service marks that are owned by other persons or entities, such as The Home Depot, Inc. ("The Home Depot").
We emphasize quality and innovation in our products, customer service, manufacturing, and marketing. We strive to provide well-built, dependable products supported by an extensive service network. We have committed funding for research, development, and engineering in order to improve and enhance existing products and develop new products. Through these efforts, we seek to be responsive to trends that may affect our 


target markets now and in the future. A significant portion of our net sales has historically been, and we expect will continue to be, attributable to new and enhanced products. We define new products as those introduced in the current and previous two fiscal years. We plan to continue to pursue targeted acquisitions using a disciplined approach that adds value while complementing our existing brands and product portfolio.
Our purpose is to help our customers enrich the beauty, productivity, and sustainability of the land. Our vision is to be the most trusted leader in solutions for the outdoor environment. Every day. Everywhere. Our mission is to deliver superior innovation and to deliver superior customer care.

Our Dingo® TX 1000 compact utility loader provides market leading operating capacity in a lightweight, maneuverable design. We offer over 35 attachments for our compact utility loaders, including 


4

trenchers, augers, vibratory plows, and backhoes. These products are mainly sold to rental companies and large retailers who subsequently rent the products to end-users. However, these products are also sold through distributors and dealers, who then sell to end-users that in many cases are the same customers as those in our landscape contractor market. In fiscal 2017, we introduced our MB TX 2500 Tracked Mud Buggy® featuring Endless Kevlar® reinforced tracks designed to increase job-site productivity by delivering high performance and outstanding traction on a wide range of terrains.
Underground Construction Market
We manufacture a line of directional drills and riding trenchers used to install water, gas, electric, and telecommunication distribution systems. Our underground products are used by specialty contractors worldwide. In fiscal 2018, we began shipping our innovative DD2226 directional drill featuring increased thrust, pull-back, and rotational torque designed to allow operators to pull back and turn larger reamers in tough ground conditions. The DD2226 also features our new SmartTouch® control mode designed to streamline pipe handling, reduce pipe loading cycle times, and increase overall productivity.
Residential/Commercial Irrigation and Lighting Market
Turf irrigation products marketed under the Toro and Irritrol brands include rotors; sprinkler bodies and nozzles; plastic, brass, and hydraulic valves; drip tubing and subsurface irrigation; electric control devices; and wired and wireless rain, freeze, climate, and soil sensors. These products are designed for use in residential and commercial turf irrigation applications and can be installed into new systems or used to replace or retrofit existing systems. Most of the product lines are designed for professionally installed, underground automatic irrigation. Electric controllers activate valves and sprinklers in a typical irrigation system. Both the Toro and Irritrol brands have received the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA") WaterSense award, as well as the EPA WaterSense certification for numerous irrigation controller families and models. In late fiscal 2018, we introduced the new Irritrol KD2 Series controller, which offers a unique combination of sophisticated features and familiar operation while being compatible with our Climate Logic® Weather Sensing System, which automatically adjusts irrigation system watering times based on real-time weather data from an on-site sensor combined with historical averages.
Our retail irrigation products are designed for homeowner installation and include sprinkler heads, valves, timers, sensors, and drip irrigation systems. The XTRA SMART® ECXTRA™ sprinkler timer and its intuitive, online Scheduling Advisor™ are designed to recommend the proper watering schedule based on the local weather, plant type, and sprinkler type.
We manufacture and market lighting products under the Unique Lighting Systems brand name consisting of a line of high quality, professionally installed lighting fixtures and transformers for residential and commercial landscapes. Our lighting product line is offered through distributors and 


landscape contractors that also purchase our irrigation products. Our Light Logic™ remote control system provides operators with wireless scene control for landscape lighting and can upgrade existing systems with expanded control. The Light Logic™ Plus system is designed to deliver cloud-based control from any location using a web-enabled computer or device for outdoor landscape features such as lighting, irrigation, and pond or fountain pumps. In fiscal 2018, we launched the new FLEX GOLDTM VIVID SERIES of LED lamps with adjustable white color temperature between 2700 – 6500K.
Agricultural-Irrigation Market
Products for the agricultural-irrigation market include products that are designed around efficient means of irrigation, including Aqua-Traxx® PBX drip tape, Neptune® flat emitter dripline, Blue Stripe® polyethylene tubing, BlueLine® drip line, and NGE® emitters, all used in agriculture and landscape applications. Global food demand and increased water use restrictions have continued to drive the need for more efficient irrigation solutions for agriculture, including our Aqua-Traxx® FC (flow control) drip tape that is designed to allow growers to achieve water uniformity while retaining flexibility to adjust system flow rates when needed. In addition to these core products, we offer a full complement of control devices and connection options to complete the system, including a software package used to help design drip irrigation systems. These products are sold mainly through dealers and distributors who then sell to end-users for use primarily in vegetable fields, fruit and nut orchards, vineyards, landscapes, and mines. In fiscal 2018, we released our Aqua-Traxx 7/8” 5-mil, which allows for higher uniformity as opposed to tape reused for multiple seasons and is designed to reduce the need for labor.
Residential Segment
We market our Residential segment products to homeowners through a variety of distribution channels, including outdoor power equipment distributors and dealers, mass retailers, hardware retailers, home centers, as well as online (direct to end-users). We also license our trademark on certain home solutions products as a means of expanding our brand presence.
Walk Power Mower Products
We manufacture and market numerous walk power mower models under our Toro and Lawn-Boy brand names, as well as the Hayter brand in the United Kingdom. Models differ as to cutting width, type of starter mechanism, method of grass clipping discharge, deck type, operational controls, and power sources, and are either self-propelled or push mowers. For the United Kingdom market, we offer a line of rear-roller walk power mowers, a design that provides a striped finish. In fiscal 2018, we expanded the innovative PoweReverse® and SmartStow® technology to more of our walk power mower products. The PoweReverse® technology is designed to help homeowners mow challenging areas with less effort, while the SmartStow® technology reduces the space needed for storage by allowing the mower to be stored vertically.

Riding Products
We manufacture and market riding products under the Toro brand name. Riding products consist of zero-turn radius mowers that are designed to save homeowners time by using superior maneuverability to cut around obstacles more quickly and easily than tractor technology. Many models of our riding products are available with a variety of engines, decks, transmissions, and accessories. Our TimeCutter® SS and TimeCutter® MX zero-turn radius riding mowers are equipped with our Smart Speed® control system, which is designed to allow the operator to choose different ground speed ranges with the flip of a lever without changing the blade or engine speed. In fiscal 2018, we expanded our MyRIDE® suspension system, featuring adjustable rear shocks, a suspended operator platform and a premium padded seat designed to provide exceptional comfort and smooth operation, to the TimeCutter® MX line of mowers.
Home Solutions Products
We design and market home solutions products under the Toro and Pope brand names. Our Toro brand name products include yard tools such as electric, gas, and cordless grass trimmers; electric and cordless hedge trimmers; and electric, gas, and cordless blower-vacuums. In Australia, we design and market garden product offerings, such as underground, hose and hose-end retail irrigation products under the Pope brand name. In fiscal 2018, we launched the PowerJetTM corded blower with the industry’s highest air flow volume in this category that is designed to allow homeowners to move large piles of leaves at a faster rate than other corded blowers on the market.
Snow Thrower Products
We manufacture and market a range of gas-powered single-stage and two-stage snow thrower models, as well as a range of electric snow thrower models. Our electric snow throwers are lightweight and ideal for clearing up to six inches of snow from decks, steps, sidewalks, and small driveways. Single-stage snow throwers are walk behind units with lightweight four-cycle gasoline engines. Most single-stage snow thrower models include Power Curve® snow thrower technology, and some feature our Quick Shoot™ control system that is designed to enable operators to quickly change snow-throwing direction. Our pivoting scraper is designed to keep the rotor in constant contact with the pavement. Our two-stage snow throwers are generally designed for relatively large areas of deep and heavy snow. Our two-stage snow throwers include a line of models featuring our patented Anti-Clogging System and Quick Stick® chute control technology. In late fiscal 2018, we began shipping the next generation of Power Max® HD two-stage snow throwers featuring expanded clearing widths, reinforced Quick Stick® chute control, all-steel construction, and new commercial grade models with options including LED headlights and hand warmers. The Toro SnowMaster® snow thrower combines the power of a two-stage snow thrower to handle deep snow with the handling and maneuverability of a lightweight, single-stage snow thrower in a design intended to increase efficiency by clearing more snow per minute.

Financial Information about International Operations and Business Segments
We currently manufacture our products in the U.S., Mexico, Australia, the United Kingdom, Italy, Romania, Germany, Poland, and China for sale throughout the world. We maintain sales offices in the U.S., Belgium, the United Kingdom, Australia, Japan, China, Italy, Poland, and Germany. New product development is pursued primarily in the U.S. Our net sales outside the U.S. were 24.6 percent, 24.4 percent, and 24.2 percent of total consolidated net sales for fiscal 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively.
We are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk arising from transactions in the normal course of business, such as sales to international third party customers, sales and loans to wholly-owned foreign subsidiaries, foreign plant operations, and purchases from suppliers. To reduce our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk, we actively manage the exposure of our foreign currency exchange rate risk by entering into various derivative instruments to hedge against such risk. For additional information regarding our derivative instruments, see Part II, Item 7A, "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk" of this report. For additional financial information regarding our international operations and geographical areas, and our reportable business segments, see Note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, in the section entitled "Segment Data," included in Part II, Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" of this report.
Engineering and Research
We are committed to an ongoing engineering program dedicated to developing innovative new products and improvements in the quality and performance of existing products. However, a focus on innovation also carries certain risks that new technology could be slow to be accepted or not accepted by the marketplace. We attempt to mitigate these risks through our focus on and commitment to understanding our customers' needs and requirements. We invest time upfront with customers, using "Voice of the Customer" tools, to help us develop innovative products that are intended to meet or exceed customer expectations. We use Design for Manufacturing and Assembly ("DFM/A") tools to ensure early manufacturing involvement in new product designs intended to reduce production costs. DFM/A focuses on reducing the number of parts required to assemble new products, as well as designing products to move more efficiently through the manufacturing process. We strive to make improvements to our new product development system as part of our continuing focus on Lean methods to shorten development time, reduce costs, and improve quality.
Manufacturing and Production
In addition to most final assembly, we have strategically identified specific core manufacturing competencies for vertical integration, such as injection molding, extrusion, welding, stamping, fabrication, laser cutting, painting, machining, and aluminum die casting, and have chosen outside vendors to provide other services. We design component parts 


6

in cooperation with our vendors, contract with them for the development of tooling, and then enter into agreements with these vendors to purchase component parts manufactured using the tooling. We also have some agreements with third party manufacturers to manufacture certain products on our behalf. In addition, our vendors regularly test new technologies to be applied in the design and production of component parts. Manufacturing operations include robotic and computer-automated equipment intended to speed production, reduce costs, and improve the quality, fit, and finish of our products. Operations are also designed to be flexible enough to accommodate product design changes that are necessary to respond to market conditions and changing customer requirements.
In order to utilize our manufacturing facilities and technology more effectively, we pursue continuous improvements in our manufacturing processes with the use of Lean methods that are intended to streamline work and eliminate waste. We spend considerable effort to reduce manufacturing costs through Lean methods and process improvement, product and platform design, application of advanced technologies, enhanced environmental management systems, safety improvements, and improved supply-chain management.
Our Professional segment products are manufactured throughout the year. Our Residential segment lawn and garden products are also generally manufactured throughout the year. However, our Residential segment snow thrower products are manufactured in the summer and fall months but may be extended into the winter months, depending upon demand. Our products are tested in conditions and locations similar to those in which they are used. We use computer-aided design and manufacturing systems to shorten the time between initial concept and final production. DFM/A principles are used throughout the product development process to optimize product quality and cost.
Our production levels and inventory management goals are based on estimates of retail demand for our products, taking into account production capacity, timing of shipments, and field inventory levels. Our production system utilizes Kanban, supplier pull, and build-to-order methodologies in our manufacturing facilities, as appropriate, for the business units they support in order to better align the production of our products to meet customer demand. We believe this has resulted in improved service levels for our participating suppliers, distributors, dealers, and other channels.
We periodically shut down production at our manufacturing facilities in order to allow for maintenance, rearrangement, capital equipment installation, seasonality, and as needed, to adjust for market demand.
Raw Materials
We purchase raw materials such as steel, aluminum, petroleum and natural gas-based resins, linerboard, and other commodities, and components, such as engines, transmissions, transaxles, hydraulics, and electric motors, for use in our products. In addition, we are a purchaser of components and 


parts containing various commodities, including steel, aluminum, copper, lead, rubber, and others that are integrated into our end products. The largest spend for raw materials and components are generally for steel, engines, hydraulic components, transmissions, resin, aluminum, and electric motors, all of which we purchase from several suppliers around the world. Most of the raw materials and components used in our products are affected by commodity cost pressures. In addition, certain foreign sourced raw materials and components are subject to the direct impact of tariffs. Most of the raw materials, components, parts, and accessories utilized in our products are generally commercially available from a number of sources, and are in adequate supply. However, certain items are sourced from single suppliers. 
During fiscal 2018, we experienced higher commodity prices compared to the average prices paid for commodities in fiscal 2017. We strategically work to mitigate the impact of inflation on the cost of commodities and components that affect our product lines; however, we anticipate commodity prices in fiscal 2019 to be higher than average prices paid for commodities during fiscal 2018. Historically, we have mitigated, and we currently expect that we would mitigate, any commodity cost increases, in part, by collaborating with suppliers, reviewing alternative sourcing options, substituting materials, utilizing Lean methods, engaging in internal cost reduction efforts, and increasing prices on some of our products, all as appropriate. Additionally, in fiscal 2018, we experienced a higher level of work stoppages because of shortages of raw materials and component parts than we experienced in fiscal 2017. 
Service and Warranty
Our products are warranted to ensure customer confidence in design, workmanship, and overall quality. Warranty coverage is generally for specified periods of time and on select products' hours of usage, and generally covers parts, labor, and other expenses for non-maintenance repairs. Warranty coverage generally does not cover operator abuse or improper use. An authorized company distributor or dealer must perform warranty work. Distributors and dealers submit claims for warranty reimbursement and are credited for the cost of repairs, labor, and other expenses as long as the repairs meet our prescribed standards. Warranty expense is accrued at the time of sale based on the estimated number of products under warranty, historical average costs incurred to service warranty claims, the trend in the historical ratio of claims to sales, the historical length of time between the sale and resulting warranty claim, and other minor factors. Special warranty reserves are also accrued for major rework campaigns. Service support outside of the warranty period is provided by authorized distributors and dealers at the customer's expense. We sell extended warranty coverage on select products for a prescribed period after the original warranty period expires.
Product Liability
We have rigorous product safety standards and continually work to improve the safety and reliability of our products. We 


7

monitor for accidents and possible claims and establish liability estimates based on internal evaluations of the merits of individual claims. We purchase insurance coverage for catastrophic product liability claims for incidents that exceed our self-insured retention levels.
Patents and Trademarks
We own patents, trademarks, and trade secrets related to our products in the U.S. and certain countries outside the U.S. in which we conduct business. We expect to apply for future patents and trademarks, as appropriate, in connection with the development of innovative new products, services, and enhancements. Although we believe that, in the aggregate, our patents are valuable, and patent protection is beneficial to our business and competitive positioning, our patent protection will not necessarily deter or prevent competitors from attempting to develop similar products. We are not materially dependent on any one or more of our patents; however, certain Toro trademarks that contribute to our identity and the recognition of our products and services, including the Toro® name and logo, are an integral part of our business.
We regularly review certain patents issued by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office ("USPTO") and international patent offices to help avoid potential liability with respect to others' patents. Additionally, we periodically review competitors' products to prevent possible infringement of our patents by others. We believe these activities help us minimize our risk of being a defendant in patent infringement litigation. We are currently involved in patent litigation cases where we are asserting our patents against competitors and defending against patent infringement assertions by others. Such cases are at varying stages in the litigation process.
Similarly, we periodically monitor various trademark registers and the market to prevent infringement of and damage to our trademarks by others. From time to time, we are involved in trademark oppositions where we are asserting our trademarks against third parties who are attempting to establish rights in trademarks that are confusingly similar to ours. We believe these activities help minimize risk of harm to our trademarks, and help maintain distinct products and services that we believe are well regarded in the marketplace.
Seasonality
Shipments of our Residential segment products, which accounted for 25 percent of total consolidated net sales in fiscal 2018, are seasonal, with shipments of lawn and garden products occurring primarily between February and June, depending upon seasonal weather conditions and demand for our products. Shipments of snow thrower products occur primarily between July and January, depending upon pre-season demand, in-season snowfalls, and product availability. Opposite seasons in global markets in which we sell our products somewhat moderate this seasonality of our Residential segment product sales. Seasonality of Professional segment product sales also exists, but is tempered because the selling season in the Southern U.S. and our markets in the Southern hemisphere continue for a longer portion of the year than in Northern 


regions of the world. Our BOSS snow and ice management business offers a portfolio of counter-seasonal products in our Professional segment with our shipments of snowplows and salt and sand spreaders occurring primarily between April and December, which can result in variability of shipment volumes due to dependency on snowfalls for these products.
Overall, our worldwide shipment volumes are historically the highest in our fiscal second quarter and retail demand is generally highest in our fiscal third quarter. Typically, our accounts receivable balances increase between January and April as a result of higher shipment volumes and extended payment terms made available to our customers. Accounts receivable balances typically decrease between May and December when payments are received. Our financing requirements are subject to variations due to seasonal changes in working capital levels, which typically increase in the first half of our fiscal year and decrease in the second half of our fiscal year. Seasonal cash requirements of our business are financed from a combination of cash flows from operations, cash on hand, and borrowings under our revolving credit facility, as applicable.
The following table shows total consolidated net sales and net earnings for each fiscal quarter as a percentage of the total fiscal year:

Fiscal Years | 2018 | | 2017 
Quarter | Net Sales | | Net Earnings | | Net Sales | Net Earnings
First | 21 | % | | 8 | % | 21 | % | 17 | %
Second | 33 | | | 48 | | 35 | | 45 | 
Third | 25 | | | 29 | | 25 | | 25 | 
Fourth | 21 | % | | 15 | % | 19 | % | 13 | %

Effects of Weather
From time to time, weather conditions in particular geographic regions or markets may adversely or positively affect sales of some of our products and field inventory levels and result in a negative or positive impact on our future net sales. If the percentage of our net sales from outside the U.S. increases, our dependency on weather in any one part of the world decreases. Nonetheless, weather conditions could materially affect our future net sales.
Working Capital
Our businesses are seasonally working capital intensive and require funding for purchases of raw materials used in production; replacement parts inventory; payroll and other administrative costs; capital expenditures; establishment of new facilities; expansion, renovation, and upgrading of existing facilities; as well as for financing receivables from customers that are not financed with Red Iron Acceptance, LLC ("Red Iron"), our joint venture with TCF Inventory Finance, Inc. ("TCFIF"). Our strategy continues to place emphasis on improving asset utilization with a focus on reducing the amount of working capital in the supply chain, adjusting production plans, and maintaining or improving order replenishment and service levels to end-users. We fund our operations through a 


8

combination of cash flows from operations, cash on hand, and, as applicable, long-term debt, including borrowings under our revolving credit facility. Cash management is centralized, and intercompany financing is used, wherever possible, to provide working capital to wholly owned subsidiaries as needed. In addition, our revolving credit facility is available for additional working capital needs, acquisitions, or other investment opportunities.
Distribution and Marketing
We market the majority of our products through 36 domestic and 110 international distributors, as well as a large number of equipment dealers, irrigation dealers and distributors, mass retailers, hardware retailers, home centers, and online (direct to end-users) in more than 125 countries worldwide. Our distribution systems are intended to assure quality of sales and market presence, as well as to provide effective after-purchase service and support.
Professional segment products are sold to distributors and dealers primarily for resale to golf courses, sports fields, industrial facilities, contractors, and government customers, and in some markets for resale to dealers. We sell some Professional segment products directly to government customers, rental companies, and agricultural irrigation dealers, as well as to end-users in certain international markets. Select residential/commercial irrigation and lighting products are sold to professional irrigation and lighting distributors and dealers, and certain retail irrigation products are sold to home centers. Products for the rental and specialty construction market are sold to dealers and rental companies. Toro and Exmark landscape contractor products are also sold to dealers in certain regions of North America. BOSS snow and ice management products are sold to distributors and dealers for resale to contractors.
Residential segment products, such as walk power mowers, zero-turn radius riding mowers, and snow throwers, are generally sold to home centers, mass retailers, dealers, hardware retailers, as well as online (direct to end-users). In certain markets, these same products are sold to distributors for resale to hardware retailers and dealers. Home solutions products are primarily sold to home centers, mass retailers, and hardware retailers. Internationally, Residential segment products are sold to dealers and mass merchandisers in Australia, Canada, and select countries in Europe. In most other countries, Residential segment products are mainly sold to distributors for resale to dealers and mass retailers.
On November 27, 2015, in our first quarter of fiscal 2016, we completed the sale of our Northwestern U.S. distribution company. During the remainder of fiscal 2016 and through fiscal 2017 and 2018, we owned one domestic distribution company. Our primary purpose in owning domestic distributorships is to improve operations and test and deploy new strategies and business practices that could be replicated by our independent distributors, as well as facilitating ownership transfers.


Our current marketing strategy is to maintain distinct brands and brand identification for Toro®, Exmark®, BOSS®, Irritrol®, Hayter®, Pope®, PERROT®, Unique Lighting Systems®, and Lawn-Boy® products.
Across our brands, we market our Professional segment and Residential segment products during the appropriate season through multiple channels, including television, radio, print, direct mail, email, digital and online media, and social media. Most of our advertising and marketing efforts emphasize our brands, products, features, and other valuable trademarks. Advertising is purchased by us, through our agency partners, as well as through cooperative programs with distributors, dealers, and retailers.
Customers
Overall, we believe that in the long-term we are not dependent on any single customer; however, the Residential segment of our business is dependent on The Home Depot as a customer, which accounted for less than 10 percent of our total consolidated gross sales in fiscal 2018 but accounted for approximately 10 percent of our total consolidated gross sales in fiscal 2017. During fiscal 2018, no customer accounted for 10 percent or more of total consolidated gross sales. While the loss of any substantial customer, including The Home Depot, could have a material adverse short-term impact on our business, we believe that our diverse distribution channels and customer base should reduce the long-term impact of any such loss.
Backlog of Orders
Our backlog of orders is dependent upon when customers place orders and is not necessarily an indicator of our expected results for our fiscal 2019 net sales. The approximate backlog of orders as of October 31, 2018 and 2017 was $77.8 million and $83.5 million, respectively, a decrease of 6.8 percent. Backlog orders were lower at the end of fiscal 2018 compared to the end of fiscal 2017 mainly due to timing of Professional segment customer stocking orders; this decrease was partially offset by increased orders of new products. We expect the existing backlog of orders will be filled in early fiscal 2019.
Competition
Our products are sold in highly competitive markets throughout the world. The principal competitive factors in our markets are product innovation, quality and reliability, pricing, product support and customer service, warranty, brand awareness, reputation, distribution, shelf space, and financing options. We believe we offer total solutions and full service packages with high quality products that have the latest technology and design innovations. In addition, by selling our products through a network of distributors, dealers, mass retailers, hardware retailers, home centers, as well as online (direct to end-users), users are offered comprehensive service support during and after the warranty period. We compete in many product lines with numerous manufacturers, some of which have substantially larger operations and financial resources than us. We believe that we have a competitive advantage because we

manufacture a broad range of product lines, we are committed to product innovation and customer service, we have a strong history in and focus on professional and residential landscapes, and our distribution channels position us well to compete in various markets.
Internationally, our Residential segment products face more competition because many foreign competitors design, manufacture, and market products in their respective countries. We experience this competition primarily in Europe. In addition, fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar affect the price of our products in foreign markets, thereby impacting their competitiveness. We provide pricing support, as appropriate, to foreign customers to remain competitive in international markets.
Environmental Matters and Other Governmental Regulation
We are subject to numerous international, federal, state, and other governmental laws, rules, and regulations relating to, among others, climate change; emissions to air, including Tier 4 or similar engine emission regulations; discharges to water; restrictions placed on water usage and water availability; product and associated packaging; use of certain chemicals; restricted substances, including "conflict minerals" disclosure rules; import and export compliance, including country of origin certification requirements; worker and product user health and safety; energy efficiency; product life-cycles; outdoor noise laws; and the generation, use, handling, labeling, collection, management, storage, transportation, treatment, and disposal of hazardous substances, wastes, and other regulated materials. For example:

• | The U.S. EPA, the California Air Resources Board, and similar regulators in other U.S. states and foreign jurisdictions in which we sell our products have phased in, or are phasing in, emission regulations setting maximum emission standards for certain equipment. Specifically, these agencies from time to time adopt increasingly stringent engine emission regulations. Following the EPA implementation of Tier 4 emission requirements applicable to diesel engines several years ago, China and the European Union ("EU") also have adopted similar regulations, and similar emission regulations are also being considered in other markets in which we sell our products.


• | The U.S. federal government, several U.S. states, and certain international jurisdictions in which we sell our products, including the EU and each of its member states, have implemented one or more of the following: (i) product life-cycle laws, rules, or regulations, which are intended to reduce waste and environmental and human health impact, and require manufacturers to label, collect, dispose, and recycle certain products, including some of our products, at the end of their useful life, including the Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment directive, which mandates the labeling, collection, and disposal of specified waste electrical and electronic equipment; (ii) the Restriction on the use of Hazardous Substances directive or similar substance level laws, rules, or regulations, which


restrict the use of several specified hazardous materials in the manufacture of specific types of electrical and electronic equipment; (iii) the Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals directive or similar substance level laws, rules, or regulations that require notification of use of certain chemicals, or ban or restrict the use of certain chemicals; (iv) country of origin laws, rules, or regulations, which require certification of the geographic origin of our finished goods products and/or components used in our products through documentation and/or physical markings, as applicable; (v) energy efficiency laws, rules, or regulations, which are intended to reduce the use and inefficiencies associated with energy and natural resource consumption and require specified efficiency ratings and capabilities for certain products; (vi) outdoor noise laws, which are intended to reduce noise emissions in the environment from outdoor equipment; (vii) conflict minerals laws, such as the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and the rules promulgated by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"), which require specific procedures for the determination and disclosure of the use of certain minerals, known as "conflict minerals," which are mined from the Democratic Republic of the Congo and adjoining countries; and (viii) other product substance restriction laws, some of which require certain labeling of products, such as California Proposition 65.

• | Our products, when used by residential users, may be subject to various federal, state, and international laws, rules, and regulations that are designed to protect consumers, including rules and regulations of the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission.

Although we believe that we are in substantial compliance with currently applicable laws, rules, and regulations, we are unable to predict the ultimate impact of adopted or future laws, rules, and regulations on our business, properties or products. Such laws, rules, or regulations may cause us to incur significant expenses to achieve or maintain compliance, may require us to modify our products, may adversely affect the price of or demand for some of our products, and may ultimately affect the way we conduct our operations. Failure to comply with these current or future laws, rules, or regulations could result in harm to our reputation and/or could lead to fines and other penalties, including restrictions on the importation of our products into, or the sale of our products in, one or more jurisdictions until compliance is achieved.
We are also involved in the evaluation and environmental clean-up of a limited number of properties currently and previously owned. We do not expect that these matters will have a material adverse effect on our Consolidated Financial Position or Results of Operations.

Customer Financing Arrangements
Wholesale Financing
We are party to a joint venture with TCFIF, a subsidiary of TCF National Bank, established as Red Iron. The primary purpose of Red Iron is to provide inventory financing to certain distributors and dealers of our products in the U.S. Under a separate arrangement, TCF Commercial Finance Canada, Inc. ("TCFCFC") provides inventory financing to dealers of our products in Canada. Under these financing arrangements, down payments are not required, and depending on the finance program for each product line, finance charges are incurred by us, shared between us and the distributor and/or the dealer, or paid by the distributor or dealer. Red Iron retains a security interest in the distributors' and dealers' financed inventories, and those inventories are monitored regularly. Floor plan terms to the distributors and dealers require payment as the equipment, which secures the indebtedness, is sold to customers or when payment terms become due, whichever occurs first. Rates are generally indexed to LIBOR plus a fixed percentage that differs based on whether the financing is for a distributor or dealer. Rates may also vary based on the product that is financed.
We continue to provide financing in the form of open account terms directly to home centers and mass retailers; general line irrigation dealers; international distributors and dealers other than the Canadian distributors and dealers to whom Red Iron provides financing arrangements; ag-irrigation dealers and distributors; government customers; and rental companies. Some products sold to independent dealers in Australia are financed by a third-party finance company.
End-User Financing
We have agreements with third party financing companies to provide lease-financing options to golf course and sports fields and grounds equipment customers in the U.S, Australia, and select countries in Europe. The purpose of these agreements is to provide end-users of our products alternative financing options when purchasing our products.
We also have agreements with third party financing companies to provide financing programs under both generic and private label programs in the U.S. and Canada. These programs, offered primarily to Toro and Exmark dealers, provide end-user customers revolving and installment lines of credit for Toro and Exmark products, parts, and services.
Distributor Financing
Occasionally, we enter into long-term loan agreements with some distributors. These transactions are used for expansion of the distributors' businesses, acquisitions, refinancing working capital agreements, or ownership transitions.
Employees
During fiscal 2018, we employed an average of 6,888 employees. The total number of employees as of October 31, 2018 was 6,715. We consider our employee relations to be good. 


As of October 31, 2018, we had four collective bargaining agreements that expire in October 2019, October 2020, March 2022, and May 2022, and cover approximately 16 percent of our total employees.
