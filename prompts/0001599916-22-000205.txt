Item 1. Business.
(a) Business Development 
 The Company was originally incorporated on June 30, 2021 in the State of Nevada with the name, “Prime Time Holdings, Inc.”
 
On June 30, 2021, Jeffrey DeNunzio was appointed Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, President, Secretary, Treasurer, and Director of the Company.
 
On September 14, 2021, the Company entered into an “Agreement and Plan of Merger”, whereas it agreed to, and subsequently participated in, a Nevada holding company reorganization pursuant to NRS 92A.180, NRS 92A.200, NRS 92A.230 and NRS 92A.250 (“Reorganization”). The constituent corporations in the Reorganization were China Shouguan Investment Holding Group Corp. (“CHSO” or “Predecessor”), Sparx Holdings Group, Inc., FKA “Prime Time Holdings, Inc.” (“Successor”), and Prime Time Merger Sub, Inc. (“Merger Sub”). Our director is, and was, the sole director/officer of each constituent corporation in the Reorganization.
 
Prime Time Holdings, Inc. issued 1,000 common shares of its common stock to Predecessor and Merger Sub issued 1,000 shares of its common stock to Prime Time Holdings, Inc. immediately prior to the Reorganization. As such, immediately prior to the merger, Prime Time Holdings, Inc. became a wholly owned direct subsidiary of China Shouguan Investment Holding Group Corp and Merger Sub became a wholly owned and direct subsidiary of Prime Time Holdings, Inc.
 
Pursuant to the above, on September 15, 2021, Prime Time Holdings, Inc. filed Articles of Merger with the Nevada Secretary of State. The merger became effective on September 17, 2021 at 9:00 AM PST (“Effective Time”). At the Effective Time, Predecessor was merged with and into Merger Sub (the “Merger), and Predecessor became the surviving corporation. Each share of Predecessor common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time was converted into one validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable share of Prime Time Holdings, Inc.’s (“Successors”) common stock.
 
At the Effective Time, Prime Time Holdings, Inc., as successor issuer to China Shouguan Investment Holding Group Corp. continued to trade in the OTC MarketPlace under the previous ticker symbol “CHSO” until the new ticker symbol “PRTM” for the Company was released into the OTC MarketPlace on September 21, 2021. The Company was given a new CUSIP Number by CUSIP Global Services for its common stock of 74167E103.
 
On September 17, 2021, after the completion of the Holding Company Reorganization, we cancelled all of the stock held in China Shouguan Investment Holding Group Corp. resulting in China Shouguan Investment Holding Group Corp. as a stand-alone company.
 
The Company believes that the Reorganization, deemed effective on September 17, 2021, was not a transaction of the type described in subparagraph (a) of Rule 145 under the Securities Act of 1933 and the consummation of the Reorganization will not be deemed to involve an “offer”, “offer to sell”, “offer for sale” or “sale” within the meaning of Section 2(3) of the Securities Act of 1933. The Reorganization was consummated without the vote or consent of the Company’s stockholders. In addition, the provisions of NRS 92A.180 did not provide a stockholder of the Company with appraisal rights in connection with the Reorganization. The Company believes that in the absence of any right of any of the Company’s stockholders to vote with respect to the Reorganization or to insist that their shares be purchased for fair value, the Reorganization could not be deemed to involve an “offer” “offer to sell”; or “sale” within the meaning of Section 2(3) of the Securities Act of 1933.”
 
However, if the Company’s belief is later determined to be incorrect, whereas the Company may have been required to register the transaction under Section 5 of the Securities Act, shareholders as a result may have a right of rescission under Section 12(a)(1) of the Securities Act. Those potential consequences may have a substantive impact on our liquidity now or at any future time. The SEC could initiate proceedings against the Company and any person that sold securities in violation of Section 5 of the 1933 Securities Act. Section 5 of the Securities Act of 1933 prohibits the sale or delivery of unregistered securities unless a registration statement is in effect as to a security.
 

On May 18, 2022, Mr. Jeffrey DeNunzio resigned as the Company’s Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, President, Secretary, and Treasurer. He remains a Director of the Company.
 
The resignations of Mr. Jeffrey DeNunzio were not the result of any disagreement with the Company on any matter relating to its operations, policies, or practices. There is no arrangement or understanding among the newly appointed officers and directors or any other person pursuant to which they were appointed as a director and officer of the Company.
On May 18, 2022 Ms. Cassandra DeNunzio was appointed as the Company’s Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, President, Secretary, Treasurer, and Director.
 
Following the appointments of Ms. Cassandra DeNunzio, the Company seeks to explore business opportunities in the area of fire suppression technologies including but not limited to licensing agreement(s), merger(s), acquisition(s), or business combination transactions after which the Company would cease to be a "shell" company. 
 
Our Common Stock is quoted on the OTC Markets Group Inc.’s Pink® Open Market under the symbol “PRTM”.
 
Our majority shareholder, NVC Holdings, LLC, a Wyoming Limited Liability Company, and our Directors, Mr. Jeffrey DeNunzio and Ms. Cassandra DeNunzio, executed a resolution to ratify, affirm, and approve a name change from Prime Time Holdings, Inc. to Sparx Holdings Group, Inc. The aforementioned parties also approved, via the same resolution, to change the Company’s ticker symbol and the authorized shares of Common Stock of the Company from 200,000,000 to 500,000,000.
 
A Certificate of Amendment to change our name and our authorized shares of Common Stock was filed with the Nevada Secretary of State on July 19, 2022, effective immediately.
 
On or about July 22, 2022 the Company initiated a FINRA corporate action to effectuate the aforementioned name change from Prime Time Holdings, Inc. to Sparx Holdings Group, Inc., and to change our ticker symbol. This corporate action is pending.
 
We do not yet know what the Company’s ticker symbol will be changed to, and the ticker symbol chosen will be dependent on current availability and FINRA approval.
 
The legal date of our name change, July 19, 2022 will differ from the market release date when posted on FINRA’s daily list. A Form 8-K will be filed with the Commission after completion of our FINRA corporate action.
 
Currently, NVC Holdings, LLC, a Wyoming LLC owned and controlled by Jeffrey DeNunzio and Thomas DeNunzio is our controlling shareholder, owning 150,000,000 common shares.
 
The Company has been and remains engaged in organizational efforts and obtaining initial financing.
 
The Company has elected June 30th as its year end.

We use home office space of our directors at no cost.
 
The Company is an “emerging growth company” (“EGC”), that is exempt from certain financial disclosure and governance requirements for up to five years as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act (the JOBS Act), that eases restrictions on the sale of securities; and increases the number of shareholders a company must have before becoming subject to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commissions (SEC’s) reporting and disclosure rules (See Emerging Growth Companies Section Below).
 
(b) Business Summary
 
Under SEC Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act, the Company qualifies as a shell company, because it has no or nominal assets (other than cash) and no or nominal operations. Many states have enacted statutes, rules and regulations limiting the sale of securities of "blank check" companies in their respective jurisdictions. Management does not intend to undertake any efforts to cause a market to develop in our securities, either debt or equity.
 
The Company intends to comply with the periodic reporting requirements of the Exchange Act for so long as it is subject to those requirements.
 
The Company seeks to explore business opportunities in the area of fire suppression technologies. This may be in the form of licensing agreement(s), merger(s), acquisition(s), or business combination transactions after which the Company would cease to be a “shell” company. 
 
Currently, the Company is in tentative discussions to enter into a patent licensing agreement with Sparx Technologies, LLC, a Wyoming Limited Liability Company, referred to herein as, “Sparx”, whereas Sparx would license various patented technology to the Company in exchange for some type of consideration, whether it be shares, cash, or some combination of the two. Discussions by and between the Company and Sparx are ongoing, and may not come to fruition. There is no guarantee that the Company and Sparx will enter into a business combination, an arrangement, or an agreement of any kind.
 
Sparx Technologies, LLC may be deemed to be a related party, as it is owned and controlled by our Chief Executive Officer and Director Cassandra DeNunzio.
 
Sparx Technologies, LLC (Sparx) is a technology company registered in the state of Wyoming, headquartered in Cranston, Rhode Island with a mission to provide fire protection to businesses and building owners that operate within infrastructures that cannot be reasonably protected by traditional fire sprinklers.
 
Sparx intends to pioneer the fire protection industry with a commercially available wireless electronic fire sprinkler network and develop the industry’s first commercially available wireless electronic fire sprinkler system that can be adaptable for a variety of different applications and customers.
 
Sparx has a provisional patent filed with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) on January 28, 2022 under United States Provisional Patent Application Serial No. 63/304,302 intended to protect Sparx’s battery-powered wireless fire sprinkler technology. Sparx relies on a combination of patent, trademark, copyright, trade secret, and contractual protections to establish and protect its intellectual proprietary rights.


As mentioned previously, there is no guarantee that the current discussions between the Company and Sparx will lead to any material contracts, arrangements, business combinations, or any other type of agreement. Should discussions between the two parties terminate, or not lead to anything material, the Company will need to continue to explore other business opportunities in the fire protection industry. 
 
The analysis of new business opportunities will be undertaken by, or under the supervision of Cassandra DeNunzio, our Chief Executive Officer and Director. As of this date, the Company has not entered into any definitive agreement(s) with any party.
 
The Registrant has unrestricted flexibility in seeking, analyzing and participating in potential business opportunities. In its efforts to analyze potential acquisition targets or business opportunities, the Registrant will consider the following kinds of factors:
 

(a) | Potential for growth, indicated by new technology, anticipated market expansion or new products;
----+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(b) | Competitive position as compared to other firms of similar size and experience within the industry segment as well as within the industry as a whole;
----+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(c) | Strength and diversity of management, either in place or scheduled for recruitment;
----+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(d) | Capital requirements and anticipated availability of required funds, to be provided by the Registrant or from operations, through the sale of additional securities, through joint ventures or similar arrangements or from other sources;
----+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(e) | The cost of participation by the Registrant as compared to the perceived tangible and intangible values and potentials;
----+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(f) | The extent to which the business opportunity can be advanced;
----+--------------------------------------------------------------


(g) | The accessibility of required management expertise, personnel, raw materials, services, professional assistance and other required items; and,
----+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(h) | Other relevant factors.
----+------------------------

 
In applying the foregoing criteria, no one of which will be controlling, management will attempt to analyze all factors and circumstances and make a determination based upon reasonable investigative measures and available data. Potentially available business opportunities may occur at various stages of development, all of which will make the task of comparative investigation and analysis of such business opportunities extremely difficult and complex. Due to the Registrant's limited capital available for investigation, the Registrant may not discover or adequately evaluate adverse facts about the opportunity to be acquired.

Additionally, Sparx Holdings Group, Inc. will continue to be an insignificant participant in the business of seeking business opportunities with other entities. A large number of established and well-financed entities, including venture capital firms, are active in this space and have significantly greater financial resources, technical expertise and managerial capabilities than Sparx Holdings Group, Inc. and, consequently, we will be at a competitive disadvantage in identifying possible business opportunities and successfully completing a business combination. Moreover, Sparx Holdings Group, Inc. will also compete with numerous other small public companies in seeking such opportunities.
 
(c) Reports to security holders.
 

(1) | The Company is not required to deliver an annual report to security holders and at this time does not anticipate the distribution of such a report.
----+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(2) | The Company will file reports with the SEC. The Company will be a reporting company and will comply with the requirements of the Exchange Act.
----+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(3) | The public may read and copy any materials the Company files with the SEC in the SEC's Public Reference Section, Room 1580, 100 F Street N.E., Washington, D.C. 20549. The public may obtain information on the operation of the Public Reference Section by calling the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330. Additionally, the SEC maintains an Internet site that contains reports, proxy and information statements, and other information regarding issuers that file electronically with the SEC, which can be found at http://www.sec.gov.

Information Regarding our Shell Status


Security holders who received securities from us when we became a shell company are considered underwriters in connection with any resale of those securities until one year from the date Form 10 information has publicly filed, as specified in Rule 144(i). Shares of our common stock which are not registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission, but are currently held by shareholders, cannot be sold under the exemptions from registration provided by Rule 144 under or Section 4(1) of the Securities Act (“Rule 144”) so long as the Company is designated a “shell company” and for 12 months after it ceases to be a “shell company,” provided the Company otherwise is in compliance with the applicable rules and regulations. Compliance with the criteria for securing exemptions under federal securities laws and the securities laws of the various states is extremely complex, especially in respect of those exemptions affording flexibility and the elimination of trading restrictions in respect of securities received in exempt transactions and subsequently disposed of without registration under the Securities Act or state securities laws. 
Emerging Growth Company
 
We are an emerging growth company under the JOBS Act. We shall continue to be deemed an emerging growth company until the earliest of:
 

(a) the last day of the fiscal year of the issuer during which it had total annual gross revenues of $1,070,000,000 (as such amount is indexed for inflation every 5 years by the Commission to reflect the change in the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, setting the threshold to the nearest 1,000,000) or more;
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(b) the last day of the fiscal year of the issuer following the fifth anniversary of the date of the first sale of common equity securities of the issuer pursuant to an effective IPO registration statement; 
(c) the date on which such issuer has, during the previous 3-year period, issued more than $1,000,000,000 in non-convertible debt; or 
(d) the date on which such issuer is deemed to be a large accelerated filer, as defined in section 240.12b-2 of title 17, Code of Federal Regulations, or any successor thereto. 

 
As an emerging growth company, we are exempt from Section 404(b) of Sarbanes Oxley. Section 404(a) requires Issuers to publish information in their annual reports concerning the scope and adequacy of the internal control structure and procedures for financial reporting. This statement shall also assess the effectiveness of such internal controls and procedures. Section 404(b) requires that the registered accounting firm shall, in the same report, attest to and report on the assessment on the effectiveness of the internal control structure and procedures for financial reporting.
 
As an emerging growth company, we are also exempt from Section 14A (a) and (b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 which require the shareholder approval of executive compensation and golden parachutes.
 
We have elected to use the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards under Section 102(b)(2) of the Jobs Act, that allows us to delay the adoption of new or revised accounting standards that have different effective dates for public and private companies until those standards apply to private companies. As a result of this election, our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with public company effective dates.
