ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview

Our company was incorporated in the State of Nevada on October 24, 2012. Founded in Calgary, Canada, we were formed and organized to capitalize on new opportunities found in the North American market for light-emitting diode (“LED”) lighting. With China as the manufacturing backbone of future LED products, we have set up an office in Guangzhou, China in search of high quality products offered by reputable manufacturers to be introduced to Canada, the United States, and abroad. In November 2016, we expanded our operations to include reselling various energy products and green technology products. We achieved this by acquiring Energy Alliance Labs Inc. (“Energy Alliance”), which is the 80% owner of Human Energy Alliance Laboratories Corp., an Idaho corporation (“HEAL”). HEAL is a “green technology” and retail company with the mission of developing and distributing technologies that relieve its customers of certain burdens, while simultaneously decreasing the energy they use. HEAL’s primary products are mid-sized wind turbines, small solar panels and related controllers and inverters.

On October 28, 2016, we entered into a share exchange agreement with Cohen Mizrahi, a director of our company, whereby on the same date we issued 4,000,000 shares of our common stock in exchange for 100% of the issued and outstanding equity interests of Energy Alliance.

On November 1, 2016, Energy Alliance closed the transactions contemplated under an agreement with certain shareholders of HEAL, in which the shareholders holding 80% of the outstanding equity interests of HEAL sold all of their shares of HEAL to Energy Alliance.

As a result of such transactions we became the owner of 100% of the issued and outstanding equity interests of Energy Alliance and Energy Alliance became the owner of 80% of the issued and outstanding equity interests of HEAL.

Effective October 4, 2016, we filed a Certificate of Dissolution of MJP Holdings Ltd., our wholly-owned subsidiary.

Effective November 28, 2016, we entered into a Share Exchange Agreement with MJP Lighting Solutions Ltd., a British Virgin Islands (“BVI”) corporation and Tong Tang and Zhao Hui Ma (the “Shareholders”) whereby the parties exchanged 100% of the issued and outstanding shares of BVI, belonging to our company for the tender of 5,500,000 restricted common shares of our company, belonging to the Shareholders, to our treasury for cancellation.

On January 1, 2017, MJP entered into transfer agreement with Cohen Mizrahi, whereby we transferred 100% of the issued and outstanding equity interests of Energy Alliance for consideration of $20,000 for past services provided to our company by Mr. Guo.

Our Current Business

We are a medical device company that intends to develop the first automated treatment for age spots (solar lentigines). The technology (patent issued) uses a “scan and treat” protocol that removes age spots accurately and completely without disturbing the surrounding skin area. Current methods of treatment (lasers and manual liquid nitrogen spray devices) are either painful, costly, or require a physician to perform the procedure. The Bionovate system would be safe and would produce excellent results and can be used for other types of skin lesions. Its operation would require minimal user interaction and users can be trained in minutes. We are also looking into developing novel cancer detection methods based on its electronic imaging patent.
Principal Products and Services

The Bionovate system is superior to the current methods. It is safer, quicker and easier-to-use and provides better results with minimal patient recovery time. The first product will be an automated computerized system that treats age spots anywhere on the body. The platform technology will allow subsequent systems to treat other types of skin lesions on all areas of the body. Each age spot will be treated in just a few seconds and the entire treatment requires less than fifteen minutes. Training and operation will be easy and straightforward. The energy source, cryogen, is well understood and the “pre-determined treatment protocols” allow for unrivaled safety, efficacy, and minimal (if any) pain.
Distribution Methods

The company expects to sell its systems to physicians and spas across the globe. The cost of the system includes a modest initial outlay for the device and a charge for a proprietary disposable for each treatment. Bionovate’s pricing for the device and disposable provides physician offices and spas with revenue and margins that exceed their business target ROI. The treatments are private-pay which avoids the insurance reimbursement and paperwork cycle and provides new direct revenue to physicians. In addition, the Company’s pricing structure allows physicians to present affordable pricing to patients. The simplicity of the system should allow non-physicians to act as operators freeing up the physician to conduct other revenue producing activities.
Competition

Current market offerings in the segment of age spots treatment are limited to lasers and manual cryo which are painful, carry a high cost and require expertise. In the case of manual cryo, there are too many variables and uncertain effectiveness as well as long healing times.
Dependence on One or a Few Major Customers

We have not yet established a customer base, but we expect to be able to not depend on a single distributor or customer.

Patents, trademarks, licenses, franchises, concessions, royalty agreements or labor contracts

We currently own two patents: U.S. Patent No. 6,858,007 "Method and system for automatic classification and quantitative evaluation of adnexal masses based on a cross-sectional or projectional images of the adnexs and U.S. Patent No. 7,963,959 “Automated Cryogenic Skin Treatment”.
Need for Government Approval

Medical devices regulation is set by the FDA. In the case of the technologies we are looking to develop, we would need FDA 510(k) Class II approval.
Compliance with Government Regulation

There is a long history of the FDA approving such medical devices. The clearance review cycle is 90 days and we expect to be able to pass clinical testing cost-effectively.
