  Overview
  
 Unless the context otherwise requires, all references in this report to the “Company,” “Yuma,” “our,” “us,” and “we” refer to Yuma Energy, Inc., a Delaware corporation, and its subsidiaries, as a common entity. Unless otherwise noted, all information in this report relating to oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids reserves and the estimated future net cash flows attributable to those reserves are based on estimates prepared by independent reserve engineers and are net to our interest. We have referenced certain technical terms important to an understanding of our business under the Glossary of Selected Oil and Natural Gas Terms section above. Throughout this report, we make statements that may be classified as “forward-looking.” Please refer to the Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements section above for an explanation of these types of statements.
  
 Yuma Energy, Inc., a Delaware corporation, is an independent Houston-based exploration and production company focused on acquiring, developing and exploring for conventional and unconventional oil and natural gas resources. Historically, our operations have focused on onshore properties located in central and southern Louisiana and southeastern Texas where we have a long history of drilling, developing and producing both oil and natural gas assets. Finally, we have operated positions in Kern County, California, and non-operated positions in the East Texas Woodbine. Our common stock is listed on the NYSE American under the trading symbol “YUMA.”
  
  Recent Developments
  
  Senior Credit Agreement and Going Concern
  
 The factors and uncertainties described below, as well as other factors which include, but are not limited to, declines in our production, our failure to establish commercial production on our Permian properties, and our substantial working capital deficit of approximately $37.0 million, raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. The Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared on a going concern basis of accounting, which contemplates continuity of operations, realization of assets, and satisfaction of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business. The Consolidated Financial Statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of the going concern uncertainty.
  
 On October 26, 2016, the Company and three of its subsidiaries, as the co-borrowers, entered into a credit agreement providing for a $75.0 million three-year senior secured revolving credit facility (the “Credit Agreement”) with Société Générale (“SocGen”), as administrative agent, SG Americas Securities, LLC, as lead arranger and bookrunner, and the lenders signatory thereto (collectively with SocGen, the “Lender”).
  
 The borrowing base of the credit facility was $34.0 million as of December 31, 2018, and the Company was and is fully drawn under the credit facility leaving no availability on the line of credit. All of the obligations under the Credit Agreement, and the guarantees of those obligations, are secured by substantially all of our assets.
  
 The Credit Agreement contains a number of covenants that, among other things, restrict, subject to certain exceptions, our ability to incur additional indebtedness, create liens on assets, make investments, enter into sale and leaseback transactions, pay dividends and distributions or repurchase our capital stock, engage in mergers or consolidations, sell certain assets, sell or discount any notes receivable or accounts receivable, and engage in certain transactions with affiliates.
  
 In addition, the Credit Agreement requires us to maintain the following financial covenants: a current ratio of not less than 1.0 to 1.0 on the last day of each quarter, a ratio of total debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, depletion, amortization and exploration expenses (“EBITDAX”) ratio of not greater than 3.5 to 1.0 for the four fiscal quarters ending on the last day of the fiscal quarter immediately preceding such date of determination, and a ratio of EBITDAX to interest expense of not less than 2.75 to 1.0 for the four fiscal quarters ending on the last day of the fiscal quarter immediately preceding such date of determination, and cash and cash equivalent investments together with borrowing availability under the Credit Agreement of at least $4.0 million. The Credit Agreement contains customary affirmative covenants and defines events of default for credit facilities of this type, including failure to pay principal or interest, breach of covenants, breach of representations and warranties, insolvency, judgment default, and a change of control. Upon the occurrence and continuance of an event of default, the Lender has the right to accelerate repayment of the loans and exercise its remedies with respect to the collateral.

 At December 31, 2018, we were not in compliance under the credit facility with our (i) total debt to EBITDAX covenant for the trailing four quarter period, (ii) current ratio covenant, (iii) EBITDAX to interest expense covenant for the trailing four quarter period, (iv) the liquidity covenant requiring us to maintain unrestricted cash and borrowing base availability of at least $4.0 million, and (v) obligation to make an interest only payment for the quarter ended December 31, 2018. In addition, we currently are not making payments of interest under the credit facility and anticipate future non-compliance under the credit facility going forward. Due to this non-compliance, as well as the credit facility maturity in 2019, we classified our entire bank debt as a current liability in our financial statements as of December 31, 2018. On October 9, 2018, we received a notice and reservation of rights from the administrative agent under the Credit Agreement advising that an event of default has occurred and continues to exist by reason of our noncompliance with the liquidity covenant requiring us to maintain cash and cash equivalents and borrowing base availability of at least $4.0 million. As a result of the default, the Lender may accelerate the outstanding balance under the Credit Agreement, increase the applicable interest rate by 2.0% per annum or commence foreclosure on the collateral securing the loans. As of the date of this report, the Lender has not accelerated the outstanding amount due and payable on the loans, increased the applicable interest rate or commenced foreclosure proceedings, but may exercise one or more of these remedies in the future. We have commenced discussions with the Lender concerning a forbearance agreement or waiver of the event of default; however, there can be no assurance that the Lender and us will come to any agreement regarding a forbearance or waiver of the event of default. As required under the Credit Agreement, we previously entered into hedging arrangements with SocGen and BP Energy Company (“BP”) pursuant to International Swaps and Derivatives Association Master Agreements (“ISDA Agreements”). On March 14, 2019, we received a notice of an event of default under our ISDA Agreement with SocGen (the “SocGen ISDA”). Due to the default under the ISDA Agreement, SocGen unwound all of our hedges with them. The notice provides for a payment of approximately $347,129 to settle our outstanding obligations thereunder related to SocGen’s hedges. On March 19, 2019, we received a notice of an event of default under our ISDA Agreement with BP (the “BP ISDA”). Due to the default under the ISDA Agreement, BP also unwound all of our hedges with them. The notice provides for a payment of approximately $775,725 to settle our outstanding obligations thereunder related to BP’s hedges.
    
  Sale of Certain Non-Core Oil and Gas Properties
  
 On August 20, 2018, we sold our 3.1% leasehold interest consisting of 9.8 net acres in one section in Eddy County, New Mexico for $127,400. On October 23, 2018, we sold substantially all of our Bakken assets in North Dakota for approximately $1.16 million in gross proceeds and the buyer’s assumption of certain plugging and abandonment liabilities of approximately $15,200. The Bakken assets represented approximately 12 barrels of oil equivalent per day of our production in the third quarter of 2018. On October 24, 2018, we sold certain deep rights in undeveloped acreage located in Grady County, Oklahoma for approximately $120,000. Proceeds of $1.0 million from these non-core asset sales were applied to the repayment of borrowings under the credit facility in October 2018.
  
  Recent Entry into PSA on our California Properties
  
 An Asset Purchase and Sale Agreement dated March 21, 2019, was executed on behalf of Pyramid Oil, LLC and Yuma Energy, Inc. (Sellers) and an undisclosed buyer (Buyer) covering the sale of all of Seller’s assets in Kern County, California. The purchase price for the sale is $2.1 million and the effective date is April 1, 2019. The parties expect to close the transaction by April 26, 2019. As additional consideration for the sale of the assets, if WTI Index for oil equals or exceeds $65 in six months following closing and maintains that average for twelve consecutive months then Buyer shall pay to the seller $250,000. Upon closing, we anticipate that the proceeds will be applied to the repayment of borrowings under the credit facility and/or working capital; however, there can be no assurance that the transaction will close.
  
  Preferred Stock
  
 As of December 31, 2018, we had 2,041,240 shares of our Series D preferred stock outstanding with an aggregate liquidation preference of approximately $22.6 million and a conversion price of $6.5838109 per share. The conversion price was adjusted from $11.0741176 per share to $6.5838109 per share as a result of our common stock offering that closed in October 2017. As a result, if all of our outstanding shares of Series D preferred stock were converted into common stock, we would need to issue approximately 3.4 million shares of common stock. The Series D preferred stock is paid dividends in the form of additional shares of Series D preferred stock at a rate of 7% per annum.

  Operating Outlook
  
 Recognizing the volatility in oil and natural gas prices, we plan to continue a disciplined approach in 2019 by emphasizing liquidity and value, enhancing operational efficiencies, and managing expenses. We will continue to evaluate the oil and natural gas price environments and may adjust our capital spending plans, capital raising activities, and strategic alternatives (including possible asset sales) to maintain appropriate liquidity and financial flexibility to the extent that we can.
 Business Strategy
 
 Due to our lack of liquidity, as well as the continued volatile commodity price environment, we expect our capital spending plans to be limited in 2019 without the successful completion of a strategic alternative that improves the liquidity of the Company. In addition, we may slow down or forego the development of our properties to more closely manage our cash flows. We will be focused on lower risk and lower cost opportunities to maintain or minimize our declines in production and cash flow.
 
 The key elements of our business strategy are:
  
   ➢
 seek merger, acquisition, and joint venture opportunities to increase our liquidity, as well as reduce our G&A on a per Boe basis;

 
   ➢
 transition existing inventory of non-producing reserves into oil and natural gas production.

 
  Description of Major Properties
  
 We are the operator of properties containing approximately 65.6% of our proved oil and natural gas reserves as of December 31, 2018. As operator, we are able to directly influence exploration, development and production operations.
  
 As is common in the industry, we participate in non-operated properties and investments on a selective basis; our non-operating participation decisions are dependent on the technical and economic nature of the projects and the operating expertise and financial standing of the operators. The following is a description of our significant oil and natural gas properties.
  
  South Louisiana
  
 We have operated and non-operated assets in many of the prolific oil and natural gas producing parishes of south Louisiana including Cameron, LaFourche, Livingston, St. Helena, St. Bernard, and Vermilion parishes. As of December 31, 2018, we had working interests in nine fields in south Louisiana, of which we operate six with an average operated working interest of 65.7%. The acreage associated with these leasehold positions is comprised of 18,536 gross acres and 3,172 net acres. The associated assets produce from a variety of conventional formations with oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids from depths of approximately 5,500 feet to almost 19,000 feet. The formations include the Lower Miocene, CibCarst, Dibert, Wilcox, Marg Tex, Het 1A, Tuscaloosa, Miocene Siphonina and Lower Planulina Cris R sands. The collective net production from this area averaged approximately 355 Bbl/d of oil, 5.5 MMcf/d of natural gas and 234 Bbl/d of natural gas liquids during the year ended December 31, 2018. The Chandeleur Sound Blk 71, State Lease 18194 #1 well located at our Main Pass 4 facility was shut in on February 27, 2019.  Prior to the well being shut in, it was producing approximately 20 net BOE/d. We are evaluating workover options to restore the well to production. Preliminary estimates to reestablish production for this well are estimated at a net cost of $300,000 to $400,000.
  
 Our two largest fields in south Louisiana, based on estimated proved reserve value, are described below.
  
 Lac Blanc Field, Vermilion Parish, Louisiana – We are the operator of the Lac Blanc Field where we have an average working interest of 81.3%. The field is comprised of 1,744 gross acres and 1,090 net acres where two wells, the SL 18090 #1 and #2, are producing from the Miocene Siphonina D-1 sand (18,700 feet sand). The net production from the field averaged approximately 64 Bbl/d of oil, 2.8 MMcf/d of natural gas and 156 Bbl/d of natural gas liquids during the year ended December 31, 2018.

 The Lac Blanc LP#2 went off production on February 4, 2019.  Prior to going off-line, this well was producing approximately 995 net Mcf/d, or $150,000 per month in cash flow. We are reviewing options to put this well back online, but given our preliminary evaluation of the well, it is likely that costs could be significant, and due to our limited liquidity and the economics associated with the workover, there is no assurance we can fund the work. We will produce the well intermittently at a rate estimated to be less than 20% of the prior rate. The LP #1 and #2 are in the same reservoir so total reserves recovered from both wells are not expected to be materially impacted, but due to the disparate working interest (LP #1 and #2 of 62.5% and 100%, respectively) our net reserves would decrease should the LP #2 well not be put back into service.  In addition, our cash flows will be similarly impacted by this decreased production from the LP #2 well.
  
 Bayou Hebert Field, Vermilion Parish, Louisiana – We have a 12.5% non-operated working interest in the Bayou Hebert Field, which is comprised of approximately 1,600 gross acres and 200 net acres with three wells completed in the Lower Planulina Cris R sands.  Two of the three wells are currently shut in. The net production from the field averaged approximately 39 Bbl/d of oil, 1.8 MMcf/d of natural gas and 76 Bbl/d of natural gas liquids during the year ended December 31, 2018. The one producing well in the Bayou Herbert Field is currently producing at a reduced rate of 375 Mcf/d net while the operator is repairing the SWD pumps. We expect the production to be restored to approximately 895 to 1,345 Mcf/d net in the second quarter of 2019.
  
  Southeast Texas
  
 We have operated and non-operated properties in southeast Texas containing both conventional and unconventional properties located in Jefferson and Madison counties. As of December 31, 2018, we had working interests in two fields, one of which we are the operator, with a working interest of 47.4%. The average working interest in the non-operated field was approximately 23.0%. The acreage associated with these leasehold positions consist of 24,444 gross acres and 591 net acres. The unconventional assets are developed primarily with horizontal wells in tight Woodbine sands producing oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids from depths of approximately 8,000 feet to 9,000 feet. Typical development wells are drilled horizontally with lateral sections ranging from approximately 4,500 feet to 7,500 feet in length where multi-stage fracturing technology is employed. The collective net production from this area averaged approximately 26 Bbl/d of oil, 230 Mcf/d of natural gas and 40 Bbl/d of natural gas liquids during the year ended December 31, 2018.
 California
  
 We have assets in Kern County, California. As of December 31, 2018, we have a 100% working interest in five conventional fields with a leasehold position comprised of 1,192 gross acres inclusive of 263 fee or minerals only acres. These properties produce oil from a variety of conventional formations including the Pliocene, Miocene, Oligocene, and Eocene from depths ranging from approximately 800 feet to 6,300 feet. For the year ended December 31, 2018, net production from our California assets averaged approximately 78 Bbls/d of oil. On March 21, 2019, we entered into an Asset Purchase and Sale Agreement covering the sale of all of our assets in Kern County, California for $2.1 million, with an effective date of April 1, 2019. We expect to close the transaction by April 26, 2019.
 Permian Basin
  
 In 2017, we entered the Permian Basin through a joint venture with two privately held energy companies and established an AMI covering approximately 33,280 acres in Yoakum County, Texas, located in the Northwest Shelf of the Permian Basin. The primary target within the AMI is the San Andres formation. As of March 1, 2019, we held a 62.5% working interest in approximately 3,192 gross acres (1,995 net acres) within the AMI. We are the operator of the joint venture. In December 2017, we sold a 12.5% working interest in ten sections of the project on a promoted basis and sold an additional 12.5% working interest in the same ten sections under the same terms in January 2018. On November 8, 2017, we spudded a salt water disposal well, the Jameson SWD #1, and completed the well on December 8, 2017. The rig was then moved to our State 320 #1H horizontal San Andres well, which we spudded on December 13, 2017. The State 320 #1H well reached total depth on January 2, 2018, and was subsequently completed, fraced and placed on production on March 1, 2018. The well failed to establish commercial production and is currently shut in pending evaluation of the commerciality of the prospect area. Given the poor well performance and our limited liquidity, the ability to establish commercial production in the prospect area is uncertain at this time.

  Oil and Natural Gas Reserves
  
 All of our oil and natural gas reserves are located in the United States. Unaudited information concerning the estimated net quantities of all of our proved reserves and the standardized measure of future net cash flows from the reserves is presented in Note 24 – Supplementary Information on Oil and Natural Gas Exploration, Development and Production Activities (Unaudited) in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 in this report. The reserve estimates have been prepared by Netherland, Sewell & Associates, Inc. (“NSAI”), an independent petroleum engineering firm. We have no long-term supply or similar agreements with foreign governments or authorities. We did not provide any reserve information to any federal agencies in 2018 other than to the SEC and the Department of Energy.
 Estimated Proved Reserves
  
 The table below summarizes our estimated proved reserves at December 31, 2018 based on reports prepared by NSAI. In preparing these reports, NSAI evaluated 100% of our properties at December 31, 2018. For more information regarding our independent reserve engineers, please see Independent Reserve Engineers below. The information in the following table does not give any effect to or reflect our commodity derivatives.

 Barrels of oil equivalent have been calculated on the basis of six thousand cubic feet (Mcf) of natural gas equal to one barrel of oil equivalent (Boe).

 
  (2)            
 Present Value Discounted at 10% (“PV10”) is a Non-GAAP measure that differs from the GAAP measure “standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows” in that PV10 is calculated without regard to future income taxes. Management believes that the presentation of the PV10 value is relevant and useful to investors because it presents the estimated discounted future net cash flows attributable to our estimated proved reserves independent of our income tax attributes, thereby isolating the intrinsic value of the estimated future cash flows attributable to our reserves. Because many factors that are unique to each individual company impact the amount of future income taxes to be paid, we believe the use of a pre-tax measure provides greater comparability of assets when evaluating companies. For these reasons, management uses, and believes the industry generally uses, the PV10 measure in evaluating and comparing acquisition candidates and assessing the potential return on investment related to investments in oil and natural gas properties. PV10 includes estimated abandonment costs less salvage. PV10 does not necessarily represent the fair market value of oil and natural gas properties.


 PV10 is not a measure of financial or operational performance under GAAP, nor should it be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows as defined under GAAP. For a presentation of the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows, see Note 24 – Supplementary Information on Oil and Natural Gas Exploration, Development and Production Activities (Unaudited) in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 in this report. The table below titled “Non-GAAP Reconciliation” provides a reconciliation of PV10 to the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows.

 Proved reserves were calculated using prices equal to the twelve-month unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month prices for each of the preceding twelve months, which were $65.56 per Bbl (WTI) and $3.10 per MMBtu (HH), for the year ended December 31, 2018. Adjustments were made for location and grade.

 
  (4)            
 Our Lac Blanc Field and Bayou Hebert Field were our only fields that each contained 15% or more of our estimated proved reserves as of December 31, 2018.

 
  Proved Undeveloped Reserves
  
 At December 31, 2018, we had no proved undeveloped (“PUD”) reserves. The following table details the changes in PUD reserves for the year ended December 31, 2018 (in MBoe):

Proved undeveloped reserves at December 31, 2018 | - 


 
 From January 1, 2018 to December 31, 2018, our PUD reserves decreased 1,295 MBoe, or 100%, from 1,295 MBoe to -0- MBoe, primarily due to our decision to write off our PUD reserves as a result of our liquidity and the uncertainty of our ability to fund their future development.
  
 Uncertainties are inherent in estimating quantities of proved reserves, including many risk factors beyond our control. Reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating subsurface accumulations of oil and natural gas that cannot be measured in an exact manner, and the accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data and the interpretation thereof. As a result, estimates by different engineers often vary, sometimes significantly. In addition, physical factors such as the results of drilling, testing and production subsequent to the date of the estimates, as well as economic factors such as change in product prices, may require revision of such estimates. Accordingly, oil and natural gas quantities ultimately recovered will vary from reserve estimates.
  
  Technology Used to Establish Estimates of Proved Reserves
  
 Under SEC rules, proved reserves are those quantities of oil and natural gas that by analysis of geoscience and engineering data can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward from known reservoirs, under existing economic conditions, operating methods and government regulations. The term “reasonable certainty” implies a high degree of confidence that the quantities of oil and natural gas actually recovered will equal or exceed the estimate. Reasonable certainty can be established using techniques that have been proven effective by actual production from projects in the same reservoir or an analogous reservoir or by other evidence using reliable technology that establishes reasonable certainty. Reliable technology is a grouping of one or more technologies (including computational methods) that has been field tested and has been demonstrated to provide reasonably certain results with consistency and repeatability in the formation being evaluated or in an analogous formation.

 To establish reasonable certainty with respect to our estimated proved reserves, NSAI employed technologies that have been demonstrated to yield results with consistency and repeatability. The technologies and economic data used in the estimation of our reserves include, but are not limited to, electrical logs, radioactivity logs, core analyses, geologic maps and available downhole and production data, seismic data and well test data. Reserves attributable to producing wells with sufficient production history were estimated using appropriate decline curves or other performance relationships. Reserves attributable to producing wells with limited production history and for undeveloped locations were estimated using both volumetric estimates and performance from analogous wells in the surrounding area. These wells were considered to be analogous based on production performance from the same formation and completion using similar techniques.
  
  Independent Reserve Engineers
  
 We engaged NSAI to prepare our annual reserve estimates and have relied on NSAI’s expertise to ensure that our reserve estimates are prepared in compliance with SEC guidelines. NSAI was founded in 1961 and performs consulting petroleum engineering services under Texas Board of Professional Engineers Registration No. F-2699. Within NSAI, the technical persons primarily responsible for preparing the estimates set forth in the NSAI reserves report incorporated herein are G. Lance Binder and Philip R. Hodgson. Mr. Binder has been practicing consulting petroleum engineering at NSAI since 1983. Mr. Binder is a Registered Professional Engineer in the State of Texas (No. 61794) and has over 30 years of practical experience in petroleum engineering, with over 30 years of experience in the estimation and evaluation of reserves. He graduated from Purdue University in 1978 with a Bachelor of Science degree in Chemical Engineering. Mr. Hodgson has been practicing consulting petroleum geology at NSAI since 1998. Mr. Hodgson is a Licensed Professional Geoscientist in the State of Texas, Geology (No. 1314) and has over 30 years of practical experience in petroleum geosciences. He graduated from University of Illinois in 1982 with a Bachelor of Science Degree in Geology and from Purdue University in 1984 with a Master of Science Degree in Geophysics. Both technical principals meet or exceed the education, training, and experience requirements set forth in the Standards Pertaining to the Estimating and Auditing of Oil and Gas Reserves Information promulgated by the Society of Petroleum Engineers; both are proficient in judiciously applying industry standard practices to engineering and geoscience evaluations as well as applying SEC and other industry reserves definitions and guidelines.
  
  Our Vice President – Evaluations and Engineering was the person primarily responsible for overseeing the preparation of our internal reserve estimates and for overseeing the independent petroleum engineering firm during the preparation of our reserve report. He has a Bachelor of Science degree in Petroleum Engineering and over 12 years of industry experience, with 9 years or more of experience working as a reservoir engineer, senior reservoir engineering, team lead senior reservoir engineering and vice president of reservoir engineering. His professional qualifications meet or exceed the qualifications of reserve estimators and auditors set forth in the “Standards Pertaining to Estimation and Auditing of Oil and Gas Reserves Information” promulgated by the Society of Petroleum Engineers The Vice President – Evaluations and Engineering reports directly to our Interim Chief Executive Officer.
  
  Internal Control over Preparation of Reserve Estimates
  
 The design of our internal controls over our reserve estimation process was not effective as of December 31, 2018. The primary inputs to the reserve estimation process are technical information, financial data, ownership interest and production data. The relevant field and reservoir technical information, which are reviewed quarterly and are updated at least annually, is assessed for validity when our independent petroleum engineering firm has technical meetings with our engineers, geologists, and operations and land personnel. Current revenue and expense information is obtained from our accounting records, which are subject to external quarterly reviews, annual audits and our own set of internal controls over financial reporting. All current financial data such as commodity prices, lease operating expenses, production taxes and field-level commodity price differentials are updated in the reserve database and then analyzed to ensure that they have been entered accurately and that all updates are complete. Our current ownership in mineral interests and well production data are also subject to our internal controls over financial reporting, and they are incorporated in our reserve database as well and verified internally by us to ensure their accuracy and completeness. Once the reserve database has been updated with current information, and the relevant technical support material has been assembled, our independent engineering firm meets with our technical personnel to review field performance and future development plans in order to further verify the validity of estimates. Following these reviews, the reserve database is furnished to NSAI so that it can prepare its independent reserve estimates and final report. The reserve estimates prepared by NSAI have been reviewed and compared to our internal estimates by our Vice President – Evaluations and Engineering and our reservoir engineering staff. Material reserve estimation differences are reviewed between NSAI’s reserve estimates and our internally prepared reserves on a case-by-case basis. An iterative process is performed between NSAI and us, and additional data is provided to address any differences. If the supporting documentation will not justify additional changes, the NSAI reserves are accepted. In the event that additional data supports a reserve estimation adjustment, NSAI will analyze the additional data, and may make changes it deems necessary. Additional data is usually comprised of updated production information on new wells. Once the review is completed and all material differences are reconciled, the reserve report is finalized and our reserve database is updated with the final estimates provided by NSAI. Access to our reserve database is restricted to specific members of our reservoir engineering department and management.

 Notwithstanding our foregoing controls and procedures, it came to management’s attention that the lease operating expense forecast for a significant field was misstated in our annual reserve report. Although we believe the error is isolated and not material to the reserve report itself, we recognize that the error causes a material amount of additional full cost ceiling impairment to be recorded. We re-assessed our internal controls over review of the third party reserve report and concluded that our controls were not effective because our review of the December 31, 2018 year-end reserve report lacked the precision necessary to identify an error in the field level lease operating expense forecast that could ultimately be material to the financial statements.

  Gross and Net Productive Wells
  
 As of December 31, 2018, our total gross and net productive wells were as follows:
  
 
Oil (1) | | Natural Gas (1) | | Total (1)
--------+-------+-----------------+-------+----------
Gross | Net | | Gross | Net | Gross | Net 
Wells | Wells | | Wells | Wells | Wells | Wells
70 | 51 | | 27 | 4 | 97 | 55 



  (1) 
 A gross well is a well in which a working interest is owned. The number of net wells represents the sum of fractions of working interests we own in gross wells. Productive wells are producing wells plus shut in wells we deem capable of production. Horizontal re-entries of existing wells do not increase a well total above one gross well. We have working interests in 8 gross wells with completions into more than one productive zone; in the table above, these wells with multiple completions are only counted as one gross well.

 
  Gross and Net Developed and Undeveloped Acres
  
 As of December 31, 2018, we had total gross and net developed and undeveloped leasehold acres as set forth below. The developed acreage is stated on the basis of spacing units designated or permitted by state regulatory authorities. Gross acres are those acres in which a working interest is owned. The number of net acres represents the sum of fractional working interests we own in gross acres.

 | Developed | | Undeveloped | Total | 
-----------+-----------+-------+-------------+-------+-------
State | Gross | Net | Gross | Net | Gross | Net 
Louisiana | 18,536 | 3,172 | - | - | 18,536 | 3,172
Texas | 25,304 | 619 | 4,626 | 1,995 | 29,930 | 2,614
Oklahoma | 2,000 | 79 | - | - | 2,000 | 79 
California | 1,192 | 1,192 | - | - | 1,192 | 1,192
Total | 47,032 | 5,062 | 4,626 | 1,995 | 51,658 | 7,057

 As of December 31, 2018, we had leases representing 434 net acres (none of which were in the Lac Blanc or Bayou Herbert Fields) expiring in 2019; 1,246 net acres (none of which were in the Lac Blanc or Bayou Herbert Fields) expiring in 2020; and 315 net acres expiring in 2021.
  
  Exploratory Wells and Development Wells
  
 Set forth below for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 is information concerning our drilling activity during the years indicated.
  
 
 | Net Exploratory | Net Development | Total Net Productive
-----+-----------------+-----------------+---------------------
 | Wells Drilled | Wells Drilled | and Dry Wells 
Year | Productive | Dry | Productive | Dry | Drilled
2018 | - | - | - | - | - 
2017 | - | 0.5 | | - | 0.5 

 Present Activities
  
 At April 2, 2019, we had -0- gross (-0- net) wells in the process of drilling or completing.
  
  Supply Contracts or Agreements
  
 Crude oil and condensate are sold through month-to-month evergreen contracts. The price is tied to an index or a weighted monthly average of posted prices with certain adjustments for gravity, Basic Sediment and Water (“BS&W”) and transportation. Generally, the index or posting is based on WTI and adjusted to LLS or HLS. Pricing for our California properties is based on an average of specified posted prices, adjusted for gravity, transportation, and for one field, a market differential.
  
 Our natural gas is sold under multi-year contracts with pricing tied to either first of the month index or a monthly weighted average of purchaser prices received. Natural gas liquids are also sold under multi-year contacts usually tied to the related natural gas contract. Pricing is based on published prices for each product or a monthly weighted average of purchaser prices received.
  
 We also engage in commodity derivative activities as discussed below in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Commodity derivative Activities.”
  
  Competition
  
 The domestic oil and natural gas business is intensely competitive in the exploration for and acquisition of leasehold interests, reserves and in the producing and marketing of oil and natural gas production. Our competitors include national oil companies, major oil and natural gas companies, independent oil and natural gas companies, drilling partnership programs, individual producers, natural gas marketers, and major pipeline companies, as well as participants in other industries supplying energy and fuel to consumers. Many of our competitors are large, well-established companies. They likely are able to pay more for seismic information and lease rights on oil and natural gas properties and exploratory prospects and to define, evaluate, bid for and purchase a greater number of properties and prospects than our financial or human resources permit. Our ability to acquire additional properties and to discover reserves in the future will be dependent upon our ability to evaluate and select suitable properties and to consummate oil and gas related transactions in a highly competitive environment.
 Other Business Matters
  
  Major Customers
  
 During the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, sales to five customers accounted for approximately 80% and sales to five customers accounted for approximately 79%, respectively, of the Company’s total revenues.
  
   
13


  
 
 We believe there are adequate alternate purchasers of our production such that the loss of one or more of the above purchasers would not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or cash flows.
  
  Seasonality of Business
  
 Weather conditions affect the demand for, and prices of, natural gas and can also delay oil and natural gas drilling activities, disrupting our overall business plans. Demand for natural gas is typically higher during the winter, resulting in higher natural gas prices for our natural gas production during our first and fourth fiscal quarters. Due to these seasonal fluctuations, our results of operations for individual quarterly periods may not be indicative of the results that we may realize on an annual basis.
 Operational Risks
  
 Oil and natural gas exploration, development and production involve a high degree of risk, which even a combination of experience, knowledge and careful evaluation may not be able to overcome. There is no assurance that we will discover, acquire or produce additional oil and natural gas in commercial quantities. Oil and natural gas operations also involve the risk that well fires, blowouts, equipment failure, human error and other events may cause accidental leakage or spills of toxic or hazardous materials, such as petroleum liquids or drilling fluids into the environment, or cause significant injury to persons or property. In such event, substantial liabilities to third parties or governmental entities may be incurred, the satisfaction of which could substantially reduce our available cash and possibly result in loss of oil and natural gas properties. Such hazards may also cause damage to or destruction of wells, producing formations, production facilities and pipeline or other processing facilities.
  
 As is common in the oil and natural gas industry, we do not insure fully against all risks associated with our business either because such insurance is not available or because we believe the premium costs are prohibitive. A loss not fully covered by insurance could have a material effect on our operating results, financial position and cash flows. For further discussion of these risks see Item 1A. “Risk Factors” of this report.
  
  Title to Properties
  
 We believe that the title to our oil and natural gas properties is good and defensible in accordance with standards generally accepted in the oil and natural gas industry, subject to such exceptions which, in our opinion, are not so material as to detract substantially from the use or value of our oil and natural gas properties. Our oil and natural gas properties are typically subject, in one degree or another, one or more of the following:
  
   ●
 royalties and other burdens and obligations, express or implied, under oil and natural gas leases;

 
   ●
 overriding royalties and other burdens created by us or our predecessors in title;

 
   ●
 a variety of contractual obligations (including, in some cases, development obligations) arising under operating agreements, joint development agreements, farmout agreements, participation agreements, production sales contracts and other agreements that may affect the properties or their titles;

 
   ●
 back-ins and reversionary interests existing under various agreements and leasehold assignments;

 
   ●
 liens that arise in the normal course of operations, such as those for unpaid taxes, statutory liens securing obligations to unpaid suppliers and contractors and contractual liens under operating agreements;

 
   ●
 pooling, unitization and other agreements, declarations and orders; and

 
   ●
 easements, restrictions, rights-of-way and other matters that commonly affect property.

 
   
14


  
 
 To the extent that such burdens and obligations affect our rights to production revenues, they have been taken into account in calculating our net revenue interests and in estimating the quantity and value of our reserves. We believe that the burdens and obligations affecting our oil and natural gas properties are common in our industry with respect to the types of properties we own.
  
  Operational Regulations
  
 All of the jurisdictions in which we own or operate producing oil and natural gas properties have statutory and regulatory provisions affecting drilling, completion and production activities, including provisions related to permits for the drilling of wells, bonding requirements to drill or operate wells, the location of wells, the method of drilling and casing wells, the surface use and restoration of properties upon which wells are drilled, sourcing and disposal of water used in the drilling and completion process, and the plugging and abandonment of wells. Our operations are also subject to various conservation laws and regulations. These laws and regulations govern the size of drilling and spacing units, the density of wells that may be drilled in oil and natural gas properties and the unitization or pooling of oil and natural gas properties. In this regard, while some states allow the forced pooling or integration of land and leases to facilitate development, other states including Texas, where we operate, rely primarily or exclusively on voluntary pooling of land and leases. Accordingly, it may be difficult for us to form spacing units and therefore difficult to develop a project if we own or control less than 100% of the leasehold. In addition, state conservation laws establish maximum rates of production from oil and natural gas wells, generally prohibit the venting or flaring of natural gas, and impose specified requirements regarding the ratability of production. On some occasions, local authorities have imposed moratoria or other restrictions on exploration, development and production activities pending investigations and studies addressing potential local impacts of these activities before allowing oil and natural gas exploration, development and production to proceed.
  
 The effect of these regulations is to limit the amount of oil and natural gas that we can produce from our wells and to limit the number of wells or the locations at which we can drill, although we can apply for exceptions to such regulations or to have reductions in well spacing. Failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations can result in substantial penalties. The regulatory burden on the industry increases the cost of doing business and affects profitability. Moreover, each state generally imposes a production or severance tax with respect to the production and sale of oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids within its jurisdiction.
  
  Regulation of Transportation of Natural Gas
  
 The transportation and sale, or resale, of natural gas in interstate commerce are regulated by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (“FERC”) under the Natural Gas Act of 1938 (“NGA”), the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978 (“NGPA”) and regulations issued under those statutes. FERC regulates interstate natural gas transportation rates and service conditions, which affects the marketing of natural gas that we produce, as well as the revenues we receive for sales of our natural gas.
  
 Intrastate natural gas transportation is also subject to regulation by state regulatory agencies. The basis for intrastate regulation of natural gas transportation and the degree of regulatory oversight and scrutiny given to intrastate natural gas pipeline rates and services varies from state to state. Insofar as such regulation within a particular state will generally affect all intrastate natural gas shippers within the state on a comparable basis, we believe that the regulation of similarly situated intrastate natural gas transportation in any states in which we operate and ship natural gas on an intrastate basis will not affect our operations in any way that is of material difference from those of our competitors. Like the regulation of interstate transportation rates, the regulation of intrastate transportation rates affects the marketing of natural gas that we produce, as well as the revenues we receive for sales of our natural gas.
  
  Regulation of Sales of Oil, Natural Gas and Natural Gas Liquids
  
 The prices at which we sell oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids are not currently subject to federal regulation and, for the most part, are not subject to state regulation. FERC, however, regulates interstate natural gas transportation rates, and terms and conditions of transportation service, which affects the marketing of the natural gas we produce, as well as the prices we receive for sales of our natural gas. Similarly, the price we receive from the sale of oil and natural gas liquids is affected by the cost of transporting those products to market. FERC regulates the transportation of oil and liquids on interstate pipelines under the provision of the Interstate Commerce Act, the Energy Policy Act of 1992 and regulations issued under those statutes. Intrastate transportation of oil, natural gas liquids and other products is dependent on pipelines whose rates, terms and conditions of service are subject to regulation by state regulatory bodies under state statutes. In addition, while sales by producers of natural gas and all sales of crude oil, condensate and natural gas liquids can currently be made at uncontrolled market prices, Congress could reenact price controls in the future.
  
   
15


  
 
 Changes in FERC or state policies and regulations or laws may adversely affect the availability and reliability of firm and/or interruptible transportation service on interstate pipelines, and we cannot predict what future action that FERC or state regulatory bodies will take. We do not believe, however, that any regulatory changes will affect us in a way that materially differs from the way they will affect other natural gas producers, gatherers and marketers with which we compete.
  
  Environmental Regulations
  
 Our operations are also subject to stringent federal, state and local laws regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to health and safety or the protection of the environment. Numerous governmental agencies, such as the United States Environmental Protection Agency (the “EPA”), issue regulations to implement and enforce these laws, which often require difficult and costly compliance measures. Among other things, environmental regulatory programs typically govern the permitting, construction and operation of a well or production related facility. Many factors, including public perception, can materially impact the ability to secure an environmental construction or operation permit. Failure to comply with environmental laws and regulations may result in the assessment of substantial administrative, civil and criminal penalties, as well as the issuance of injunctions limiting or prohibiting our activities. In addition, some laws and regulations relating to protection of the environment may, in certain circumstances, impose strict liability for environmental contamination, which could result in liability for environmental damages and cleanup costs without regard to negligence or fault on our part.
  
 Beyond existing requirements, new programs and changes in existing programs may affect our business including oil and natural gas exploration and production, air emissions, waste management and underground injection of waste material. Environmental laws and regulations have been subject to frequent changes over the years, and the imposition of more stringent requirements could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. The following is a summary of the more significant existing environmental, health and safety laws and regulations to which our business operations are subject and for which compliance in the future may have a material adverse impact on our capital expenditures, earnings and competitive position.
  
  Hazardous Substances and Wastes
  
 The federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (“CERCLA”), also known as the Superfund law, and comparable state laws impose liability, without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct on certain categories of persons that are considered to be responsible for the release of a hazardous substance into the environment. These persons may include the current or former owner or operator of the site or sites where the release occurred and companies that disposed or arranged for the disposal of hazardous substances found at the site. Under CERCLA, these potentially responsible persons may be subject to strict, joint and several liability for the costs of investigating and cleaning up hazardous substances that have been released into the environment, for damages to natural resources and for the costs of certain health studies. In addition, it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by hazardous substances or other pollutants released into the environment. We are able to control directly the operation of only those wells with respect to which we act as operator. Notwithstanding our lack of direct control over wells operated by others, the failure of an operator other than us to comply with applicable environmental regulations may, in certain circumstances, be attributed to us. We generate materials in the course of our operations that may be regulated as hazardous substances but we are not presently aware of any liabilities for which we may be held responsible that would materially or adversely affect us.
  
 The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976 (“RCRA”), and comparable state statutes, regulate the generation, treatment, storage, transportation, disposal and clean-up of hazardous and solid (non-hazardous) wastes. With the approval of the EPA, the individual states can administer some or all of the provisions of RCRA, and some states have adopted their own, more stringent requirements. Drilling fluids, produced waters and most of the other wastes associated with the exploration, development and production of oil and natural gas are currently regulated under RCRA’s solid (non-hazardous) waste provisions. However, legislation has been proposed from time to time and various environmental groups have filed lawsuits that, if successful, could result in the reclassification of certain oil and natural gas exploration and production wastes as “hazardous wastes,” which would make such wastes subject to much more stringent handling, disposal and clean-up requirements. For example, in response to a lawsuit filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia by several non-governmental environmental groups against the EPA for the agency’s failure to timely assess its RCRA Subtitle D criteria regulations for oil and natural gas wastes, the EPA and the environmental groups entered into an agreement that was finalized in a consent decree issued by the District Court on December 28, 2016. Under the decree, the EPA is required to propose no later than March 15, 2019, a rulemaking for revision of certain Subtitle D criteria regulations pertaining to oil and natural gas wastes or sign a determination that revision of the regulations is not necessary. EPA action in response to the consent decree remains pending. If the EPA proposes a rulemaking for revised oil and natural gas waste regulations, the consent decree requires that the EPA take final action following notice and comment rulemaking no later than July 15, 2021. A loss of the RCRA exclusion for drilling fluids, produced waters and related wastes could result in an increase in our, as well as the oil and natural gas E&P industry’s, costs to manage and dispose of generated wastes, which could have a material adverse effect on the industry as well as on our business.
  
   
16


  
 
 From time to time, releases of materials or wastes have occurred at locations we own or at which we have operations. These properties and the materials or wastes released thereon may be subject to CERCLA, RCRA and analogous state laws. Under these laws, we have been and may be required to remove or remediate such materials or wastes.
  
  Water Discharges
  
 The federal Clean Water Act and analogous state laws impose restrictions and strict controls with respect to the discharge of pollutants, including spills and leaks of oil and other substances, into waters of the United States. The discharge of pollutants into regulated waters, including jurisdictional wetlands, is prohibited, except in accordance with the terms of a permit issued by the EPA or an analogous state agency. In September 2015, the EPA and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers rule defining the scope of federal jurisdiction over Waters of the United States (the “WOTUS rule”) became effective; however, this rule has been stayed nationwide by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit while the appellate court and numerous federal district courts consider lawsuits opposing implementation of the rule. The U.S. Supreme Court considered the issue of which court has jurisdiction to hear challenges to the WOTUS rule, and in January 2018 concluded that jurisdiction rests with the federal district courts. In addition, in 2017, President Trump issued an executive order directing the EPA and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to review the WOTUS rule and, if the agencies’ reviews find that the rule does not meet the executive order’s goal of promoting economic growth while reducing regulatory uncertainty, to initiate a new rulemaking to repeal or revise the rule. Pursuant to the executive order, in June 2017, the EPA and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers formally proposed to rescind the WOTUS rule. In January 2018, the EPA and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers finalized a rule that would delay applicability of the WOTUS rule for two years, but a federal judge barred the agencies’ suspension of the rule in August 2018. Separately, a federal court in Georgia enjoined implementation of the rule in 11 states. However, in December 2018, the EPA and the U.S. Army Corps released a proposed rule that would replace the WOTUS rule and significantly reduce the waters subject to federal regulation under the CWA. Such proposal is currently subject to public review and comment, after which additional legal challenges are anticipated. The scope of the jurisdictional reach of the Clean Water Act will likely remain uncertain for several years.
  
 The process for obtaining permits has the potential to delay our operations. Spill prevention, control and countermeasure requirements of federal laws require appropriate containment berms and similar structures to help prevent the contamination of navigable waters by a petroleum hydrocarbon tank spill, rupture or leak. In addition, the Clean Water Act and analogous state laws require individual permits or coverage under general permits for discharges of storm water runoff from certain types of facilities. Federal and state regulatory agencies can impose administrative, civil and criminal penalties as well as other enforcement mechanisms for non-compliance with discharge permits or other requirements of the Clean Water Act and analogous state laws and regulations. The Clean Water Act and analogous state laws provide for administrative, civil and criminal penalties for unauthorized discharges and, together with the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (“OPA”), impose rigorous requirements for spill prevention and response planning, as well as substantial potential liability for the costs of removal, remediation, and damages in connection with any unauthorized discharges.
  
 Our oil and natural gas production also generates salt water, which we dispose of by underground injection. The federal Safe Drinking Water Act (“SDWA”) regulates the underground injection of substances through the Underground Injection Control (“UIC”) program, and related state programs regulate the drilling and operation of salt water disposal wells. The EPA directly administers the UIC program in some states, and in others it is delegated to the state for administering. In Texas, the Texas Railroad Commission (“RRC”) regulates the disposal of produced water by injection well. Permits must be obtained before drilling salt water disposal wells, and casing integrity monitoring must be conducted periodically to ensure the casing is not leaking salt water to groundwater. Contamination of groundwater by oil and natural gas drilling, production, and related operations may result in fines, penalties, and remediation costs, among other sanctions and liabilities under the SDWA and state laws. In response to recent seismic events near underground injection wells used for the disposal of oil and natural gas-related waste waters, federal and some state agencies have begun investigating whether such wells have caused increased seismic activity, and some states have shut down or placed volumetric injection limits on existing wells or imposed moratoria on the use of such injection wells. In response to concerns related to induced seismicity, regulators in some states have already adopted or are considering additional requirements related to seismic safety. For example, the RRC has adopted rules for injection wells to address these seismic activity concerns in Texas. Among other things, the rules require companies seeking permits for disposal wells to provide seismic activity data in permit applications, provide for more frequent monitoring and reporting for certain wells and allow the RRC to modify, suspend, or terminate permits on grounds that a disposal well is likely to be, or determined to be, causing seismic activity. More stringent regulation of injection wells could lead to reduced construction or the capacity of such wells, which could in turn impact the availability of injection wells for disposal of wastewater from our operations.
  
   
17


  
 
 Increased costs associated with the transportation and disposal of produced water, including the cost of complying with regulations concerning produced water disposal, may reduce our profitability. The costs associated with the disposal of proposed water are commonly incurred by all oil and natural gas producers, however, and we do not believe that these costs will have a material adverse effect on our operations. In addition, third party claims may be filed by landowners and other parties claiming damages for alternative water supplies, property damages, and bodily injury.
  
  Hydraulic Fracturing
  
 Our completion operations are subject to regulation, which may increase in the short- or long-term. In particular, the well completion technique known as hydraulic fracturing is used to stimulate production of oil and natural gas has come under increased scrutiny by the environmental community, and many local, state and federal regulators. Hydraulic fracturing involves the injection of water, sand and additives under pressure, usually down casing that is cemented in the wellbore, into prospective rock formations at depths to stimulate oil and natural gas production. We engage third parties to provide hydraulic fracturing or other well stimulation services to us in connection with substantially all of the wells for which we are the operator.
  
 The SDWA regulates the underground injection of substances through the UIC program. Hydraulic fracturing is generally exempt from regulation under the UIC program, and the hydraulic fracturing process is typically regulated by state oil and gas commissions. However, legislation has been proposed in recent sessions of Congress to amend the SDWA to repeal the exemption for hydraulic fracturing from the definition of “underground injection,” to require federal permitting and regulatory control of hydraulic fracturing, and to require disclosure of the chemical constituents of the fluids used in the fracturing process.
  
 Furthermore, several federal agencies have asserted regulatory authority over certain aspects of the fracturing process. For example, the EPA has taken the position that hydraulic fracturing with fluids containing diesel fuel is subject to regulation under the UIC program, specifically as “Class II” UIC wells.
  
 In addition, on June 28, 2016, the EPA published a final rule prohibiting the discharge of wastewater from onshore unconventional oil and natural gas extraction facilities to publicly owned wastewater treatment plants. The EPA is also conducting a study of private wastewater treatment facilities (also known as centralized waste treatment (“CWT”) facilities) accepting oil and natural gas extraction wastewater. The EPA is collecting data and information related to the extent to which CWT facilities accept such wastewater, available treatment technologies (and their associated costs), discharge characteristics, financial characteristics of CWT facilities, and the environmental impacts of discharges from CWT facilities.
  
 In addition, on March 26, 2015, the Bureau of Land Management (the “BLM”) published a final rule governing hydraulic fracturing on federal and Indian lands. Also, on November 15, 2016, the BLM finalized a waste preventing rule to reduce the flaring, venting and leaking of methane from oil and natural gas operations on federal and Indian lands. On March 28, 2017, President Trump signed an executive order directing the BLM to review the above rules and, if appropriate, to initiate a rulemaking to rescind or revise them. Accordingly, on December 29, 2017, the BLM published a final rule to rescind the 2015 hydraulic fracturing rule; however, a coalition of environmentalists, tribal advocates and the state of California filed lawsuits challenging the rule rescission. Also, on February 22, 2018, the BLM published proposed amendments to the waste prevention rule that would eliminate certain air quality provisions and, on April 4, 2018, a federal district court stayed certain provisions of the 2016 rule. At this time, it is uncertain when, or if, the rules will be implemented, and what impact they would have on our operations.
  
 Furthermore, there are certain governmental reviews either underway or being proposed that focus on environmental aspects of hydraulic fracturing practices. On December 13, 2016, the EPA released a study examining the potential for hydraulic fracturing activities to impact drinking water resources, finding that, under some circumstances, the use of water in hydraulic fracturing activities can impact drinking water resources. Also, on February 6, 2015, the EPA released a report with findings and recommendations related to public concern about induced seismic activity from disposal wells. The report recommends strategies for managing and minimizing the potential for significant injection-induced seismic events. Other governmental agencies, including the U.S. Department of Energy, the U.S. Geological Survey, and the U.S. Government Accountability Office, have evaluated or are evaluating various other aspects of hydraulic fracturing. These ongoing or proposed studies could spur initiatives to further regulate hydraulic fracturing and could ultimately make it more difficult or costly for us to perform fracturing and increase our costs of compliance and doing business.

 Some states and local jurisdictions in which we operate or hold oil and natural gas interests have adopted or are considering adopting regulations that could restrict or prohibit hydraulic fracturing in certain circumstances, impose more stringent operating standards and/or require the disclosure of the composition of hydraulic fracturing fluids. If new or more stringent state or local legal restrictions relating to the hydraulic fracturing process are adopted in areas where we operate, we could incur potentially significant added costs to comply with such requirements, experience delays or curtailment in the pursuit of exploration, development or production activities, and perhaps even be precluded from drilling wells.
  
 There has been increasing public controversy regarding hydraulic fracturing with regard to the use of fracturing fluids, induced seismic activity, impacts on drinking water supplies, use of water and the potential for impacts to surface water, groundwater and the environment generally. A number of lawsuits and enforcement actions have been initiated across the country implicating hydraulic fracturing practices. If new laws or regulations that significantly restrict hydraulic fracturing are adopted, such laws could make it more difficult or costly for us to perform fracturing to stimulate production from tight formations as well as make it easier for third parties opposing the hydraulic fracturing process to initiate legal proceedings based on allegations that specific chemicals used in the fracturing process could adversely affect groundwater. In addition, if hydraulic fracturing is further regulated at the federal, state or local level, our fracturing activities could become subject to additional permitting and financial assurance requirements, more stringent construction specifications, increased monitoring, reporting and recordkeeping obligations, plugging and abandonment requirements and also to attendant permitting delays and potential increases in costs. Such legislative changes could cause us to incur substantial compliance costs, and compliance or the consequences of any failure to comply by us could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. At this time, it is not possible to estimate the impact on our business of newly enacted or potential federal, state or local laws governing hydraulic fracturing.
  
  Air Emissions
  
 The federal Clean Air Act and comparable state laws restrict emissions of various air pollutants through permitting programs and the imposition of other requirements. In addition, the EPA has developed and continues to develop stringent regulations governing emissions of toxic air pollutants at specified sources, including oil and natural gas production. Federal and state regulatory agencies can impose administrative, civil and criminal penalties for non-compliance with air permits or other requirements of the Clean Air Act and associated state laws and regulations. Our operations, or the operations of service companies engaged by us, may in certain circumstances and locations be subject to permits and restrictions under these statutes for emissions of air pollutants.
  
 In 2012 and 2016, the EPA issued New Source Performance Standards to regulate emissions of sources of volatile organic compounds (“VOCs”), sulfur dioxide, air toxics and methane from various oil and natural gas exploration, production, processing and transportation facilities. In particular, on May 12, 2016, the EPA amended its regulations to impose new standards for methane and volatile organic compounds emissions for certain new, modified, and reconstructed equipment, processes, and activities across the oil and natural gas sector. However, in a March 28, 2017 executive order, President Trump directed the EPA to review the 2016 regulations and, if appropriate, to initiate a rule making to rescind or revise them consistent with the stated policy of promoting clean and safe development of the nation’s energy resources, while at the same time avoiding regulatory burdens that unnecessarily encumber energy production. In June 2017, the EPA published a proposed rule to stay for two years certain requirements of the 2016 regulations, including fugitive emission requirements. On September 11, 2018, the EPA proposed targeted improvements to the rule, including amendments to the rule’s fugitive emissions monitoring requirements, and expects to “significantly reduce” the regulatory burden of the rule in doing so. These standards, as well as any future laws and their implementing regulations, may require us to obtain pre-approval for the expansion or modification of existing facilities or the construction of new facilities expected to produce air emissions, impose stringent air permit requirements, or mandate the use of specific equipment or technologies to control emissions. We cannot predict the final regulatory requirements or the cost to comply with such requirements with any certainty.
  
 In October 2015, the EPA announced that it was lowering the primary national ambient air quality standards (“NAAQS”) for ozone from 75 parts per billion to 70 parts per billion. In July 2018, the EPA finished issuing area designations with respect to ground-level ozone for U.S. counties as either “attainment/unclassifiable” or “unclassifiable.” Reclassification of areas of state implementation of the revised NAAQS could result in stricter permitting requirements, delay or prohibit our ability to obtain such permits, and result in increased expenditures for pollution control equipment, the costs of which could be significant.

  Climate Change
  
 In response to findings that emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and other greenhouse gases (“GHGs”) endanger public health and the environment, the EPA has adopted regulations under existing provisions of the Clean Air Act that, among other things, establish Prevention of Significant Deterioration (“PSD”), construction and Title V operating permit reviews for certain large stationary sources. Facilities required to obtain PSD permits for their GHG emissions also will be required to meet “best available control technology” standards for these emissions. EPA rulemakings related to GHG emissions could adversely affect our operations and restrict or delay our ability to obtain air permits for new or modified sources. In addition, the EPA has adopted rules requiring the annual reporting of GHG emissions from certain petroleum and natural gas system sources in the U.S., including, among others, onshore and offshore production facilities, which include certain of our operations. Also, as noted above, the EPA has promulgated a New Source Performance Standard related to methane emissions from the oil and natural gas source category.
  
 While Congress has considered legislation related to the reduction of GHG emissions in the past, no significant legislation to reduce GHG emissions has been adopted at the federal level. In the absence of Congressional action, a number of state and regional GHG restrictions have emerged. At the international level, the United States joined the international community at the 21st Conference of the Parties of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in Paris, France. The Paris Agreement entered into force in November 2016. Although this agreement does not create any binding obligations for nations to limit their GHG emissions, it does include pledges from participating nations to voluntarily limit or reduce future emissions. In June 2017, President Trump stated that the United States would withdraw from the Paris Agreement, but may enter into a future international agreement related to GHGs. The Paris Agreement provides for a four-year exit process beginning when it took effect in November 2016, which would result in an effective exit date of November 2020. The United States’ adherence to the exit process is uncertain, and the terms on which the United States may reenter the Paris Agreement or a separately negotiated agreement are unclear at this time. Although it is not possible at this time to predict how legislation or new regulations that may be adopted to address GHG emissions would impact our business, any such future laws and regulations imposing reporting obligations on, or limiting emissions of GHGs from, our equipment and operations could require us to incur costs to reduce emissions of GHGs associated with our operations.
  
 Restrictions on emissions of methane or carbon dioxide that may be imposed could adversely impact the demand for, price of and value of our products and reserves. As our operations also emit greenhouse gases directly, current and future laws or regulations limiting such emissions could increase our own costs. Currently, our operations are not adversely impacted by existing federal, state and local climate change initiatives and, at this time, it is not possible to accurately estimate how potential future laws or regulations addressing greenhouse gas emissions would impact our business. Notwithstanding potential risks related to climate change, the International Energy Agency estimates that global energy demand will continue to represent a major share of global energy use through 2040, and other private sector studies project continued growth in demand for the next two decades. However, recent activism directed at shifting funding away from companies with energy-related assets could result in limitations or restrictions on certain sources of funding for the energy sector. Finally, it should also be noted that many scientists have concluded that increasing concentrations of GHGs in the Earth’s atmosphere may produce climate changes that have significant physical effects, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, floods, droughts and other climatic events; if any such effects were to occur, they could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
  
  National Environmental Policy Act
  
 Oil and natural gas exploration, development and production activities on federal lands are subject to the National Environmental Policy Act (“NEPA”). NEPA requires federal agencies, including the Department of the Interior, to evaluate major agency actions that have the potential to significantly impact the environment. The process involves the preparation of either an environmental assessment or environmental impact statement depending on whether the specific circumstances surrounding the proposed federal action will have a significant impact on the human environment. The NEPA process involves public input through comments which can alter the nature of a proposed project either by limiting the scope of the project or requiring resource-specific mitigation. NEPA decisions can be appealed through the court system by process participants. This process may result in delaying the permitting and development of projects, increase the costs of permitting and developing some facilities and could result in certain instances in the cancellation of existing leases.

  Threatened and endangered species, migratory birds and natural resources
  
 Various federal and state statutes prohibit certain actions that adversely affect endangered or threatened species and their habitat, migratory birds, wetlands, and natural resources. These statutes include the Endangered Species Act (“ESA”), the Migratory Bird Treaty Act and the Clean Water Act. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (“FWS”) may designate critical habitat areas that it believes are necessary for survival of threatened or endangered species. As a result of a 2011 settlement agreement, the FWS was required to make a determination on listing of more than 250 species as endangered or threatened under the FSA by no later than completion of the agency’s 2017 fiscal year. The FWS missed the deadline but reportedly continues to review new species for protected status under the ESA pursuant to the settlement agreement. A critical habitat designation could result in further material restrictions on federal land use or on private land use and could delay or prohibit land access or development. Where takings of or harm to species or damages to wetlands, habitat, or natural resources occur or may occur, government entities or at times private parties may act to prevent or restrict oil and natural gas exploration activities or seek damages for any injury, whether resulting from drilling or construction or releases of oil, wastes, hazardous substances or other regulated materials, and in some cases, criminal penalties may result. Similar protections are offered to migratory birds under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act. Recently, there have been renewed calls to review protections currently in place for the dunes sagebrush lizard, whose habitat includes portions of the Permian Basin, and to reconsider listing the species under the ESA. While some of our operations may be located in areas that are designated as habitats for endangered or threatened species or that may attract migratory birds we believe that we are in substantial compliance with the ESA and the Migratory Bird Treaty Act, and we are not aware of any proposed ESA listings that will materially affect our operations. The federal government in the past has issued indictments under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act to several oil and natural gas companies after dead migratory birds were found near reserve pits associated with drilling activities. The identification or designation of previously unprotected species as threatened or endangered in areas where underlying property operations are conducted could cause us to incur increased costs arising from species protection measures or could result in limitations on our development activities that could have an adverse impact on our ability to develop and produce our oil and natural gas reserves. If we were to have a portion of our leases designated as critical or suitable habitat, it could adversely impact the value of our leases.
  
  Hazard communications and community right to know
  
 We are subject to federal and state hazard communication and community right to know statutes and regulations. These regulations, including, but not limited to, the federal Emergency Planning & Community Right-to-Know Act, govern record keeping and reporting of the use and release of hazardous substances and may require that information be provided to state and local government authorities, as well as the public.
  
  Occupational Safety and Health Act
  
 We are subject to the requirements of the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act, as amended (“OSHA”), and comparable state statutes that regulate the protection of the health and safety of workers. In addition, OSHA hazard communication standard requires that information be maintained about hazardous materials used or produced in operations and that this information be provided to employees, state and local government authorities and citizens.
 State Regulation
  
 Texas regulates the drilling for, and the production, gathering and sale of, oil and natural gas, including imposing severance taxes and requirements for obtaining drilling permits. Texas currently imposes a 4.6% severance tax on oil production and a 7.5% severance tax on natural gas production. States also regulate the method of developing new fields, the spacing and operation of wells and the prevention of waste of oil and natural gas resources. States may regulate rates of production and may establish maximum daily production allowables from oil and natural gas wells based on market demand or resource conservation, or both. States do not regulate wellhead prices or engage in other similar direct economic regulation, but we cannot assure our stockholders that they will not do so in the future. The effect of these regulations may be to limit the amount of oil and natural gas that may be produced from our wells and to limit the number of wells or locations we can drill.
  
   
21


  
 
 The petroleum industry is also subject to compliance with various other federal, state and local regulations and laws. Some of those laws relate to resource conservation and equal employment opportunity. We do not believe that compliance with these laws will have a material adverse effect on us.
  
  Related Insurance
  
 We maintain insurance against some risks associated with above or underground contamination that may occur as a result of our exploration, development and production activities. However, this insurance is limited to activities at the well site, and there can be no assurance that this insurance will continue to be commercially available or that this insurance will be available at premium levels that justify its purchase by us. The occurrence of a significant event that is not fully insured or indemnified against could have a materially adverse effect on our financial condition and operations.
  
 Although we have not experienced any material adverse effect from compliance with environmental requirements, there is no assurance that this will continue.
  
  Employees and Principal Office
