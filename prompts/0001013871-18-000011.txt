Business Overview
As of December 31, 2017, the Company’s core businesses include (i) wholesale conventional generation, (ii) retail electricity for residential and commercial, including personal power solutions and Business Solutions, which includes C&I customers and other distributed and reliability products (included in the Retail segment, effective in January 2017), (iii) contracted generation owned by NRG Yield, Inc. (included in the NRG Yield segment) and (iv) renewable utility scale and distributed generation assets that are constructed or in development and that are not otherwise owned by NRG Yield, Inc. (included in the Renewables segment). On June 14, 2017, NRG deconsolidated GenOn for financial reporting purposes as a result of the GenOn bankruptcy filings.
Generation
The Company’s wholesale power generation business includes plant operations, commercial operations, EPC, energy services and other critical related functions. In addition to the traditional functions, the wholesale power generation business also includes NRG’s conventional distributed generation business, consisting of reliability, combined heat and power and large-scale distributed generation. 
The wholesale generation business is capital-intensive and commodity-driven with numerous industry participants that compete on the basis of the location of their plants, fuel mix, plant efficiency and the reliability of the services offered. The Company has a diversified power generation portfolio, with approximately 28,000 MW of fossil fuel and nuclear generation capacity at 51 plants as of December 31, 2017. The Company's power generation assets are diversified by fuel-type, dispatch level and region, which helps mitigate the risks associated with fuel price volatility and market demand cycles. NRG's U.S. baseload and intermediate facilities provide the Company with a significant source of cash flow, while its peaking facilities provide NRG with opportunities to capture significant upside potential that can arise during periods of high demand, which typically drive higher energy prices. As of December 31, 2017, less than 25% of the Company's consolidated operating revenues were derived from coal-fired operating assets. As noted above, the Company expects to sell its 3,555 MW South Central business in the second half of 2018.
Wholesale power generation is a regional business that is currently highly fragmented and diverse in terms of industry structure. As such, there is a wide variation in terms of the capabilities, resources, nature and identities of the companies the Company competes with depending on the market. Competitors include regulated utilities, municipalities, cooperatives, other independent power producers, and power marketers or trading companies, including those owned by financial institutions. Many of the Company's generation assets, however, are located within densely populated areas that tend to have higher wholesale pricing as a result of relatively favorable local supply-demand balance. The Company has generation assets located in or near major metropolitan areas. The Company believes that its extensive generation portfolio provides asset optimization opportunities. The Company currently has over 500 MW targeted for repowering initiatives, all of which are under development or construction. In addition, the Company evaluates opportunities for new generation, on both a merchant and contracted basis.
Retail 
Retail provides energy and related services to residential, industrial and commercial consumers through various brands and sales channels across the U.S. In 2017, Retail delivered approximately 63 TWhs and served approximately 2.9 million customers. Retail's results make it one of the largest competitive energy retailers in the U.S. The majority of Retail's sales come in the competitive retail energy markets of Texas, Pennsylvania, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York and Ohio, as well as the District of Columbia. Retail's brands collectively are the largest providers of electricity in Texas.
Residential and small commercial (Mass Market) consumers make purchase decisions based on a variety of factors, including price, customer service, brand, product choices and value-added features. These consumers purchase products through a variety of sales channels, including direct sales, call centers, websites, brokers and brick-and-mortar stores. Through its broad range of service offerings and value propositions, Retail is able to attract, retain, and increase the value of its customer relationships. Retail's brands are recognized for exemplary customer service, innovative smart energy and technology product offerings and environmentally friendly solutions. 
12


Included in Retail is the Company's Business Solutions group, which includes demand response, commodity sales, energy efficiency and energy management solutions. An integrated provider of supply and distributed energy resources, Business Solutions focuses on distributed products and services as businesses seek greater reliability, cleaner power or other benefits that they cannot obtain from the grid. These solutions include system power, distributed generation, solar and wind products, carbon management and specialty services, backup generation, storage and distributed solar, demand response and energy efficiency and advisory services. In providing on-site energy solutions, the Company often benefits from its ability to supply energy products from its wholesale generation portfolio to commercial and industrial retail customers. In 2017, Business Solutions delivered approximately 21 TWhs of electricity and managed approximately 1,500 MWs of demand response positions across its portfolio.
Renewables and NRG Yield
As described above, NRG expects to sell its Renewables operating and development platform and its full ownership interest in NRG Yield, Inc. in the second half of 2018. The following description reflects the historical view of these businesses as a part of NRG’s business strategy through its announcement of the Transformation Plan in 2017. 
Renewables
The Company’s renewables business focuses on the acquisition, development and operation and maintenance of utility scale wind and solar, community solar and distributed solar generation assets as well as the management and operations of the renewable generation assets owned by NRG Yield, Inc. In 2017, the Company acquired 209 MW of utility scale solar and wind projects and 82 MW of distributed generation and community solar projects that are currently under development or in operation across three states. The renewables business has in-house expertise that covers the full spectrum of development capabilities to execute on utility, distributed generation, and community solar projects. The asset management and operations and maintenance groups within the renewables business manage a portfolio of wind and solar assets across 27 states, serving as the primary commercial asset manager on the vast majority of assets owned by NRG and NRG Yield, Inc. In addition, the operations and maintenance group self-performs plant operations on 2,689 MW of the consolidated fleet of assets owned by NRG and NRG Yield, Inc. and 224 MW of assets owned by third parties.
The utility wind and solar generation business targets strategic partnerships with utilities, municipalities and large national corporations for offsite wind and solar solutions. The distributed solar business targets partnerships with companies, municipalities, schools and communities to provide on-site and virtual net metering off-site renewable generation. The community solar business targets relationships with companies and municipalities as well as residential homeowners to provide off-site solar generation under community solar regulations and tariffs. In addition to assets in operation, as of December 31, 2017, the Company held a backlog of in-construction, contracted and awarded projects of 1,500 MW, and a pipeline of 5,742 MW across the utility, community solar and distributed solar renewables markets. 
The renewables business also competes for new generation opportunities through both RFPs and bilateral solicitations. The renewables business selects markets and projects based on resource relative to the value of the power, while seeking to make use of NRG capabilities in a competitive landscape. The number and type of competitors vary based on location, generation type, project size and counterparty.  The renewables business competes with traditional utilities as well as companies that provide products and services in the downstream solar and wind energy value chains. 
NRG Yield
NRG Yield, Inc. is a publicly-traded, dividend growth-oriented company that has historically served as the primary vehicle through which NRG owns, operates and acquires diversified contracted renewable and conventional generation and thermal infrastructure assets. As of December 31, 2017, NRG owns a 55.1% voting interest in the outstanding common stock of NRG Yield, Inc. and receives distributions from NRG Yield LLC through its 46.3% ownership of Class B and Class D units. NRG Yield, Inc.’s contracted generation portfolio collectively represents 5,118 net MW as of December 31, 2017. Each of the assets sells most of its output pursuant to long-term, fixed-price offtake agreements with creditworthy counterparties. NRG Yield, Inc. also owns thermal infrastructure assets with an aggregate steam and chilled water capacity of 1,319 net MWt and electric generation capacity of 123 net MW. These thermal infrastructure assets provide steam, hot water and/or chilled water, and in some instances electricity, to commercial businesses, universities, hospitals and governmental units in multiple locations, principally through long-term contracts or pursuant to rates regulated by state utility commissions.

GenOn Chapter 11 Cases
As disclosed in Item 15 - Note 1, Nature of Business, to the Consolidated Financial Statements, on June 14, 2017, or the Petition Date, GenOn, along with GenOn Americas Generation and certain of their directly and indirectly-owned subsidiaries, or collectively the GenOn Entities, filed voluntary petitions for relief under Chapter 11, or the Chapter 11 Cases, of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, or the Bankruptcy Code, in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Texas, Houston Division, or the Bankruptcy Court. GenOn Mid-Atlantic, as well as its consolidated subsidiaries, REMA and certain other subsidiaries, did not file for relief under Chapter 11.
As a result of the bankruptcy filings and beginning on June 14, 2017, GenOn and its subsidiaries were deconsolidated from NRG’s consolidated financial statements. NRG recorded its investment in GenOn under the cost method with an estimated fair value of zero. NRG determined that this disposal of GenOn and its subsidiaries is a discontinued operation; and, accordingly, the financial information for all historical periods has been recast to reflect GenOn as a discontinued operation. In connection with the disposal, NRG recorded a loss on deconsolidation of $208 million during the quarter ended June 30, 2017, which is included within the total loss from discontinued operations of $789 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. See Note 3, Discontinued Operations, Acquisitions and Dispositions, for more information. In addition, upon GenOn's emergence from bankruptcy, the Company will recognize an estimated $9.5 billion worthless stock deduction for tax purposes. 
On June 29, 2017, the GenOn Entities filed the initial plan of reorganization and the disclosure statement with the Bankruptcy Court consistent with the Restructuring Support Agreement. On September 18, 2017 and October 2, 2017, the GenOn Entities filed amendments to the plan of reorganization and the disclosure statement which primarily provided the GenOn Entities with the flexibility to complete sales of certain assets pursuant to the amended plan of reorganization and removed the GenOn Entities' requirement to conduct a rights offering in connection with the GenOn Entities' exit financing. 
On October 31, 2017, the GenOn Entities announced that they entered into a Consent Agreement with certain holders of GenOn’s Senior Notes and GenOn Americas Generation's Senior Notes, collectively, the Consenting Holders, whereby the GenOn Entities and the Consenting Holders agreed to extend the milestones in the Restructuring Support Agreement, by which the plan of reorganization must become effective, or the Effective Date. Specifically, the Consent Agreement extended the Effective Date milestone to June 30, 2018 or September 30, 2018, if regulatory approvals are still pending, or the Extended Effective Dates.
On December 12, 2017, the Bankruptcy Court entered an order confirming the plan of reorganization, and effective December 12, 2017, GenOn and NRG entered into agreements concerning (i) timeline and transition, (ii) cooperation and co-development matters, (iii) post-employment and retiree health and welfare benefits and pension benefits, (iv) tax matters, and (v) intercompany balances, consistent with the Restructuring Support Agreement, which among other things, provide for the transition of GenOn to a standalone enterprise, resolution of substantial intercompany claims between GenOn and NRG, and the allocation of certain costs and liabilities between GenOn and NRG. The principal terms of these agreements are described further in Note 3, Discontinued Operations, Acquisitions and Dispositions. On December 12, 2017, the Bankruptcy Court also entered an order giving effect to the Consent Agreement.

NRG's portfolio diversification and commercial operations hedging strategy provides the Company with reliable future cash flows.  NRG has hedged a portion of its coal and nuclear capacity with decreasing hedge levels through 2021. In addition, NRG's capacity revenues not only enhance the reliability of future cash flows but are not correlated to natural gas prices. As of December 31, 2017, the Company had purchased fuel forward under fixed price contracts, with contractually-specified price escalators, for approximately 41% of its expected coal requirement from 2018 to 2021. The Company enters into additional hedges when it believes market conditions are favorable. 
The Company also has the advantage of being able to supply its retail businesses with its own generation, which can reduce the need to sell and buy power from other institutions and intermediaries, resulting in lower transaction costs and credit exposures. This combination of generation and retail allows for a reduction in actual and contingent collateral, through offsetting transactions and by reducing the need to hedge the retail power supply through third parties. 
The generation and retail combination also provides stability in cash flows, as changes in commodity prices generally have offsetting impacts between the two businesses. The offsetting nature of generation and retail, in relation to changes in market prices, is an integral part of NRG's goal of providing a reliable source of future cash flow for the Company. 
When developing new renewable and conventional power generation facilities, NRG typically secures long-term PPAs, which insulate the Company from commodity market volatility and provide future cash flow stability. These PPAs are typically contracted with high credit quality local utilities and typically have durations from 10 years to as much as 25 years.
16


Commercial Operations Overview
NRG seeks to maximize profitability and manage cash flow volatility through the marketing, trading and sale of energy, capacity and ancillary services into spot, intermediate and long-term markets and through the active management and trading of emissions allowances, fuel supplies and transportation-related services. The Company's principal objectives are the realization of the full market value of its asset base, including the capture of its extrinsic value, the management and mitigation of commodity market risk and the reduction of cash flow volatility over time.
NRG enters into power sales and hedging arrangements via a wide range of products and contracts, including PPAs, fuel supply contracts, capacity auctions, natural gas derivative instruments and other financial instruments. In addition, because changes in power prices in the markets where NRG operates are generally correlated to changes in natural gas prices, NRG uses hedging strategies that may include power and natural gas forward sales contracts to manage the commodity price risk primarily associated with the Company's coal and nuclear generation assets. The objective of these hedging strategies is to stabilize the cash flow generated by NRG's portfolio of assets. 
In addition to power sales and hedging arrangements, NRG trades electric power, natural gas and related commodity and financial products, including forwards, futures, options and swaps. The Company seeks to generate profits from volatility in the price of electricity, capacity, fuels and transmission congestion by buying and selling contracts in wholesale markets under guidelines approved by the Company's risk management committee.

For detailed information on the Company's hedging methodology through use of derivative instruments, see discussion in Item 15 - Note 5, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Includes inter-segment sales from the Company's wholesale power generation business to the retail business. 


(d) | Percentage hedged is based on total coal sales as described in (c) above divided by the forecasted coal capacity.


(e) | Represents U.S. coal sales, including energy revenue and demand charges, excluding revenues derived from capacity auctions.

Capacity and Other Contracted Revenue Sources
NRG's revenues and cash flows benefit from capacity/demand payments and other contracted revenue sources, originating from market clearing capacity prices, Resource Adequacy contracts, tolling arrangements, PPAs and other long-term contractual arrangements: 

• | Capacity auctions — The Company's largest sources of capacity revenues are capacity auctions in PJM, ISO-NE, and NYISO. Both ISO-NE and PJM operate a pay-for-performance model where capacity payments are modified based on real-time performance, where NRG's actual revenues will be the combination of revenues based on the cleared auction MWs plus the net of any over- and under-performance of NRG's fleet. In addition, MISO has an annual auction, known as the Planning Resource Auction, or PRA. The Gulf Coast assets situated in the MISO market may participate in this auction. 


• | Resource adequacy and bilateral contracts — In California, there is a resource adequacy requirement that is primarily satisfied through bilateral contracts. Such bilateral contracts are typically short-term resource adequacy contracts. When bilateral contracting does not satisfy the resource adequacy need, such shortfalls can be addressed through procurement tools administered by the CAISO, including the capacity procurement mechanism or reliability must-run contracts. In addition, NRG earns demand payments from its long-term full-requirements load contracts with nine Louisiana distribution cooperatives, which expire in 2025. Demand payments from the current long-term contracts are tied to summer peak demand and provide a mechanism for recovering a portion of the costs associated with new or changed environmental laws or regulations. In Texas, capacity and contracted revenues are through bilateral contracts with load serving entities.


• | Long-term PPAs — Output from the majority of renewable energy assets and certain conventional energy plants is sold through long-term PPAs and tolling agreements to a single counterparty, which is often a utility or commercial customer.

Fuel Supply and Transportation
NRG's fuel requirements consist of various forms of fossil fuel (including coal, natural gas and oil) and nuclear fuel. The prices of fossil fuels are highly volatile. The Company obtains its fossil fuels from multiple suppliers and through multiple transporters. Although availability is generally not an issue, localized shortages, transportation availability, delays arising from extreme weather conditions and supplier financial stability issues can and do occur. The preceding factors related to the sources and availability of raw materials are fairly uniform across the Company's businesses and fuel products used.
Coal — The Company believes it is adequately hedged, using forward coal supply agreements, for its domestic coal consumption for 2018. NRG actively manages its coal requirements based on forecasted generation, market volatility and its inventory on site. As of December 31, 2017, NRG had purchased forward contracts to provide fuel for approximately 41% of the Company's expected requirements from 2018 through 2021, including expected coal inventory draw down. NRG purchased approximately 21 million tons of coal in 2017, almost all of which was Powder River Basin coal. For fuel transport, NRG has entered into various rail and barge transportation and rail car lease agreements with varying tenures that provide for most of the Company's transportation requirements of Powder River Basin coal for the next 4 years. 
The following table shows the percentage of the Company's coal requirements from 2018 through 2021 that have been purchased forward as of December 31, 2017:

 | Percentage ofCompany'sRequirement (a)
2018 | 97 | %
2019 | 40 | %
2020 | 26 | %
2021 | — | %


(a) | Includes expected coal inventory draw down.

Natural Gas — NRG operates a fleet of mid-merit and peaking natural gas plants across all its U.S. wholesale regions. Fuel needs are managed on a spot basis, especially for peaking assets, as the Company does not believe it is prudent to forward purchase natural gas for these types of units, the dispatch of which is highly unpredictable. The Company contracts for natural gas storage services as well as natural gas transportation services to deliver natural gas when needed.
Nuclear Fuel — STP's owners satisfy their fuel supply requirements by: (i) acquiring uranium concentrates and contracting for conversion of the uranium concentrates into uranium hexafluoride; (ii) contracting for enrichment of uranium hexafluoride; and (iii) contracting for fabrication of nuclear fuel assemblies. Through its proportionate participation in STPNOC, which is the NRC-licensed operator of STP and responsible for all aspects of fuel procurement, NRG is party to a number of long-term forward purchase contracts with many of the world's largest suppliers covering STP's requirements for uranium concentrates with only approximately 25% of STP's requirements outstanding for the duration of the original operating license. Similarly, NRG is party to long-term contracts to procure STP's requirements for conversion and enrichment services and fuel fabrication for the life of the operating license. Since the operating license was renewed for another 20 years in September 2017, STPNOC has begun to review a second phase of fuel purchasing.
Retail Operations
In 2017, NRG's retail businesses sold electricity to residential, commercial and industrial consumers at either fixed, indexed or variable prices. Residential and smaller commercial consumers typically contract for terms ranging from one month to five years while industrial contracts are often between one year and five years in length. In 2017, NRG's retail businesses sold approximately 63 TWhs of electricity. In any given year, the quantity of TWhs sold can be affected by weather, economic conditions and competition. The wholesale supply is typically purchased as the load is contracted from a combination of NRG's wholesale portfolio and other third parties. The ability to choose supply from the market or the Company's portfolio allows for an optimal combination to support and stabilize retail margins.

Operational Statistics
The following are industry statistics for the Company's fossil and nuclear plants, as defined by the NERC, and are more fully described below:
Annual Equivalent Availability Factor, or EAF — Measures the percentage of maximum generation available over time as the fraction of net maximum generation that could be provided over a defined period of time after all types of outages and deratings, including seasonal deratings, are taken into account.
Net Heat Rate — The net heat rate represents the total amount of fuel in BTU required to generate one net kWh provided.
Net Capacity Factor — The net amount of electricity that a generating unit produces over a period of time divided by the net amount of electricity it could have produced if it had run at full power over that time period. The net amount of electricity produced is the total amount of electricity generated minus the amount of electricity used during generation.
The tables below present these performance metrics for the Company's global power generation portfolio, including leased facilities and those accounted for through equity method investments, for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016:

Segment Review
The Company's segment structure reflects how management currently makes financial decisions and allocates resources. Effective January 2017, the Company's businesses are segregated as follows: Generation , which includes generation, international and BETM; Retail which includes Mass customers and Business Solutions, which includes C&I customers and other distributed and reliability products; Renewables, which includes solar and wind assets, excluding those in NRG Yield; NRG Yield; and corporate activities. Intersegment sales are accounted for at market. The Company has recast data from prior periods to reflect changes in reportable segments to conform to the current year presentation. 
During 2017, NRG Yield acquired several projects totaling 555 MW for cash consideration of approximately $245 million from NRG. These acquisitions were accounted for as transfers of entities under common control and accordingly, all historical periods have been recast to reflect this change. 
On June 14, 2017, NRG deconsolidated GenOn for financial reporting purposes. The financial information for all historical periods have been recast to present GenOn as discontinued operations within the corporate segment. 
 Revenues
The following table contains a summary of NRG's operating revenues by segment for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, as discussed in Item 15 — Note 18, Segment Reporting, to the consolidated financial statements.

Seasonality and Price Volatility
Annual and quarterly operating results of the Company's wholesale power generation segments can be significantly affected by weather, including wind resource availability, and energy commodity price volatility. Significant other events, such as the demand for natural gas, interruptions in fuel supply infrastructure and relative levels of hydroelectric capacity can increase seasonal fuel and power price volatility. The preceding factors related to seasonality and price volatility are fairly uniform across the Company's wholesale generation business segments.
The sale of electric power to retail customers is also a seasonal business with the demand for power generally peaking during the summer months. As a result, net working capital requirements for the Company's retail operations generally increase during summer months along with the higher revenues, and then decline during off-peak months. Weather may impact operating results and extreme weather conditions could materially affect results of operations. The rates charged to retail customers may be impacted by fluctuations in total power prices and market dynamics like the price of natural gas, transmission constraints, competitor actions, and changes in market heat rates.
Market Framework 
Organized Energy Markets in CAISO, ERCOT, ISO-NE, MISO, NYISO and PJM 
The majority of NRG's fleet operates in one of the organized energy markets, known as RTOs or ISOs. Each organized market administers day-ahead and real-time centralized bid-based energy and ancillary services markets pursuant to tariffs approved by FERC, or in the case of ERCOT, market rules approved by the PUCT. These tariffs and rules dictate how the energy markets operate, how market participants make bilateral sales with one another, and how entities with market-based rates are compensated. Established prices reflect the value of energy at the specific location and time it is delivered, which is known as the Locational Marginal Price, or LMP. Each market is subject to market mitigation measures designed to limit the exercise of locational market power. These market structures facilitate NRG's sale of power and capacity products at market-based rates. 
Other than ERCOT, each of the ISO regions also operates a capacity or resource adequacy market that provides an opportunity for generating and demand response resources to earn revenues to offset their fixed costs that are not recovered in the energy and ancillary services markets. The ISOs are also responsible for transmission planning and operations. 
Gulf Coast
NRG's Gulf Coast wholesale power generation business is located in the ERCOT and MISO markets.  The ERCOT market is one of the nation's largest and historically fastest growing power markets.  ERCOT is an energy only market, and has implemented market rule changes to provide pricing more reflective of higher energy value when operating reserves are scarce or constrained.  NRG also operates generation assets that are located within MISO, participating in the MISO day-ahead and real-time energy and ancillary services markets. Additionally, MISO employs a one-year forward resource adequacy construct, in which capacity resources can compete for fixed cost recovery in the capacity auction.  NRG continues to provide full requirements service to LSEs, including cooperatives and municipalities in the MISO region.
23


East/West 
NRG's generation and demand response assets located in the East region of the U.S. are within the control areas of ISO-NE, NYISO and PJM. Each of the market regions in the East region provides for robust competition in the day-ahead and real-time energy and ancillary services markets. Additionally, the East region receives a significant portion of its revenues from capacity markets in ISO-NE, NYISO and PJM. PJM and ISO-NE use a three-year forward capacity auction, while NYISO uses a month-ahead capacity auction. Capacity market prices are sensitive to design parameters, as well as additions of new capacity. Both ISO-NE and PJM operate a pay-for-performance model where capacity payments are modified based on real-time generator performance. In such markets, NRG’s actual revenues will be the combination of cleared auction prices times the quantity of MWs cleared, plus the net of any over-performance “bonus payments” and any under-performance charges. In both markets, bidding rules allow for the incorporation of a risk premium into generator bids. 
In the West region, NRG operates a fleet of natural gas fired facilities located entirely within the CAISO footprint. The CAISO operates day-ahead and real-time locational markets for energy and ancillary services, while managing congestion primarily through nodal prices. The CAISO system facilitates NRG's sale of power, ancillary services and capacity products at market-based rates, either within the CAISO's centralized energy and ancillary service markets or bilaterally pursuant to tolling arrangements or other capacity sales with California's LSEs. The CPUC also determines capacity requirements for LSEs and for specified local areas utilizing inputs from the CAISO. Both the CAISO and CPUC rules require LSEs to contract with sufficient generation resources in order to maintain minimum levels of generation within defined local areas. Additionally, the CAISO has independent authority to contract with needed resources under certain circumstances, typically either when LSEs have failed to procure sufficient resources, or system conditions change unexpectedly. 
Renewables
NRG operates a fleet of utility scale and distributed renewable generating assets across the U.S. Many states have implemented their own renewable portfolio standards requiring LSEs to provide a given percentage of their energy sales from renewable resources. As a result, a number of LSEs have entered into long-term PPAs with NRG's utility scale renewable generating facilities. There are examples of states increasing their RPS from initially stated levels, such as California’s 50% RPS by 2030 and Hawaii’s goal of achieving 100% renewables by 2045. In addition, given the cost competitiveness of renewables, LSEs are procuring renewables in excess of their RPS obligations. In December 2015, the U.S. Congress extended the 30% solar ITC so that projects which begin construction in 2016 through 2019 will continue to qualify for the 30% ITC.  Projects beginning construction in 2020 and 2021 will be eligible for the ITC at the rates of 26% and 22%, respectively.  The same legislation also extended the 10-year wind PTC for wind projects which begin construction in years 2016 through 2019.  Wind projects which begin construction in the years 2017, 2018 and 2019 are eligible for PTC at 80%, 60% and 40% of the statutory rate per kWh, respectively. 
Retail 
NRG's retail businesses sell energy and related services as well as portable power and battery solutions to customers across the country. In most of the states that have introduced retail competition, NRG's retail businesses competitively offer retail power, natural gas, portable power or other value-enhancing services to end-use customers. Each retail choice state establishes its own retail competition laws and regulations, and the specific operational, licensing, and compliance requirements vary on a state-by-state basis. In the East markets, incumbent utilities currently provide default service and as a result typically serve a majority of residential customers. In Texas, NRG’s retail business activities are subject to standards and regulations adopted by the PUCT and ERCOT, including the requirement for retailers to be certified by the PUCT in order to contract with end-users to sell electricity. A majority of the retail load is in the ERCOT market region and is served by competitive retail suppliers, except certain areas that are served by municipal utilities and electric cooperatives that have not opted into competitive choice. Regulated terms and conditions of default service, as well as any movement to replace default service with competitive services, as is done in ERCOT, can affect customer participation in retail competition. The attractiveness of NRG's retail offerings in each state may be impacted by the rules, regulations, market structure and communication requirements from public utility commissions across the country.
24


Regulatory Matters 
As owners of power plants and participants in wholesale and retail energy markets, certain NRG entities are subject to regulation by various federal and state government agencies. These include the CFTC, FERC, NRC and the PUCT, as well as other public utility commissions in certain states where NRG's generating, thermal, or distributed generation assets are located. In addition, NRG is subject to the market rules, procedures and protocols of the various ISO and RTO markets in which it participates. Likewise, certain NRG entities participating in the retail markets are subject to rules and regulations established by the states in which NRG entities are licensed to sell at retail. NRG must also comply with the mandatory reliability requirements imposed by NERC and the regional reliability entities in the regions where NRG operates.
NRG's operations within the ERCOT footprint are not subject to rate regulation by FERC, as they are deemed to operate solely within the ERCOT market and not in interstate commerce. These operations are subject to regulation by the PUCT, as well as to regulation by the NRC with respect to NRG's ownership interest in STP.
Federal Energy Regulation
FERC
FERC regulates the transmission and the wholesale sale by public utilities of electricity in interstate commerce under the authority of the FPA. Under existing regulations, FERC determines whether an entity owning a generation facility is an EWG as defined in the PUHCA. FERC also determines whether a generation facility meets the ownership and technical criteria of a QF under PURPA. The transmission of electric energy occurring wholly within ERCOT is not subject to FERC's rate jurisdiction under Sections 203 or 205 of the FPA. Each of NRG's non-ERCOT U.S. generating facilities either qualifies as a QF, or the subsidiary owning the facility qualifies as an EWG.
Public utilities are required to obtain FERC's acceptance, pursuant to Section 205 of the FPA, of their rate schedules for the wholesale sale of electricity. Generally all of NRG's non-QF generating and power marketing entities located outside of ERCOT make sales of electricity pursuant to market-based rates, as opposed to traditional cost-of-service regulated rates.
Derivatives Regulatory Reforms
In the U.S., the CFTC regulates the trading of swaps, futures and many commodities under the Commodity Exchange Act, or CEA. In recent years, there have been a number of reforms to the regulation of the derivatives markets, both in the U.S. and internationally.  These regulations, and any further changes thereto, or adoption of additional regulations, including any regulations relating to position limits on futures and other derivatives or margin for derivatives, could negatively impact NRG’s ability to hedge its portfolio in an efficient, cost-effective manner by, among other things, potentially decreasing liquidity in the forward commodity and derivatives markets or limiting NRG’s ability to utilize non-cash collateral for derivatives transactions.
Department of Energy's Proposed Grid Resiliency Pricing Rule — On September 29, 2017, the Department of Energy issued a proposed rulemaking titled the "Grid Resiliency Pricing Rule." The rulemaking proposed that FERC take action to reform the ISO/RTO markets to value certain reliability and resiliency attributes of electric generation resources. On October 23, 2017, NRG filed comments encouraging FERC to act expeditiously to modernize energy and capacity markets in a manner compatible with robust competitive markets. On January 8, 2018, FERC terminated the proposed rulemaking and opened a new rulemaking asking each ISO/RTO to address specific questions focused on grid resilience.
State Energy Regulation
In Texas, NRG's operations within the ERCOT footprint are not subject to rate regulation by FERC, because they operate solely within the ERCOT market. These operations are subject to regulation by the PUCT, as well as to regulation by the NRC with respect to NRG's ownership interest in STP.
In New York, NRG's generation subsidiaries are electric corporations subject to "lightened" regulation by the NYSPSC. As such, the NYSPSC exercises its jurisdictional authority over certain non-rate aspects of the facilities, including safety, retirements, and the issuance of debt secured by recourse to NRG's generation assets located in New York. 
In California, NRG's generation subsidiaries are subject to regulation by the CPUC with regard to certain non-rate aspects of the facilities, including health and safety, outage reporting and other aspects of the facilities' operations. Additionally, the competitiveness of many of NRG's businesses depends on state competition and other policies.
25


State Out-Of-Market Subsidy Proposals — Certain states in the areas of the country in which NRG operates, including New Jersey, Ohio and Pennsylvania have considered but have not enacted proposals to provide out-of-market subsidy payments to potentially uneconomic nuclear and fossil generating units.  NRG has opposed efforts to provide out-of-market subsidies, and intends to continue opposing them in the future.  
Nuclear Operations
NRG South Texas LP owns 44% of a joint undivided interest in STP. The other owners of STP are the City of Austin, Texas (16%) and the City Public Service Board of San Antonio (40%). STP Nuclear Operating Company, or STPNOC, was founded by the then-owners in 1997 to operate the plant and it is the operator, licensee and holder of the Facility Operating Licenses NPF-76 and NPF-80. STPNOC is a nonstock, nonprofit, nonmember corporation. Each owner of STP appoints a board member (and the three directors then choose a fourth director who also serves as the chief executive officer of STPNOC). A participation agreement establishes an owners' committee with voting interests consistent with ownership interests. 
As a holder of an ownership interest in STP, NRG South Texas LP is an NRC licensee and is subject to NRC regulation. The NRC license gives the Company the right only to possess an interest in STP but not to operate it. As a possession-only licensee, i.e., non-operating co-owner, the NRC's regulation of NRG South Texas LP is primarily focused on the Company's ability to meet its financial and decommissioning funding assurance obligations. In connection with the NRC license, the Company and its subsidiaries have a support agreement to provide up to $120 million to support operations at STP. 
 Decommissioning Trusts — Upon expiration of the operating licenses for the two generating units at STP, recently extended until 2047 and 2048, respectively, the co-owners of STP are required under federal law to decontaminate and decommission the STP facility. Under NRC regulations, a power reactor licensee generally must pre-fund the full amount of its estimated NRC decommissioning obligations unless it is a rate-regulated utility, or a state or municipal entity that sets its own rates, or has the benefit of a state-mandated non-bypassable charge available to periodically fund the decommissioning trust such that the trust, plus allowable earnings, will equal the estimated decommissioning obligations by the time the decommissioning is expected to begin.
 NRG South Texas LP, through its 44% ownership interest, is the beneficiary of decommissioning trusts that have been established to provide funding for decontamination and decommissioning of STP. CenterPoint and AEP collect, through rates or other authorized charges to their electric utility customers, amounts designated for funding NRG South Texas LP's portion of the decommissioning of the facility. See also Item 15 — Note 6, Nuclear Decommissioning Trust Fund, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion.
If the funds from the trusts are ultimately determined to be inadequate to decommission the STP facilities, the original owners of the Company's STP interests, CenterPoint and AEP, each will be required to collect, through their PUCT-authorized non-bypassable rates or other charges to customers, additional amounts required to fund NRG South Texas LP's obligations relating to the decommissioning of the facility. Following the completion of the decommissioning, if surplus funds remain in the decommissioning trusts, those excesses will be refunded to the respective rate payers of CenterPoint or AEP, or their successors. 
 Regional Regulatory Developments
NRG is affected by rule/tariff changes that occur in the ISO regions. For further discussion on regulatory developments see Item 15 — Note 23, Regulatory Matters, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Gulf Coast
MISO
Revisions to MISO Capacity Construct — On February 28, 2018, FERC issued two orders on MISO’s capacity market design, which together, re-affirm MISO’s existing capacity market structure. FERC also held that, even though there was a period of time between where MISO’s capacity market structure may not have just and reasonable, that FERC exercised its remedial authority not to rerun past auctions. The Company has 30 days to seek an administrative rehearing with FERC. The eventual outcome of this proceeding will affect capacity prices in MISO and the incentive for generators in MISO to sell capacity into neighboring markets.

East/West
FERC’s Fast-Start Pricing Dockets — On December 28, 2017, notices were published regarding FERC’s initiation of FPA section 206 proceedings for the NYISO, PJM, and SPP to investigate these ISO pricing practices for fast-start generating resources. FERC found that the practices of each ISO regarding the pricing of fast-start resources may be unjust and unreasonable because the practices do not allow prices to reflect the marginal cost of serving load. FERC also terminated its generic rulemaking into these issues. The proceeding is ongoing. The outcome of this proceeding could affect price formation in the respective energy markets.
PJM 
Minimum Offer Price Rule Exemption Appeal — On July 7, 2017, the D.C. Circuit vacated a FERC order from 2013 related to an exemption to the Minimum Offer Price Rule, or MOPR, and remanded the issue back to FERC. On October 23, 2017, PJM re-filed its initial 2012 MOPR. On December 8, 2017, FERC rejected PJM's filing and directed PJM to submit a compliance filing reinstating the MOPR in effect prior to PJM's December 2012 filing. PJM submitted a compliance filing modifying certain PJM tariff sections, retaining the unit-specific exception, which FERC has accepted.
Generators’ Complaint on Existing Generation MOPR — On January 9, 2017, NRG, its trade association and other generators filed a joint amendment to the pending complaint seeking to apply the MOPR in the capacity market to existing resources that receive out-of-market subsidies. This filing amends the March 21, 2016 complaint filed by NRG and other companies related to ratepayer-funded subsidies approved by the PUCO. The national trade association sought expedited treatment to implement countermeasures to protect consumers and wholesale power markets from the negative effects of out-of-market subsidies, like the Zero Emission Credit. The complaint is pending at FERC.
2020/2021 PJM Auction Results — On May 23, 2017, PJM announced the results of its 2020/2021 Base Residual Auction. NRG cleared approximately 3,992 MW of Capacity Performance product. NRG’s expected capacity revenues from the Base Residual Auction for the 2020/2021 delivery year are approximately $268 million. 
The table below provides a detailed description of NRG’s 2020/2021 base residual auction results from May 23, 2017: 

 | Capacity Performance Product
Zone | Cleared Capacity (MW)(a) | Price ($/MW-day)
COMED | 3,315 | $ | 188.12
EMAAC | 519 | $ | 187.87
MAAC | 158 | $ | 86.04 
Total | 3,992 | 

(a) Includes imports. Does not include capacity sold by NRG Curtailment Solutions. 
PJM Seasonal Capacity Proceeding — On November 17, 2016, PJM proposed to allow winter- and summer-peaking capacity resources to “aggregate” their seasonal capacity into an annual capacity product eligible to participate as Capacity Performance resources. NRG filed comments specifically supporting PJM’s proposal to modify the aggregation rules to allow seasonal capacity resources to aggregate across LDAs and to allow aggregations through RPM auctions. On January 23, 2017, PJM amended its proposal to address questions from FERC. On March 21, 2017, FERC issued a decision accepting PJM's seasonal capacity aggregation filing pursuant to FERC staff's delegated authority, since FERC did not have a quorum at the time. On February 23, 2018, FERC re-affirmed its prior order. Rehearings are pending at FERC. The outcome of this proceeding could have a material impact on future PJM capacity prices.
Complaints Related to Extension of Base Capacity — In 2015, FERC approved changes to PJM’s capacity market, which included moving from the Base Capacity product to the higher performance Capacity Performance product over the course of a five year transition. Under this transition, as of the May 2017 BRA, the Base Capacity product will no longer be available.  Several parties have filed complaints at FERC seeking to maintain the RPM Base Capacity product for at least one more delivery year or until such time as PJM develops a model for seasonal resources to participate. If the transition is delayed, capacity prices could be materially impacted. The matters are pending at FERC.
27


Complaints Regarding Pseudo-Ties for Capacity — On April 6, 2017, Potomac Economics, the market monitor for MISO and NYISO, filed a complaint against PJM regarding the participation of external capacity resources in PJM’s auction. Currently, external resources must enter into a pseudo-tie agreement in order to sell capacity into PJM. The complaint alleges that the pseudo-tie requirement is causing market inefficiencies in PJM, New York and MISO and suggests a new protocol for incorporating external resources into PJM’s markets. In addition, other market participants have filed separate complaints at FERC against MISO or PJM, respectively, for issues resulting from pseudo-tied generators. The complainants argue that the generation owners with pseudo-ties from MISO to PJM are receiving double-charges for congestion. The outcome could impact the PJM, NYISO and MISO capacity markets.
Midwest Generation Reactive Power Compensation — On June 21, 2016, FERC issued an order directing Midwest Generation to make a compliance filing setting forth refunds for payments received in violation of its 2004 reactive power settlement or to show cause why it has not violated the settlement. FERC also ordered Midwest Generation to revise its tariff to reflect the costs of units continuing to provide reactive power or show cause why it should not be required to do so. FERC also referred this matter to FERC's Office of Enforcement. On June 30, 2016, Midwest Generation filed a revised tariff, and on July 22, 2016, Midwest Generation made a compliance filing as ordered by FERC. On October 13, 2016, FERC found that Midwest Generation should only be liable for refunds that accrued after bankruptcy on April 1, 2014 through June 30, 2016. On November 16, 2017, Midwest Generation filed its Offer of Settlement, which was approved by FERC on February 22, 2018. In addition, FERC's Office of Enforcement has closed the investigation into Midwest Generation without further action.
New England
Competitive Auctions with Sponsored Resources Proposal (CASPR) — On January 8, 2018, ISO-NE filed the CASPR proposal which attempts to accommodate state sponsored resources while maintaining competitive market pricing. On January 29, 2018, NRG protested certain aspects of the proposal and also supported ISO-NE’s beginning attempts to address state sponsored resources entering the capacity market. The outcome of this proceeding will potentially affect future capacity market prices.
Renewable Technology Resource (RTR) Exemption — In 2014, FERC approved a package of revisions that included a renewables exemption called the RTR Exemption. After FERC denied rehearing, the case was appealed to the D.C. Circuit. After a voluntary remand motion, the Court remanded the case back to FERC. In 2016, FERC issued an order reaffirming its decision. In 2017, a group of generators, including NRG, filed a petition for review with the D.C. Circuit. Briefing is complete. Oral argument is scheduled for April 13, 2018. 
Challenge to ISO-NE’s Capacity Carry Forward Rule — On February 2, 2018, the D.C. Circuit remanded a FERC order regarding how generators that previously received a seven-year “price lock” should be priced in future auctions, known as the Capacity Carry Forward Rule. The price-lock mechanism permits qualified new resources that clear the auction to receive their first-year clearing price for seven years.  Because the underlying orders focused on the implementation of the Capacity Carry Forward Rule, this remand does not implicate the validity of the underlying price-lock. Because several auctions have been held under the existing rules, any subsequent order from FERC could affect future capacity prices in New England, as well as affect the price that non-price locked resources could receive from prior capacity auction.
2021/2022 ISO-NE Auction Results — On February 6, 2018, ISO-NE announced the results of its 2021/2022 forward capacity auction.  NRG cleared 1,529 MW at $4.631 kW-month providing expected annualized capacity revenues of $85 million.  The 333 MWs at Canal Unit 3, which previously cleared the tenth forward capacity auction with a seven year price lock at a price of $7.03 kW-month for the 2021/2022 deliverability year, are excluded from these results. 
Massachusetts GHG Regulations — On September 11, 2017, multiple generators, including GenOn Energy, Inc. and the New England Power Generators Association, or NEPGA, filed complaints regarding the Massachusetts GHG regulations with the Superior Court in Massachusetts. The complaint alleges that the final regulation does not demonstrate a lowering of emissions and that the regulation violates the state’s Global Warming Solutions Act law. On January 30, 2018, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court transferred the superior court cases to the Supreme Judicial Court for Suffolk County. At the same time, the Court stayed two pending appeals of siting certificates, one of which is the certificate of NRG’s Canal 3 development. The outcome of the matter may affect generators’ abilities to run their plants without violating environmental regulations. 
Northern Pass Siting Application — On February 1, 2018, the New Hampshire Site Evaluation Committee denied the application for Northern Pass to cross the state with a 160-mile transmission line from Quebec into southern New Hampshire.  The Northern Pass transmission line project had previously been awarded a contract by the State of Massachusetts, which is now in doubt.  The addition of 1,000 MW of additional Canadian hydropower associated with Northern Pass would have affected energy and capacity prices. 
28


Peak Energy Rent Adjustment Complaint — On September 30, 2016, the New England Power Generators Association, or NEPGA, filed a complaint against ISO-NE asking FERC to find the Peak Energy Rent, or PER, unjust and unreasonable. The PER adjustment reduces capacity payments on days where energy prices exceed a pre-defined level, known as the "PER strike price." On January 9, 2017, FERC granted NEPGA’s complaint requiring a change to the methodology used to calculate the PER strike price. FERC also directed the parties to determine any refunds for PER paid between September 30, 2016 and May 31, 2018. On July 26, 2017, NEPGA filed settlement documents at FERC, which NRG supported. On February 20, 2018, FERC accepted the settlement and directed ISO-NE to submit a compliance filing setting out the PER calculation.
New York
Independent Power Producers of New York (IPPNY) Complaint — On January 9, 2017, EPSA requested FERC to promptly direct the NYISO to file tariff provisions to address pending market concerns related to out-of-market payments to existing generation in the NYISO. This request was prompted by the ZEC program initiated by the NYSPSC. This request follows IPPNY’s complaint at FERC against the NYISO on May 10, 2013, as amended on March 25, 2014. The generators asked FERC to direct the NYISO to require that capacity from existing generation resources that would have exited the market but for out-of-market payments be mitigated. Failure to implement buyer-side mitigation measures could result in uneconomic entry, which artificially decreases capacity prices below competitive market levels.
New York Public Service Commission Retail Energy Market Proceedings — On February 23, 2016, the NYSPSC issued what it refers to as its “Retail Reset” order, or Reset Order, in docket 12-M-0476 et al. Among other things, the Reset Order placed a price cap on energy supply offers and required many retail providers to seek affirmative consent from certain retail customers. Various parties have challenged the NYPSC’s ability to regulate rates charged by competitive suppliers in New York state court. In conjunction with the court challenges, the NYPSC noticed both an evidentiary and a collaborative track to address the functioning of the competitive retail markets. An administrative hearing commenced on November 29, 2017 as part of the evidentiary track, which is ongoing. The outcome of the evidentiary and collaborative processes, combined with the outcome of the appeal of the Reset Order, could affect the viability of the New York retail energy market.
CAISO
Puente Power Project — On October 5, 2017, the California Energy Commission, or CEC, the agency responsible for permitting the Puente Power Project, issued a statement on behalf of the committee of two Commissioners overseeing the permitting process stating their intention to issue a proposed decision that would deny a permit for the Puente Power Project. On October 16, 2017, NRG filed a motion to suspend the permitting proceeding for at least six months, which was granted on November 3, 2017. During the six month suspension period, which could be extended, NRG will evaluate the progress of a procurement process initiated by SCE to replace the Puente Power Project.
Environmental Matters 
NRG is subject to numerous environmental laws in the development, construction, ownership and operation of projects. These laws generally require that governmental permits and approvals be obtained before construction and during operation of power plants. Federal and state environmental laws historically have become more stringent over time. Future laws may require the addition of emissions controls or other environmental controls or impose restrictions on our operations, which could affect the Company's operations. Complying with environmental laws often involves significant capital and operating expenses, as well as occasionally curtailing operations. NRG decides to invest capital for environmental controls based on the relative certainty of the requirements, an evaluation of compliance options, and the expected economic returns on capital. 
A number of regulations that may affect the Company are under review by the EPA, including ESPS for GHGs, ash disposal requirements, NAAQS revisions and implementation and effluent limitation guidelines. NRG will evaluate the impact of these regulations as they are revised but cannot fully predict the impact of each until anticipated legal challenges are resolved. 
Air
The CAA and the resulting regulations (as well as similar state and local requirements) have the potential to affect air emissions, operating practices and pollution control equipment required at power plants. Under the CAA, the EPA sets NAAQS for certain pollutants including SO2, ozone, and PM2.5. Many of the Company's facilities are located in or near areas that are classified by the EPA as not achieving certain NAAQS (non-attainment areas). The relevant NAAQS have become more stringent. The Company maintains a comprehensive compliance strategy to address continuing and new requirements. Complying with increasingly stringent air regulations could require the installation of additional emissions control equipment at some NRG facilities or retiring of units if installing such controls is not economic. Significant changes to air regulatory programs affecting the Company are described below. 
29


Ozone NAAQS — On October 26, 2015, the EPA promulgated a rule that reduces the ozone NAAQS to 0.070 ppm. Challenges to this rule have been stayed at the request of the EPA so that it can evaluate the rule. If the rule is not altered by the EPA and survives legal challenges, this more stringent NAAQS will obligate the states to develop plans to reduce NOx (an ozone precursor), which could affect some of the Company's units.
Cross-State Air Pollution Rule — The EPA finalized CSAPR in 2011, which was intended to replace CAIR in January 2012, to address certain states' obligations to reduce emissions so that downwind states can achieve federal air quality standards. In December 2011, the D.C. Circuit stayed the implementation of CSAPR and then vacated CSAPR in August 2012 but kept CAIR in place until the EPA could replace it. In April 2014, the U.S. Supreme Court reversed and remanded the D.C. Circuit's decision. In October 2014, the D.C. Circuit lifted the stay of CSAPR. In response, the EPA in November 2014 amended the CSAPR compliance dates. Accordingly, CSAPR replaced CAIR on January 1, 2015. On July 28, 2015, the D.C. Circuit held that the EPA had exceeded its authority by requiring certain reductions that were not necessary for downwind states to achieve federal standards. Although the D.C. Circuit kept the rule in place, the court ordered the EPA to revise the Phase 2 (or 2017) (i) SO2 budgets for four states including Texas and (ii) ozone-season NOx budgets for 11 states including Maryland, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Texas. On October 26, 2016, the EPA finalized the CSAPR Update Rule, which reduces future NOx allocations and discounts the current banked allowances to account for the more stringent 2008 Ozone NAAQS and to address the D.C. Circuit's July 2015 decision. This rule has been challenged in the D.C. Circuit. The Company believes its investment in pollution controls and cleaner technologies leave the fleet well-positioned for compliance. 
MATS — In 2012, the EPA promulgated standards (the MATS rule) to control emissions of HAPs from coal and oil-fired electric generating units. The rule established limits for mercury, non-mercury metals, certain organics and acid gases, which had to be met beginning in April 2015 (with some units getting a 1-year extension). In June 2015, the U.S. Supreme Court issued a decision in the case of Michigan v. EPA, and held that the EPA unreasonably refused to consider costs when it determined that it was "appropriate and necessary" to regulate HAPs emitted by electric generating units. The U.S. Supreme Court did not vacate the MATS rule but rather remanded it to the D.C. Circuit for further proceedings. In December 2015, the D.C. Circuit remanded the MATS rule to the EPA without vacatur. On April 25, 2016, the EPA released a supplemental finding that the benefits of this regulation outweigh the costs to address the U.S. Supreme Court's ruling that the EPA had not properly considered costs. This finding has been challenged in the D.C. Circuit. On April 18, 2017, the EPA asked the D.C. Circuit to postpone oral argument that had been scheduled for May 18, 2017 because the EPA is closely reviewing the supplemental finding to determine whether it should reconsider all or part of the rule. On April 27, 2017, the D.C. Circuit granted the EPA's request to postpone the oral argument and hold the case in abeyance. While NRG cannot predict the final outcome of this rulemaking, NRG believes that because it has already invested in pollution controls and cleaner technologies, the fleet is well-positioned to comply with the MATS rule.
Clean Power Plan — The attention in recent years on GHG emissions has resulted in federal regulations and state legislative and regulatory action. In October 2015, the EPA finalized the Clean Power Plan, or CPP, addressing GHG emissions from existing EGUs. On February 9, 2016, the U.S. Supreme Court stayed the CPP. The D.C. Circuit heard oral argument on the legal challenges to the CPP in September 2016. At the EPA's request, the D.C. Circuit agreed on April 28, 2017 to hold the case in abeyance. On October 16, 2017, the EPA proposed a rule to repeal the CPP. The Company believes the CPP is not likely to survive.
30


Greenhouse Gas Emissions — NRG emits CO2 and small quantities of other greenhouse gases, or GHGs, when generating electricity at most of its facilities. The graphs presented below illustrate NRG's domestic emissions of CO2e for 2015, 2016 and 2017. A significant majority (>99%) of NRG's emission sources are subject to federal (U.S. EPA) GHG reporting requirements programs. NRG anticipates further reductions in CO2e emissions as the Company modernizes the fleet. From 2016 to 2017, the Company's CO2e emissions decreased from 48 million metric tons to approximately 46 million metric tons, representing a 4% reduction year over year. The primary factor leading to the decreased emissions include reductions in fleet wide annual net generation due to a continued market-driven shift towards increased generation from natural gas over coal. The Company's goal is to reduce CO2e emissions by 50% by 2030, and 90% by 2050, using 2014 as a baseline.
The effects from federal, regional or state regulation of GHGs on the Company's financial performance will depend on a number of factors, including the outcome of the legal challenges and actions of the current U.S. presidential administration.
 Byproducts, Wastes, Hazardous Materials and Contamination
In April 2015, the EPA finalized the rule regulating byproducts of coal combustion (e.g., ash and gypsum) as solid wastes under the RCRA. On September 13, 2017, the EPA granted the petition for reconsideration that the Utility Solid Waste Activities Group filed in May 2017. The Company has evaluated the impact of the new rule on the Company's consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows and has accrued its environmental and asset retirement obligations under the rule based on current estimates as of December 31, 2017.
Domestic Site Remediation Matters
Under certain federal, state and local environmental laws, a current or previous owner or operator of any facility, including an electric generating facility, may be required to investigate and remediate releases or threatened releases of hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum products. NRG may be responsible for property damage, personal injury and investigation and remediation costs incurred by a party in connection with hazardous material releases or threatened releases. These laws, including the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 as amended by the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act of 1986, or SARA, impose liability without regard to whether the owner knew of or caused the presence of the hazardous substances, and the courts have interpreted liability under such laws to be strict (without fault) and joint and several. Cleanup obligations can often be triggered during the closure or decommissioning of a facility, in addition to spills during its operations. Further discussions of affected NRG sites can be found in Item 15 — Note 24, Environmental Matters, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
31


Nuclear Waste — The federal government's program to construct a nuclear waste repository at Yucca Mountain, Nevada was discontinued in 2010. Since 1998, the U.S. DOE has been in default of the federal government's obligations to begin accepting spent nuclear fuel, or SNF, and high-level radioactive waste, or HLW, under the U.S. Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982, or the Nuclear Waste Policy Act. Owners of nuclear plants, including the owners of STP, had been required to enter into contracts setting out the obligations of the owners and the U.S. DOE, including the fees to be paid by the owners for the U.S. DOE's services to license a spent fuel repository. Effective May 16, 2014, the U.S. DOE stopped collecting the fees. 
On February 5, 2013, STPNOC entered into a settlement agreement with the U.S. DOE for payment of damages relating to the U.S. DOE's failure to accept SNF and HLW under the Nuclear Waste Policy Act through December 31, 2013, which was extended through an addendum dated January 24, 2014, to December 31, 2016. On December 12, 2016, STPNOC received the federal government's offer of another three-year extension of payment for continued failure to accept SNF and HLW. The proposal was reviewed and accepted. There are no facilities for the reprocessing or permanent disposal of SNF currently in operation in the U.S., nor has the NRC licensed any such facilities. STPNOC currently stores all SNF generated by its nuclear generating facilities in on-site storage pools.  Since STPNOC's SNF storage pools do not have sufficient storage capacity for the life of the units, STPNOC is proceeding to construct dry cask storage capability on-site. STPNOC plans to continue to assert claims against the U.S. DOE for damages relating to the U.S. DOE's failure to accept SNF and HLW.
Under the federal Low-Level Radioactive Waste Policy Act of 1980, as amended, the state of Texas is required to provide, either on its own or jointly with other states in a compact, for the disposal of all low-level radioactive waste generated within the state. STP's warehouse capacity is adequate for on-site storage until a site in Andrews County, Texas becomes fully operational. 
Water
Clean Water Act — The Company is required under the CWA to comply with intake and discharge requirements, requirements for technological controls and operating practices. As with air quality regulations, federal and state water regulations have become more stringent and imposed new requirements. 
Once Through Cooling Regulation — In August 2014, EPA finalized the regulation regarding the use of water for once through cooling at existing facilities to address impingement and entrainment concerns. NRG anticipates that more stringent requirements will be incorporated into some of its water discharge permits over the next several years as NPDES permits are renewed.
Effluent Limitations Guidelines — In November 2015, the EPA revised the Effluent Limitations Guidelines for Steam Electric Generating Facilities, which would have imposed more stringent requirements (as individual permits were renewed) for wastewater streams from flue gas desulfurization, or FGD, fly ash, bottom ash, and flue gas mercury control. In April 2017, the EPA granted two petitions to reconsider the rule and also administratively stayed some of the deadlines. On September 18, 2017, the EPA promulgated a final rule that (i) postpones the compliance dates to preserve the status quo for FGD wastewater and bottom ash transport water by two years to November 2020 until the EPA completes its next rulemaking and (ii) withdrew the April 2017 administrative stay. The legal challenges have been suspended while the EPA reconsiders and likely modifies the rule. Accordingly, the Company has largely eliminated its estimate of the environmental capital expenditures that would have been required to comply with permits incorporating the revised guidelines. The Company will revisit these estimates after the rule is revised. 
Regional Environmental Developments
New Source Review — In 2007, Midwest Generation received an NOV from the EPA alleging that past work at Crawford, Fisk, Joliet, Powerton, Waukegan and Will County generating stations violated NSR and other regulations. These alleged violations are the subject of litigation described in Item 15 — Note 22, Commitments and Contingencies. Additionally, in April 2013, the Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection issued four NOVs alleging that past work at oil-fired combustion turbines at the Torrington Terminal, Franklin, Branford and Middletown generating stations violated regulations regarding NSR. 
32


Burton Island Old Ash Landfill — In January 2006, NRG's Indian River Power LLC was notified that it may be a potentially responsible party with respect to Burton Island Old Ash Landfill, a historic captive landfill located at the Indian River facility. On October 1, 2007, NRG signed an agreement with DNREC to investigate the site through the Voluntary Clean-up Program, or the VCP. On February 4, 2008, DNREC issued findings that no further action was required in relation to surface water and that a previously planned shoreline stabilization project would satisfactorily address shoreline erosion. The landfill itself required a Remedial Investigation and Feasibility Study to determine the type and scope of any additional required work. DNREC approved the Feasibility Study in December 2012. In January 2013, DNREC proposed a remediation plan based on the Feasibility Study. The remediation plan was approved in October 2013. In December 2015, DNREC approved the Company's remediation design, the Company's Closure Report and the Company's Long Term Stewardship Plan. The cost of completing the work required by the approved remediation plan is consistent with amounts budgeted in early 2016 and remediation was completed in 2017. The estimated cost to comply with the Long-Term Stewardship Plan was added to the liability in December 2016. 
In addition to the VCP, on May 29, 2008, DNREC requested that NRG's Indian River Power LLC participate in the development and performance of a Natural Resource Damage Assessment at the Burton Island Old Ash Landfill. NRG is currently working with DNREC and other trustees to close out the assessment process. 
RGGI — The Company operates generating units in Connecticut, Delaware, Maryland, and New York that are subject to RGGI, which is a regional cap and trade system. In 2013, each of these states finalized a rule that reduced and will continue to reduce the number of allowances through 2020. The nine RGGI states re-evaluated the program and published a model rule to further reduce the number of allowances. The revisions being currently contemplated could adversely impact NRG's results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. 
Texas Regional Haze — On October 17, 2017, the EPA promulgated a final rule creating a Texas-only SO2 cap-and-trade program to address regional haze. The program is scheduled to begin on January 1, 2019. Several of the Company's units in Texas will be affected by this rule. The rule has been challenged by several environmental groups in the Fifth Circuit of the U.S. Court of Appeals.
Customers
NRG sells to a wide variety of customers. No individual customer accounted for 10% or more of NRG's total revenue in 2017. The Company owns and operates power plants to generate and sell power to wholesale customers such as utilities and other intermediaries. The Company also directly sells to end-use customers in the residential, commercial and industrial sectors. NRG also receives significant revenues from PJM in its capacity as the regional transmission organization for the PJM footprint.
Employees
As of December 31, 2017, NRG and its consolidated subsidiaries, including NRG Yield, Inc., had 5,940 employees, approximately 24% of whom were covered by U.S. bargaining agreements. During 2017, the Company did not experience any labor stoppages or labor disputes at any of its facilities.
Available Information
NRG's annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act are available free of charge through the Company's website, www.nrg.com, as soon as reasonably practicable after they are electronically filed with, or furnished to, the SEC. The Company also routinely posts press releases, presentations, webcasts, sustainability reports and other information regarding the Company on the Company's website. The information posted on the Company's website is not a part of this report.
