We primarily engage in the manufacturing and distribution of organic fertilizer and the sales of agricultural products in the PRC. Our organic fertilizer products are sold under our brand names “Zongbao,” “Fukang,” and “Muliang.” Our wholly-owned subsidiary Viagoo Pte Ltd, a Singapore company, is primarily focused on building smart document, operation and delivery platform for distribution and logistics companies.



Through our patented technology, we are able to process crop straw (including corn, rice, wheat, cotton, and other crops) into high quality organic nutritious fertilizers that are easily absorbed by crops in three hours. Straw is a common agricultural by-product. In the PRC, farmers usually remove the straw stubble that remains after harvesting grains by burning them in order to continue farming on the same land season to season. These activities have resulted in significant air pollution, and damage the surface structure of the soil by causing a loss of nutrients. We turn waste into treasure by transforming the straws into organic fertilizer, which also effectively reduces air pollution. The straw-based organic fertilizer we produce does not contain the heavy metals, antibiotics, or harmful bacteria that are common in traditional manure fertilizer. Our fertilizers also provide optimum levels of primary plant nutrients, including multi-minerals, proteins and carbohydrates that promotes healthy soil capable of growing excellent crops and vegetables. It effectively reduces the use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides as well as reduce the penetration of large chemical fertilizers and pesticides into the soil, thus avoiding water pollution. Therefore, our fertilizer can effectively improve the fertility of soil and the quality and safety of agricultural products.



We generated our revenue mainly from our organic fertilizers, which accounted for approximately 91.5% and 95.8% of our total revenue for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. We currently have two integrated factories in Weihai City, Shandong Province, PRC to produce our organic fertilizers, which have been in operations since August 2015. We plan to improve the technology for our existing organic straw fertilizer production lines in the following aspects: (i) adopt more advanced automatic control technology for raw material feed to shorten the processing time of raw material, and (ii) manufacture powdered organic fertilizer instead of granular organic fertilizer in order to avoid the drying and cooling process, as such will increase our production capacity.



Besides our focus on producing organic fertilizers, we also engage in the business of selling agriculture food products including apples, and as a sales agent for other large agriculture companies in the PRC. In 2014, we rented 350 mu (about 57.66 acres) of mountainous land as an apple orchard. The sales of apples generated less than 1% of our total revenue for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 respectively. We expect to generate more revenues from the sales of apples as the apple orchards become more mature in the next few years.



In addition, we began the processing and distribution of black goat products business in June 2022. We are currently constructing a deep-processing slaughterhouse and processing plant which is expected to have the capacity of slaughtering 200,000 black goats per year in Chuxiong City, Yunnan Province, in China. Our black goat processing products including goat rib lets, goat loin roast, goat loin chops, goat rack, goat leg, goat shoulder, goat leg shanks, ground goat, goat stew meat, whole goat, half goat, lamb viscera, etc. We expect to start generating revenue from the black goat products in 2022.



Our 42,895 square meters of industrial land and 28,549 square meters of factory and office space located in Jinshan District, Shanghai was sold for RMB 74.52 million (US$11.42 million), and the transaction has been settled as of December 31, 2021..Our assets mainly include: (i) 22,511 square meters of industrial land and 10,373 square meters of plant area and organic straw fertilizer production line in Weihai City, Shandong Province, and (ii) over $2 million investment of land use right and the black goat slaughtering and processing plant located in Shuangbai County, Chuxiong City, Yunnan Province, in China.

History



The following diagram illustrates and assumes the completion of the Reorganization, including consolidation of our subsidiaries and VIEs:






Shanghai Muliang Industry Co., Ltd. (referred to herein as “Muliang Industry”) was incorporated in PRC on December 7, 2006 as a limited liability company, owned 95% by Lirong Wang and 5% by Zongfang Wang. Muliang Industry through its own operations and its subsidiaries is engaged in the business of developing, manufacturing and selling organic fertilizers for use in the agricultural industry.



On May 27, 2013, Muliang Industry entered into and consummated an equity purchase agreement whereby it acquired 99% of the outstanding equity of Weihai Fukang Bio-Fertilizer Co., Ltd. (“Fukang”), a corporation organized under the laws of the People’s Republic of China. Fukang was incorporated in Weihai City, Shandong Province on January 6, 2009. Fukang is focused on the distribution of organic fertilizers and the development of new bio-organic fertilizers. As a result of the completion of the transaction, Fukang became a 99% owned subsidiary of Muliang Industry, with the remaining 1% equity interest owned by Mr. Hui Song.



On July 11, 2013, Muliang Industry established a wholly owned subsidiary, Shanghai Muliang Development Co., Ltd. (“Agritech Development”) in Shanghai, China. On November 6, 2013, Muliang Industry sold 40% of the outstanding equity of Agritech Development to Mr. Jianping Zhang for consideration of approximately $65,000 or RMB 400,000.

Our Industry



The Status and Market Demand of the Organic Straw Fertilizer Industry in China



In China, straw exists in a large quantity and has a wide variety of uses and broad distribution. The annual output of straw is more than 700 million tons, according to the China Industry Information Network’s report on “2017 China Straw Resource Reserves and Utilization Market Overview.” Straw contains more than 3 million tons of nitrogen, more than 700,000 tons of phosphorus and nearly 7 million tons of potassium; this is equivalent to more than a quarter of the amount of fertilizer China’s currently uses and equivalent to 300 million tons of standard coal. Unfortunately, nearly 100 million tons of straw chaff are burned directly in the fields every year, which not only seriously damages the beneficial bacteria in the soil surface but directly leads to severe air pollution and increases the greenhouse effect. With such a significant amount of straw production in China, if even a part of the straw can be recycled each year, it will bring huge, sustainable recycling resources to the fertilizer industry. On November 25, 2015, the National Development and Reform Commission, the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Agriculture and the Ministry of Environmental Protection jointly issued a notice, requiring the utilization rate of straw to exceed 85% by 2020.



The market demand in China for organic fertilizer is significant. According to the National Bureau of Statistics in 2019, the China national sales volume of organic fertilizers in 2018 was 133.42 million tons. According to the current policy of encouraging less use of chemical fertilizer, improving the quality of agricultural products and restoring land, it is estimated that the demand of organic fertilizers will increase to 180 million tons by 2020. At the same time, according to a governmental advocate of increasing proportion of organic fertilizer to 50% of the total use of fertilizer, the demand in China for organic fertilizer will reach more than 500 million tons by 2030.



The Environmental Benefits of Promoting Organic Straw Fertilizer



Lower Air Pollution- If each county area builds straw disposal factories that can handle even 100,000 tons of waste, 100 counties can offset the damage from destructive burning equivalent to approximately 10 million tons of straw. This would reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 15 million tons and reduce a huge amount of carbon monoxide, volatile organic particles (PM), nitrogen oxides, benzene, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and other harmful gases released into the atmosphere.



Lower soil pollution and greater environment restoration- Straw is a circulating agricultural resource and the best organic fertilizer resource, according to Baidu. Organic straw fertilizer is also the main agricultural tool used to convert wasteland, tidal flats, and saline-alkali land into arable land. It is also the primary tool in transforming barren land into medium-low yield fields and to upgrade medium-low yield fields to high-quality fertile fields.



Lower water pollution- The utilization rate of traditional chemical fertilizers is generally below 30%, and 70% of dissolved chemical fertilizers directly enter underground water bodies and flow into rivers, resulting in eutrophication of water bodies. Increasing the application of organic fertilizer is one of the important methods to reduce water pollution.



The High Growth of Logistics and Last Mile Delivery Market in China



According to research done by Reportlinker.com (https://www.reportlinker.com/p05819554/Global-Last-Mile-Delivery-Industry.html?utm_source=GNW), the global last mile delivery market is estimated to reach USD 53.4 billion by 2027. China, the world’s second largest economy is expected to reach a market size of USD 9.3 billion by the year 2027, representing a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 7.1% over the analysis period of 2020 to 2027.



With Muliang Viagoo’s last mile delivery platform, we are in a good position to aggregate the carriers and merchant’s orders by taking advantage of route optimization and tracking technologies to drive down the cost per delivery. The platform has the ability to expand beyond Muliang’s business network of organic fertilizer supplies to food distribution, restaurants, and eCommerce merchants.

Our Products 



We are committed to ensuring the quality of our agricultural products. We aim to provide high-quality and environmentally friendly organic straw fertilizer for our customers. Our organic fertilizers are the products of natural decomposition and are easy for plants to absorb and digest. Our powder form fertilizer maximizes the survival rate of microorganisms, ensures faster nutrient absorption, and increases soil improvement seed and processing productivity. While we are primarily engaged in producing organic fertilizers, we also sell agriculture food products such as apples. We generated our revenue mainly from our organic fertilizers, which constituted approximately 91.5% and 94.5% of our total revenue for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The sales of apples generated less than 1% of our total revenue for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. In addition, we invested in the construction of a deep-processing slaughterhouse which is expected to have the capacity of slaughtering 200,000 black goats per year in Chuxiong City, Yunnan Province, China. We expect to complete the construction in June 2022 and start generating revenues from the black goat processing products in the third quarter of 2022. The rest of our revenues for the last two fiscal years comes from the sales of agricultural foods as an intermediate sales agent for large diary companies in China such as Bright Dairy & Food Co., Ltd., and Mengniu Dairy industry Limited.
Organic Fertilizer



Our fertilizer products are sold under our brand names “Zongbao,” “Fukang,” and “Muliang.” There are seven lines of our organic fertilizers including:




● | Soil improvement and preparation fertilizer, which includes compound microbes, probiotics that can supplement microorganisms and trace elements of soil. It can be used as both starter fertilizer and regular fertilizer; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Root protection fertilizer, which is an organic nutrient water-soluble fertilizer that can help the growth of crops’ roots; 
● | Foliar nutrition fertilizer, which is a biological growth promoter to help customers take care of the foliar of their plants; 
● | Lower pesticide residue fertilizer, which can help our customers reduce the usage of pesticide and enhance the resistance ability for plants; 
● | Fruit special fertilizer which contains enhanced nutrient availability to increase plant performance; 
● | Fruit tree fertilizer that promotes healthy roots and fruit growth and are ideal for all fruit trees and berries; and 
● | Corn and peanuts fertilizer that are specially used for corns and peanuts. 




Our organic fertilizer contains all-purpose nutrition that can be used in the different stages of plant growth. It aims to increase soil fertility, improve soil aggregate structure, provide nutrient absorption ability for crop, improve water retention capacity and improve fertilizer utilization, thus creating a sustainable environment and healthy soil.



Apple Orchard 



In 2014, we leased 350 mu (about 57.66 acres) of mountainous land as an apple farm and, for the purpose of using our own fertilizer to demonstrate the advantages of our organic straw fertilizer. The selling of apples generated less than 1% of our total revenue for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. As the apple trees become more mature, we expect to generate more revenues from the sales of apples in the future.
Other Agricultural products



We are also acting as intermediate sales agent for the agricultural products from large agricultural products companies, such as Bright Dairy & Food Co., Ltd., Mengniu Dairy industry Limited, Haitian Flavoring & Food Co., Ltd. and Hangzhou Wahaha Group, etc.

Future Products



Black Goat Processing Products



Currently we invested in a goat slaughtering and processing factory located in Shuangbai County, Chuxiong City, Yunnan Province, PRC starting in 2018. This factory is expected to be completed in June 2022 with a capacity of deep processing of 200,000 black goats per year. Our products will include goat riblets, goat loin roast, goat loin chops, goat rack, goat leg, goat shoulder, goat leg shanks, ground goat, goat stew meat, whole goat, half goat, and lamb viscera, etc. We expect to commence sales of black goat processing products and start generating revenue in the third quarter of 2022.
Forage Grass



We are exploring the options to use forage grass as an alternative for traditional feed for live-stocks. We currently have several research and development projects with schools and institutions. See “Research and Development” below.
Integration with Viagoo



The Viagoo business model includes the following main revenue streams. Viagoo Transport Marketplace (VTM) – This is the transaction platform for shippers and carriers to list and accept delivery jobs. The platform provides sharing functions where a group of shippers can share the transport fleet to some common places (e.g. shopping malls in the city). This service will reduce the waiting time and fuels, resulting in huge cost savings.

● | VTM provides single job and bulk orders or API connection for job posting. The fees are pre-calculated based on distance, areas, volume matric weight, types of goods, delivery options and time. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Task tracking – Shippers can track the delivery status if the option for tracking is required. 
● | eWallet option – eWallet will be used for the service purpose and payment will be deducted from the eWallet stored value. 
● | Reports – Delivery reports are available for shippers to track the performance and status of the delivery operation. 




VTM is charged to carriers based on certain percentage of the freight charges. Other add-on services like online insurance, rest stop services will be a percentage charged to the service providers.



Viagoo Enterprise Services (VES) - is a cloud based service that provides operations management to support the Transport and Logistics team. With the use of the various modules, the carrier’s transport management is able to greatly optimize its resources and achieve higher efficiency.




● | Automatic Scheduling – Delivery / Invoice data will be pushed to the VES for automatic schedule to the driver via VES mobile app. The criteria of automatic scheduling are based on location, time preference, route zoning. These criteria can be configured and fine-tuned as the business progresses. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Route Optimization – The system is able to automatically calculate the best routes based on various delivery points and constraints such as “time window”. With route optimization, the transport planner is able to handle new delivery addresses dynamically. Also if there is a change in delivery plan due to various unforeseen circumstances such as vehicle breakdown, customer last minute cancellation, the system is able to re-optimize quickly by pushing a button. 
● | VES Driver app - Task tracking – Once the tasks are started, they will be tracked till the jobs are completed. If e-sign is accepted, customers can sign and acknowledge the acceptance of goods using VES mobile sign feature built into the app or by taking a photo of the signed invoices or deliver orders (usually the last page of the document). 
● | Customer Notification – Customers will be notified via email upon the completion of the delivery. A copy of the invoice / delivery order along with the signed copies will be sent to customers (customer email list to be maintained in the system) via email. 





8








● | Reports – Delivery reports are available for operations managers to track the performance and status of the delivery operations. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | VES Temperature Sensor Tracking Services – This is an additional module for real-time tracking of temperature control (via a GPS temperature tracking device installed in the truck) trucks for the purpose of preventing food waste and ensuring food safety. 




VES is charged based on a monthly subscription by vehicles and by users. It is integrated with VTM and jobs received via VTM can be assigned and tracked automatically by VES.



Enterprise Systems – This is a project-based system integration. The Enterprise system is charged based on project price and annual maintenance service fees. As Viagoo smart logistics platform gains acceptance in local markets, we expect business opportunities to arise for us to custom build enterprise solutions in the healthcare as well as logistic sectors. For example, Parkway Pantai Singapore is using us to custom build the online logistic job assignment and tracking of lab sample collection / delivery between clinics / hospitals and lab. This is to facilitate efficient deployment of the delivery resources and to ensure compliance is achieved in a tightly controlled fashion.



Viagoo’s 1st tier technology platform, codename VES (Viagoo Enterprise System) enables onboarding customers to seamlessly embark on a digital transformation path to reduce costs and increase efficiencies with quick ROI (return of investments) and total cost of ownership (TCO). Customers using VES effectively transformed their operations digitally instantly by having full visibility and full control of operations, underpinned by logistical movements, traceability, status reporting, communications, operations planning and data analytics for key business decisions.



Viagoo platform (VES) is currently used by ST Synthesis, Horme Hardware, Strategic Marketing, Parkway Pantai, Bridgestone, Skyfast, Impetus, KL Enviro, PN-I, P5, Servtouch and many others. Canon Singapore, Canon Malaysia, Ibiz (Navision ERP Vendor), Konica Minolta Singapore are new partners onboarded as resellers of Viagoo VES.



Viagoo has recently completed the development of the 2nd tier technology platform primarily for the “Transport Market Place Community.” Coined as VTM (Viagoo Transportation Marketplace), the purpose is to allow “trading collaboration, transportation crowd sourcing and resource sharing”. It creates a transport crowdsourcing eco-system between vested partners, stakeholders, fleet owners, retailers, online shops, transport owners in which they can co-share resources to resolve transport inadequacies and achieve a demand to supply equilibrium.



Transport inadequacies are caused by various reasons such as surges in delivery demand because of seasonal or festivities or simply sudden business growth. Another key pain point is where delivery trips in large countries often result in empty return trips. For long geographical distances, some one way delivery trips can log up to hundreds of kilometres but with empty return trips resulting in wastage of time, fuel and money. Empty trips can be filled up through a robust job sourcing system, by way of “jobs versus transports sourcing” via intelligent matching, an effective booking system and a payment gateway system, which now is a reality made possible through the technology cornerstone of VTM.



Viagoo has also just recently marked its roadmap milestone with the 3rd tier technology through the launch of “Viamove”. Soft-launched in May 2020, Viamove is the “Last mile on-demand delivery service” in Singapore using the VTM technology. This platform was a testbed amidst the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic hard hitting local economy and businesses. On the contrary, Viamove has attested to the growth potential by remaining relatively unscathed despite COVID-19’s relentless hit on many businesses.



Over 200 merchants and 300 freelance delivery agents have signed up since its launch. The testbed yielded promising results and hence Viagoo is looking at expanding into “next day and international delivery” through our delivery partners to broaden the business horizon. To enhance the business model, the team is working on two hour same day island wide delivery which is suitable for food, medical, and perishable products.



To solidify its partnership and brand building objectives, Viagoo is actively working with Enterprise Singapore, a local government agency, to support the efficient use of transport resources. In addition, Viagoo is partnering with the Singapore Logistics Association to support her members in promoting the online integration with local eCommerce portals to enable them to fulfil the services via Viagoo’s digital platform.


The strong growth of e-Commerce in the South East Asia market could exceed USD 200 billion by 2025 (https://www.temasek.com.sg/en/news-and-views/stories/future/Southeast-Asia-accelerating-internet-economy). With a population of 630 million in Association of Southeast Asia Nations (ASEAN) alone, 163 million households are expected to have income capacity for discretionary spending (https://www.iseas.edu.sg/images/pdf/TRS1_18.pdf). As such the need for logistics services will push for the demand for efficiency in this sector.

The opportunities to improve performance to better serve customers using digital platforms remain elusive to small and medium enterprises (SMEs) despite vast support from local government agencies. This is seen particularly in logistics operations in many SMEs. The shippers are finding difficulties in efficiently managing delivery and storage resources and as a result they are incurring heavy costs in maintaining these resources. Customers now expect to get shipments faster, have more flexibility, and more transparency at a lower price. B2B customers are facing far faster expectations around efficiency and performance than ever before.



An inefficient delivery also results in high wastage of fuels and contributes to avoidable environmental pollution. Carriers and logistic service providers are facing similar problems in adopting digital technology as the high costs of implementing and maintaining such systems has proven to be a big challenge for stakeholders. Defining a clear digital strategy that’s integrated into business strategy is critical. Digital is still a challenge in logistics space, and there are vast opportunities to improve performance and serve customers better. In addition, logistics sectors have substantial benefits in having more consolidation. However, fragmentation, accountability, and a lack of consistency make collaboration more difficult.



Viagoo logistic platform aims to provide a solution for shippers to easily optimize the logistics resources by either listing their assets in the platform for other shippers to book or request the logistic services via the platform. The flexible sharing model ensures shippers and carriers are able to get the best deals so as to reduce the cost by maximizing utilization of the unused resources.



Our Technology and Manufacturing Process



We utilize our patented technologies to process crop straws into organic fertilizer.



Crop straws include the stems, roots, leaves, pods and vines of crops. The main ingredients are cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin, as well as a small amount of minerals. Straw is a crude fiber material that is waxy and lignified. The fermentation cycle is long for the straw to be processed into organic fertilizer, as it takes 15 days to 60 days for microbial action. This is a common challenge for the large-scale and timely manufacturing of straw fertilizer.



The crop straws will be processed into a nutrient-rich organic fertilizer in a closed container by low-pressure, medium-temperature acid hydrolysis technology (with 9-to-13-kg pressure and at 150-to-180-degree temperature). The basic principle is as follows:



We utilize cellulose hydrolysis, hemicellulose hydrolysis and lignin hydrolysis methods to process cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin into short-chain cellulose, polysaccharide, monosaccharide, oligomer, etc. Based on the demand for our organic fertilizers and the controlled processing conditions, on average our methods produce a mix with a majority of short-chain cellulose, some polysaccharides and a small amount of monosaccharides.



The straws are stored in our warehouse after compacting them in a briquetting machine. The straw compacts are easy to transfer and occupy less storage space. The straw compacts will be first crushed to 3 cm to 5 cm in length. The straws are then processed in the hydrothermal degradation tank for 2 to 3 hours. We pump steam generated by a boiler into the hydrothermal degradation tank, so that the temperature in the hydrothermal degradation tank is maintained between 150°C and 180°C and the pressure is maintained at 0.9-1.3MPa. After 2-3 hours of thermal degradation, we release the pressure to 0.2~0.4MPa. By releasing the pressure, the straws explode to the storage tank, resulting in a mechanical treatment of the explosion impinging stream, breaking the cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin in the straw, breaking the hydrogen bonds, degrading fiber crystallization regions into an amorphous stage and degrading macromolecules into micro-molecules. After that, we add different auxiliary materials through an automatic batching system to make different organic fertilizers suitable for different crops. We then repeat a process of crushing, granulating, cooling and screening before packaging the fertilizers into products.

Our Growth Strategy



We intend to build upon our proven ability to produce high-quality organic fertilizer and increase our presence and market share in the agriculture industry. We have begun to implement the growth strategies described below and expect to continue to do so over the several years following this offering. Although the net proceeds of this offering will be available to assist us to implement our growth strategies, we cannot estimate the ultimate amount of capital needed to achieve our expected growth. We may need additional capital to implement these strategies, particularly in the event we pursue acquisitions of complementary businesses or technologies.
Scale Up Production of Organic Fertilizer and Accelerate Penetration in Local and Regional Markets 



We plan to construct a new organic fertilizer factory in Heilongjiang Province, China. We have entered into a strategic cooperation agreement with Suihua City of Heilongjiang Province to produce a total of 1 million tons of organic fertilizer. We expect to produce 70,000 tons of organic fertilizer in 2022 and the remaining within the next 5 years. In addition, we will establish warehouse and distribution center in Heilongjiang Province, which is expected to accelerate penetration in the local and regional market.
Increase Sources of Revenue by Expanding Our Current Business 



We have a slaughtering and processing plant for black goats under construction in Yunnan Province, China. We expect the plant to begin operations in June 2022 and start generating revenue in the third quarter of 2022. Demand for lamb in China as an alternative to pork is increasing due to growing concern on swine disease and pork quality. We plan to offer lamb and lamb products to consumers via a subscription program available on our website and mobile app in the future.
Continue to Invest in Research and Development and Expand Our Product Portfolio 



We have invested significant capital in the development and improvement of our products. One of the R&D results introduced us to a type of forage grass that contains 30% more protein than other crops. We plan to work with the forage grass farmers in Xinjiang Province and to produce plant protein powder from the forage grass to be used in food and beverages in 2022.
Growth Strategy in Viagoo Online Smart Logistics



The Chinese smart logistics industry reached a total size of USD 37 billion in 2017 and is projected to reach a size of USD 135 billion by the year 2024. (https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20190903005657/en/China-Smart-Logistics-Market-Report-2019-Industry)



As of 2018, there were 25.68 million registered trucks in China based on data shown in Statista.com. To ride on the growth trend and capitalize the emerging growth potential, Muliang Viagoo will be implementing the Viagoo Technology platform in China and targeting the China fleet owners and truck drivers.



The Viagoo VTM is a very apt and synergistic logistic platform for the Chinese logistic market as it has huge geographical distance and a huge population of truck drivers. They can collaborate by job listings/postings, sub listings and job bookings in a resource sharing model. Muliang Viagoo can potentially extend to seek further value-added revenue streams deriving, for example, from insurance and soliciting job bookings.



Mitigating empty return trips for truck drivers and fleet operators is a key reason to join and onboard our VTM platform as it leads to cost reductions and added revenue. The onboarding of retailers, malls, and ecommerce (shippers) who are the source of demand generation in tandem with truck drivers and fleet owners (the carriers) are the fulfilment of demand, hence forming a sought-after business equilibrium.



With Muliang Viagoo’s connections to farms, malls, logistics service providers in conjunction with VTM platform, we are well poised to pave way to gain quicker inroads into China logistic markets to seek business growth as planned.



As for South East Asia, third party logistics market accounted for US$ 36.4 billion in 2017 and is expected to grow at a CAGR of 5.5% over the forecast period 2018-2025, to account for US$ 55.7 billion in 2025. Viagoo platform is well positioned in the regional technology hub of ASEAN and we are targeting to have a strong growth in these markets. 





12







In China, we plan to adopt a three phases approach. In phase 1, the platform will be opened to Muliang’s businesses and business partners. The platform will enable participating merchants to take advantage of Viagoo’s digital technology to improve efficiency and lower costs. We plan to onboard truck drivers to the platform to list their services. To entice the drivers to join, we plan to partner with local insurance and finance companies to offer discounts in insurance coverage and truck leasing.



In phase 2, we plan to use data analytics technology to provide forecasts on supply and demand across provinces and delivery locations. With the improved data, the platform services is expected to expand the market coverage to other cities and provinces. We plan to deploy blockchain technology to enhance data and transaction security. Using a distributed ledger, the data is protected and transparent between the respective stakeholders.



In phase 3, we plan to expand the partner network to include other supportive merchants to offer their services at the key rest stops across the strategic locations.



Outside China, we plan to work with joint venture partners in target countries to establish our platform services. This is to ensure a quick deployment of the services and reduce the political and cultural differences. The target countries include Malaysia, Hong Kong SAR, and Indonesia.



We also plan to look at introducing specialized services such as medicine delivery linking to hospital and clinical systems for on demand dispensing.

Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act



U.S. laws and regulations, including the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act, or HFCAA, may restrict or eliminate our ability to complete a business combination with certain companies, particularly those acquisition candidates with substantial operations in China.



On March 24, 2021, the SEC adopted interim final rules relating to the implementation of certain disclosure and documentation requirements of the HFCAA. An identified issuer will be required to comply with these rules if the SEC identifies it as having a “non-inspection” year under a process to be subsequently established by the SEC. In June 2021, the United States Senate has passed the Accelerating Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act, which, if signed into law, would reduce the time period for the delisting of foreign companies under the HFCAA to two consecutive years instead of three years. If our auditor cannot be inspected by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, or the PCAOB, for two consecutive years, the trading of our securities on any U.S. national securities exchanges, as well as any over-the-counter trading in the U.S., will be prohibited. On September 22, 2021, the PCAOB adopted a final rule implementing the HFCAA, which provides a framework for the PCAOB to use when determining, as contemplated under the HFCAA, whether the PCAOB is unable to inspect or investigate completely registered public accounting firms located in a foreign jurisdiction because of a position taken by one or more authorities in that jurisdiction. On December 2, 2021, the SEC issued amendments to finalize rules implementing the submission and disclosure requirements in the HFCA Act. The rules apply to registrants that the SEC identifies as having filed an annual report with an audit report issued by a registered public accounting firm that is located in a foreign jurisdiction and that PCAOB is unable to inspect or investigate completely because of a position taken by an authority in foreign jurisdictions. On December 16, 2021, the PCAOB issued a report on its determinations that it is unable to inspect or investigate completely PCAOB-registered public accounting firms headquartered in mainland China and in Hong Kong, because of positions taken by PRC authorities in those jurisdictions.



Our auditor, WWC, P.C., has been inspected by the PCAOB on a regular basis with the last inspection conducted during November 2021. As of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, WWC, P.C., our auditor, is not subject to the determinations as to inability to inspect or investigate registered firms completely announced by the PCAOB on December 16, 2021.



The recent developments would add uncertainties to our offering and we cannot assure you whether Nasdaq or regulatory authorities would apply additional and more stringent criteria to us after considering the effectiveness of our auditor’s audit procedures and quality control procedures, adequacy of personnel and training, or sufficiency of resources, geographic reach or experience as it relates to the audit of our financial statements.



Transfers of Cash to and from Our Subsidiaries



Muliang is a holding company with no operations of its own. We conduct our operations in China primarily through our subsidiary and VIE in China. As a result, although other means are available for us to obtain financing at the holding company level, Muliang’s ability to pay dividends to its shareholders and to service any debt it may incur may depend upon dividends paid by our PRC subsidiaries and license and service fees paid by our PRC consolidated affiliated entities. If any of our subsidiaries incurs debt on its own in the future, the instruments governing such debt may restrict its ability to pay dividends to Muliang. In addition, our PRC subsidiary and VIE are required to make appropriations to certain statutory reserve funds, which are not distributable as cash dividends except in the event of a liquidation of the companies.



Current PRC regulations permit our indirect PRC subsidiaries to pay dividends to Shanghai Mufeng only out of their accumulated profits, if any, determined in accordance with Chinese accounting standards and regulations. In addition, each of our subsidiaries in China is required to set aside at least 10% of its after-tax profits each year, if any, to fund a statutory reserve until such reserve reaches 50% of its registered capital. Each of such entity in China is also required to further set aside a portion of its after-tax profits to fund the employee welfare fund, although the amount to be set aside, if any, is determined at the discretion of its board of directors. Although the statutory reserves can be used, among other ways, to increase the registered capital and eliminate future losses in excess of retained earnings of the respective companies, the reserve funds are not distributable as cash dividends except in the event of liquidation.




15







The PRC government also imposes controls on the conversion of RMB into foreign currencies and the remittance of currencies out of the PRC. Therefore, we may experience difficulties in completing the administrative procedures necessary to obtain and remit foreign currency for the payment of dividends from our profits, if any. Furthermore, if our subsidiaries in the PRC incur debt on their own in the future, the instruments governing the debt may restrict their ability to pay dividends or make other payments. If we or our subsidiaries are unable to receive all of the revenues from our operations through the current VIE Agreements, we may be unable to pay dividends on our common stock.



Cash dividends, if any, on our common stock will be paid in U.S. dollars. If we are considered a PRC tax resident enterprise for tax purposes, any dividends we pay to our overseas shareholders may be regarded as China-sourced income and as a result may be subject to PRC withholding tax at a rate of up to 10.0%.



In order for us to pay dividends to our shareholders, we will be dependent on payments made from Shanghai Muliang to Shanghai Mufeng, pursuant to VIE Agreements between them, and the distribution of such payments to Muliang HK as dividends from Shanghai Mufeng. Certain payments from Shanghai Muliang to Shanghai Mufeng are subject to PRC taxes, including business taxes and VAT. During the year ended September 31, 2021 and 2020, Shanghai Muliang made no payments to Shanghai Mufeng. For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, there was no cash transferred between the Company and Shanghai Muliang (our VIEs).



For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, none of the VIE and its subsidiaries have issued any dividends or distributions to respective holding companies, or to any investors as of the date of this prospectus. Our subsidiaries in the PRC generate and retain cash generated from operating activities and re-invest it in our business.



Muliang is permitted under the laws of the state of Nevada to provide funding to Muliang HK through loans or capital contributions without restrictions on the amount of the funds. Muliang HK is permitted under the respective laws of Hong Kong to provide funding to Shanghai Mufeng through dividend distribution without restrictions on the amount of the funds.



To transfer cash from Muliang HK to Shanghai Mufeng, Muliang HK can increase its registered capital in WFOE, which requires a filing with the local commerce department, or through a shareholder loan, which requires a filing with the State Administration of Foreign Exchange or its local bureau. Aside from the declaration to the State Administration of Foreign Exchange, there is no restriction or limitations on such cash transfer or earnings distribution.



To transfer cash from Shanghai Mufeng to Shanghai Muliang, Shanghai Mufeng can increase its registered capital in Shanghai Muliang, which requires a filing with the local commerce department, or through a shareholder loan to Shanghai Muliang, which requires a filing with the State Administration of Foreign Exchange or its local bureau. Aside from the declaration to the State Administration of Foreign Exchange, there is no restriction or limitations on such cash transfer or earnings distribution. However, our PRC subsidiaries may not procure loans which exceed the difference between their respective registered capital and total investment amount as recorded in the Foreign Investment Comprehensive Management Information System.



To make loans to Muliang HK, Shanghai Mufeng or Shanghai Muliang, according to Matters relating to the Macro-prudential Management of Comprehensive Cross-border Financing, or PBOC Circular 9 promulgated by the People’s Bank of China, the total cross-border financing of a company shall be calculated using a risk-weighted approach and shall not exceed an upper limit. The upper limit shall be calculated as capital or assets (for enterprises, net assets shall apply) multiplied by a cross-border financing leverage ratio and multiplied by a macro-prudential regulation parameter. The macro-prudential regulation parameter is currently 1, which may be adjusted by the People’s Bank of China and the State Administration of Foreign Exchange in the future, and the cross-border financing leverage ratio is 2 for enterprises. Therefore, the upper limit of the loans that a PRC company can borrow from foreign companies shall be calculated at 2 times the borrower’s net assets. When Shanghai Mufeng and Shanghai Muliang jointly apply for borrowing foreign debt, the upper limit of borrowing shall be 2 times of the net assets in the consolidated financial statement, and Shanghai Muliang shall make a commitment to refrain from borrowing foreign debt in their own respective names.



For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, Muliang and its subsidiaries have not distributed any earnings or settled any amounts owed under the previous VIE Agreements. nor does Muliang and its subsidiaries have any plan to distribute earnings or settle amounts in the foreseeable future.
