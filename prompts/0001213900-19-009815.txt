Overview

Majesco is a California corporation which was incorporated in April 1992 under the name Mastek Software, Inc. In 1995, this name was changed to Majesco Software, Inc., which was changed to MajescoMastek in 2006 and to Majesco in October 2014.
 
Our principal offices are located at 412 Mount Kemble Ave., Suite 110C, Morristown, NJ 07960, and our telephone number is (973) 461-5200. Our principal website is www.majesco.com.

Majesco Limited
 
Majesco Limited (“Majesco Limited”), a public limited company domiciled in India whose equity shares are listed on the BSE Limited (Bombay Stock Exchange) and the National Stock Exchange of India Limited, currently owns 70.16% of our issued and outstanding common stock.
 
Previously, Majesco was 100% owned (directly and indirectly) by Mastek Limited (“Mastek”), a public limited company domiciled in India whose equity shares are listed on the BSE Limited and the National Stock Exchange of India Limited.
 
Pursuant to a de-merger process which was completed on June 1, 2015, Mastek’s insurance-related business was separated from Mastek’s non-insurance related businesses and all insurance-related operations of Mastek that were not directly owned by Majesco were contributed to Majesco (such de-merger and reorganization process is referred to in this Annual Report on Form 10-K as the “Majesco Reorganization”).
 
In connection with the de-merger, 81.92% of Mastek’s then ownership interest in Majesco was transferred to a newly-formed company in India, called Majesco Limited, which was spun-off from Mastek. Mastek continues to own a 11.76% indirect minority interest in Majesco through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Mastek (UK) Ltd.

Exaxe Acquisition 
 
On November 27, 2018 we entered into a share purchase agreement (the “SPA”) for the acquisition of all the issued share capital (collectively, the “Securities”) of Exaxe Holdings Limited, a private limited company incorporated in Ireland (“Exaxe”). Exaxe is an EMEA (Europe, the Middle East and Africa) based cloud software leader in the life, pensions and wealth management segment.  Headquartered in Dublin, Ireland, Exaxe serves a growing list of top European individual life, pensions and wealth management insurers. This acquisition will strengthen and expand the Group’s software offerings in EMEA for the individual life, pensions and wealth management market while complementing the Group’s software and Group focused customer base in the UK. On November 27, 2018, we consummated the purchase of 90% of the Securities. We have agreed to purchase, and the sellers have agreed to sell to us, the remaining 10% of the Securities on August 1, 2019.
 
In consideration for the purchase of the Securities, on November 27, 2018, we paid the sellers EUR 6,392. In addition, we agreed to make an additional payment to the sellers of EUR 717 for the remainder of the Securities on August 1, 2019. We also agreed to make certain earnout payments to the sellers if certain adjusted EBITDA (as defined in the SPA) targets for Exaxe are met.
 
We always look at additional acquisitions to complement our service offerings and growth strategy. Our success, in the near term, will depend, in large part, on our ability to: (a) successfully integrate our acquisitions into our business, (b) build up momentum for new sales, (c) cross-sell to existing customers and (d) exceed customer satisfaction through our state of the art products and solutions.
 
Cover-All Technologies Merger
 
On June 26, 2015, Cover-All Technologies Inc. (“Cover-All”), a provider of core insurance software and business analytics solution primarily focused on commercial lines for the P&C insurance industry, merged into Majesco, with Majesco as the surviving corporation.
 
Cover-All’s customers included insurance companies, agents, brokers and managing general agents (“MGAs”) throughout the United States and Puerto Rico. Cover-All’s software solutions and services are designed to enable customers to introduce new products quickly, expand their distribution channels, reduce costs and improve service to their customers. Cover-All’s business analytics solution enables customers to leverage their information assets for real time business insights and for better risk selection, pricing and financial reporting.
 
In connection with the merger, we listed our common stock on the NYSE American under the symbol “MJCO” and began trading under this symbol following the consummation of the merger. Effective on February 26, 2019, we transferred the listing of our common stock and began trading on the Nasdaq Global Market under the symbol “MJCO.”
 
Agile Asset Acquisition
 
On January 1, 2015, we acquired substantially all of the insurance consulting business of Agile Technologies LLC, a business and technology management consulting firm (“Agile”).
 
Through this acquisition, we acquired the insurance-focused business and IT consulting business of Agile, as well as business transformation and process optimization capabilities, strategy enablement for data and digital and data services including data management and architecture strategy and services. In connection with this acquisition, over 55 insurance technology professionals and other personnel formerly employed or engaged by Agile became employees or independent contractors of Majesco. This acquisition also resulted in the addition of approximately 20 customers to our customer base. In connection with this acquisition, we assumed office leases under which Agile was lessee in New Jersey, Georgia and Ohio, and acquired certain trademarks, service marks, domain names and the business process framework of Agile.

Accordingly, references in this Annual Report on Form 10-K to “fiscal 2019” mean the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019, references to “fiscal 2018” mean the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018, references to “fiscal 2017” mean the fiscal year ended March 31, 2017, references to “fiscal 2016” mean the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016 and references to “fiscal 2015” mean the fiscal year ended March 31, 2015.
Business
 
We have been operating in the insurance industry for more than twenty-five years, successfully partnering with market leading insurance companies, large brokers, MGAs and reinsurers to enable them to modernize their business by replacing legacy systems in a private or public cloud to keep and grow today’s business, optimize their business by implementing data and digital capabilities to protect and grow their customer base, and create their new business for tomorrow by launching new business models and innovative products, reach new markets and expand distribution channels to capture a new generation of customers.
 
We provide technology, expertise, and leadership that helps insurers modernize, innovate and connect to build the future of their business and the industry at speed and scale. We do this by providing technology that connects people and businesses to insurance in ways that are innovative, hyper-relevant, compelling and personal. Our portfolio of solutions enable our customers to respond to evolving market needs, growth and innovation opportunities and regulatory changes, which enables agility, innovation and speed while improving the effectiveness and efficiency of their business operations. We offer a portfolio of platform solutions for all lines of business and all tiers of insurers, MGAs, brokers and reinsurers. The portfolio includes core insurance platform solutions for policy, rating, underwriting, billing, claims, distribution management, digital, data and analytics and an ecosystem of partners with “apps” that provide access to innovative data sources and capabilities.
 
Long-term, strong customer relationships are a key component of our success given the long-term nature of our contracts, and provide an opportunity for deeper relationships using our portfolio of solutions. They provide critical customer references for new sales. Our customers range from some of the largest global tier one insurers, brokers and reinsurers in the industry to mid-market insurers, MGAs, startups and greenfields across all lines of business. As of March 31, 2019, we served approximately 200 insurance companies on a worldwide basis. For fiscal 2018, fiscal 2017, fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2015, we served approximately 160, 148, 149 and 108 insurance companies on a worldwide basis, respectively.
 
We generate revenue from our global software product led business, including insurance delivery and consulting services. The software business is primarily driven through deployment on the cloud or on-premise deployment. Over the last few quarters, we have seen a significant shift in demand for the cloud model over the on-premise model. The shift to cloud offers speed to value, including speed to implementation, speed to market and speed to revenue with low upfront investments for the customer. The revenues from the cloud model are driven by monthly subscriptions on deployment. The on-premise model generates revenues from the licensing of our proprietary software (perpetual or annual license fees) which includes base product support as well. Our portfolio of solutions offers rich, out-of-the-box content and capabilities that can be rapidly deployed on the cloud or on-premise and from which the customer can derive value on day one. The customer may also elect to engage Majesco for configuration and customer specific services work as needed for both modes of deployment. License fees, support and maintenance and cloud subscription fees are usually managed through multi-year agreements, typically over a period of five to seven years.

Overview of the Insurance Industry
 
The insurance industry is large, fragmented, highly regulated and complex, and in the midst of profound change fueled by trends including people, technology and market boundaries that are converging and pushing a sometimes slow-to-adapt industry. The pace of change and disruption is creating leaps in innovation, challenging traditional business assumptions, operations, processes and products of the last 30 to 50 years. Increasing competition, emergence of InsurTech, emerging technologies, new customer behaviors and changing customer expectations are pushing insurers, MGAs, brokers and reinsurers to make their business more agile, drive speed to market for new products, reach new markets, expand channels and respond quickly to market changes in a new digital era of insurance.
 
In late 2018, A.M. Best released the results of a global insurance survey regarding insurers’ attitudes toward innovation. A key finding was that “nearly 9 out of 10 respondents from more than 450 insurance companies said that innovation was moderately to extremely critical to their organization’s success.” However, “only 25 percent of insurers said they were willing to significantly disrupt their current processes for innovation initiatives.”
 
As a result, many insurers are experiencing increased operational risk and financial loss due to the inadequacy of their existing legacy core systems to meet the needs of a new digital era of insurance. The inherent functional and technical limitations of these systems have impeded insurers’ ability to innovate and grow profitability while continuously adapting to the rapidly evolving expectations of consumers, commercial and government insurance customers. Most organizations cannot simply flip off one switch (traditional business model and products administered on traditional systems) and flip another on (new business model and products on modern, flexible systems that will handle digital integration and better data acquisition and analysis). The shift will require steps. To grow and succeed in this new era, insurers are taking three paths to the future of insurance: modernizing, optimizing and creating new models.
 
These paths operate as both a bridge and a proving ground, with the traditional system still operational as a firm foundation while the new foundation for the future of insurance is being constructed.
 
Our Solutions
 
To enable insurers to make the shift, we provide technology, expertise, and leadership that helps insurers modernize, innovate and connect to build the future of their business and the industry at speed and scale.
 
Our solutions support a two speed strategy: Speed of Operations for the traditional business model with mature core systems and processes with incremental improvements and Speed of Innovation for agile, fast and minimum viable product (MVP) models to explore, test and learn new business opportunities. We provide core, digital and data insurance software solutions primarily via our managed cloud/SaaS model (private, public or hybrid) infrastructure and continue to offer our solutions via an on-premises license and support model, with the option to move to the cloud/SaaS model in the future. Our delivery and consulting services support our customers’ implementations and ongoing needs.
 
Our software solutions connect people and businesses to insurance in ways that are innovative, hyper-relevant, compelling and personal. These solutions are designed to provide insurance carriers with the core, digital and data capabilities required to effectively manage, grow and innovate their business at speed and scale to meet the fast changing market dynamics and opportunities. Our solutions are comprised primarily of:
 

● | core insurance software platform solutions for all lines of business in the insurance industry;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | digital engagement and microservices platform-as-a-service for the entire insurance business;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | an ecosystem of partner “apps” that provide innovative data sources and capabilities to extend the core systems;

● | Mergers and acquisitions (M&A) – We will continue to look at M&A opportunities with a focus on strategic tuck-ins, IP, high growth, high multiple emerging opportunities with strong next gen strategic positions; or larger, more mature businesses with stable and compelling revenue and EBITDA projections that provide adjacencies or new marker spaces.

Intellectual Property
 
We rely on a combination of contractual provisions and intellectual property laws to protect our proprietary technology. We believe that due to the dynamic nature of the computer and software industries, factors such as the knowledge and experience of our management and personnel, the frequency of product enhancements and the timeliness and quality of our support services are critical to the Company’s success.
 
We have registered the copyrights of our software products, and we seek to protect the source code of our products as trade secret information and as unpublished copyright work, although we often agree to place our source code into escrow in connection with entering into new customer agreements. We also rely on security and copy protection features in our proprietary software. We distribute our products under software license agreements which grant customers a personal, non-transferable license to use our products and contain terms and conditions prohibiting the unauthorized reproduction or transfer of our products. We do not hold any patents.

Competition
 
The insurance technology solution provider market is highly competitive and fragmented. The market is rapidly changing due to new technology, shifting customer needs, new customer expectations and introductions of new and innovative business models, products and services.
 
Based on our forward-thinking and research, we early on identified a technology shift from “old technology monolithic or componentized solutions primarily on-premise” to “modern technology componentized solutions moving to cloud, microservices and API” and now to “next generation” cloud, microservices, data/AI and API based solutions. Our solutions are in “modern” and “next-generation” categories.
 
As a result of this shift, our competitors vary in size and in the breadth and scope of the products and services offered based on these three categories, including traditional and new/startup competitors. Our current principal competitors include, but are not limited to, the following:
 

Area of Product/Service | Competitors 
------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
“Old” Technology | Guidewire Software, Inc., Insurity, Accenture, Sapiens International Corporation, Instec
“Modern” Technology | Duck Creek, InsurSoft, CodeObjects, FAST, Oracle, EIS 
“Next-Gen” Technology | Socotra, Britecore, Solartis, Instanda 

 
Some of our current and potential direct competitors have longer operating histories, significantly greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources than we do, greater brand recognition and, we believe, a larger base of customers. With our “modern and next-gen” platform and SaaS solutions, however, we believe that we have developed an edge as a quickly-evolving provider that combines deep experience with a commitment to supporting digital experimentation and emerging business models, helping insurers modernize, innovate and connect to build the future of their insurance at speed and scale.

Sales and Marketing
 
We market our solutions portfolio through an integrated sales and marketing platform through digital, direct and partner channels. Our direct sales are driven by our digital marketing creating queries (i.e. thought leadership downloads, website visits/inquiries, webinar registrations, SEO/SEM, social media, podcasts, email and more) that drive lead generation opportunity for qualification. Our client partners work with existing customers, and our direct sales teams work with assigned accounts to provide a consultative approach. Strategic partnerships are important to our sales efforts because they influence buying decisions, help us to identify sales opportunities and complement our software and services with their domain expertise and professional services capabilities.
 
We have a strategic marketing program that conducts a broad range of integrated marketing programs, campaigns and sales plays that leverage thought leadership and other content developed by us, including, press relations, media relations, industry research analyst relations, social media, industry tradeshows, roundtables, videos, webinars, podcasts, emails and website. We work closely with partners and other third parties to conduct joint marketing campaigns that generate growth in the sales pipeline.
 
At the end of 2018, we refreshed our brand and launched a new website.
 
Major Customers
 
As of March 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, our product line was in use in approximately 200, 160 and 148 insurance companies worldwide, respectively. We had one customer in fiscal 2019 and no customer in fiscal 2018 contributing 10% or more of total revenues.
 
For fiscal 2019, fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017 our top five customers generated approximately 28.6%, 28.4% and 27.1% of revenue, respectively. We expect that the top five customers will continue to account for a significant portion of revenue for the foreseeable future.
 
Backlog
 
As of March 31, 2019, we had unrecognized licenses and support services or professional services backlog of unbilled work totaling $96,900, which are expected to be recognized by March 31, 2020.
 
As of March 31, 2018, we had unrecognized licenses and support services or professional services backlog of unbilled work totaling $90,600, which we recognized as of March 31, 2019.
 
Research and Development
 
We continue to enhance the business and technical capabilities of our market leading solution portfolio for insurance carriers through consistent significant research and development (“R&D”) investment in core platform software, cloud, distribution, data, digital and services for innovative and scalable solutions. For fiscal 2019 we spent $19,289 on R&D compared to $17,250 in fiscal 2018.
 
The continued investments in R&D has enabled us to take our solutions based offerings and transform them in to out of the box, ready to use solutions which today has significantly shortened the time to deploy and increased the speed to value for the customer. We intend to continue to invest in our future roadmap to further bolster our portfolio of offerings in line with the future of insurance.
 
Capital Expenditures
 
As a growing company, we have on-going capital expenditure needs based on our short term and long term business plans. Although our requirements for capital expenses vary from time to time, for the next twelve months, we anticipate incurring capital expenditures of $3,000 to $4,000 for new business development activities and infrastructure enhancements.

We believe that our current cash balances and anticipated cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet our normal operating needs for at least the next twelve months. These projections include anticipated sales to new customers and upsell/cross sell to existing customers, the exact timing of which cannot be predicted with absolute certainty and can be influenced by factors outside our control. Our ability to fund our working capital needs and address planned capital expenditures will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future. We anticipate generating future working capital through sales to new customers and continued sales and services to our existing customers.
 
Our future liquidity and capital resource requirements will depend on many factors, including, but not limited to, the following trends and uncertainties we face and those described in “Item 1A. Risk Factors”:
 

● | Our ability to generate cash is subject to general economic, financial, competitive and other factors beyond our control.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Our need to invest resources in product development in order to continue to enhance our current products, develop new products, attract and retain customers and keep pace with competitive product introductions and technological developments.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | We experience competition in our industry and continuing technological changes.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Insurance companies typically are slow in making decisions and have numerous bureaucratic and institutional obstacles, which can make our efforts to attain new customers difficult.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | We compete on the basis of insurance knowledge, products, services, price, technological advances and system functionality and performance.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We do not expect for there to be a need for a change in the mix or relative cost of our sources of capital.
 
Employees
 
As of March 31, 2019, we had 2,682 full-time employees and no part-time employees on a worldwide basis. In addition, as of March 31, 2019, we actively received services from a total of 108 individuals in their capacities as independent contractors.
