ITEM 1. BUSINESS
 
In this Annual Report on Form 10-K (the “Form 10-K”), references to the “Company” and to “we,” “us,” and “our” refer to Union Acquisition Corp. II.
 
We are a Cayman Islands exempted company incorporated on December 6, 2018 for the purpose of entering into a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, recapitalization, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses or entities (a “business combination”). Our efforts to identify a prospective target business will not be limited to a particular industry or geographic location, although we intend to focus our search on businesses located in Latin America.
 
In December 2018, we issued 4,312,500 ordinary shares (“founder’s shares”) to Kyle Bransfield, our Chief Executive Officer, in exchange for a capital contribution of $25,000, or approximately $0.006 per share. In August 2019, we effected a share capitalization pursuant to which we issued an additional 718,750 ordinary shares, resulting in there being an aggregate of 5,031,250 founders’ shares outstanding. Mr. Bransfield then transferred 2,515,625 shares to each of our sponsors, Union Acquisition Associates II, LLC, an entity controlled by him, and Union Group International Holdings Limited (“Union Group”), an entity controlled by Juan Sartori, our Non-Executive Chairman of the Board. Union Acquisition Associates II, LLC and Union Group International Holdings Limited thereafter transferred an aggregate of 152,500 shares to our officers, directors, advisors, and their affiliates at the same price the shares were originally paid for by Mr. Bransfield.
 
On October 22, 2019, we consummated our initial public offering (“IPO”) of 20,000,000 units, including 2,500,000 units subject to the underwriters’ over-allotment option. Each unit consisted of one ordinary share and one redeemable warrant, with each warrant entitling the holder to purchase one ordinary share at a price of $11.50 per share. The units were sold at an offering price of $10.00 per unit, generating gross proceeds of $200,000,000.
 
Simultaneously with the consummation of the IPO, we consummated the private placement (“Private Placement”) of 6,250,000 warrants (“Private Placement Warrants”) at a price of $1.00 per Private Warrant, generating total proceeds of $6,250,000. The Private Placement Warrants were purchased by our sponsors. The Private Placement Warrants are identical to the Warrants sold in the IPO, except that the Private Placement Warrants are non-redeemable and may be exercised on a cashless basis, in each case so long as they continue to be held by the initial purchaser or its permitted transferees. The purchasers of the Private Placement Warrants have agreed not to transfer, assign, or sell any of the Private Placement Warrants or ordinary shares underlying the Private Placement Warrants (except to certain permitted transferees) until 30 days after the completion of our initial business combination.
 
Transaction costs to date amounted to $4,529,222, consisting of $4,000,000 of underwriting fees and $529,222 of other costs. In addition, $1,888,753 was held as cash outside of the trust account established in connection with the IPO and is available for working capital purposes.
 
For further details regarding our business, see the section titled “Proposed Business” contained in our prospectus dated October 17, 2019, incorporated by reference herein.
