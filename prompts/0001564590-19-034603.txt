Sales and Marketing
 We market our in-line and near-line products directly to end-user Original Equipment Manufacturer (“OEM”) customers and through manufacturing line builders and system integrators. We market our Coord3 CMM product line through both direct sales and value added resellers.
 Our principal customers for Measurement Solution products have historically been automotive manufacturing companies that we either sell to directly or through manufacturing line builders, system integrators or assembly equipment manufacturers.  These products are typically purchased for installation in connection with retooling programs undertaken by these companies.  Because sales are dependent on the timing of customers’ retooling programs, sales by customer vary significantly from year to year.  For our fiscal years 2019, 2018 and 2017, approximately 32%, 41% and 36%, respectively, of our Net Sales were derived from sales directly to our four largest automotive end-user customers.  We also sell to manufacturing line builders, system integrators and assembly equipment manufacturers, who in turn sell to our automotive customers.  For our fiscal years 2019, 2018 and 2017, approximately 9%, 7% and 11%, respectively, of our Net Sales were to manufacturing line builders, system integrators and original equipment manufacturers for the benefit of the same four largest automotive end-user customers in each respective year.  During our fiscal years 2019, 2018 and 2017, direct sales to Volkswagen Group accounted for approximately 13%, 15% and 16%, respectively, and direct sales to General Motors Company accounted for approximately 11%, 17% and 14%, respectively, of our Net Sales.  
Manufacturing and Suppliers
 Our manufacturing operations consist primarily of final assembly and calibration of hardware components and the development, testing and integration of our software with these hardware components.  We build our products from a combination of commercially available parts and uniquely designed and manufactured parts.  The components are primarily manufactured by third parties.  Individual components such as printed circuit boards are manufactured and supplied by third parties.  We believe a low level of vertical integration gives us significant manufacturing and inventory flexibility and minimizes total product costs.  
 We purchase certain component parts and assemblies from single and multi-source suppliers.  With respect to the majority of our components, we believe that alternative suppliers could be found if existing suppliers could not ship to us.  Many of our components are customized for our specific manufacturing needs.  Due to these specifications, various lead times would be required, based on the specific component that needed to be re-sourced.  Component supply shortages in certain industries, including the electronics industry, have occurred in the past and are possible in the future due to imbalances in supply and demand.  We use global purchasing sources to minimize the risk of part shortages.  We have not experienced significant component supply shortages from single source suppliers in recent years. Significant delays or interruptions in the delivery of components, assemblies or products by suppliers, or difficulties or delays in shifting manufacturing capacity to new suppliers, could have a material adverse effect on us.  
 Competition
 We believe our products provide cost-efficient and complete solutions for our customers in terms of system capabilities, level of support and competitive pricing for the value provided, which we believe are the principal competitive factors in our markets. We also believe the technology within our products is more advanced than our competition.
 There are a number of companies that sell similar and/or alternative technologies and methods into the same markets and regions as Perceptron. We believe there may be entities, some of which may be larger and have greater resources than our resources, that could develop technology and products which could prove to be competitive with us.   We also believe that certain existing or potential customers may be capable of internally developing their own technology.  See Item 1A: “Risk Factors” titled “There are a number of companies offering competitive products in our markets, or developing products to compete with our products, which could result in a reduction in our revenues through lost sales or a reduction in prices”.
 
Backlog
 Backlog represents orders or bookings we have received but have not yet been filled, that is, our unsatisfied performance obligations.  As of June 30, 2019, we had a backlog of $38.4 million, compared to $47.5 million at June 30, 2018.  As a result of our adoption of Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, as of July 1, 2018, our total backlog decreased by $3.8 million as of that date.  Most of our backlog is subject to cancellation or delay by the customer, often with limited or no penalties.  Historically, cancellations of orders once they have been booked have been very infrequent although several cancellations have occurred during the last two fiscal years.  The level of our backlog at any particular time is not necessarily indicative of our future operating performance.  We expect to be able to fill substantially all of the orders in our backlog by June 30, 2020.  See Note 3, of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers”, contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for our current expectation on the timing of the revenue recognition for our current backlog level.
