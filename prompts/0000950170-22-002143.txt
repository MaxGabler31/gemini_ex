Overview
Ceridian is a global human capital management (“HCM”) software company. Dayforce, our flagship cloud HCM platform, provides human resources (“HR”), payroll, benefits, workforce management, and talent management functionality. In addition to Dayforce, we sell Powerpay, a cloud HR and payroll solution for the Canadian small business market, through both direct sales and established partner channels. We also continue to support customers using our legacy North America Bureau solutions, which we generally stopped actively selling to new customers in 2012, following the acquisition of Dayforce, and customers using our acquired Bureau solutions which we also intend to stop actively selling to new customers on a stand-alone basis. We invest in maintenance and necessary updates to support our Bureau customers and continue to migrate them to Dayforce. Revenue from our Cloud and Bureau solutions include investment income generated from holding customer funds before funds are remitted to taxing authorities, also referred to as float revenue or float.
 Our five strategic growth levers drive our long-term perspectives, near-term decision making and stockholder alignment:
 •Acquiring new customers in the markets where we have seen success to date;
 •Extending the Dayforce platform, thereby allowing us to deliver more value to our current and prospective customers; 
 •Expanding within the Enterprise segment;
 •Accelerating our global expansion both by serving local customers in new geographies, and by extending our scope to service global multinational customers; and finally,
 •Driving incremental value for our customers by innovating in adjacent markets around our core HCM suite, such as the Dayforce Wallet. 
 Products and Services
 Dayforce
 Dayforce, our principal cloud HCM platform, is a single application that provides continuous real-time calculations across all modules to enable, for example, payroll administrators access to data through the entire pay period, and managers access to real-time data to optimize work schedules. Dayforce offers a comprehensive range of functionality, including global HR, payroll, benefits, workforce management, and talent management on web and native iOS and Android platforms. Our Dayforce mobile app enables employees not only to request and to trade schedules, but also to see the real-time impact of schedule changes on their pay. Our Dayforce platform is used by organizations, regardless of industry or size, to optimize management of the entire employee lifecycle, including attracting, engaging, paying, deploying, and developing their people. Key functionality of our Dayforce platform includes HR, payroll and tax, Dayforce Wallet, benefits, workforce management, and talent management. In 2021, we received several accolades for our Dayforce solution, including Leader in the 2021 Gartner Magic Quadrant for Cloud HCM Suites for the second consecutive year, and CIPD People Management Awards: Best Human Resources/Learning & Development Supplier; Human Resources Director Asia - 5 Star HR Software; Aite-Novarica Digital Wallet Impact Innovation Award - Dayforce Wallet; Leader in the Nucleus Research 2021 Human Capital Management Value Matrix.
Human Resources
 Dayforce Human Resources functionality provides customers with a single, complete record for all employees. Our HR functionality is centered on a comprehensive, flexible workflow engine that streamlines and automates administrative tasks.
Payroll and Tax
 Our payroll capabilities provide customers with the tools needed to manage their payroll processes accurately and in compliance. Through our Dayforce platform, users with localized payroll functionality are able to make updates to time and pay in real-time. In countries where we do not currently offer localized payroll within Dayforce, Dayforce

ConnectedPay provides payroll aggregation features that allow an organization to have a centralized view of their global payroll. ConnectedPay automates the data exchange with in-country payroll providers, including our global Cloud solutions from acquired businesses, and provides a consistent self-service experience for employees to view earnings statements and associated payroll documentation. Dayforce calculates, withholds, and files payroll related taxes in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Ireland, Australia, New Zealand, and Mauritius as part of our localized payroll offering. In 2021, we announced our plans to deliver Dayforce Payroll across new markets, including Germany, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan, and Thailand.
Dayforce Wallet
 Dayforce Wallet is a digital wallet for customers' employees on the Dayforce platform. The Dayforce Wallet offers the flexibility and convenience of processing and distributing customers’ different payment needs, including off-cycle pay and on-demand pay requests. Since all employee payments are processed as a regular payroll, the appropriate deductions, remittances, and garnishments are accounted for, which means there’s minimal impact to payroll administrators and our customers' cash flow.
 The Dayforce Wallet gives our customers’ employees greater control over their financial well-being by providing them with instant access to their earnings. The on-demand pay feature allows employees more choice over when they get paid by making any day payday. Dayforce Wallet enables workers to access their already-earned wages anytime during the pay period, net of taxes, withholdings and other payroll deductions. The on-demand wages are loaded onto a pay card, which customers’ employees can use anywhere credit or debit cards are accepted. With pay cards, the Dayforce Wallet eliminates the need to distribute paper checks and reduces processing costs. The Dayforce Wallet mobile app makes it easy for customers’ employees to check their pay deposits, account balance and transaction history. This provides the convenience of a traditional bank account, but without the balance minimums and monthly service fees.
 The Dayforce Wallet was launched in the U.S. in 2020 and in Canada in 2021. We continue to introduce new features and enhancements to the Dayforce Wallet, such as two day early direct deposit, which allows users that have direct deposit set up not only to get paid when they want, but also the option to receive the remainder of their paycheck two days in advance of normal payroll dates. Additional features, such as Streaming Pay, Dayforce Wallet Rewards, referrals, additional pay card functionality, buy now pay later, and saving goals will be introduced in the upcoming quarters. Streaming Pay enables customers’ employees the ability to request automatic delivery of earned wages to their Dayforce Wallet pay card, eliminating the need to request earnings on-demand. We believe these features will enhance our Dayforce Wallet consumer experience and help improve financial wellness over the long term.
 Benefits
 Dayforce Benefits assists users from benefits enrollment to ongoing benefits administration, including eligibility, open enrollment and Affordable Care Act (“ACA”) management. Support and comparative tools can provide information to users about each of the available benefit plans and impact of their plan options to help employees choose the best option for their specific needs.
Talent Management
 Dayforce Talent Management enables organizations to attract, to engage, to develop, and to motivate their workforce. Users can leverage tools for recruiting, onboarding, engagement, performance, succession planning, compensation management, and employee learning.
Workforce Management
 Dayforce Workforce Management provides functionality to help organizations manage their workforces, improve operational efficiency, and enhance compliance by configuring the system to meet complex labor and employment rules and policies. Through Dayforce, users are offered absence management, time and attendance, schedule, and labor planning.

Powerpay
We offer Powerpay for Canadian organizations with fewer than 100 employees. Powerpay is a cloud platform that provides scalable and straightforward payroll and HR solutions. Specifically designed for small businesses, Powerpay enables clients to pay their employees accurately and on-time.
 Bureau
Our Bureau solutions offer payroll and payroll-related services using legacy technology and Bureau technology from our acquired businesses. We invest in maintenance and necessary updates to support our Bureau customers. We generally stopped selling our legacy North America Bureau payroll solutions to new customers in the United States in 2012, and in Canada in 2015, and we also intend to stop actively selling our acquired Bureau payroll solutions to new customers on a stand-alone basis. In addition to customers who use our payroll services, certain customers use our legacy Bureau tax filing services on a stand-alone basis; and we started to sell stand-alone legacy Bureau tax services again in 2019.
Customers
 Dayforce is designed to serve organizations with 100 to over 100,000 employees. The Dayforce customer base has increased from 482 as of December 31, 2012 to 5,434 customers* on the platform as of December 31, 2021. For 2021, our 5,434 Dayforce customers* represented approximately 5.1 million active global users*. We define a customer as a single organization, such as a company, a non-profit association, an educational institution, or government entity. We also have approximately 39,000 Powerpay customer accounts. No single customer accounted for more than 1% of our revenues during the year ended December 31, 2021.
 Sales and Marketing
We sell our Cloud solutions through a direct sales force and a variety of third party channels, organized by customer size and geography. We market Dayforce to organizations with more than 100 employees. We market Powerpay to organizations with fewer than 100 employees in Canada. The majority of our revenue growth comes from new Cloud customers.
Services and Support
 We offer a broad portfolio of services aimed to ensure customer success. We believe it’s important to work closely with our customers to understand their needs and deliver technology solutions and support that address them. We continue to increase our global reach in supporting and serving our customers. As part of our international strategy, we work with partners to perform services in certain geographies where we do not currently have international operations or the particular service required by our customers.
Implementation and Professional Services
 Our internal implementation team leverages proprietary onboarding technology for new customer activation and professional services work. Our internal team is supplemented by third party services partners and system integration partners (“SI”). Our implementation services include solution configuration and activation for new customers. Professional services include add-on implementation services for existing customers, ongoing product configuration changes when the customer does not have the resources to do it themselves, product usage consulting and a variety of additional services, such as report writing, usage audits, and process improvement.
 Customer Support
Our global customer support organization provides 24/7 application support from locations across North America and in the United Kingdom, Mauritius, Australia, Singapore, Philippines, and India. Our support function is organized into teams of representatives with deep domain expertise across our platform. These teams are aligned to groups of customers based on geography, product type, and client vertical to provide a combination of deep product and industry knowledge, consistent relationships, and high availability.

Technology, Hosting, and Research and Development (“R&D”)
Technology and innovation are at the core of Ceridian. Our innovation and development process is customer-driven. We work directly with customers to understand their needs and to deliver solutions that address their challenges, taking into consideration the entire user experience, without being constrained by individual modules or applications. We are committed to protecting our customer information, along with our employee and contractor information and other business data.
 Our R&D team is responsible for the design, development, and testing of our applications. We believe that our modern cloud technology stack, agile design and development methodology, and efficient software deployment process enable us to innovate quickly in response to industry trends. We host cloud-based applications and serve all of our customers from data centers operated by third party providers, primarily Navisite, VMWare Cloud on AWS, Microsoft Azure, and AWS. While we control and have access to our servers and all of the components of our network that are located in our external data centers, we do not control the operation of these facilities. Additionally, we host our internal systems through data centers that we operate and lease in the United States and Asia Pacific Japan ("APJ").
 Intellectual Property
Our success depends, in part, on our ability to protect our proprietary technology and intellectual property. We rely on a combination of patents, copyrights, trade secrets, and trademarks, as well as confidentiality and nondisclosure agreements and other contractual protections, to establish and to safeguard our intellectual property rights.
 Competition
The market for HCM technology solutions is highly competitive and subject to changing technology and shifting client needs. We compete with firms that provide both integrated and point solutions for HCM, as well as with local providers in each jurisdiction that we operate. Globally, we compete with legacy payroll service providers, as well as cloud-enabled client-server HCM providers. We also face competition from modern HCM providers, whose solutions have been specifically built as single application platforms in the cloud. In addition, we face competition from large, long-established enterprise application software vendors.
 Competition in the global HCM market is primarily based on product and service quality, including ease of use and accessibility of technology, breadth of offerings, reputation, and price. We believe that we are competitive in each of these areas and that our single application always-on technology and product innovations, combined with our commitment to service and our geographic reach, distinguishes us from our competitors.
 Seasonality
 We have in the past and expect in the future to experience seasonal fluctuations in our revenues and new customer contracts with the fourth quarter historically being our strongest quarter for new customer contracts, renewals, and customer go-lives. Although the growth of our Cloud solutions and the ratable nature of our fees makes this seasonality less apparent in our overall results of operations, we expect our revenue to fluctuate quarterly and to be higher in the fourth and first quarters of each year. Fourth quarter revenue is driven by year-end processing fees and Dayforce customer go-lives; and first quarter revenue is driven by revenue earned for printing of year-end tax packages.
Environmental, Social, and Governance ("ESG") and Human Capital
 Our People
 As of December 31, 2021, we had 7,462 employees, including 4,477 in North America, 1,846 in APJ, and 1,139 in Europe, the Middle East, and Africa ("EMEA"). We provide a wide range of compensation and benefits to our employees which enhance the workplace experience and drive our Makes Work Life Better brand. In addition to salaries, these benefits (which vary by country/region) include annual bonuses, equity awards, a global employee stock purchase program, retirement savings plans, healthcare and insurance benefits, health savings and flexible savings spending accounts, unlimited time away from work, employee assistance programs, and tuition reimbursement. In addition to our broad-based employee stock purchase program, we have targeted equity-based grants with vesting conditions to facilitate retention of our employees. Our ability to attract and retain top talent is critical to our continued success as a business, and we were very pleased that our employee Net Promoter Score (eNPS) in 2021 was 47.
 Promoting diversity, equity and inclusion within our workforce is also a priority for Ceridian. In 2021, we established
  2021 Form 10-K


a company-wide Global Diversity Advisory Council that is comprised of employees from around the world, and we expanded the number of our inclusive-building YOUnity groups from 6 to 9—adding the Native and Indigenous People’s Network, the Ceridian Parenting Network, and the Asia Pacific Network. As of December 31, 2021, women represent approximately 49% of our global workforce, including approximately 43% of employees in manager-level roles and above, and approximately 38% in vice president-level roles and above. Employees from recently acquired companies ADAM HCM, Ascender, and Excelity are not included in this data, but will be included next year. In the United States, approximately 14% of our workforce is Black or African American, 11% is Asian, 6% is Hispanic or Latino, 2% is multiracial, and less than 1% is Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander, American Indian or Alaska Native and approximately 64% is White. In the United States, people of color represent approximately 24% of employees in manager-level roles and above, and approximately 22% of employees in vice president-level roles and above.
 As we enter the third year of the pandemic, we continue to ensure that all necessary policies and procedures are in place at our facilities to protect employee health and safety. This includes those for vaccination, testing, masking, and physical distancing that conform to government requirements.
 We are also committed to providing meaningful leadership and learning development opportunities to our workforce. Over 35,000 hours of in-person trainings, digital learning and webinars related to leadership and learning development topics were completed by nearly 93% of our employees as of December 31, 2021.
 Responsible Innovation
 We believe that tech for good and responsible innovation can have a positive impact on all stakeholders. Dayforce Wallet provides individuals with faster access to their earned pay, which enables them to cover both everyday expenses as well as urgent or unplanned costs.
Our Communities
 Ceridian is committed to giving back to the communities in which we live and work. Through our charity, Ceridian Cares, we provide financial support to individuals and families struggling with basic needs and quality of life. In 2021, the organization donated over $1.1 million to people in need in the United States and Canada. Last year, we launched a new giving and volunteering platform for our workforce through which employees donated to over 480 non-profits in 12 countries.
