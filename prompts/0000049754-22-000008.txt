Item 1.    Business
Dine Brands Global, Inc.®, together with its subsidiaries (referred to as the “Company,” “Dine Brands Global,” “we,” “our” and “us”), owns, franchises and operates the Applebee's Neighborhood Grill + Bar® (“Applebee's”) concept in the bar and grill segment within the casual dining category of the restaurant industry and owns and franchises the International House of Pancakes® (“IHOP”) concept in the family dining category of the restaurant industry. References herein to Applebee's® and IHOP® restaurants are to these two restaurant concepts, whether operated by franchisees, area licensees and their sub-licensees or by us. As of December 31, 2021, the substantial majority of our 3,431 restaurants across both brands were franchised. We believe this highly franchised business model requires less capital investment and general and administrative overhead, generates higher gross profit margins and reduces the volatility of adjusted free cash flow performance, as compared to a business model based on owning a significant number of company-operated restaurants. 
We generated revenue during the year ended December 31, 2021 from five operating segments, comprised as follows:
•Our two franchise operations (each a separate operating segment) - primarily royalties, advertising fees and other income from 1,611 Applebee’s franchised restaurants and 1,751 IHOP franchised and area licensed restaurants;
•Rental operations - primarily rental income derived from lease or sublease agreements covering 598 IHOP franchised restaurants and two Applebee’s franchised restaurants;
•Financing operations - primarily interest income from approximately $33 million of receivables for equipment leases and franchise fee notes generally associated with IHOP franchised restaurants developed before 2003 and approximately $15 million of notes receivable from franchisees; and
•Company restaurant operations - retail sales from 69 Applebee's company-operated restaurants. 
Most of our revenue is derived from domestic sources within these five operating segments, with approximately 71% of our total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2021 being generated from our two franchise operating segments. Internationally, our restaurants are in 15 countries and two United States territories at December 31, 2021. Revenue derived from all international operations comprised less than 2% of total consolidated revenue for the year ended December 31, 2021. At December 31, 2021, there were no long-lived assets located outside of the United States. See Note 18 - Segment Reporting, of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, included in this report for additional segment information. 
COVID-19 Pandemic
In March 2020, the World Health Organization (“WHO”) declared a global pandemic related to the outbreak of a novel strain of coronavirus, designated “COVID-19.” Initially, federal, state, local and international governments reacted to the COVID-19 pandemic by encouraging or requiring social distancing, instituting shelter-in-place orders, and requiring, in varying degrees, reduced operating hours, restaurant dine-in and/or indoor dining limitations, capacity limitations or other restrictions that largely limited restaurants to off-premise sales (take-out and delivery) in the early stages of the pandemic, particularly from the second week of March 2020 until May 2020. As infection rates from the initial outbreak declined, domestic governmental entities slowly began to relax restrictions, and the degree of relaxation varied by individual geographic area. Restaurants allowed to re-open were largely limited to occupancy of 50% or less of capacity during the period from May 2020 to March 2021. As vaccines became widely available and incidents of infection continued to decrease, many restrictions on domestic restaurant operations were removed, such that by June 2021, 98% of domestic IHOP and Applebee's restaurants and 8% of international restaurants were operating without government-mandated restrictions. As of December 31, 2021, 99% of domestic IHOP and Applebee's restaurants and 32% of international restaurants were operating without government-mandated restrictions. Throughout the pandemic, we and our franchisees instituted and continue to maintain operational procedures to protect the health and foster the confidence of employees and guests at the restaurants. 
 The operating status of our restaurants continues to face uncertainty as governmental authorities modify existing restrictions or implement new restrictions on restaurant operations in response to changes in the number of COVID-19 infections and the emergence of variant strains of the virus in their respective jurisdictions. We and our franchisees continue to monitor developing health authority recommendations and regulatory requirements. 
The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our results of operations and liquidity is discussed in Item 7 - Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of this Form 10-K.
Our Goal
Our goal is to accelerate profitable growth and create significant value for stockholders and franchisees.
Our Strategic Priorities
 To build value, we seek to maximize our business by focusing on these key strategic priorities:
•Evolve strong brands and drive same-restaurant sales, traffic and system sales growth;
•Facilitate franchisee restaurant development; and
•Maintain strong financial discipline.
Our fundamental approach to brand building centers on a strategic combination of initiatives to continually innovate and evolve our existing brands as well as explore investments in or acquisitions of new concepts. We intend to leverage our significant scale and our franchise business model to drive robust margins and cash flows. We are actively supporting our brands with focused teams that are responsible and accountable at the brand level to drive strong performance. In partnership with our franchisees, significant investments have been made and will continue to be made in marketing across traditional and digital channels to drive traffic to our restaurants. We are placing greater emphasis on quantitative analytics to leverage our favorable guest dynamics. We are investing in technology to create more ways for customers to access our brands and in growth platforms such as online ordering, off-premise business and delivery. We will continue to focus on generating strong adjusted free cash flow and returning a portion of it to stockholders through quarterly cash dividends and repurchases of our common stock taking into consideration COVID-related changes to business conditions. We will continue to reevaluate our capital allocation strategy to maximize long-term stockholder return. Our business strategy includes evaluating the addition of new brands to our restaurant portfolio through mergers and acquisitions.
Our History
The first IHOP restaurant opened in 1958 in Toluca Lake, California. Since that time, the Company and its predecessors have engaged in the development, franchising and operation of IHOP restaurants. Prior to 2003, new IHOP restaurants were generally developed by us, and we were involved in all aspects of the construction and financing of the restaurants. We typically identified and leased or purchased the restaurant sites for new company-developed IHOP restaurants, built and equipped the restaurants and then franchised them to franchisees. In addition, we typically financed as much as 80% of the franchise fee for periods ranging from five to eight years and leased the restaurant and equipment to the franchisee over a 25-year period. We refer to this as our “Previous IHOP Business Model,” which accounts for most of the activity in our rental and financing operations. 
For most IHOP restaurants opened after 2003, the franchisee is primarily responsible for the development and financing of the restaurant. In general, we no longer provide any financing with respect to the franchise fee, restaurant site or equipment. The franchisee uses its own capital and financial resources along with third-party financial sources obtained by the franchisee to purchase or lease a restaurant site, build and equip the business and fund its working capital needs. We refer to this as our “Current IHOP Business Model.” 
The first restaurant in what became the Applebee’s chain opened in 1980 in Decatur, Georgia. Applebee's International, Inc, (“AII”) became a public company in 1989, comprised of 100 restaurants. In November 2007, we completed the acquisition of AII, which comprised 1,455 franchised restaurants and 510 company-operated restaurants at the time of the acquisition. We subsequently refranchised all Applebee's company-operated restaurants and were 100% franchised until we acquired 69 restaurants from a former Applebee's franchisee in December 2018. 
Restaurant Concepts
Applebee's
We franchise and operate Applebee’s restaurants in the bar and grill segment within the casual dining category of the restaurant industry. As one of the world’s largest casual dining brands, Applebee’s Neighborhood Grill + Bar offers guests a dining experience that combines simple, craveable American fare with classic drinks and local drafts - all for a moderate price. Applebee's restaurants that are franchised are owned and operated by franchisees dedicated to serving great food and also building up the communities that we call home. From raising money for local charities to hosting community fundraisers, Applebee’s is always “Doin’ Good in the Neighborhood”. 
We strive to provide genuine and neighborly service, appetizers, drinks and entrees and limited-time offers. Our menu features a selection of grill and bar fare, such as appetizers, bar snacks, burgers, pasta entrees and lighter fare, as well as cocktails, beers and desserts. During the current global pandemic, we continue to enhance our very popular “Eatin’ Good in the Neighborhood” positioning while providing safe and sanitary dining options whether in limited indoor or outside seating or To 
Go. Applebee's offers online ordering via web and a mobile app for Carside To Go pick up options or Applebee’s Delivery with no-contact options and new tamper-proof packaging. We also contract with all major delivery service providers, such as DoorDash, Uber Eats and GrubHub, providing multiple options for our guests to continue to enjoy Applebee’s at home during this challenging time. Applebee's also opened our first ghost kitchens (small kitchens with no store-front presence, used to fill online orders) in 2020 to further expand our delivery options and reach even more of our customers at home. We began offering catering, a third component of our off-premise options, as a national program in 2019, and plan to continue expansion of our catering offerings to align with the needs of our customers as larger events with catering needs are anticipated to become more frequent as COVID-19 infection rates decline. 
As of December 31, 2021, 49 franchise groups (31 domestic and 18 international) operated 1,611 Applebee’s franchise restaurants. We operated 69 Applebee's restaurants acquired from a former franchisee in December 2018. Applebee's restaurants were located in 49 states within the United States, two United States territories and 11 countries outside of the United States. The June 2021 issue of Nation's Restaurant News reported that Applebee's was the fourth largest restaurant system in the casual dining category in terms of United States system-wide sales during 2020. 
IHOP
We franchise restaurants in the family dining category of the restaurant industry under the names IHOP and International House of Pancakes. IHOP restaurants feature full table service and high quality, moderately priced food and beverage offerings in an attractive and comfortable family atmosphere. Although the restaurants are best known for their award-winning pancakes and putting an unexpected twist on “all things breakfast, any time of the day,” IHOP is committed to accelerating growth through menu innovation, day-part expansion, off-premise initiatives and development. Focused on meeting the needs of today’s guest, IHOP leverages industry analytics and brand-specific insights to help effectively drive positive behaviors, including increased frequency of visit and average check. 
IHOP restaurants are open throughout the day and evening hours. As of December 31, 2021, approximately 26% of IHOP restaurants operate 24 hours a day, seven days a week, with 68 additional restaurants operating 24 hours a day for some portion of the week. In comparison, approximately 45% of IHOP restaurants operated 24 hours a day, seven days a week, with 245 additional restaurants operating 24 hours a day for some portion of the week as of December 31, 2019, the last fiscal year end prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. Operating hours remain affected by varying dine-in restrictions mandated by federal, state, local and international jurisdictions in which the restaurants are located, as well as by recent labor challenges and staffing shortages experienced by franchisees. 
We announced the most comprehensive remodel program in our brand’s history, “Rise ‘N’ Shine,” in late 2015. Since starting the program in 2016, our domestic franchisees have remodeled over 1,175 of their restaurants. Including new restaurants opened in the past six years, more than 86% of our domestic IHOP franchise restaurants reflect the new, contemporary look. In light of the COVID-19 pandemic, we allowed franchisees to defer their 2021 and 2020 unit remodel obligations, but nevertheless franchisees still completed 24 remodels in 2021.
We remain committed to giving more people, more reasons to enjoy more IHOP, more often. Placing an emphasis on building its IHOP ‘N’ Go business, IHOP offers an online ordering platform, a mobile app, and a national delivery program with leading service providers including DoorDash, Uber Eats and GrubHub. In 2021, our off-premise business sustained significantly elevated volume compared to pre-pandemic volumes. We now offer delivery directly through our website and mobile app at close to 100% of our restaurants, as well as Curbside Pickup options. We believe the convenience of take-out and delivery will remain appealing to our guests even as dining room restrictions are eased around the world. Additionally, we implemented several measures to enhance our in-restaurant health safety and sanitation operational procedures in order to protect the health and foster the confidence of employees and guests at the restaurants. 
As of December 31, 2021, 289 franchise groups (270 domestic, 19 international) operated 1,751 IHOP franchise and area license restaurants. These restaurants were in all 50 states within the United States, in the District of Columbia, in two United States territories and in seven countries outside of the United States. We no longer operate any company-owned IHOP restaurants on a permanent basis, but we may operate, on a temporary basis until refranchised, IHOP restaurants that we reacquire for a variety of reasons from IHOP franchisees. There were no such reacquired restaurants at December 31, 2021. The June 2021 issue of Nation's Restaurant News reported that IHOP was the largest restaurant system in the family dining category in terms of United States system-wide sales during 2020. 
See Item 2 - Properties, for the geographic location of all Applebee’s and IHOP restaurants.
Franchising
Franchisee Relationships
We highly value good relationships with our IHOP and Applebee's franchisees and strive to maintain positive working relationships with them. For several years, IHOP and Applebee’s franchisees have participated in Company-sponsored advisory groups. These groups provide a forum for franchisees to share demonstrated best practices, offer counsel and review successful strategies, while working side-by-side with management of the Applebee's and IHOP brands. Applebee’s sponsors its Franchise Business Council (“FBC”), which consists of eight elected franchisee representatives and three Applebee's representatives. IHOP sponsors its Franchise Leadership Council (“FLC”), an elected and appointed body of 12 IHOP franchisees. The Applebee's FBC and the IHOP FLC assist Applebee's and IHOP senior management in key areas of the business and strategy, including brand marketing, operations, restaurant development, information technology, menu, and innovation.
Franchise Agreements and Fees
Franchise arrangements for Applebee's restaurants typically consist of a development agreement and a separate franchise agreement for each restaurant. Development agreements grant to the franchisee the exclusive right to develop Applebee's restaurants within a designated geographical area over a specified period of time. The term of a domestic development agreement is generally 20 years. The development agreements typically provide for initial development periods of one to five years as agreed upon by us and the franchisee. At or shortly prior to the completion of the initial development schedule or any subsequent supplemental development schedule, we and the franchisee may execute supplemental development schedules providing for the development of additional Applebee's restaurants in the franchisee's exclusive territory.
Prior to the opening of each new Applebee's restaurant, we enter into a separate franchise agreement with the franchisee for that restaurant. Our current standard domestic Applebee's franchise agreement provides for an initial term of 20 years and provides an option for four successive renewal terms, in five-year increments, for up to an additional 20 years, upon payment of an additional franchise fee. Our current standard domestic Applebee's franchise arrangement calls for a development fee equal to $10,000 for each Applebee's restaurant that the franchisee contracts to develop and an initial franchisee fee of $35,000 for each restaurant developed (against which the $10,000 development fee will be credited) and a royalty fee equal to 4% of the restaurant's monthly gross sales. Our agreements for most Applebee's restaurants opened before January 1, 2000, provide for a royalty rate of 4%, while the terms, royalty rate and advertising fees under a limited number of franchise agreements and other franchise fees under older development agreements vary from the currently offered arrangements. 
Under the Current IHOP Business Model, a potential franchisee that is approved first enters into a single-restaurant franchise agreement, a single-restaurant development agreement, or a multi-restaurant development agreement with us and is responsible for the development and financing of one or more new IHOP franchised restaurants. Our current standard domestic IHOP franchise agreement typically provides for an initial term of 20 years and permits one renewal for a term of 10 years, upon payment of a renewal fee of $10,000.
The revenues we receive from a typical domestic franchise development arrangement under the Current IHOP Business Model include (a) a location fee equal to $15,000 for an IHOP restaurant that the franchisee contracts to develop upon execution of a single-restaurant development agreement; (b) a development fee equal to $20,000 for each IHOP restaurant that the franchisee contracts to develop upon execution of a multi-restaurant development agreement; (c) an initial franchise fee equal to (i) $40,000 (against which the $20,000 development fee will be credited) for each restaurant developed under a multi-restaurant development agreement, (ii) $50,000 (against which the $15,000 location fee will be credited) for a restaurant developed under a single-restaurant development agreement or (iii) $50,000 for a restaurant opened pursuant to a single-restaurant franchise agreement, in each case paid upon execution of the franchise agreement; (d) franchise royalties equal to 4.5% of weekly gross sales; (e) revenue from the sale of our proprietary pancake and waffle dry-mixes; and (f) franchise advertising fees.
The principal commercial terms of the franchise arrangements under the Previous IHOP Business Model and the Current IHOP Business Model, including the franchise royalties and the franchise advertising fees, are substantially the same except with respect to the terms relating to the franchise fee, lease or sublease rents for the restaurant property and building, and interest income from any franchise fee notes and equipment leases.
Development of Applebee’s and IHOP restaurants outside of the United States has historically been conducted through a separate development agreement and franchise agreement. More recently, certain franchisees have entered into a multi-unit franchise agreement that governs the rights and obligations to develop a territory, in addition to terms of operating each restaurant opened in the territory. The term of a franchisee’s exclusive right to develop a territory expires when the agreement’s development schedule is completed. The term to operate the restaurant is typically 20 years, subject to applicable renewals.
In limited instances, we have agreed to accept reduced royalties and/or lease payments from franchisees or have provided other accommodations to franchisees for specified periods of time to assist them in either establishing or reinvigorating their businesses. For example, in response to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, we allowed our franchisees to defer their development obligations for up to 15 months. We also offered Applebee's franchisees the opportunity to defer payment of their royalty, advertising and other fees, and IHOP franchisees the opportunity to defer payment of their royalty, advertising, equipment rent and sublease rent payments, primarily for the months of March and April 2020. From time to time, we may also offer reduced or eliminated initial franchise fees, key money grants, and periods of reduced royalties as development incentives to encourage the development of new restaurants.
We have the contractual right, subject to applicable law, to terminate a development and franchise agreement for a variety of reasons, such as a franchisee’s failure to make required payments when due, failure to timely develop restaurants and failure to adhere to specified brand policies and standards.
Advertising Fees
The Applebee's franchise agreements generally require domestic franchisees of Applebee's restaurants to (i) contribute 3.25% of their gross sales to a national advertising fund, which funds the development of national promotions, television and radio commercials, print advertising materials and digital marketing and (ii) spend at least 0.5% of their gross sales on local marketing and promotional activities. Under the current Applebee's franchise agreements, we have the ability to increase the amount of the required combined contribution to the national advertising fund and the amount required to be spent on local marketing and promotional activities to a maximum of 5% of gross sales. Virtually all domestic Applebee’s franchisees have either entered into an amendment to their franchise agreements to increase their contribution to the Applebee's national advertising fund (the “Applebee’s NAF”) or entered into new franchise agreements in connection with renewals setting forth the current advertising contribution requirements. Virtually all franchisees who entered into amendments agreed to an incremental temporary increase in the national advertising contribution rate to 4.25% through December 31, 2022, with no requirement that franchisees spend on local marketing during that time.
 IHOP franchisees allocate a percentage of their sales to local advertising cooperatives and a national advertising fund (the “IHOP NAF”). The IHOP franchise agreements generally provide for advertising fees comprised of (i) a local advertising fee generally equal to 2.0% of weekly gross sales under the franchise agreement, which is typically used to cover the cost of local media purchases and other local advertising expenses incurred by a local advertising cooperative, and (ii) a national advertising fee equal to 1.0% of weekly gross sales under the franchise agreement. Area licensees are generally required to pay lesser amounts toward advertising.
The local IHOP advertising cooperatives have historically used advertising fees for various local marketing programs. The IHOP NAF is primarily used for buying media and national advertising, in addition to the related production costs. The IHOP NAF is also used to defray certain expenses associated with our marketing and advertising functions. 
 Beginning in 2005, and every year thereafter, we and the IHOP franchisees agreed to reallocate portions of the local advertising fees to purchase national broadcast, syndication and cable television time to reach our target audience more frequently and more cost effectively.
In 2014, we and franchisees whose restaurants account for a large majority of total annual contributions to the IHOP NAF entered into franchise agreement amendments that increased the advertising contribution percentage of those restaurants' gross sales. Pursuant to the amendment, for the period from January 1, 2015 to December 31, 2017, 3.50% of each participating restaurant's gross sales was contributed to the IHOP NAF with no significant contribution to local advertising cooperatives required. The amended advertising contribution percentage also was applicable to all new franchise agreements and to IHOP company-operated restaurants open at the time. In 2016, we and franchisees whose restaurants account for a large majority of total annual contributions to the IHOP NAF extended this additional contribution through 2022, and in 2022 it was further extended through 2027. The current IHOP franchise agreements generally provide for advertising fees comprised of (i) a local advertising fee equal to 0% of gross sales under the franchise agreement, and (ii) a national advertising fee equal to 3.5% of weekly gross sales under the franchise agreement. Commencing on January 1, 2028, the local advertising fee and the national advertising fee are subject to change.
The Company temporarily discontinued the national advertising programs of both brands in March 2020 due to uncertainty related to the COVID-19 pandemic; however, both brands returned to national media advertising in July 2020.
IHOP Area License Agreements
We have entered into four long-term area license agreements for IHOP restaurants covering the state of Florida and certain counties in the state of Georgia, the province of British Columbia, Canada, the country of Pakistan and certain countries or islands in the Caribbean, including Aruba, Bonaire and Curacao (ABC Islands), Bahamas, Barbados, Guyana, Jamaica, St. 
Lucia, St. Maarten and Trinidad & Tobago. The area license agreements provide the licensees with the right to develop and franchise new IHOP restaurants in their respective territories and provide for royalties ranging from 1.0% to 5.5% of gross sales and advertising fees ranging from 0.25% to approximately 2.0% of gross sales. During 2014, the advertising fee contribution provisions of the Florida area license agreement were amended for the period through December 31, 2017 on substantially similar terms as the franchise agreement amendment described above and such amendments were subsequently extended through 2022. We also derive revenues from the sale of proprietary products to these area licensees and, in certain instances, to their sub-franchisees. Revenues from our area licensees are included in franchise operations revenues.
As of December 31, 2021, the area licensee for the state of Florida and certain counties in Georgia operated or sub-franchised a total of 148 IHOP restaurants. The area licensee for the province of British Columbia, Canada operated or sub-franchised a total of eight IHOP restaurants. The area licensee for the country of Pakistan opened its first franchise IHOP restaurant in 2020 and may begin to sub-license restaurants once a required number of franchise restaurants have been opened. The area licensee for the Caribbean also may begin to sub-license restaurants once a required number of franchise restaurants have been opened. The area license for British Columbia expires in 2026; the area license for Pakistan expires in 2047; the area license for the Caribbean expires after the year 2042, with the date of expiration changing depending on the number of qualified restaurant openings and closures by such licensee; and the area license for Florida and Georgia expires after the year 2100, with the date of expiration changing depending on the number of qualified restaurant openings and closures by such licensee. 
Other Franchise-related Revenues and Fees
Approximately 90% of franchise segment revenue for the year ended December 31, 2021 consisted of Applebee's and IHOP royalties and advertising revenue. Most of the remaining 10% consisted of sales of proprietary products (primarily IHOP pancake and waffle dry mix), initial franchise and renewal fees and software maintenance and support fees. Depending on circumstances, we may seek to recover a portion of any royalties and fees lost due to early termination of a franchise agreement; however, not all franchise restaurant closures necessarily result in our receipt of such fees.
International Franchising
We continue to pursue international franchising of the Applebee's and the IHOP concepts. To this end, we seek qualified franchisees that possess the financial, development and operational resources needed to open multiple restaurants in each territory and are experienced in conducting business in the development territory. We work closely with our international franchisees to develop and implement the Applebee's and IHOP systems outside the United States, recognizing commercial, cultural and dietary diversity. Differences in tastes and cultural norms and standards require that we be flexible and pragmatic regarding many elements of the Applebee's and IHOP systems, including menu, restaurant design, restaurant operations, training, marketing, purchasing and financing.
The success of further international expansion will depend on, among other things, local acceptance of the Applebee's and IHOP concepts and menu offerings and our ability to attract qualified franchisees and operating personnel. Our franchisees must comply with the regulatory requirements of the local jurisdictions.
Domestic and International Franchise Restaurant Development 
Each franchisee is responsible for selecting the site for each new restaurant. We may consult with franchisees when they are selecting appropriate sites, and selections made by franchisees are subject to our approval. For domestic restaurants, we also conduct a physical inspection, review any proposed lease or purchase agreement for compliance with our requirements and may make available to franchisees demographic and other studies for domestic restaurants. We make the design specifications for a typical restaurant available to franchisees, and we retain the right to prohibit or modify the use of any set of plans.
 As of December 31, 2021, we had signed commitments from IHOP franchisees to build 387 IHOP restaurants over the next nine years, comprised of 98 restaurants under single restaurant or non-traditional development agreements, 135 restaurants under domestic multi-restaurant development agreements and 154 restaurants under international development agreements. We also have signed option agreements to build an additional 17 restaurants over the next 11 years, primarily under domestic multi-restaurant development agreements. As of December 31, 2021, we had signed commitments from Applebee's franchisees for the opening of approximately 20 international restaurants over the next nine years and we are beginning to re-establish Applebee's domestic development pipeline. Developers’ level of compliance with development obligations varies per year and could change; therefore, the number of signed commitment and/or development agreements in place at any given time may not be a reliable indicator of future development activity. In light of the COVID-19 pandemic, we allowed franchisees to defer their 2020 development obligations for up to 15 months.
Franchise Operations
We continuously monitor franchise restaurant operations. Company and third-party representatives make both scheduled and unannounced inspections of franchised restaurants to ensure that only approved products are in use and that our prescribed operations practices and procedures are being followed. We have the right to terminate a franchise agreement if a franchisee does not operate and maintain a restaurant in accordance with our requirements. Due to cultural and regulatory differences, we may have different requirements for restaurants opened outside of the United States. We also monitor the financial health of our franchisees through business and financial reviews.
Composition of Franchise Systems
As of December 31, 2021, 31 Applebee’s franchisees owned a total of 1,509 domestic Applebee's restaurants. The number of domestic restaurants held by a single franchisee ranged from one restaurant to 441 restaurants. As of December 31, 2021, 18 franchisees owned a total of 102 international Applebee's restaurants. The number of international restaurants held by a single franchisee ranged from one restaurant to 19 restaurants. Our five largest Applebee’s franchisees owned 53% of the total 1,611 Applebee's franchise restaurants.
As of December 31, 2021, 270 franchisees owned a total of 1,657 domestic IHOP restaurants, including 108 franchisees that each owned one restaurant. The largest single IHOP franchisee owned 272 domestic restaurants. As of December 31, 2021, 19 franchisees owned a total of 94 international IHOP franchise restaurants. The number of international restaurants held by a single franchisee ranged from one restaurant to 15 restaurants. Our five largest IHOP franchisees owned 30% of the total 1,751 IHOP franchise restaurants.
Company-Operated Restaurants
In December 2018, we acquired 69 Applebee's restaurants in North Carolina and South Carolina from a former Applebee's franchisee. While we currently intend to own and operate these restaurants for the near term, we will assess and monitor opportunities to refranchise these restaurants under favorable circumstances. We believe this transaction was a unique circumstance and should not be considered a change in our business strategy. Our business strategy includes the possible addition of new brands to our restaurant portfolio, which may result in our acquiring additional company-operated restaurants. 
From time to time, we also may reacquire a small number of restaurants from franchisees for a variety of reasons. Historically, we have been able to refranchise these restaurants quickly to new franchisees. When reacquired restaurants are not refranchised quickly, we typically operate the reacquired restaurants until they can be refranchised. These temporarily reacquired restaurants may require investments in remodeling and rehabilitation before they can be refranchised. As a result, a reacquired restaurant may incur operating losses for some period of time. There were no such reacquired restaurants at December 31, 2021.
Supply Chain
In February 2009, Centralized Supply Chain Services, LLC (“CSCS” or the “Co-op”), an independent cooperative entity, was formed by us and franchisees of Applebee's and IHOP domestic restaurants. CSCS has been appointed as the sole authorized purchasing organization and purchasing agent for goods, equipment and distribution services for Applebee's and IHOP restaurants in the United States. As of December 31, 2021, 100% of Applebee's domestic franchise restaurants and 99.8% of IHOP domestic franchise restaurants were members of CSCS. 
CSCS combines the purchasing volume for goods, equipment and distribution services within and across the Applebee's and IHOP concepts. Its mission is to achieve for its members the benefit of continuously available goods, higher quality equipment and distribution services in adequate quantities at the lowest possible sustainable prices. We do not control CSCS, but do have contractual rights associated with supplier certification, quality assurance and protection of our intellectual property. The operations of CSCS are funded by a separately stated administrative fee added to one or more products purchased by operators. 
We believe the larger scale provided by combining the supply chain requirements of both brands provides continuing cost savings and efficiencies while helping to ensure compliance with our quality and safety standards. 
Industry Overview and Competition
Applebee's and IHOP are among the numerous restaurant chains and independent restaurants competing in the restaurant industry in the United States. The restaurant industry is generally categorized into segments by price point ranges, the types of food and beverages offered and the types of service available to customers. These segments include, among others, fast food or quick service restaurants, fast-casual dining, family dining, casual dining and fine dining. Casual dining restaurants offer full table service and typically have bars or serve liquor, wine and beer, while family dining restaurants offer full table service, typically do not have bars or serve liquor, and usually offer breakfast in addition to lunch and dinner items. 
Applebee's competes in the casual dining segment against national and multi-state restaurant chains such as Buffalo Wild Wings, Olive Garden, Chili's Grill & Bar, Texas Roadhouse and Outback Steakhouse, among others, as well as fast-casual and quick service restaurant chains. In addition, there are many independent restaurants across the country in the casual dining segment. The June 2021 issue of Nation's Restaurant News reported that Applebee's was the fourth largest restaurant system in the casual dining category in terms of United States system-wide sales during 2020.
IHOP competes in the family dining segment against national and multi-state restaurant chains such as Denny's, Cracker Barrel Old Country Store, Golden Corral, Waffle House and Bob Evans Restaurants. IHOP also faces competition from fast-casual and quick service restaurant chains that serve breakfast. In addition, there are many independent restaurants and diners across the country in the family dining segment. The June 2021 issue of Nation's Restaurant News reported that IHOP was the largest restaurant system in the family dining category in terms of United States system-wide sales during 2020.
The restaurant and related food-service industries are highly competitive and are affected by, among other things, economic conditions, price levels, on-going changes in eating habits and food preferences, population trends and traffic patterns. The principal bases of competition in the industry are the type, quality and price of the food products served. Restaurant location, quality and speed of service, advertising, name identification and attractiveness of facilities are important. Additionally, changes in the price of groceries may influence the attractiveness of dining at home versus dining out.
The market for high quality commercial real estate is also very competitive. We and our franchisees compete with other restaurant chains and retail businesses for suitable sites for the development of new restaurants. We also compete against other franchisors both within and outside the restaurant industry for new franchisees. For further information regarding competition, see Item 1A, Risk Factors.
Trademarks and Service Marks
We and our affiliates have registered or submitted registrations for certain trademarks and service marks with the United States Patent and Trademark Office and various international jurisdictions, including “Dine Brands Global®.” We own trademarks and service marks used in the Applebee's system, including various logos and the trademarks “Applebee's®,” “Applebee's Neighborhood Grill + Bar®” and variations of each. In addition, we own trademarks and service marks used in the IHOP system, including various logos and the trademarks “IHOP®,” “International House of Pancakes®” and variations of each. 
We consider our trademarks and service marks important to the identification of our company and our restaurants and believe they are of material importance to the conduct of our business. Depending upon the jurisdiction, trademarks and service marks generally are valid as long as they are used and/or registered. We generally intend to renew our trademarks and service marks as they come up for renewal. We own or have rights to all trademarks we believe are material to our restaurant operations. In addition, we have registered various domain names on the Internet that incorporate certain of our trademarks and service marks and believe these domain name registrations are an integral part of our identity. From time to time, we may take appropriate legal action to defend and protect the use of our intellectual property.
Information Technology
We use in-house developed and third-party point of sale systems, kitchen data systems, and back-of-the house systems for accounting, labor and inventory management in our franchisees' restaurants. In addition, we have several consumer-facing technology initiatives focused on improving our customers' experience. Sales and product mix information is transmitted to our restaurant support centers daily and this information supports our operations and marketing initiatives. We mitigate the potential impact from operational interruption of our information technology systems through a disaster recovery plan that is updated on a regular basis. We believe that technology is and will continue to be a key component of our long-term plans and are committed to providing system stability and targeted innovation. Our use of technology, particularly in terms of managing electronic payments and confidential information, also represents security and operational risks that we must manage and may result in additional costs incurred.
Protection of financial and personal information is a high priority for us, led by our Cybersecurity Department with a committee representing key functional areas. We continuously focus on enhancing our cybersecurity capabilities, educating our team members on cybersecurity importance, and managing our cyber risks. In addition, we participate in annual audits of our financial and human resources systems to verify that measures are in place to protect our employees' personal information. We accept credit cards, third party gift cards, and branded gift cards as payment in our restaurants. We submit our systems to regular audit and review, as required by the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (“PCI DSS”), including periodic scanning of our networks to check for vulnerability. To further secure customers' payment data, we worked with our franchisees to deploy and implement encryption and tokenization technologies, ensuring credit card data is not stored in our franchisees' and our restaurants systems. This includes installation of equipment to improve authentication and to prevent fraud using EMV (Europay, Mastercard, Visa) technology. We and our franchisees are required and responsible for maintaining compliance, with PCI DSS, and we regularly communicate and encourage our franchisees to maintain compliance and to manage risk. For further information regarding Information Technology, see Item 1A, Risk Factors.
Seasonality
We do not consider our operations to be seasonal to a material degree. We may experience a slight increase in system-wide sales in the first quarter of our fiscal year due to redemptions of gift cards sold during the preceding December holiday season. In terms of average sales over the five-year time period covering 2016 to 2021, excluding the year 2020, 25% of our annual system-wide sales (retail sales reported to us by our franchisees plus sales at our company-operated restaurants) occurred in the first, second and fourth quarters of the fiscal year, with 24% occurring in the third quarter (Note: does not add to 100% due to rounding). The 2020 time period was excluded in the five-year average above due to distortions caused by COVID-19 pandemic in that year. Sales at restaurants owned by franchisees are not attributable to the Company.
Government Regulation
We are subject to regulation by the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) and a number of foreign and state laws that regulate the offer and sale of franchises. We also are subject to a number of foreign and state laws that regulate substantive aspects of the franchisor-franchisee relationship. The FTC's Trade Regulation Rule on Franchising, as amended (the “FTC Rule”), requires us to furnish to prospective domestic franchisees a Franchise Disclosure Document containing information prescribed by the FTC Rule unless an exemption applies.
State laws that regulate the offer and sale of franchises and the franchisor-franchisee relationship presently exist in a number of states and some of these laws require registration of the franchise offering with state authorities. Those states that regulate the franchise relationship generally require that the franchisor deal with its franchisees in good faith, prohibit interference with the right of free association among franchisees, limit the imposition of unreasonable standards of performance on a franchisee and regulate discrimination against franchisees with respect to charges, royalty fees or other fees. Although such laws may restrict a franchisor in the termination and/or non-renewal of a franchise agreement by, for example, requiring “good cause” to exist as a basis for the termination and/or non-renewal, advance notice to the franchisee of the termination or non-renewal, an opportunity to cure a default and a repurchase of inventory or other compensation upon termination, these provisions have not historically had a significant effect on our business.
Each restaurant is subject to licensing and regulation by a number of governmental authorities, which may include liquor license authorities (primarily in the case of Applebee's restaurants), health, sanitation, safety, fire, building and other agencies in the state or municipality in which the restaurant is located. 
More stringent and varied requirements of local governmental bodies with respect to zoning, land use and environmental factors could delay or prevent the development of new restaurants in particular areas.
Various federal and state labor laws govern our relationship with employees and our franchisees' relationship with their own employees. These include such matters as minimum wage requirements, overtime, tip credits and other working requirements and conditions. Significant additional government-imposed increases in minimum wages, paid leaves of absence, mandated health benefits, changes to the tip credit or increased tax reporting and tax payment requirements with respect to employees who receive gratuities could be detrimental to the economic viability of company-operated restaurants and our franchisees' restaurants.
We are subject to a number of privacy and data protection laws and regulations globally, including, without limitation, the California Consumer Privacy Act and pending California Privacy Rights Act. The legislative and regulatory landscape for privacy and data protection continues to evolve, and there has been increased attention in privacy and data protection issues. This has the potential to affect directly our business, including recently enacted laws and regulations in the United States and internationally requiring notification to individuals and government authorities of security breaches involving certain categories of personal information.
We are also subject to laws and regulations, which may vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, relating to nutritional content and menu labeling. In recent years, there has been an increased legislative, regulatory and consumer focus at the federal, state and municipal levels on the food industry including nutrition and advertising practices. Restaurants operating in the quick-service and fast-casual segments have been a particular focus. In addition to the United States Food and Drug Administration’s menu labeling requirements for restaurants requiring that chain restaurants include calorie information on their menus or make other nutritional information available, a number of other jurisdictions around the United States have adopted regulations related to disclosure of other information, such as sodium content, and imposing requirements for children's menus. Initiatives in the area of nutrition disclosure or advertising, such as requirements to provide information about the nutritional content of our food, may result in increased costs of compliance with the requirements and may also change customer buying habits in a way that adversely impacts our sales. For further information regarding governmental regulation, see Item 1A, Risk Factors.
Environmental Matters
We are subject to federal and state environmental regulations, but historically these have not had a material effect on our operations. We are not aware of any federal, state or local environmental laws or regulations that are likely to materially impact our revenues, cash flow or competitive position, or result in any material capital expenditure. However, we cannot predict the effect of possible future environmental legislation or regulations. 
Human Capital
We view our employees as one of the three core strategic pillars of our business - People, Brand, and Growth. We believe that hiring, developing and retaining team members is critically important to our operations and that our corporate responsibility begins with our team members. We are focused on a comprehensive approach to diversity and representation across leadership, team members, franchisees, partners and the community.
At Dine Brands, we believe the power to meaningfully impact the people and communities we serve is realized when each team member is personally and professionally fulfilled. One of our primary focuses is to ensure the health and well-being of our team members. Our Total Rewards Program plays a big part in our commitment to creating an environment of well-being. We believe that when team members are supported with the resources they need to care for themselves and their loved ones, they are able to be at their best. Dine Brands has a consistent and fair compensation program that reflects our pay-for-performance philosophy and rewards our team members for their contributions to our success. We offer comprehensive health and protection benefits that support our team members and their families’ overall well-being. Dine Brands also contributes to programs that provide our team members with financial security, now and in the future. We offer other rewards that focus on recognition, career building, health and wellness, time-off benefits, and other perks that are designed to make our peoples’ experience as Dine Brands team members productive and fun.
Dine Brands values, encourages and appreciates the diversity of our workforce. We embrace our personal differences - whether it be race, gender, age, religion, culture, ethnicity, sexual orientation, veteran status, national origin or physical ability - and the benefits that an array of backgrounds, cultures and thinking styles bring to our organization. We are committed to sustaining an environment that accepts, includes and engages everyone in our workforce and encourages open dialogue, empowerment and a sense of belonging. While the world and our business change rapidly, our management believes that respecting individual differences will continue to be essential to our long-term success.
We maintain six Team Member Resource Groups (TMRGs) as part of our diversity and inclusion efforts. TMRGs are team member-led, self-directed, voluntary groups, each sponsored by a member of our Executive team, that offer internal networking opportunities, career development, expand our innovation and problem solving and in general, act as a vehicle to enhance diversity and inclusion.
We assess our culture and listen to our workforce through periodic employee engagement surveys. Numerous policy changes have been made or been influenced by the feedback we receive from our employees. Some recent examples of these changes include our new flexible hybrid work schedule, which offers increased flexibility for our restaurant support center employees, and our COVID-19 vaccination policy, which protects the health and safety of our employees.
We believe in accountability that starts with our leadership and extends to all of our team members. Our Chief Executive Officer, John W. Peyton, has taken the CEO Action for Diversity and Inclusion pledge. Substantially all our restaurant support center team members as well as our Board members have undertaken a comprehensive diversity and inclusion training seminar. 
As of December 31, 2021, we had 3,521 employees, of whom 3,008 were employees of our company-owned restaurants and 513 were corporate employees at our restaurant support centers or in the field. Of our corporate employees, 60% are male and 40% are female, while 59% are white and 41% are people of color. Approximately 81% of our corporate employees are salaried, with 19% paid hourly.
Of our company owned restaurant employees, 59% are female and 41% are male, while 52% are people of color and 48% are white. Nearly 93% of our company-owned restaurant employees are paid on an hourly basis, while certain restaurant and operations management and corporate positions are salaried. We employ both full-time and part-time restaurant employees in order to provide the flexibility necessary during peak periods of restaurant operations and meet the individual needs of our employees. Our employees are not presently represented by any collective bargaining agreements and we have not experienced any significant work stoppages. We believe our relations with employees are good. Our franchisees are independent business owners and their employees are not our employees. Therefore, their employees are not included in our employee count.
