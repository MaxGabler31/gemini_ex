ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Company Overview

History

BBX Capital, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the “Company” or, unless otherwise indicated or the context otherwise requires, “we,” “us,” or “our”) is a Florida-based diversified holding company. BBX Capital, Inc. as a standalone entity without its subsidiaries is referred to as “BBX Capital.”

Spin-Off from Bluegreen Vacations

Prior to September 30, 2020, the Company was a wholly-owned subsidiary of Bluegreen Vacations Holding Corporation (“Bluegreen Vacations”) (formerly known as BBX Capital Corporation), whose principal holdings were Bluegreen Vacations Corporation (“Bluegreen”), BBX Capital Real Estate LLC (“BBX Capital Real Estate” or “BBXRE”), BBX Sweet Holdings, LLC (“BBX Sweet Holdings”), and Renin Holdings, LLC (“Renin”). On September 30, 2020, Bluegreen Vacations completed a spin-off which separated Bluegreen Vacations’ business, activities, and investments into two separate, publicly-traded companies: (i) Bluegreen Vacations, which continues to hold its investment in Bluegreen, and (ii) BBX Capital, which continues to hold all of Bluegreen Vacations’ other businesses and investments, including BBX Capital Real Estate, BBX Sweet Holdings, which currently owns over 90% of IT’SUGAR, LLC (“IT’SUGAR”), and Renin. The spin-off was consummated on September 30, 2020 with the distribution by Bluegreen Vacations to its shareholders of all of the outstanding shares of BBX Capital’s Common Stock through the distribution of one share of BBX Capital’s Class A Common Stock for each share of its Class A Common Stock and one share of BBX Capital’s Class B Common Stock for each share of its Class B Common Stock. Accordingly, following the spin-off, Bluegreen Vacations ceased to have an ownership interest in the Company, and Bluegreen Vacations’ shareholders who received shares of BBX Capital’s Common Stock in the distribution became shareholders of the Company.

In connection with the spin-off, BBX Capital was converted from a Florida limited liability company into a Florida corporation and changed its name from BBX Capital Florida LLC to BBX Capital, Inc., and Bluegreen Vacations changed its name from BBX Capital Corporation to Bluegreen Vacations Holding Corporation. In addition, in connection with the spin-off, Bluegreen Vacations issued a $75.0 million note payable to the Company that accrues interest at a rate of 6% per annum and requires payments of interest on a quarterly basis. Under the terms of the note, Bluegreen Vacations has the option in its discretion to defer interest payments under the note, with interest on the entire outstanding balance thereafter to accrue at a cumulative, compounded rate of 8% per annum until such time as Bluegreen Vacations is current on all accrued payments under the note, including deferred interest. All outstanding amounts under the note will become due and payable on September 30, 2025 or earlier upon certain other events. Bluegreen Vacations is permitted to prepay the note in whole or in part at any time. In December 2021, Bluegreen Vacations prepaid $25.0 million of the principal balance of the note, reducing the outstanding balance to $50.0 million as of December 31, 2021.

In October 2020, BBX Capital’s Class A Common Stock commenced trading on the OTCQX Best Market under the ticker symbol “BBXIA,” and its Class B Common Stock commenced trading on the OTC Pink Market under the ticker symbol “BBXIB.”

Our Strategies and Objectives

The Company’s goal is to build long-term shareholder value. Since many of the Company’s assets do not generate income on a regular or predictable basis, the Company’s objective is long-term growth as measured by increases in book value and intrinsic value over time. The Company regularly reviews the performance of its investments and, based upon economic, market, and other relevant factors, considers transactions involving the sale or disposition of all or a portion of its assets, investments, or subsidiaries. Further, subject to market conditions and other factors, the Company has and may from time to time in the future repurchase its outstanding common stock.

BBX Capital Real Estate 

Business Overview

BBX Capital Real Estate is engaged in the acquisition, development, construction, ownership, financing, and management of real estate and investments in real estate joint ventures, including investments in multifamily rental apartment communities, single-family master-planned for sale housing communities, and commercial properties located primarily in Florida. In addition, BBXRE currently owns a 50% equity interest in the Altman Companies, a developer and manager of multifamily apartment communities, and anticipates acquiring an additional 40% of the Altman Companies in 2023. BBXRE also manages the legacy assets acquired in connection with the Company’s sale of BankAtlantic in 2012, including portfolios of loans receivable, real estate properties, and judgments against past borrowers.

In an effort to diversify its portfolio of real estate developments, BBXRE is also currently evaluating potential investment opportunities in the development of warehouse and logistics facilities and has expanded its operating platform to include a logistics real estate division. Further, the Altman Companies is currently evaluating potential opportunities to develop multifamily apartment communities in new geographical areas, including the greater Atlanta, Georgia area. 

Strategy

BBX Capital Real Estate’s strategy is focused on:

Identifying, acquiring, and developing real estate, including multifamily rental apartment communities, single-family master-planned for sale housing communities, speculative and build-to-suit logistics real estate properties, and commercial properties; and
Identifying and investing in real estate joint ventures with third party developers.




Although BBXRE historically focused on the monetization of the legacy asset portfolio formerly held by BankAtlantic through the collection or sale of loans receivable and the development or sale of foreclosed real estate properties, the monetization of the portfolio was largely completed following the sale of several significant real estate properties during 2019. As a result, BBXRE’s long-term goal is to build a diversified portfolio of profitable real estate investments that generate recurring earnings and cash flows primarily through the following activities:

Continuing to expand its investments in multifamily rental apartment communities through the Altman Companies. In addition to the development and sale of multifamily rental apartment communities through the Altman Companies, other investment opportunities may include the development of multifamily rental apartment communities that will be owned and held over a longer term investment period and the pursuit of investment opportunities in new geographic locations outside of Florida. Further, while BBXRE’s investments in joint ventures sponsored by the Altman Companies primarily involve investing in the managing member of the joint ventures, BBXRE has in the past and may in the future consider opportunistically making increased equity investments in projects. 
Diversifying its portfolio of real estate developments by investing in the development of warehouse and logistics facilities through its logistics real estate division. 
Opportunistically deploying capital in real estate joint ventures with third party developers.

Investments

BBX Capital Real Estate currently holds investments in a diverse portfolio of real estate developments, including multifamily rental apartment communities, single-family master-planned for sale communities, mixed-used properties, and other legacy assets. The following provides a description of certain of these investments.
Multifamily Rental Apartment Communities – The Altman Companies

The Altman Companies

In November 2018, BBX Capital Real Estate acquired a 50% equity interest in the Altman Companies, a joint venture between BBXRE and Joel Altman engaged in the development, construction, and management of multifamily apartment communities, for cash consideration of $14.6 million, including $2.3 million in transaction costs. The Company accounts for this investment under the equity method of accounting. The Altman Companies is an integrated platform engaged in the development and sale of multifamily apartment communities. Since 1968, these companies and their predecessors have developed and managed more than 25,000 multifamily units throughout the United States, including communities in Florida, Michigan, Illinois, Tennessee, Georgia, Texas, and North Carolina. The Altman Companies currently operates through the following companies: 

Altman Development Company (“ADC”) – The Altman Companies owns 100% of ADC, which performs site selection and other predevelopment activities (including project underwriting and design), identifies development financing (which is typically comprised of a combination of internal and external equity and institutional debt), provides oversight of the construction process, and arranges for the ultimate sale of the projects upon stabilization. ADC enters into a development agreement with each joint venture that is formed to invest in development projects originated by the platform and earns a development fee for its services.
Altman Management Company (“AMC”) – The Altman Companies owns 100% of AMC, which performs leasing and property management services for the multifamily apartment communities developed by the Altman Companies prior to the ultimate sale of such projects. In certain cases, AMC also provides such services to apartment communities owned by third parties and certain affiliated entities. AMC enters into a leasing and property management agreement with each joint venture that is formed to invest in projects originated by the platform and earns a management fee for its services.
Altman-Glenewenkel Construction (“AGC”) – The Altman Companies owns 60% of AGC, which performs general contractor services for the multifamily apartment communities developed by the Altman Companies. AGC enters into a general contractor agreement with each joint venture that is formed to invest in projects originated by the platform and earns a general contractor fee for its services.

Pursuant to the operating agreement of the Altman Companies, BBXRE and Joel Altman invest in the managing member of the joint ventures that are formed to invest in projects originated by the platform. The managing member is typically entitled to receive an increased percentage of the joint venture distributions from the projects to the extent that the equity investors in such ventures receive agreed-upon returns on their investments. Further, BBXRE has in the past and may in the future consider opportunistically making increased equity investments in one or more of such projects originated by the Altman Companies.

The Altman Companies has historically incurred operating costs in excess of the fees earned from the projects, and as a result, earnings generated by the overall platform are generally associated with BBXRE and Joel Altman’s receipt of promoted equity distributions from their investments in the managing member of the development joint ventures. 




Pursuant to the operating agreement of the Altman Companies, BBXRE will acquire an additional 40% equity interest in the Altman Companies from Joel Altman for a purchase price, subject to certain adjustments (including reimbursements for predevelopment expenditures incurred at the time of purchase), of $9.4 million in January 2023, and Joel Altman can also, at his option or in other predefined circumstances, require BBX Capital to purchase his remaining 10% equity interest in the Altman Companies for $2.4 million. However, Joel Altman will retain his membership interests, including his decision making rights, in the managing member of any development joint ventures that are originated prior to BBXRE’s acquisition of additional equity interests in the Altman Companies. In addition, in certain circumstances, BBXRE may acquire the 40% membership interests in AGC that are not owned by the Altman Companies for a purchase price based on formulas set forth in the operating agreement of AGC. 

In connection with its investment in the Altman Companies, BBXRE acquired interests in the managing member of seven multifamily apartment developments, including four developments in which BBXRE had previously invested as a non-managing member, for aggregate cash consideration of approximately $8.8 million. As of December 31, 2021, all seven joint ventures had sold their respective multifamily apartment communities or had been recapitalized.

In addition, as of December 31, 2021, BBXRE and Joel Altman had each contributed $3.8 million to ABBX Guaranty, LLC, a joint venture established to provide guarantees on the indebtedness and construction cost overruns of new real estate joint ventures formed by the Altman Companies.

Active Developments Sponsored by The Altman Companies

As of December 31 2021, BBXRE had investments in eight active developments sponsored by the Altman Companies, which are summarized as follows (dollars in thousands):




Project | Location | Apartment Units | Project Status at December 31, 2021 | | Carrying Value of BBXRE Investment at December 31, 2021
Altis Grand Central | Tampa, Florida | 314 | Stabilized - 97% Occupied | $ | 730 
Altis Little Havana | Miami, Florida | 224 | Under Construction - Expected Completion in 2022 | | 1,021 
Altis Miramar East/West | Miramar, Florida | 650 | Under Construction - Expected Completion in 2022 | | 2,878 
Altis Ludlam Trail (1) | Miami, Florida | 312 | Under Construction - Expected Completion in 2022 | | 10,831 
Altis Grand at Lake Willis Phase 1 | Orlando, Florida | 329 | Under Construction - Expected Completion in 2023 | | 437 
Altis Lake Willis Phase 2 | Orlando, Florida | 238 | Predevelopment | | 2,538 
Altis Grand at Suncoast | Lutz, Florida | 449 | Under Construction - Expected Completion in 2023 | | 2,780 
Altis Blue Lake | West Palm Beach, Florida | 318 | Under Construction - Expected Completion in 2023 | | 260 


(1)The carrying value of BBXRE’s investment at December 31, 2021 includes $10.3 million related to BBXRE’s investment in the preferred equity associated with the Altis Ludlam Trail project, including the investment balance and accrued preferred return.

Rights to Joint Venture Distributions

The operating agreements governing the joint ventures sponsored by the Altman Companies generally provide that the holders of the non-managing membership interests are entitled to distributions based on their pro-rata share of the capital contributions to the ventures until such members receive their aggregate capital contributions plus a specified return on their capital. After such members receive their contributed capital and the specified returns, distributions are based on an agreed-upon allocation of the remaining cash flows available for distribution, with the holders of the managing membership interests receiving an increasing percentage of the distributions. As BBXRE’s investments in the above joint ventures primarily include investments as a managing member, BBXRE’s overall economic interest in the expected distributions from such ventures in many cases is not the same as its pro-rata share of its contributed capital in such ventures.
Single Family Development - Beacon Lake Master Planned Development

BBXRE is the master developer of the Beacon Lake Community, a master planned community located in St. Johns County, Florida that is being developed in four phases and expected to be comprised of 1,476 single-family homes and townhomes. BBXRE is primarily developing the land and common areas and selling finished lots to third-party homebuilders who are constructing single-family homes and townhomes that are planned to range from 1,400 square feet to 4,400 square feet and have base prices ranging from the high $300,000’s to the $700,000’s. Other than in the case of the lots comprising Phase 4, the agreements pursuant to which BBXRE is selling finished lots to homebuilders generally provide for a base purchase price that is paid to BBXRE upon the sale of the developed lots to the homebuilders and a contingent purchase price that is calculated as a percentage of the proceeds that the homebuilders receive from the sale of the completed homes. While an estimated amount of the contingent purchase price is recognized in BBXRE’s revenues upon the sale of the lots to the homebuilders, the contingent purchase price is paid to BBXRE upon the closing of such home sales.




BBXRE has substantially completed the development of the lots comprising Phases 1 and 2 of the Beacon Lake Community and commenced the development of the lots comprising Phase 3 during the second quarter of 2021. In 2021, BBXRE sold the 299 undeveloped lots comprising Phase 4 in a bulk lot sale to a single homebuilder. 

The following table summarizes the status of the sale of lots to homebuilders in each phase in the development as of December 31, 2021:


 | Phase 1 | Phase 2 | Phase 3 | Phase 4 | Total
 | | Single-family | Townhomes | | | 
Total planned lots | 302 | 479 | 196 | 200 | 299 | 1,476 
Lots sold to homebuilders (1) | (302) | (448) | (164) | — | (299) | (1,213)
Remaining lots to sell | — | 31 | 32 | 200 | — | 263 
Lots under contract with homebuilders | — | (31) | (32) | (68) | — | (131) 
Available lots (2) | — | — | — | 132 | — | 132 


(1)As further described in Item 8 - Note 2 to the Company’s consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report, BBXRE generally recognizes revenue related to sales of lots to homebuilders, including an estimate of any contingent purchase price expected to be collected in relation to such lots, upon the closing of the sale of such lots to the homebuilders. Although BBXRE recognizes the expected contingent purchase price associated with such lots upon the closing of the sale to the homebuilders, BBXRE ultimately does not receive any contingent purchase price related to a lot until the homebuilder closes on the sale of a home on such lot and collects the proceeds from the home sale. With respect to the sale of the undeveloped lots comprising Phase 4, BBXRE received the payment of the purchase price for the lots from the homebuilder at the time of closing, subject to certain adjustments contemplated in the agreement, but the agreement related to the transaction does not provide for a contingent purchase price structure similar to the agreements related to the sale of developed lots in Phases 1 through 3.
(2)Although BBXRE was previously exploring the possible construction, leasing, and management of a portfolio of rental homes on the remaining lots in Phase 3, BBXRE is developing the remaining lots in Phase 3 and currently expects that it will sell the finished lots to a homebuilder.

The following table summarizes the status of the sale of homes by homebuilders on lots previously sold by BBXRE to such homebuilders: 



 | Phase 1 | Phase 2 | Total 
 | | Single-family | Townhomes | 
Lots sold to homebuilders | 302 | 448 | 164 | 914
Homes closed | 301 | 194 | 93 | 588
Homes remaining to close | 1 | 254 | 71 | 326


BBXRE has financed a portion of the development costs for the Beacon Lake Community through the issuance of Community Development District Bonds. Under the terms of the agreements with the homebuilders, in connection with the sale of the finished lots, BBXRE is required to repay a portion of the bonds with proceeds from such sales, while a portion of the bonds are assumed by the homebuilders.

Single-Family Developments with Third Party Developers

Marbella

As of December 31, 2021, BBXRE had invested $8.1 million in a joint venture with CC Homes to develop Marbella, a residential community expected to be comprised of 158 single-family homes in Miramar, Florida. Under the terms of the operating agreement between BBXRE and CC Homes, BBXRE is entitled to receive 70.0% of the joint venture distributions until it receives its aggregate capital contributions plus a specified return on its capital. After BBXRE and CC Homes receive a specified return and the return of their contributed capital, any distributions thereafter are shared based on earnings, with CC Homes, as the managing member, receiving an increasing percentage of distributions. 

The joint venture acquired the development land in 2019 and commenced site development in 2020. As of December 31, 2021, the joint venture had executed contracts to sell all of the 158 single-family homes comprising Marbella and had closed on the sale of 32 homes. During the year ended December 31, 2021, BBXRE recognized $2.6 million of equity earnings and received $9.3 million of distributions from the venture. 

Sky Cove

In June 2019, BBXRE invested $4.2 million as one of a number of investors in a joint venture with Label & Co. to develop Sky Cove at Westlake, a residential community comprised of 204 single-family homes in Loxahatchee, Florida. Under the terms of the operating agreement governing the joint venture, BBXRE is entitled to receive 26.25% of the joint venture distributions until it receives its aggregate capital contributions plus a specified return on its capital. After all investors receive a specified return and the return of their contributed capital, any distributions thereafter are shared based on earnings, with Label & Co., as the managing member, receiving an increasing percentage of distributions.

 



During the year ended December 31, 2021, the joint venture closed on 165 single-family homes, and BBXRE recognized $1.5 million of equity earnings and received $3.2 million of distributions from the venture. As of December 31, 2021, the joint venture had executed contracts to sell an additional 31 single-family homes.

Sky Cove South

In February 2021, BBXRE invested $4.9 million as one of a number of investors in a joint venture with Label & Co. to develop Sky Cove South at Westlake, a residential community that will be adjacent to Sky Cove at Westlake and is expected to be comprised of 197 single-family homes. BBXRE’s rights to distributions from the Sky Cove South joint venture are substantially the same as its rights to distributions from the Sky Cove joint venture. 

As of December 31, 2021, the joint venture had commenced construction of the community and executed contracts to sell 103 single-family homes.

Mixed Use Developments

Bayview

In 2014, BBXRE invested in a joint venture with an affiliate of Procacci Development Corporation (“Procacci”). At the inception of the venture, BBXRE and Procacci each contributed $1.8 million to the venture in exchange for a 50% equity interest, and the joint venture acquired approximately three acres of real estate in Fort Lauderdale, Florida for $8.0 million. The site is currently comprised of an approximately 84,000 square foot office building, along with a convenience store and gas station. The office building has low occupancy with short term leases, while the lease for the convenience store ends in March 2022. 

In February 2022, BBXRE agreed to sell its equity interest in the joint venture to Procacci for net cash consideration of approximately $8.9 million. Under the terms of the agreement, Procacci will fully assume the mortgage loan on the property, which currently has an outstanding balance of $5.0 million, and BBX Capital’s existing guaranty on 50% of the outstanding loan balance for any liabilities that occur following the closing. However, the closing of the sale is subject to certain closing conditions, including obtaining a release from the lender of BBX Capital’s guaranty on the outstanding loan balance for any liabilities that occur following the closing, and there is no assurance that the transaction will be consummated pursuant to the terms of the agreement, or at all. 

The Main Las Olas

As of December 31, 2021, BBXRE had invested $3.8 million as one of a number of investors in The Main Las Olas joint venture, which was formed to invest in the development of The Main Las Olas, a mixed-used project in downtown Fort Lauderdale, Florida that is comprised of an office tower with approximately 365,000 square feet of leasable area, a residential tower with approximately 341 units, and approximately 45,000 square feet of ground floor retail. Construction was substantially completed during 2021, and as of December 31, 2021, the office tower, residential tower, and retail space were 73%, 97% and 97% leased, respectively. 

BBX Capital leases 32,166 square feet of space in the office tower for its corporate headquarters pursuant to a lease agreement with the joint venture that has an initial term that ends in 2031. 

Other Assets

In addition to the above projects, BBXRE holds certain investments in real estate joint ventures in which a majority of the assets of the ventures have been sold. BBXRE also holds various legacy assets primarily formerly held by BankAtlantic, including loans receivable and real estate with an aggregate carrying amount of approximately $16.9 million as of December 31, 2021. The majority of the legacy assets do not generate cash flow on a regular or predictable basis and are not expected to do so until the assets are monetized through loan repayments or transactions involving the sale, joint venture, or development of the underlying real estate.

Since the Company’s sale of BankAtlantic in 2012, BBXRE has generated substantial income from the legacy asset portfolio, as the majority of the loans receivable and foreclosed real estate assets within the portfolio were impaired in prior periods to their estimated fair values during the recession that began in 2007 and 2008 but were ultimately monetized by BBXRE following the recovery in the real estate market over the past several years. In recent years, BBXRE has believed that the monetization of the portfolio is substantially complete and generally has not expected significant earnings relating to the remaining assets in future periods. However, as a result of changes in market conditions over the past year, including a significant increase in demand for single-family housing in Florida, BBXRE now expects certain of these assets to generate earnings that are significantly higher than prior expectations

BBXRE is also continuing its efforts to seek collection of legal judgments against past borrowers, and although such collection efforts have continued to generate income for BBXRE over the past several years, there is significant uncertainty relating to these efforts, and there is no assurance that these efforts will generate income in future periods.

 



BBX Sweet Holdings

Business Overview 

BBX Sweet Holdings is engaged in the ownership and management of operating businesses in the confectionery industry, including: i) IT’SUGAR, a specialty candy retailer whose products include bulk candy, candy in giant packaging, and licensed and novelty items and which operates in retail locations which include a mix of high-traffic resort and entertainment, lifestyle, mall/outlet, and urban locations throughout the United States; ii) Las Olas Confections and Snacks, a manufacturer and wholesaler of chocolate and other confectionery products; and iii) Hoffman’s Chocolates, a retailer of gourmet chocolates with six retail locations in South Florida. 

Prior to September 22, 2020, the Company consolidated the financial statements of IT’SUGAR and its subsidiaries as a result of its over 90% ownership of IT’SUGAR. However, on September 22, 2020, IT’SUGAR and its subsidiaries filed voluntary petitions to reorganize under Chapter 11 of Title 11 of the U.S. Code (the “Bankruptcy Code”) in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Florida (the “Bankruptcy Court”) (the cases commenced by such filings, the “Bankruptcy Cases”), and the Company deconsolidated IT’SUGAR as a result of the filings and the uncertainties surrounding the nature, timing, and specifics of the bankruptcy proceedings. On June 16, 2021, the Bankruptcy Court confirmed IT’SUGAR’s plan of reorganization, and the plan became effective on June 17, 2021 (the “Effective Date”). Pursuant to the terms of the plan, BBX Sweet Holdings’ equity interests in IT’SUGAR were revested on the Effective Date. As a result of the confirmation and effectiveness of the plan and the revesting of its equity interests in IT’SUGAR, the Company was deemed to have reacquired a controlling financial interest in IT’SUGAR and consolidated the results of IT’SUGAR into its consolidated financial statements as of the Effective Date. See Item 7 - Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Note 23 in Item 8 – Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for further discussion related to the Bankruptcy Cases. 

Strategy

Although there are certain synergies amongst BBX Sweet Holdings’ operating businesses, these businesses have distinct business and operating strategies based on their respective business models. In particular, IT’SUGAR’s business and operating strategy is focused on:

Continuing its focus on driving traffic and sales by creating a “retailtainment” experience for customers, including developing creative and humorous product content; 
Expanding on the recent success of its “candy department store” concept as implemented in retail locations at American Dream in New Jersey and the Ala Moana Center in Honolulu, Hawaii in additional select high-traffic resort and entertainment locations; 
Evaluating additional retail locations in targeted markets in which it believes it can opportunistically capitalize on the availability of retail space and a decline in rental rates of retail space in certain markets as a result of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic;
Improving the remaining maturity of its store portfolio by extending the lease terms of its existing successful retail locations, as well as expanding the size of certain retail locations; 
Opening “short term” temporary stores in seasonal locations; and
Developing and leveraging industry relationships and establishing itself as a vehicle through which brands can market and sell their products at “retailtainment” locations specifically focused on candy products and candy-themed merchandise.

Las Olas Confections and Snacks’ strategy is primarily focused on growing its wholesale business and improving its gross margin and profitability through process improvements and efficiencies and reductions in product and operating costs. Hoffman’s Chocolates is primarily focused on driving sales at its six retail locations in South Florida. While it previously manufactured various products in a manufacturing location in Greenacres, Florida, Hoffman’s Chocolates expects to exit this manufacturing location in 2022 and purchase substantially all of its products from Las Olas Confections and Snacks, which has a manufacturing facility in Orlando, Florida.

Renin

Business Overview

Renin is engaged in the design, manufacture, and distribution of sliding doors, door systems and hardware, and home décor products and operates through its headquarters in Canada and three manufacturing and distribution facilities in the United States and Canada. In addition to its own manufacturing activities, Renin sources various products and materials from China, Brazil, and certain other countries. In October 2020, Renin acquired substantially all of the assets and assumed certain of the liabilities of Colonial Elegance, a supplier and distributor of building products that was headquartered in Montreal, Canada. Colonial Elegance’s products included barn doors, closet doors, and stair parts, and its customers included various big box retailers in the United States and Canada which were complementary to and expanded Renin’s existing customer base.

 



Renin’s products are primarily sold through three channels in North America: (i) retail, (ii) commercial, and (iii) direct installation in the greater Toronto area. For the year ended December 31, 2021, Renin’s retail channel comprised approximately 77% of its gross sales and included big box retail customers, Lowe’s (U.S. and Canada), Home Depot (U.S. and Canada), and Menards. Renin’s commercial channel comprised approximately 16% of its gross sales and included original equipment manufacturers and fabricators across North America, while Renin’s direct installation channel generated the remaining sales.

During the year ended December 31, 2021, Renin’s total revenues included $123.5 million of trade sales to three major customers and their affiliates and $50.6 million of revenues generated outside the United States. For the year ended December 31, 2021, revenues from three customers and their affiliates respectively represented $50.3 million (or 16.0%), $42.8 million (or 13.6%,), and $30.4 million (or 9.7%) of the Company’s total revenues. Renin’s long-lived assets located outside the United States, which includes properties, equipment, and right of use assets, had a carrying amount of $11.5 million as of December 31, 2021. 

Strategy

Renin’s business and operating strategy is primarily focused on: 

Increasing sales by delivering outstanding customer service; 
Lowering product and manufacturing costs through improvements in product sourcing and logistics and manufacturing efficiencies; 
Balancing an appropriate mix between domestic manufacturing and global sourcing of finished goods in light of market conditions; and
Reducing customer lead-times through improved inventory planning.

Other Investments

In addition to its principal holdings, the Company has investments in other operating businesses, including a restaurant located in South Florida that was acquired through a loan foreclosure and an insurance agency. 
Regulatory Matters

As a public company, the Company is subject to federal securities laws, including the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). In addition, the companies in which BBX Capital holds investments are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations generally applicable to their respective businesses. 

The Company collects, processes, and retains large volumes of internal and customer data, including social security numbers, credit card numbers, and other personally identifiable information of its employees and customers, in various internal information systems. The Company also transmits some of this information to third party service providers. The regulatory environment, as well as the requirements imposed on the Company by the payment card industry surrounding information, security, and privacy is increasingly demanding, in both the United States and other jurisdictions in which the Company operates. From time to time, information comes to our attention that our internal information systems, including our payment processing systems, fail to fully comply with applicable requirements and regulations. Such requirements and regulations may include, without limitation, the Florida Information Protection Act (FIPA), the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act (FACTA), and the Consumer Credit Protection Act (CCPA). Upon receipt of such information, we immediately seek to remediate the issues, both directly and with our third party service providers.

See “Item 1A – Risk Factors” for a description of risks with respect to regulatory compliance.

Seasonality 

BBX Sweet Holdings’ businesses are subject to seasonal fluctuations in trade sales, which cause fluctuations in BBX Sweet Holdings’ quarterly results of operations. Historically, IT’SUGAR generated its strongest retail trade sales during the months from June through August, as well as during the month of December, when families are generally on vacation, while BBX Sweet Holdings’ other operating businesses generate their strongest trade sales during the fourth quarter in connection with various holidays in the United States.
Human Resources

As of December 31, 2021, the Company and its subsidiaries had approximately 1,387 employees, including 811 employees at IT’SUGAR. We believe that our employee relations are satisfactory and that our employees are important to achieving our business objectives.




In 2020 and 2021, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we instituted safety protocols and procedures for our employees who continued to work at physical locations. These protocols included complying with social distancing and other health and safety standards as recommended by federal, state and local government agencies, as well as taking into consideration guidelines of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and other public health authorities. In addition, we reduced the number of in-person interactions and significantly expanded the use of virtual interactions in all aspects of our business, including administrative and operational activities. We have now returned to in-person interactions but continue to evaluate our operations in light of federal, state, and local guidance, evolving data concerning the pandemic, and the best interests of our employees and customers.

BBX Capital seeks to offer competitive compensation and benefit programs for our employees in our effort to attract and retain employees. In addition to competitive base wages, additional programs currently include: Incentive Compensation Plans, Long-Term Incentive Plans, a company matched 401(k) plan, healthcare and insurance benefits, health savings and flexible spending accounts, paid time off, family leave, and employee assistance programs. 

We are committed to foster an inclusive work environment that supports our workforce and the communities we serve. We seek to hire the best qualified employees regardless of gender, ethnicity, or other protected traits and to fully comply with all laws applicable to discrimination in the workplace.

We are committed to maintaining a work environment where employees are treated with dignity and respect, free from the threat of discrimination and harassment. We believe these same standards should apply to all stakeholders and to our interactions with customers, vendors, and independent contractors. 

We are proud to be an Equal Opportunity Employer. Our policies prohibit discrimination in hiring or advancement against any individual on the basis of race, color, religion, gender, sex, national origin, age, marital status, pregnancy, physical or mental disability, veteran status, sexual orientation, or any other characteristic protected by applicable law.

We strive to ensure our employees have access to working conditions that provide a safe and healthy environment, free from work-related injuries and illnesses. We encourage employees to raise concerns about actual or suspected misconduct. 

Competition

The industries in which the Company conducts its business are very competitive, and BBX Capital also faces substantial competition with respect to its investment activities from real estate investors and developers, private equity funds, hedge funds, and other institutional investors. BBX Capital competes with institutions and entities that are larger and have greater resources than the resources available to BBX Capital.

BBXRE invests in the development of multifamily apartment communities. Due to the historically strong performance of this class of asset within the real estate market and the recent increase in demand for housing in the markets in which BBXRE and the Altman Companies operate, BBXRE is experiencing increased competition from other real estate investors and developers, which has resulted in an increase in the cost of land and limits the number of available development opportunities in the markets in which BBXRE and the Altman Companies operate.

Renin’s products are primarily sold to large retailers and wholesalers, and it experiences intense competition from others, including importers of foreign products. 

Four unaffiliated companies in the confectionery industry currently account for the majority of the industry’s revenues, reflecting significant concentration and competition in the industry in which BBX Sweet Holdings operates.

Implications of Being an Emerging Growth Company

We qualify as an “emerging growth company” as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the “JOBS Act”). As an emerging growth company, we can take advantage of specified reduced disclosure and other requirements that are otherwise applicable generally to public companies, including reduced financial disclosure, reduced disclosure about our executive compensation arrangements, exemption from the requirements to hold non-binding advisory votes on executive compensation or shareholder approval of golden parachute payments, and exemption from the auditor attestation requirement in the assessment of our internal control over financial reporting. We expect to continue to take advantage of certain of the exemptions available to emerging growth companies until December 31, 2025 (the end of the fifth fiscal year following the initial public issuance of our common stock in connection with the spin-off from Bluegreen Vacations) or such earlier time that we no longer qualify as an emerging growth company. We would cease to be an emerging growth company if we have more than $1.07 billion in annual revenue, more than $700.0 million in market value of our stock is held by non-affiliates, or we issue more than $1.0 billion of non-convertible debt securities over a three-year period.
