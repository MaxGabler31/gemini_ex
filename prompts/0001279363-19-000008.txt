Item 1. Business.
OVERVIEW    
We are a leading managed care company, headquartered in Tampa, Florida, and focus primarily on providing government-sponsored managed care services to families, children, seniors and individuals with complex medical needs primarily through Medicaid, Medicare Advantage ("MA") and Medicare Prescription Drug Plans ("PDP"), as well as individuals in the Health Insurance Marketplace. As of December 31, 2018, we served approximately 5.5 million members nationwide. We estimate that we are among the largest managed care organizations providing Medicaid managed care services plans, MA Plans and PDPs, as measured by membership. Our broad range of experience and government focus allows us to effectively serve our members, partner with our providers, government clients and communities we serve, and efficiently manage our ongoing operations.
As of December 31, 2018, we operated Medicaid health plans, including states where we receive Medicaid premium revenues associated with dually eligible special needs plans, in Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Illinois, Kentucky, Michigan, Missouri, Nebraska, New Jersey, New York, South Carolina and Texas.
In addition, as of December 31, 2018, we also operated MA coordinated care plans ("CCPs") in Arizona, Arkansas, California, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Michigan, Mississippi, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, South Carolina, Tennessee and Texas. We also offered stand-alone Medicare PDPs in 50 states and the District of Columbia.
In September 2018, we completed the acquisition of Meridian Health Plan of Michigan, Inc., Meridian Health Plan of Illinois, Inc., and MeridianRx, a pharmacy benefit manager ("PBM") (collectively, “Meridian”). As a result of the acquisition, we expanded our Medicaid portfolio through the addition of Michigan, where Meridian has the leading market position; expanded our Medicaid presence in Illinois; and acquired an integrated PBM platform. Meridian also serves MA members in Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, and Ohio, as well as Health Insurance Marketplace members in Michigan.
We manage our business in three reportable segments: Medicaid Health Plans, Medicare Health Plans and Medicare PDPs. See Our Product Segments below for further discussion.

Acquisitions
On November 30, 2018, we completed the purchase of Aetna Inc.'s ("Aetna") entire standalone Medicare Part D prescription drug plan membership ("Aetna Part D membership"), which Aetna divested as part of CVS Health Corporation's acquisition of Aetna, for a total consideration of $107.2 million, which is subject to certain true-up provisions. Per the terms of the agreements, Aetna will provide administrative services to, and retain financial risk of, the Aetna Part D membership through 2019. Therefore, the Aetna Part D membership will be excluded from our membership and results of operations until January 1, 2020.
On September 1, 2018, we completed the acquisition of Meridian. The estimated purchase price, subject to certain purchase price adjustments, was approximately $2.5 billion. 
On April 28, 2017, we acquired all of the outstanding shares of Universal American Corp. ("Universal American"). The transaction, valued at approximately $770.0 million, strengthens our business by increasing our MA membership and deepening our presence in two key markets, Texas and New York, and diversifying our business portfolio. In addition, Universal American has joined with provider groups to operate Accountable Care Organizations (“ACOs”) under the Medicare Shared Saving Program ("MSSP") and Next Generation ACO models. 
OUR VISION, MISSION AND STRATEGY    
We focus primarily on providing government-sponsored managed care services to families, children, seniors and individuals with complex medical needs primarily through Medicaid, MA and PDPs, as well as individuals in the Health Insurance Marketplace. We are committed to operating our business in a manner that serves our key constituents - members, providers, government partners, and associates - while delivering competitive returns for our investors.
Mission
At WellCare, our members are our reason for being. We help those eligible for government-sponsored health care programs live better, healthier lives. 

Vision
Our vision is to be a leader in government-sponsored health care programs in collaboration with our members, providers, and government partners. We foster a rewarding and enriching culture to inspire our associates to do well for others.
Strategy
Overview

We focus on serving Medicaid and Medicare members, by understanding their special needs, challenges, and the communities in which they live. We have developed expertise in three major areas of government-sponsored managed care: Medicaid, MA and PDPs.

Our strategy is to diversify our sources of revenue and earnings, and, consequently, to provide a strong and stable capital position so we can serve our government partners and members. Our mission and vision are achieved by focusing on population health and integration, regulatory and provider partnerships, local markets and community connections, and delivering prudent, profitable long-term growth.

Population Health and Integration

The members that we serve include lower income individuals, members with medically-complex conditions, and those who are dually eligible for Medicaid and Medicare. We are committed to continually improving the quality of care and service that we provide to our members, and to help them access the right care at the right time in the appropriate setting. We are focused on preventive health, wellness, and a population health management model that brings together medical, behavioral, social, and pharmacy programs to provide quality care and assist our government partners given fiscal constraints. We have invested in a flexible model of care that adapts to the needs of our members through appropriate degrees of intensity, which we anticipate will improve member care, quality, accreditations, Star Ratings and, ultimately, our financial results. Providing a more comprehensive and integrated set of services provides a better care experience and engagement for our members.
Regulatory and Provider Partnerships
7


We build advanced government and provider partnerships to further enhance health care delivery and improve the quality of and access to health care services for our members via high-performing, cost-effective health care solutions. Our provider networks, community support relationships, and service infrastructure are targeted to serving Medicaid and Medicare eligible members who may be economically disadvantaged. In each community that WellCare serves, we focus on developing a comprehensive and collaborative provider network, which is essential to delivering quality health care to our members and value to our government partners. Our experience, exclusive commitment to government-sponsored managed care programs and regulatory relationships, provides improved budget predictability and innovative health care solutions that emphasize preventative care, collaborative and holistic care coordination, and supportive disease management.
Local Markets and Community Connections

WellCare’s “mission to serve” starts with our members, but it does not end there. We achieve greater presence and support through our local market structure. In each of the states in which we operate, we have a market leader who manages customer-facing functions such as member outreach, provider engagement and quality management, and state regulatory and government relations. Through our model, WellCare's Community Connections, we connect members, their caregivers and the community-at-large with needed resources through a network of community partners. We are committed to closing social care gaps with our model of care through collaboration with local community and social groups that are targeted at serving members who may be economically disadvantaged. Our commitment includes breaking down social barriers that prevent our members from attaining the health care they need by connecting them not only to medical professionals, but also to community-based resources including food banks, housing assistance, transportation, child care, and education programs.
Delivering Prudent, Profitable Long-Term Growth

We pursue opportunities for prudent, profitable growth by bidding on existing and new Medicaid program procurements. These opportunities can have a substantial concentration of medically-complex and dual-eligible members, such as long-term services and supports and the aged, blind and disabled. Long-term growth also includes our intent to enter new service areas for Medicare Advantage. We grow organically by creating provider networks, building community connections, and developing marketing strategies to expand into new service areas and offer new products. We also seek to acquire and integrate attractive Medicaid and/or Medicare related businesses that will strengthen our capabilities and/or market position. 

We align our expense structure with our revenue base and continually assess opportunities to maintain appropriate medical benefit ratios, obtain actuarially-sound rates, and manage administrative costs to generate earnings that enable us to reinvest in our business and members. With respect to medical benefits expense, our initiatives are focused on quality improvement, reductions in unit costs, optimizing utilization of services, and eliminating waste and abuse. We also continue to invest in technology, regulatory compliance, and other infrastructure to improve efficiency and service quality to our members and providers. For more information regarding our SG&A ratio, please see Item 6 - Selected Financial Data as well as Item 7 - Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

For a list of key developments and accomplishments relating to progress on our business strategy that occurred or affected our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows during 2018, and in the 2019 period prior to issuance of this 2018 Form 10-K, please see Item 7 - Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Key Developments and Accomplishments.
OUR BUSINESS - MEDICAID AND MEDICARE HEALTH PROGRAMS    
Government-sponsored coverage in the United States is an important element of the health care system. Managed care solutions have a well-established track record of helping governments improve health care quality and access for beneficiaries while strengthening the fiscal sustainability of these programs. Given economic conditions, demographics, budget challenges, and the proven success of managed care programs, we believe federal and state governments will continue to turn to managed care solutions to help achieve program objectives.
A “managed care” plan is an integrated health care delivery system that manages health care services for an enrolled population rather than simply providing or paying for these services. Services within managed care plans are usually delivered by providers who are under contract to, or employed by, the plan. Managed care plans use a variety of approaches to “manage” care, including, but not limited to, care and disease management, capitation, risk-sharing or value-based arrangements with providers, the use of primary care physicians to act as health care coordinators and the use of preferred provider networks.

As of December 31, 2018, our Medicare plans are primarily offered under the WellCare name, for which we hold a federal trademark registration. In Hawaii and California, we offer our plans under the names 'Ohana and Easy Choice, respectively. Additionally, certain of our Texas and northeast plans are offered under the Texan Plus and Today's Options names, respectively. In Michigan, Indiana and Ohio, and certain plans in Illinois, we offer our plans under the Meridian name. For our Medicaid plans, we offered a number of brand names depending on the state, consisting of Care1st Arizona, Staywell in Florida, 'Ohana in Hawaii, Meridian in Illinois and Michigan, Missouri Care in Missouri and, until December 31, 2018, Harmony in Illinois, and the WellCare brand name in Georgia, Kentucky, Nebraska, New Jersey, New York and South Carolina. 
Medicaid
Medicaid provides medical assistance to elderly, disabled, children and their families, and is implemented and operated by each state. Medicaid is funded and regulated by both the state and federal governments in partnership. Within federal guidelines, each state establishes its own eligibility standards; determines the type, amount, duration and scope of services; sets the rate of payment for services; and administers its own program. This results in considerable variation in the types of services covered and the amount of care provided across states. Most states offer a variety of public programs including Temporary Assistance for Needy Families ("TANF"), Supplemental Security Income ("SSI"), Aged, Blind and Disabled ("ABD") as well as other state-based programs that are not part of the Medicaid program, such as Children's Health Insurance Program ("CHIP") and Long-Term Services and Supports ("LTSS"). TANF generally provides financial assistance to low-income families with children. ABD and SSI generally provide assistance to low-income aged, blind or disabled individuals. CHIPs provide assistance to qualifying children and their families who are not eligible for Medicaid because their income exceeds the applicable income thresholds. See further discussion below under "Children's Health Insurance Program". LTSS programs are designed to help people with chronic illnesses or who have disabilities and need health and long-term care services, such as home care or adult day care, to enable them to stay in their homes and communities as long as possible.
We have entered into contracts with Medicaid agencies in each state in which we operate Medicaid plans. Some of the states in which we operate award contracts to applicants that can demonstrate that they meet the state's minimum requirements. Other states engage in a competitive bidding process for all or certain programs. In either case, we must demonstrate to the satisfaction of the respective agency that we are able to meet certain operational and financial requirements. For example, depending on the state:

• | we must coordinate care that encompasses the full breadth of a member's needs including their physical health, behavioral health, pharmacy, LTSS and, increasingly, their need for social, non-medical services;


• | we contract with providers and measure access and availability in terms of the time needed for a member to reach the doctor's office;


• | our quality improvement programs must emphasize member education, member outreach and include measures designed to promote utilization of preventive services;


• | we must have linkages with schools, city or county health departments and other community-based providers of health care in order to demonstrate our ability to coordinate all of the sources from which our members may receive care;


• | we must have the capability to meet the needs of members with complex conditions including those with co-occurring conditions and those who have disabilities;


• | our providers and member service representatives must be able to communicate with members who do not speak English or who are hearing impaired;


• | our member handbook, newsletters and other communications must be written at the prescribed reading level and must be available in certain languages other than English;


• | we must have the capabilities to meet any specialized waiver requirements, such as member premium payments or work eligibility requirements; and


• | we must demonstrate our readiness to meet contract requirements prior to the commencement date of services.

Once awarded, our Medicaid program contracts generally have terms of one to three years. Most of these contracts provide for renewal upon mutual agreement of the parties, or at the option of the government agency, and both parties have certain early termination rights. Generally, under state regulation, these contracts are only renewable for a limited amount of time prior to reprocurement in the states that require procurements. In addition to the operating requirements listed above, state contract requirements and regulatory provisions applicable to us generally set forth detailed provisions relating to subcontractors, marketing, safeguarding of member information, fraud, waste and abuse reporting, grievance procedures, and timely submission of encounter data and other cost reporting.
Our compliance with the provisions of our contracts is subject to monitoring or examination by state regulators and their agents. Certain contracts require us to be subject to quality assurance evaluations and accreditation by a third-party organization.

Children's Health Insurance Program
The Children's Health Insurance Program is a joint federal-state program established to provide coverage to uninsured children in families whose incomes are too high to qualify for Medicaid. To encourage states to participate, CHIP provided states with enhanced federal financing and greater flexibility in program design compared to Medicaid. We provide services under CHIP in ten states. In some states, like Hawaii, those beneficiaries are served as a part of the state’s Medicaid program. In other states, including New York and Florida, the state’s CHIP is operated separately. CHIP was established in 1997 to serve low-income, uninsured children. In some states, the program was extended to the parents of those children. As a result of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively, the "ACA"), parents previously covered under CHIP may now instead be covered through the state’s Medicaid expansion or may be eligible for premium assistance and other subsidies through the state or federal exchange, as applicable. Accordingly, CHIP programs are sometimes referred to as expansion programs. The ACA maintained CHIP eligibility standards for children in place as of enactment through 2019. 
On January 22, 2018, CHIP funding was extended for six years as part of a broader continuing resolution to fund the federal government and further extended to 2027 by the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, on February 9, 2018. The resolution extended the requirement for states to maintain coverage for children from 2019 through 2023, but on or after October 1, 2019, the requirement is limited to children in families with incomes at or below 300% of the federal poverty level.
Medicare
The Medicare program provides health care coverage primarily to individuals age 65 or older as well as to individuals with certain disabilities and consists of four parts, labeled A through D. Part A provides hospitalization benefits financed largely through Social Security taxes and requires beneficiaries to pay out-of-pocket deductibles and coinsurance. Part B provides benefits for medically necessary services and supplies including outpatient care, physician services, and home health care. Beneficiaries enrolled in Part B are required to pay monthly premiums and are subject to annual deductibles. Parts A and B are referred to as "Original Medicare."
Medicare beneficiaries may elect to receive their Medicare benefits through Part C, MA plans, as an alternative to Original Medicare. Under MA, private health plans, including health maintenance organizations ("HMO") and preferred provider organizations ("PPO"), contract with CMS to provide benefits that are comparable to, or that may be more attractive (such as including prescription drug coverage and supplemental benefits) to Medicare beneficiaries than Original Medicare in exchange for a fixed monthly per member payment that varies based on the county in which a member resides, the demographics of the member and the member's health condition. MA plans may also charge beneficiaries monthly premiums and other copayments for Medicare-covered services or for certain extra benefits. Medicare's prescription drug benefit, Part D, provides outpatient drug coverage through MA plans and standalone prescription drug plans.
PPO products offer seniors the ability to obtain services from out-of-network providers with additional out-of-pocket expenses. For the year ended December 31, 2018, we offered PPO products in Florida, Georgia, New York and South Carolina. As more seniors opt for plan flexibility, our ability to offer a choice of products will be important to attracting more customers.
Additionally, through our acquisition of Universal American in 2017, we added a Medicare private-fee-for-service ("PFFS") product to our Medicare portfolio. PFFS plans are open-access plans that allow members to be seen by any physician or facility that participates in the Original Medicare program and are subject to our network terms and conditions. PFFS beneficiaries can join a PFFS plan that has Part D drug coverage or join a plan without such coverage. Our PFFS plans are offered under contracts with CMS and provide enhanced health care benefits compared to Original Medicare, subject to cost sharing and other limitations. We actively coordinate care for these members in a similar manner to our PPO and HMO plans. In addition to a fixed monthly payment per member from CMS, individuals in these plans may be required to pay a monthly premium in selected counties or for selected enhanced products. 
We offer a Chronic Special Needs Plan ("C-SNP"), which limits enrollment to individuals with specific severe or disabling chronic conditions. C-SNP plans focus on monitoring health status, managing chronic diseases, avoiding inappropriate hospitalizations and helping beneficiaries move from high risk to lower risk on the care continuum. CMS has approved 15 C-SNPs specific to certain chronic conditions. Our C-SNP program targets cardiovascular disorders and is limited to certain counties in Florida. 
10

Beneficiaries enrolled in Original Medicare can either join a stand-alone PDP plan or forgo Part D prescription drug coverage. Beneficiaries enrolled in Medicare Advantage plans can join a plan with Part D coverage (a "MA-PD" plan), select a stand-alone PDP plan or forgo Part D prescription drug coverage. Beneficiaries who are dually eligible for Medicare and Medicaid, and certain beneficiaries who qualify for a low-income subsidy ("LIS"), but who do not enroll in a MA plan with drug benefits or a PDP, are automatically assigned to a plan by CMS. These assignments are made among those PDPs that submitted bids below the applicable regional benchmarks for standard Part D plans established annually by CMS.
All managed care plans offering Part D (PDP and MA-PD) bid on providing Part D benefits in June of each year. Based on the bids submitted, CMS establishes a benchmark for each of the 34 regions. CMS pays the Part D plans a percentage of the benchmark on a per member per month ("PMPM") basis with the remaining portion of the premium being paid by the Medicare member. Members whose income falls below 150% of the federal poverty level qualify for the federal LIS, through which the federal government helps pay the member's Part D premium and certain other cost sharing expenses.
Our MA and PDP plan contracts with CMS are on a calendar-year basis. CMS requires that each plan meet certain regulatory requirements including, as applicable: provisions related to enrollment and disenrollment; restrictions on marketing activities; benefits or formulary requirements; quality assessment; encounter data reports; fraud, waste and abuse monitoring; maintaining relationships with health care providers; and responding to appeals and grievances.
Dual-eligibles
Individuals qualifying for both Medicare and Medicaid are referred to as "dual-eligibles." For dual-eligibles, if a service is covered by Medicare and Medicaid, Medicare is the primary payer. Medicaid pays for services available under the state's Medicaid program, which exceed or supplement what Medicare covers, often referred to as wrap-around coverage. Medicaid may also cover some beneficiary cost-sharing associated with Medicare services. For Medicaid benefits that are not covered by Medicare, such as certain long-term care services, Medicaid covers the cost of these benefits unless there is another liable third-party payer. Medicaid is generally the payer of last resort. 
Improved care coordination is imperative to enhance care options for dual-eligibles as an aging population and increased life expectancy among Americans with disabilities increase the dual-eligible population. As such, dual-eligible programs have become an immediate target for both spending reductions and attempts to improve the quality of care beneficiaries receive. The ACA created a federal Medicare-Medicaid Coordination Office to serve dual-eligibles. This Medicare-Medicaid Coordination Office has initiated a series of state Duals Demonstration Programs intended to provide better coordination and integration of care between Medicare and Medicaid on a capitated or fee-for-service basis, which is required to produce cost savings. As of January 1, 2019, we operate dual special needs plans ("D-SNPs") in 19 states.
General Economic and Political Environment Affecting our Business
We expect overall spending on health care in the U.S. to continue to rise due to inflation, evolving medical technology, pharmaceutical advancement, regulatory requirements, demographic trends in the U.S. population and national interest in health and well-being. The rate of market growth may be affected by a variety of factors, including macro-economic conditions and enacted health care reforms, which could also affect our results of operations. We expect that the state and federal governments will continue to look for budgetary cost control savings through reductions in health care expenses. 
The 115th Congress proposed several plans to cut or restructure Medicare including raising the Medicare eligibility age, moving Medicare to a defined contribution model, converting Medicare to a voucher system and various other modifications including cuts to provider reimbursement. Medicaid is similarly situated, consuming ever greater portions of the federal budget. As a result, the 115th Congress also considered several proposals to modify the Medicaid program including moving from a match program to block grants, moving to a per-capita capitation system, limiting the use of provider taxes to fund the state’s portion of the Medicaid program, as well as modifying the ACA Medicaid expansions. While legislative efforts to restructure Medicare and modify the Medicaid programs have stalled following the 2018 midterm elections, the current presidential administration may modify these programs through regulatory mechanisms. Consequently, we do not know whether any of these proposals will pass or the effect any such actions could have on our business. 
In addition, states are looking for more flexibility to design their Medicaid programs to manage their state health care budgets, including by imposing premium and community engagement or work requirements to maintain Medicaid eligibility. For example, the State of Kentucky intends to implement new premium and community engagement or work requirements for certain members to maintain their eligibility for the Medicaid program, which may reduce our Medicaid membership in Kentucky. However, these requirements have been challenged in federal district court and their implementation is currently 
11

stayed. Once implemented, these changes could reduce the membership in our Medicaid health plans, which could have a materially adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
In May 2016, CMS published regulations that overhauled Medicaid managed care requirements, which were further revised in November 2018. These regulations include requirements that state Medicaid programs evaluate network adequacy standards; impose a requirement of managed care organizations ("MCO") to report medical loss ratios ("MLRs") annually to states; and a requirement that states set MCO rates to reasonably achieve an MLR of greater than 85% as long as the capitation rates are actuarially sound. Additionally, these regulations expand federal financial participation reimbursement opportunities related to members with behavioral health issues who receive short term services in an alternative institute for mental health and outline requirements for value-based provider contracting.  Under the regulations, the states may also be tasked with developing and publicizing plan quality rating results.  To the extent we do not comply with the implementing regulations by the states, we may be subject to additional financial penalties and/or reductions in membership, which may materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
In addition, on December 21, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 was enacted, which reformed tax rates beginning January 1, 2018. For additional discussion, refer to Note 14 - Income Taxes to the consolidated financial statements included in this 2018 Form 10-K.
Health Care Reform
In March 2010, the ACA became law and significantly reformed various aspects of the U.S. health insurance industry. Financing for these reforms comes in part from substantial additional fees and taxes on us and other health insurers, health plans and individuals, as well as reductions in certain levels of payments to us and other health plans under Medicare. The majority of regulations and interpretive guidance on provisions of the ACA have been issued by the Department of Health and Human Services ("HHS"), the Department of Labor, the Treasury Department, and the National Association of Insurance Commissioners ("NAIC"). There may be provisions of the legislation that receive additional guidance and clarification in the form of regulations and interpretations. 
On February 9, 2018, the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 was enacted, which among other things, extended CHIP for an additional four years, until 2027, added additional flexibility to how ACOs can operate and accelerated the timing of the closure of the Part D “coverage gap” (i.e., the dollar threshold at which an individual has to pay full price for his or her medications). As a result, Part D beneficiaries' co-pays will be reduced to 25% of prescription costs in 2019, instead of that reduction occurring in 2020 under prior law. In addition, MA special needs plans were permanently reauthorized, but additional requirements for care coordination and integration of long-term services and supports were imposed.  We are still assessing the affect these changes may have on our business.
The ACA included a number of changes that affected the way plans operate, such as reduced Medicare premium rates, CMS Star Ratings, minimum MLRs and other provisions.
CMS Star Ratings
CMS developed a five-star rating system, which awards between 1.0 and 5.0 stars to MA and PDP plans based on performance in several categories, including quality of care and customer service. Certain provisions in the ACA provide additional Medicare revenue related to the achievement of higher Star Ratings that can be used to offer more attractive benefit packages to members and/or achieve higher profit margins. In addition, plans with Star Ratings of 5.0 are eligible for year-round open enrollment, whereas plans with lower Star Ratings have more restrictions on enrollment criteria and timing. Part C or Part D Medicare plans with Star Ratings of less than three stars for three consecutive years are denoted as "low performing" plans on the CMS website and in the CMS "Medicare and You" handbook. In addition, CMS could exercise its authority to terminate the MA and PDP contracts for plans rated below three stars for three consecutive years for the plan year 2021. As a result, plans that achieve higher Star Ratings may have a competitive advantage over plans with lower Star Ratings.
CMS's current quality measurement methodology does not appropriately account for socio-economic determinants of health. Because we have a greater percentage of lower-income members than average, we may be unable to achieve or maintain a 4.0 Star Rating for some or all of our plans without a legislative or regulatory adjustment to the quality measurement methodology. Though various regulatory and legislative solutions have been proposed, we continue to work with our legislative and regulatory partners to ensure this issue is adequately addressed.
In October 2018, CMS announced 2019 MA and PDP Star Ratings. Four of our 25 active MA contracts, serving certain members in California, Florida, Texas and New York/Maine, received an overall rating of 4.0 stars or higher and served 
12

approximately 41.2% of our total December 31, 2018 MA membership. Excluding members from our two dual demonstration MA contracts, which are not subject to star ratings, these four contracts served approximately 42.2% of our total December 31, 2018 MA membership. 
Additionally, five of our MA contracts received an overall rating of 3.5 stars, including contracts serving certain members in Arizona, Connecticut, Kentucky, North Carolina, New York and Texas; while, eight of our MA contracts received an overall rating of 3.0 stars, serving members in 11 states, and eight of our MA contracts have not been scored due to size, are too new to be rated or not subject to star ratings. 
Our MA plan serving Hawaii and Louisiana received an overall score of 3.0 stars, and for its Part D operations for 2018 and 2019 received a score of 2.5 stars and, as a result, could be subject to termination by CMS if the score does not improve for 2020.
Minimum Medical Loss Ratio 
Beginning in 2014, the ACA established a minimum MLR for MA and Part D plans, requiring plans to spend not less than 85% of premiums on medical and pharmacy benefits. The rules implementing the minimum MLR impose financial and other penalties for failing to achieve the minimum MLR, including requirements to refund to CMS shortfalls in amounts spent on medical benefits and termination of a plan’s MA contract for prolonged failure to achieve the minimum MLR. The MLR prescribed by HHS differs from the MLR calculation under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America ("GAAP") and is determined by adding a plan’s spending for clinical services, prescription drugs and other direct member benefits, plus the plan's total spending on quality improvement activities and dividing the total by earned premiums (after subtracting specific identified taxes and other fees). This provision has not had a material effect on our results of operations.
Other Provisions

The ACA imposed certain new taxes and fees, including limitations on the amount of compensation that is tax deductible, as well as an annual premium-based health insurance industry assessment (the "ACA industry fee"). The total ACA industry fee levied on the health insurance industry was $11.3 billion in both 2015 and 2016, increasing to $14.3 billion in 2018. After 2018, the ACA industry fee increases according to an index based on net premium growth. The assessment is being levied on certain health insurers that provide insurance in the assessment year, and is allocated to health insurers based on each health insurer's share of net premiums for all U.S health insurers in the year preceding the assessment. The ACA industry fee is not deductible for income tax purposes, which has significantly increased our effective income tax rate. In December 2015, President Obama signed the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016 which, among other provisions, included a one-year moratorium on the ACA industry fee for 2017. While the ACA industry fee was assessed in 2018, the continuing resolution approved in January 2018 provides for an additional one-year moratorium for 2019 for the ACA industry fee. Reinstatement of the fee in future years and/or any future increases could increase our tax rates and adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
We received amendments, written agreements or other documentation from all our Medicaid customers that commit them to reimburse us for the portion of the ACA industry fee on our Medicaid plans, including its non-deductibility for income tax purposes. CMS does not directly reimburse us for the effect of the ACA industry fee related to MA and PDP premiums.
Five states are currently challenging the requirement that the IRS assess the ACA industry fee on Medicaid and CHIP plans. As a result, there is uncertainty with respect to the ACA industry fee, including that the ACA industry fee could be reallocated to other health insurance products. Changes to how the ACA industry fee is assessed may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
In addition, the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015 is gradually increasing rates on the provider fee schedule from June 30, 2015 to 2019. After 2019, the provider fee schedules will also adjust rates based on quality performance. This Act also provided for incentive payments for those providers that participate in an alternative payment model, such as a demonstration program. Beginning in 2019, the Act also provides that we are required to pay out of network providers an additional quality-related payment pursuant to the Merit Based Incentive Payment System. These increases may increase our medical expenses and adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. 
The ACA also established Medicare Shared Savings ACOs as a tool to improve quality and lower costs through increased care coordination in the Medicare fee-for-service (“FFS”) program, which covers the majority of the Medicare-eligible population. CMS established the Medicare Shared Service Program (“MSSP”) to facilitate coordination and cooperation among 
13

providers to improve the quality of care for FFS beneficiaries and reduce unnecessary costs. The MSSP shares savings with the ACOs when they generate savings above a minimum savings rate and meet quality of care performance standards. The future of the ACOs is uncertain given the uncertain funding status of the ACA, or its modification.
In December 2018, a Texas federal district court ruled that the ACA was unconstitutional. Implementation of the ruling has been stayed pending appeal. If the ruling is ultimately upheld, the membership in our states that have expanded Medicaid eligibility may be reduced, which may adversely affect our results of operations.
The reforms in the ACA present both challenges and opportunities for Medicaid plans. The reforms provide states the option to expand eligibility for Medicaid programs. However, some states have decided not to participate in the Medicaid expansion, and some states who have expanded may revisit their decision. In addition, state budgets continue to be strained due to economic conditions and uncertain levels of federal financing for current and expansion populations. As a result, the effects of any potential future expansions are uncertain, including whether states that have expanded will maintain their expansion, making it difficult to determine whether the net effect of the ACA, or any modification, will be positive or negative for Medicaid plans. 
We currently serve the ACA Medicaid expansion population in Arizona, Hawaii, Illinois, Kentucky, New Jersey and New York. Our other Medicaid states, Florida, Georgia, Michigan, Missouri, Nebraska and South Carolina, have not expanded their Medicaid eligibility. 
OUR PRODUCT SEGMENTS 
Our operations are conducted in three reportable segments: Medicaid Health Plans, Medicare Health Plans and Medicare PDPs, which correspond with the Medicaid and Medicare products that we offer.

Medicaid Health Plans
Our Medicaid Health Plans segment includes plans for beneficiaries of TANF, SSI and ABD programs and other state-based programs that are not part of the Medicaid program, such as CHIP and LTSS. For purposes of our Medicaid Health Plans segment, we define our customer as the state and related governmental agencies that have common control over the contracts under which we operate in that particular state. As of January 1, 2019, we are the largest Medicaid health plan by membership in Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Kentucky, Michigan and Missouri.
The Medicaid programs and services we offer to our members vary by state and county and are designed to effectively serve our constituencies in the communities in which we operate. Although our Medicaid contracts determine, to a large extent, the type and scope of health care services that we arrange for our members, in certain markets we provide additional value-added benefits in ways that we believe make our offerings more attractive. Our Medicaid plans provide our members with access to a broad spectrum of medical benefits from primary care and preventive programs to full hospitalization and long-term services and support.
In general, members are required to use our network to receive care, except in cases of emergencies, transition of care or when network providers are unavailable to meet their medical needs. Members generally do not pay any premiums, deductibles 
14

or co-payments for most of our Medicaid plans; however, the Kentucky Medicaid program intends to implement premium and community engagement and work requirements for continued eligibility purposes. 
Certain contracts expired in 2018; however, we are still serving members as if these contracts were still effective and expect the contracts to be renewed. Our other current Medicaid contracts are set to expire or renew between June 2019 and December 2023. The following table sets forth the terms and expiration dates of our Medicaid contracts with the State of Florida and the Commonwealth of Kentucky, the two states that each accounted for greater than 10% of our consolidated premium revenues during 2018.

State | Line of Business | Term of Contract 
Florida | Medicaid (MMA) | February 4, 2014 - December 31, 2018
Florida | Medicaid and LTC | August 27, 2018 - December 31, 2023 
Kentucky | Medicaid and CHIP | July 1, 2018 - June 30, 2019

Medicare Health Plans
We contract with CMS under the Medicare program to provide a comprehensive array of Part C and Part D benefits to Medicare eligible persons, through our MA plans. Our MA plans are comprised of CCPs which are primarily administered through HMOs and generally require members to seek health care services and select a PCP from a network of health care providers. In addition, we offer Medicare Part D coverage, which provides prescription drug benefits, as a component of our MA plans. 
As of December 31, 2018, we offered MA plans in a total of 524 counties across 21 states to 545,000 members. As of January 1, 2019, we are offering MA plans in a total of 558 counties across 22 states to 567,000 members. We offer D-SNPs in 82.8% of the MA counties that we serve, and approximately 31.3% of our MA members are "dually-eligible" for Medicare and Medicaid and are enrolled in one of our D-SNPs or dual demonstration programs. We cover a wide spectrum of medical services through our MA plans. For many of our plans, we provide additional benefits not covered by Original Medicare, such as vision, dental and hearing services. Through these enhanced benefits, out-of-pocket expenses incurred by our members are generally reduced, which allows our members to better manage their health care costs. We believe that our D-SNPs are attractive to these beneficiaries due to the enhanced benefit offerings and clinical support programs.
Some of our MA plans require members to pay a co-payment, which varies depending on the services and level of benefits provided. Typically, members of our MA CCPs are required to use our network of providers, except in specific cases such as emergencies, transition of care or when specialty providers in our network are unavailable to meet their medical needs. MA CCP members may see out-of-network specialists if they receive referrals from their PCPs and may be required to pay incremental cost-sharing.
We continue to focus on three main areas in MA, including:

• | execution on quality and affordability initiatives;


• | continued application of a disciplined portfolio approach to our MA bids, including a focus on net income; and


• | improving Star Ratings, both in terms of execution on quality initiatives and our advocacy position to properly match the ratings, rules and economics with the prevalent data that demonstrates the connection between socio-economic status and lower quality ratings.

Refer to Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this 2018 Form 10-K for a complete discussion of our premium revenue recognition policy.
As of December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, our Medicare Health Plans segment had approximately 545,000, 496,000 and 345,000 members, respectively. Refer to Item 7 – Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for membership discussion by segment for 2018, 2017 and 2016.
As of January 1, 2019, our Medicare Health Plans segment had approximately 567,000 members, an increase of approximately 22,000 compared with December 31, 2018.
Medicare PDPs
We have contracted with CMS to serve as a plan sponsor offering stand-alone Medicare Part D PDP plans to Medicare-eligible beneficiaries through our Medicare PDPs segment. As of January 1, 2019, we offer PDPs in 50 states and the District of Columbia. Our PDPs offer national in-network prescription drug coverage, including a preferred pharmacy network, subject to limitations in certain circumstances.
The PDP benefit design generally results in our incurring a greater portion of the responsibility for total prescription drug costs in the early stages of a plan year, and less in the latter stages of a plan year, due to the members' share of cumulative out-of-pocket costs increasing throughout the plan year. As a result, the PDP medical benefits ratio ("MBR") generally decreases throughout the year. 
Our PDP contracts with CMS are renewable for successive one-year terms unless CMS notifies us of its decision not to renew by May 1 of the current contract year or we notify CMS of our decision not to renew by the first Monday in June of the contract year.

Refer to Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this 2018 Form 10-K for a complete discussion of our premium revenue recognition policy.

As of December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, we served approximately 1,057,000, 1,152,000 and 1,009,000 PDP members, respectively. Refer to Item 7 – Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for membership discussion by segment for 2018, 2017 and 2016.
Our 2019 PDP bids resulted in one of our basic plans being below the benchmarks in 21 of the 34 CMS regions, and within the de minimis range in 10 other regions, compared with our 2018 bids, in which we were below the benchmarks in 25 of the 34 CMS regions, and within the de minimis range in five other regions. As of January 1, 2019, we served approximately 1,590,000 PDP members, an increase of approximately 533,000 from December 31, 2018 resulting from our 2019 bid positioning. 
OUR OPERATIONS    
Provider Networks and Provider Reimbursement Methods 
As of December 31, 2018, we contracted with approximately 750,000 health care providers and 69,000 pharmacies to provide our members with access to medically necessary services. Our contracted providers deliver a variety of services to our members including: primary and specialty physician care; laboratory and imaging services; inpatient, outpatient, home health and skilled facility care; medication and injectable drug therapy; ancillary services; durable medical equipment and related services; mental health and chemical dependency counseling and treatment; transportation; and dental, hearing and vision care.
The following are the types of providers in our Medicaid and MA CCP contracted networks:

• | Professionals such as PCPs, provider groups, specialty care physicians, psychologists and licensed social workers;


• | Facilities such as hospitals with inpatient, outpatient and emergency services, skilled nursing facilities, outpatient surgical facilities, urgent care facilities/clinics, Federally Qualified Health Centers ("FQHC") and diagnostic imaging centers;


• | Ancillary providers such as laboratory providers, radiology, home health, physical therapy, speech therapy, occupational therapy, ambulance providers and transportation providers; and


• | Pharmacies, including retail pharmacies, mail order pharmacies and specialty pharmacies.

These providers are contracted through a variety of mechanisms, including agreements with individual providers, groups of providers, independent provider associations, integrated delivery systems and local and national provider chains such as hospitals, surgical centers and ancillary providers. We also contract with other companies who provide access to contracted providers, such as pharmacy, dental, hearing, vision, transportation and mental health benefit managers.
Facility, physician, pharmacy, dental, vision and behavioral health contracts cover medically necessary services and, under some of our plans, enhanced benefits. These contracts may have terms of one to four years with some of the agreements automatically renewing at the end of the contract period, unless otherwise specified in writing by either party. During the contract period, these agreements typically can be terminated without cause upon written notice by either party, but the notification period may range from 90 to 180 days and early termination may subject the terminating party to financial penalties.
The contract terms require providers to participate in our quality improvement and utilization review programs, which we may modify from time to time. Providers must also adhere to applicable state and federal regulations.

We periodically review payments made to providers and make adjustments, as necessary. Generally, our contracts with providers do not allow for automatic annual increases in reimbursement levels; however, we review these contracts periodically to ensure competitiveness. Among the factors generally considered in routine adjustments are changes to state Medicaid or Medicare fee schedules, competitive environment, current market conditions, anticipated utilization patterns and projected medical expenses. Some provider contracts are directly tied to state Medicaid or Medicare fee schedules, in which case, reimbursement levels will be adjusted up or down, generally on a prospective basis, based on adjustments made by the state or CMS to the appropriate fee schedule.
The Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015 is gradually increasing rates on the provider fee schedule from June 30, 2015 to 2019. After 2019, the provider fee schedules will also adjust rates based on quality performance. This Act also provided for incentive payments for those providers that participate in an alternative payment model, such as a demonstration program. Beginning in 2019, the Act also provides that we are required to pay out of network providers an additional quality-related payment pursuant to the Merit Based Incentive Payment System. These increases may increase our medical expenses and adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. 
17

Physicians and Provider Groups
PCPs play an important role in coordinating and managing the care of our Medicaid and MA CCP members. This coordination includes delivering preventive services as well as referring members to other providers for medically necessary services. PCPs are typically trained in internal medicine, pediatrics, family practice, general practice or, in some markets, obstetrics and gynecology. In rare instances, a physician trained in sub-specialty care will perform primary care services for a member with a chronic condition.
Additionally, mental health and substance abuse are increasing areas of focus in our overall population’s health, providing a growing priority for our behavioral health providers. In response, we are forging new partnerships to support more comprehensive and integrated care including behavioral health homes and integrated health homes. 
PCPs and specialty care providers are typically reimbursed a specified fee for the service performed, which is known as fee-for-service. The specified fee is set as a percentage of the amount Medicaid or Medicare would pay under the applicable fee-for-service program. 
We reimburse some of our PCPs and specialty care provider groups on a fixed-fee PMPM basis. This type of reimbursement methodology is commonly referred to as capitation. The reimbursement covers care provided directly by the provider as well as coordination of care from other providers, as described above. In certain markets, we may also reimburse certain services such as vaccinations and laboratory or screening services delivered by the PCP in addition to the capitation payment. 
Consistent with our long-term business priorities and emerging regulatory guidance, we have increased emphasis on aligning provider incentives with our objective of improving health care quality by employing a continuum of performance-based arrangements to incentivize providers to improve the quality of care they provide to our members. Substantially all of our contracted PCPs are eligible to participate in our quality incentive programs and/or other value-based arrangements. These arrangements consisted of additional payments for achieving specified quality of care targets. In 2018, 54% of Medicare and 35% of Medicaid hospital, professional and pharmacy payments were made through these value-based arrangements.
We also maintain shared-surplus, shared-risk and full-risk arrangements by establishing an operating fund for provider groups participating in these types of arrangements. We monitor the performance of this fund to determine whether these providers are eligible for shared savings payments or whether they should reimburse us if the contracts include shared or full risk provisions. Payments due to us are normally carried forward and offset against future potential surplus payments. PCPs participating in these specialized risk arrangements cover 53% and 31% of our MA and Medicaid membership, respectively, as of December 31, 2018. 
In all instances, we require providers to submit data reporting all direct encounters with members. This data helps us to monitor the amount and levels of medical treatment provided to our members to help improve the quality of care provided and comply with regulatory reporting requirements. Our regulators use the encounter data that we submit, as well as data submitted by other health plans, to set reimbursement rates, assign membership, assess the quality of care being provided to members and evaluate contractual and regulatory compliance.
To help ensure quality of care, we credential and recredential all professional providers with whom we contract, including physicians, psychologists, licensed social workers, certified nurse midwives, advanced registered nurse practitioners and physician assistants who provide care under the supervision of a physician directly or through delegated arrangements. This credentialing and recredentialing is performed in accordance with standards required by CMS and consistent with the standards of the NCQA. We also may delegate utilization and care management services.
Facilities
Our health plans arrange for hospital care primarily through contracts with selected hospitals in their service areas for coverage of medically necessary care. These hospital contracts generally have multi-year terms or annual terms with automatic renewals and provide for payments on a variety of bases, including capitation, per diem rates, case rates and discounted fee-for-service schedules. These contracts typically can be canceled by either party, without cause, usually upon 90 days written notice. In some cases, a longer notice period may be required, such as where a longer period is required by regulation or the applicable government contract.
18

Inpatient services are sometimes reimbursed as a fixed global payment for an admission and certain readmissions based on the associated diagnosis related group, or DRG, as defined by CMS. In many instances, certain services, such as implantable devices or particularly expensive admissions, are reimbursed as a percentage of hospital charges either in addition to, or in lieu of, the DRG payment. Certain facilities in our networks are reimbursed on a negotiated rate paid for each day of the member's admission, known as a per diem. This payment varies based upon the intensity of services provided to the member during admission, such as intensive care, which is reimbursed at a higher rate than general medical services.
Facility outpatient services are reimbursed either as a percentage of charges or based on a fixed-fee schedule for the services rendered, in accordance with ambulatory payment groups or ambulatory payment categories, both as defined by CMS. Outpatient services for diagnostic imaging are reimbursed on a fixed-fee schedule as a percentage of the applicable Medicare or Medicaid fee-for-service schedule or a capitation payment.
Ancillary Providers

Our typical ancillary agreements provide for coverage of medically necessary care and, in general for Medicare, are renewed annually as benefits change. For Medicaid, these contracts automatically renew for successive one-year periods unless otherwise specified in writing by either party. These contracts typically can be canceled by either party, without cause, usually upon 90 days written notice. In some cases, a longer notice period may be required, such as where a longer period is required by regulation or the applicable government contract.
Ancillary providers, who provide services such as laboratory services, home health, physical, speech and occupational therapy, and ambulance and transportation services, are reimbursed on a capitation or fee-for-service basis.
Pharmacies

Pharmacy services are reimbursed based on a fixed fee for dispensing medication and a separate payment for the ingredients. Ingredients produced by multiple manufacturers are reimbursed based on a maximum allowable cost for the ingredient. Ingredients produced by a single manufacturer are reimbursed as a percentage of the average wholesale price. In certain instances, we may contract directly with the sole-source manufacturer of an ingredient to receive a rebate, which may vary based upon volumes dispensed during the year. Excluding our Meridian health plans, we outsource pharmacy rebate management services to a third party, including rebates processing, claims processing, pre-authorization, utilization management and other related services.
Out-of-Network Providers

 When our traditional HMO members receive services for which we are responsible from a provider outside our network, such as in the case of emergency room services from non-contracted hospitals, we generally attempt to negotiate a rate with that provider. In most cases, when a member is treated by a non-contracted provider, we are typically obligated to pay only the amount that the provider would have received from traditional Medicaid or Medicare.
Member Recruitment

 Our member recruitment and marketing efforts for both Medicaid and Medicare members are heavily regulated by state agencies and CMS. For many products, we rely on the auto-assignment of members into our plans, including our PDP plan. The auto-assignment of a beneficiary into a health or prescription drug plan generally occurs when that beneficiary does not choose a plan. The agency with responsibility for the program determines the approach by which a beneficiary becomes a member of a plan serving the program. Some programs assign members to a plan automatically based on predetermined criteria. These criteria frequently include a plan's rates, the outcome of a bidding process, quality scores or similar factors. For example, CMS auto-assigns PDP members based on whether a plan's rate bids during the annual renewal process are above or below the CMS benchmark for that region. In most states, our Medicaid health plans benefit from auto-assignment of individuals who do not choose a plan, but for whom participation in managed care programs is mandatory. Each state differs in its approach to auto-assignment, but one or more of the following criteria is typical in auto-assignment algorithms: a Medicaid beneficiary's previous enrollment with a health plan or experience with a particular provider contracted with a health plan, enrolling family members in the same plan, a plan's quality or performance status, a plan's network and enrollment size, awarding all auto-assignments to a plan with the lowest bid in a county or region, and equal assignment of individuals who do not choose a plan in a specified county or region.

19

 Our Medicaid marketing efforts are regulated by the states in which we operate, each of which imposes different requirements for, or restrictions on, Medicaid sales and marketing. These requirements and restrictions can be revised from time to time. Several states, including our two largest Medicaid states, Florida and Kentucky, do not permit direct sales by Medicaid health plans. We rely on member selection and auto-assignment of Medicaid members into our plans in those states.

 Our Medicare marketing and sales activities are regulated by CMS and the states in which we operate. CMS has oversight over all marketing materials used by MA plans, and in some cases has imposed advance approval requirements. Also, our sales activities are limited to those such as conveying information regarding benefits, describing the operations of our managed care plans and providing information about eligibility requirements.

 We employ our own insurance agents and contract with independent, licensed insurance agents to market our MA and PDP products. We have continued to expand our use of independent agents whose cost is largely variable in nature and whose engagement is more conducive to the shortened Medicare selling season and the open enrollment period. The activities of our independently licensed insurance agents are also regulated by CMS. We also use direct mail, mass media and the Internet to market our products.
A significant portion of our PDP membership is obtained from the auto-assignment of beneficiaries, which is dependent on the outcome of a bid process whereby plans submit bids to CMS based on their estimated cost to provide services in designated regions. Plans that submit bids below the benchmark of other plans’ bids in their bidding region are eligible for auto-assignment of LIS beneficiaries. 
Quality Improvement

 We are focused on improving quality across all of our lines of business, which is critical to the continued growth and success of our business. We continually seek to measure and improve the quality of care delivered by our network providers to our members. Our quality improvement program provides the basis for our clinical programs, which include our quality care management and utilization management functions. It outlines ongoing processes designed to improve the delivery of quality, health care services to our members, as well as to enhance compliance with regulatory and accreditation standards. This program consists of a multi-year improvement plan with a more rigorous quality governance structure focused on driving better quality results. 
Our quality improvement activities will continue to focus on: 

• | Access;


• | Preventive health and wellness;


• | Care management and population health programs;


• | Health plan accreditation;


• | Provider credentialing;


• | Provider education and incentives for closing care gaps;


• | Member education and outreach;


• | Information technology initiatives related to the above activities;


• | Community Connections; and


• | Oversight and audits.

Access
We are focused on improving access for our members to a high-performing network, including PCPs, specialists and ancillary providers, and ensuring that members see the appropriate providers, based on clinical condition. We help members access the right care at the right time in the appropriate setting through coordinated care teams and community partnerships. We recently added additional clinical resources in our markets to implement new care models.
Preventive health and wellness
We sponsor a number of initiatives aimed at the promotion of healthy lifestyles and the prevention of disease. These include programs focusing on preventive screenings, health education programs to inform members about health care issues and healthy behaviors, health assessment and counseling to inform members how to use the resources and services available to them to help reduce preventable diseases.
20

Care management and population health programs
We have enhanced our care management model to more effectively serve our most medically complex members. The model leverages both field-based and telephonic resources using state-specific, multi-disciplinary care teams. Our complex care management helps reduce the fragmentation that exists in the current health care system, improving member access to quality care. We also employ interventions that target specific populations, conditions and those that target specific quality outcomes through established best practices. For example, a prenatal care management program to help women with high-risk pregnancies; a program to reduce the number of inappropriate opioid use; and care management programs to decrease the need for emergency room visits and hospitalizations.
Health plan accreditation
Where required, our health plans are either accredited or actively seeking accreditation by the National Committee for Quality Assurance ("NCQA").  NCQA Accreditation is the most comprehensive evaluation in the industry, and the only assessment that includes results of clinical performance (i.e., HEDIS measures) and consumer experience (i.e., Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Provider and Systems measures).

Provider credentialing
We credential physicians, hospitals and other health care professionals in our participating provider networks using quality criteria, which meet or exceed the standards of external accreditation or state regulatory agencies, or both. Typically, most health care professionals are re-credentialed every three years, depending on applicable state laws.
Provider education and incentives for closing care gaps
We expanded our Quality Practice Advisory program, which pairs a WellCare licensed clinician (e.g. nurse or social worker) with a provider to assist our providers in identifying and closing gaps in member care. We believe that this program has been effective in closing care gaps and improving our quality scores in future years. As part of our quality improvement program, we implemented changes to our reimbursement methods to reward providers who encourage preventive care, such as well-child check-ups, prenatal care and/or who adopts evidence based guidelines for members with chronic conditions. Additionally, all of our markets offer provider incentives for closing care gaps inherent to the health care system. This initiative has resulted in increased member encounters to drive improvement in the quality of care. 
Member education and outreach
We are focused on improving access for our members to a high-performing network, including PCPs, specialists and ancillary providers. This will ensure that members see the appropriate providers, based on clinical condition. We have strengthened our resources focused exclusively on outreach to Medicaid and Medicare members to educate them on care gaps and assist with care gap closure. Intervention and support activities include arranging transportation assistance, three-way calls with a member and his/her primary care physician to schedule appointments, and arranging for home visits to assess and close care gaps. In addition, our medication therapy management initiatives empower patients to take an active role in managing their medications. We are focused on enhancing our members' experience by improving service and reducing complaint levels through improved grievance and appeals processes which we believe will result in improved member satisfaction survey results. Additionally, we use a variety of multimodal techniques to reach members in the manner of their choosing and to minimize cost and maximize effectiveness.  Using culturally and linguistically relevant messages, these modes include mailings, live and automated calls, texts, web portals and mobile applications.  This outreach is coordinated through sophisticated systems that allow for campaign management and a single, 360 degree view of every member.
Information technology initiatives
We understand the importance of information technology in improving the level of service that we can provide to our members. Accordingly, we continue to invest in our information technology infrastructure and capabilities including tools that support our focus on improving our ability to ensure our members receive quality health care. We have specialized systems to support our quality improvement activities and to gather information from our systems to identify opportunities to improve care and track the outcomes of the services provided to achieve those improvements, such as evaluating the effects of particular preventive measures and improving member experience by addressing member specific needs.
21

Community Connections
WellCare connects community resources to help improve health outcomes and lower the overall cost of health care. We work to link people to social services such as food banks or meal delivery, housing assistance, financial assistance, transportation, education support, legal assistance and employment services.
Oversight and audits

Internally, our quality improvement programs benefit from executive oversight and project management processes. Each of our health plans has a Quality Improvement Committee comprised of senior members of management, medical directors and other key associates. Each of these committees reports directly to the applicable health plan board of directors, which has ultimate oversight responsibility for the quality of care rendered to our members. The Quality Improvement Committees also have a number of subcommittees that are charged with monitoring certain aspects of care and service, such as health care utilization, pharmacy services and provider credentialing and re-credentialing. Several of these subcommittees include physicians as committee members.
Our board of directors recognizes the importance of delivering quality care and providing access to that care for our members and has established the Health Care Quality and Access Committee of the board. The primary purpose of this committee is to assist the board by reviewing, and providing general oversight of, our health care quality and access strategy, including our policies and procedures governing health care quality and access for our members. This input helps provide overall direction and guidance to our Quality Improvement Committees.
We conduct routine site audits of select providers and medical record audits to ensure the effectiveness of our quality improvement programs. 
Information Technology
The accurate and timely capture, processing and analysis of critical data is required to provide managed care services and operate our business in a cost effective manner. Data processing and data-driven decision making are key components of both administrative efficiency and medical cost management. We use our information systems for premium billing, claims processing, utilization management, reporting, medical cost trending, planning and analysis. The systems also support member and provider service functions, including enrollment, member eligibility verification, primary care and specialist physician roster access, claims status inquiries, and referrals and authorizations.
On an ongoing basis, we evaluate the ability of our existing operations to support our current and future business needs and to maintain our compliance requirements. As a result, we periodically consolidate, integrate, upgrade and expand our information systems capabilities as a result of technology initiatives, industry trends and recently enacted regulations, changes in our system platforms and integration of new business acquisitions. Our information systems require an ongoing commitment of significant resources to maintain, protect and enhance existing systems and develop new systems to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology, evolving systems, external threats and regulatory standards and changing customer preferences.
Secure maintenance of personal information and information technology systems is critical to our business operations. As a result, cybersecurity, physical security and the continued development and enhancement of our controls, processes and practices designed to protect our facilities, information systems and data from attack, damage or unauthorized access remain a priority for us. To ensure information security, we have implemented multiple layers of controls to protect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of this data and the systems that store and transmit such data. We utilize current security technologies, and our defenses are monitored and routinely tested internally and by external parties. 
We have a disaster recovery plan that addresses how we recover business functionality within stated timelines. We have an agreement with a nationally-recognized, third-party vendor to provide for the restoration of our general support systems at a remote processing center. We perform disaster recovery testing at least annually for those business applications that we consider critical. 
22

Our board of directors believes that information security is a critical component of the enterprise-wide risk management program. Our information security risk management practices are a core component of our enterprise-wide risk management program. The board’s information security oversight responsibilities include providing oversight of information security strategies and risk management; and assuring financial and other resources, including insurance related to information security events, are in place to support risk management. The board’s information security oversight includes regular reporting from members of senior management who are responsible for information security risk management practices. Reports cover areas such as process improvements, relevant risks and strategic initiatives. Pursuant to its charter, the Audit, Finance and Regulatory Compliance Committee (the "AFRC Committee") of the board assists the board in the oversight of the enterprise risk management function, including information security.
Additionally, the Information Technology Oversight Committee of the board assists with oversight of major information technology initiatives and programs, consults with senior management regarding information strategy, assists the board in its oversight of information technology security programs and assists the AFRC Committee in its oversight of information technology internal controls and disaster recovery capabilities and strategies. 
Outsourcing Arrangements

We determined, based on an evaluation of factors including cost, compliance, quality and procurement success, that it is more efficient to use third parties instead of our personnel for certain functions. As a result, we contract with a number of vendors to provide significant operational support including, but not limited to, pharmacy benefit management for certain of our members as well as certain enrollment, billing, call center, benefit administration, claims processing, mail order pharmacy, reinsurance, sales and marketing and certain aspects of utilization management. Where a vendor provides services that we are required to provide under a contract with a government customer, we are responsible for such performance and will be held accountable by our government customers for any failure of performance by our vendors. We evaluate the competency and solvency of our third-party vendors prior to execution of contracts and endeavor to include service level guarantees and information security safeguards in our contracts, where appropriate. When we need to share PHI with a vendor, we ensure that a compliant HIPAA Business Associate Agreement is put in place. Additionally, we perform ongoing vendor oversight activities to identify any performance or other issues related to our vendors.
We maintain insurance that includes coverage for certain costs related to information security events.
Centralized Management Services
We provide centralized management services to each of our health plans from our Tampa, Florida headquarters and call centers. These services are provided by an affiliated administrator and include, among others, information technology, product development and administration, finance, human resources, accounting, legal, public relations, marketing, insurance, purchasing, risk management, internal audit, actuarial, underwriting, claims processing, customer service and certain aspects of clinical service. 
Employees
As of December 31, 2018, we had approximately 12,000 full-time employees. Our employees are not represented by any collective bargaining agreement, and we have never experienced a work stoppage. 
OUR COMPETITION    
Competitive Environment
We operate in a highly competitive environment to obtain government health care program beneficiaries and manage the cost and quality of services that are delivered to these beneficiaries. We currently compete in this environment by offering Medicare and Medicaid health plans in which we accept all or nearly all of the financial risk for management of beneficiary care under these programs.
New entrants into the marketplace have contributed to the competitive environment. In addition, the increased use of technology to interact with members, providers and customers, increase the risks we currently face from new entrants and disruptive actions by existing competitors compared with prior periods. 
23

We typically must be awarded a contract by the government agency with responsibility for a program in order to offer our services in a particular location. Some government programs choose to limit the number of plans that may offer services to beneficiaries, while other agencies allow an unlimited number of plans to serve a program, subject to each plan meeting certain contract requirements. When the number of plans participating in a program is limited, an agency generally employs a bidding process to select the participating plans.
As a result, the number of companies with which we compete varies significantly depending on the geographic market, business segment and line of business. 
We believe that the significant factors that distinguish competing health plans include the perceived overall quality (including accreditation status), level of service, comprehensiveness of coverage, cost (including premium rates, provider arrangements and member out-of-pocket costs), financial stability and ratings, breadth and quality of provider networks, and quality of member support and care management programs. We believe that we are competitive on each of these factors. Some of our competitors may be more established with larger market share, greater financial resources or better quality scores than we have in some markets. Our ability to increase the number of persons covered by our plans or to increase our revenues is affected by our ability to differentiate ourselves from our competitors on these factors. Competition may also affect the availability of services from health care providers, including primary care physicians, specialists and hospitals.
Competitive Factors—Program Participation
Regardless of whether the number of health plans serving a program is limited, we believe government agencies determine program participation based on several criteria. We compete for government program participation, renewals of those government contracts and members who have the ability to change health plans on the basis of the terms set in the bids as well as the breadth and depth of a plan's provider network; quality and utilization management processes; responsiveness to member complaints and grievances; timeliness and accuracy of claims payment; financial resources; historical contractual and regulatory compliance; quality scores, references and accreditation; and other factors. If not auto-assigned, potential members typically choose a health plan based on a specific provider being a part of the network, the quality of care and services available, accessibility of services, and reputation or name recognition of the health plan. As discussed in Our Operations-Member Recruitment above, a significant portion of our PDP membership is obtained from the auto-assignment of beneficiaries, which is dependent on the outcome of a bid process.
If we fail to compete effectively to maintain or increase our program participation, including by maintaining or increasing enrollments in existing government programs, our results of operations, financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.
Competitive Factors—Network Providers
We compete with other health plans to contract with hospitals, physicians, pharmacies and other providers for inclusion in our networks that serve government program beneficiaries. We believe providers select plans in which they participate based on several criteria. These criteria generally include reimbursement rates, timeliness and accuracy of claims payment, potential to deliver new patient volume and/or retain existing patients, effectiveness of resolution of calls and complaints, and other factors.
Medicaid Competitors
In the Medicaid managed care market, our principal competitors for state contracts, members and providers include the following types of organizations:

• | MCOs—Managed care organizations ("MCOs") that, like us, receive state funding to provide Medicaid benefits to members. Many of these competitors operate in a single or small number of geographic locations. There are a few multi-state Medicaid organizations that are able to leverage their infrastructure over a larger membership base. Competitors include private and public companies, which can be either for-profit or non-profit organizations, with varying degrees of focus on serving Medicaid populations.


• | Medicaid Fee-For-Service—Traditional Medicaid offered directly by the states or a modified version whereby the state administers a primary care case management model.


• | PSNs—A Provider Service Network ("PSN") is a network of providers that is established and operated by a health care provider or group of affiliated health care providers. A PSN operates as either a fee-for-service ("FFS") health plan or

24

as a prepaid health plan that, like us, receives a capitated premium to provide Medicaid benefits to members. A PSN that operates as a FFS health plan is not at risk for medical benefit costs. 
Medicare Competitors
In the Medicare market, which includes Medicare Advantage and Prescription Drug Plans, our primary competitors for contracts, members and providers include the following types of competitors:

• | Original Fee-For-Service Medicare—Original Medicare is available nationally and is a fee-for-service plan managed by the federal government. Beneficiaries enrolled in Original Medicare can go to any doctor, supplier, hospital or other facility that accepts Medicare and is accepting new Medicare patients.


• | Medicare Advantage and Prescription Drug Plans—MA and stand-alone Part D plans are offered by national, regional and local MCOs and insurance companies that serve Medicare beneficiaries. In addition, prescription drug plans are being offered by or co-branded with retail drug store chains or other retail store chains, which may be able to offer lower priced plans and achieve benefits from integration with their pharmacy benefit management operations.


• | Employer-Sponsored Coverage—Employers and unions may subsidize Medicare benefits for their retirees in their commercial group. The group sponsor solicits proposals from MA plans and may select an HMO, preferred provider organization ("PPO") and/or PDP to provide these benefits.


• | Accountable Care Organizations - Accountable Care Organizations are groups of doctors, hospitals, and other health care providers who come together voluntarily to provide coordinated high quality care to their patients. The goal of coordinated care is to ensure that patients, especially the chronically ill, get the right care at the right time, while avoiding unnecessary duplication of services and preventing medical errors.

REGULATION AFFECTING OUR BUSINESS    
Our health care operations are highly regulated by both state and federal government agencies. Regulation of managed care products and health care services is an ever-evolving area of law that varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Regulatory agencies generally have discretion to issue regulations and interpret and enforce laws and rules. Changes in applicable laws, statutes, regulations and interpretive guidance occur frequently. These changes may include a requirement to provide health care services not contemplated in our current contracted premium rate or to pay providers at a state-mandated fee schedule without a commensurate adjustment to the premium rate. For further information, see the discussion above under Our Operations- Provider Networks and Provider Reimbursement Methods. In addition, government agencies may impose taxes, fees or other assessments upon us and other managed care companies at any time.
Our contracts with various state government agencies and CMS to provide managed health care services include provisions regarding provider network adequacy, maintenance of quality measures, accurate submission of encounter and health care cost information, maintaining standards of call center performance, prompt payment of claims, accuracy of provider directories and other requirements specific to government and program regulations. We must also have adequate financial resources to protect the state, our providers and our members against the risk of our insolvency. Our failure to comply with these requirements may result in the assessment of penalties, fines and liquidated damages. For further information on data provided to CMS that is subject to audit, refer to the discussion above under Product Segments-Medicare Health Plans.
Our Medicaid plans are subject to periodic financial and informational reporting and comprehensive quality assurance evaluations. We regularly submit periodic financial, encounters, utilization and operations reports and other information to the appropriate Medicaid program regulatory agencies. 
Our MA and PDP plans perform ongoing monitoring of our compliance with the CMS requirements, including functions performed by vendors. From time to time, CMS conducts examinations of our compliance with the provisions of our MA and PDP contracts.
Government enforcement authorities have become increasingly active in recent years in their review and scrutiny of various sectors of the health care industry, including health insurers and managed care organizations. We routinely respond to subpoenas and requests for information from these entities and, more generally, we endeavor to cooperate fully with all government agencies that regulate our business.
25

Licensing and Solvency Regulation
Our operations are conducted primarily through HMO and insurance subsidiaries. These subsidiaries are licensed by the insurance departments in the states in which they operate, except our New York HMO subsidiary, which is licensed as a prepaid health services plan by the New York State Department of Health, and our California HMO, which is licensed by the California Department of Managed Health Care. The subsidiaries are subject to the rules, regulations and oversight of the applicable state agencies in the areas of licensing and solvency. State insurance laws and regulations prescribe accounting practices for determining statutory net income, capital and surplus. Each of our regulated subsidiaries is required to report regularly on its operational and financial performance to the appropriate regulatory agency in the state in which it is licensed. These reports describe each of our regulated subsidiaries' capital structure, ownership, financial condition, certain intercompany transactions and business operations. From time to time, any of our regulated subsidiaries may be selected to undergo periodic audits, examinations or reviews by the applicable state agency of our operational and financial assertions.
Our regulated subsidiaries generally must obtain approval from, or provide notice to, the state in which it is domiciled before entering into certain transactions such as declaring dividends in excess of certain thresholds, entering into other arrangements with related parties, acquisitions or similar transactions involving an HMO or insurance company, or any change in control. For purposes of these laws, in general, control commonly is presumed to exist over an entity when a person, group of persons or entity, directly or indirectly, owns, controls or holds the power to vote 10% or more of the voting securities of that entity.
Each of our HMO and insurance subsidiaries must maintain a minimum amount of statutory capital determined by statute or regulation. For additional information on regulatory requirements, see Item 7 – Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Regulatory Capital and Dividend Restrictions and Note 16 – Regulatory Capital and Dividend Restrictions to the consolidated financial statements.
HIPAA, HITECH, State Privacy Laws and Breach Notification Laws
The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 ("HIPAA") and the regulations adopted under HIPAA are intended to improve the portability and continuity of health insurance coverage and simplify the administration of health insurance claims and related transactions. 
The Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009 (the "HITECH Act") modified certain provisions of HIPAA by, among other things, extending the privacy and security provisions to business associates, mandating new regulations around electronic health records, expanding enforcement mechanisms, and increasing penalties for violations. 
On January 25, 2013, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services ("HHS"), as required by the HITECH Act, issued the Final Omnibus Rules that provide final modifications to HIPAA rules to implement the HITECH Act.
The HITECH Act also contains a number of provisions that provide incentives for states to initiate certain programs related to health care and health care technology, such as electronic health records. While provisions such as these do not apply to us directly, states wishing to apply for grants under the HITECH Act, or otherwise participating in such programs, may impose new health care technology requirements on us through our contracts with state Medicaid agencies.
All health plans, including ours, are considered covered entities subject to HIPAA. HIPAA generally requires health plans, as well as their providers and vendors, to:

• | protect patient privacy and safeguard individually identifiable health information; and 


• | establish the capability to receive and transmit electronically certain administrative health care transactions, such as claims payments, in a standardized format.

Specifically, the HIPAA Privacy Rule regulates use and disclosure of individually identifiable health information, known as “protected health information” ("PHI"). The HIPAA Security Rule requires covered entities to implement administrative, physical and technical safeguards to protect the security of electronic PHI. Certain provisions of the security and privacy regulations apply to business associates (entities that handle PHI on behalf of covered entities), and business associates are subject to direct liability for violation of these provisions. Furthermore, a covered entity may be subject to penalties as a result of a business associate violating HIPAA, if the business associate is found to be an agent of the covered entity.
26

Covered entities must report breaches of unsecured PHI to affected individuals without unreasonable delay, but not to exceed 60 days of discovery of the breach by a covered entity or its agents. Notification must also be made to HHS and, in certain situations involving large breaches, to the media. HHS is required to publish on its website a list of all covered entities that report a breach involving more than 500 individuals. All non-permitted uses or disclosures of unsecured PHI are presumed to be breaches unless the covered entity or business associate establishes that there is a low probability the information has been compromised. Various state laws and regulations may also require us to notify affected individuals in the event of a data breach involving individually identifiable information.
HIPAA violations by covered entities may result in civil and criminal penalties. Covered entities could face civil monetary penalties up to an annual maximum of $1.5 million for uncorrected violations based on willful neglect. HHS enforces the regulations and performs audits to confirm compliance. Investigations of violations that indicate willful neglect, for which penalties are mandatory, are statutorily required. HHS may also resolve HIPAA violations through informal means, such as allowing a covered entity to implement a corrective action plan, but HHS has the discretion to move directly to impose monetary penalties and is required to impose penalties for violations resulting from willful neglect. In addition, state attorneys general are authorized to bring civil actions seeking either injunctions or damages in response to violations of HIPAA privacy and security regulations that threaten the privacy of state residents.
We enforce a HIPAA compliance plan, which we believe complies with the HIPAA privacy and security regulations. We have dedicated resources to monitor compliance with our HIPAA compliance program. 
We, our providers, and certain of our vendors are also subject to numerous other privacy and security laws and regulations at the federal and state levels. We remain subject to any federal or state privacy-related laws that are more restrictive than the privacy regulations issued under HIPAA. These laws vary and violations may result in additional penalties. 
Fraud and Abuse Laws
Federal and state enforcement authorities have prioritized the investigation and prosecution of health care fraud, waste and abuse. Fraud, waste and abuse prohibitions encompass a wide range of operating activities, including kickbacks or other inducements for referral of members or for the coverage of products (such as prescription drugs) by a plan, billing for unnecessary medical services by a provider, improper marketing and violation of patient privacy rights. Companies involved in public health care programs such as Medicaid and Medicare are required to maintain compliance programs to detect and deter fraud, waste and abuse, and are often the subject of fraud, waste and abuse investigations and audits. The regulations and contractual requirements applicable to participants in these public-sector programs are complex and subject to change. Although we have structured our compliance program with care in an effort to meet all statutory and regulatory requirements, our policies and procedures are continuously under review and subject to updates and our training and education programs are always evolving. We have invested significant resources to enhance our compliance efforts and we expect to continue to do so.
Federal and state laws and regulations governing submission of information and claims to agencies
We are subject to federal and state laws and regulations that apply to the submission of information and claims to various agencies. For example, the federal False Claims Act provides, in part, that the federal government may bring a lawsuit against any person or entity who it believes has knowingly presented, or caused to be presented, a false or fraudulent request for payment from the federal government, or who has made a false statement or used a false record to get a claim approved. The federal government has taken the position that claims presented in violation of the federal anti-kickback statute may be considered a violation of the federal False Claims Act. Violations of the False Claims Act are punishable by treble damages and penalties of up to a specified dollar amount per false claim. In addition, a special provision under the False Claims Act allows a private person (for example, a "whistleblower" such as a disgruntled former associate, competitor or member) to bring an action under the False Claims Act on behalf of the government alleging that an entity has defrauded the federal government and permits the private person to share in any settlement of, or judgment entered in, the lawsuit. A number of states, including states in which we operate, have adopted false claims acts that are similar to the federal False Claims Act.
