Background
 
Hemp Naturals, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“the Company”) was incorporated on November 13, 2015 under the laws of the state of Delaware. We have performed limited business operations and have generated no revenue to date.
Our Business
 
Hemp Naturals, Inc. is an early stage company that plans to research, develop, acquire and sell products made of industrial hemp. While the company will have a wide range of products and supplementary goods to go with our primary line up, the focus will be, at least initially, upon rolling papers made out of industrial hemp. Currently our rolling papers are available to purchase in twenty-five retail establishments comprised of gas stations, convenience stores, tobacco shops and liquor stores. At the date of this filing, all transactions have been at a promotional rate with no revenues realized by the Company. The Company’s purchases of rolling papers were recorded as advertising and promotion expense. Our expectation is that the promotional phase of rolling paper sales will transition to profitable operations during the next fiscal year. In the future, additional products may include, but not be limited to, hemp clothing, nutritional hemp health supplements, hemp shakes and/or foods, and beauty supply products with hemp as the key ingredient.
 
One of the keys to the success of our future business will be establishing positive and long lasting relationships with companies which manufacture products made out of industrial hemp. If we can acquire these products wholesale and at low prices, we will be able to subsequently resell them under the Hemp Naturals name to the general population at a significant profit. Currently, the Company is collaborating with one rolling papers wholesaler to develop a new design for and produce our product. We expect the newly designed product to be available to sell in the next fiscal year.
 
The growing demand and need for hemp products gives us an ideal environment in which to enter the already competitive hemp industry. As the demand grows, and indeed as it has continued to grow steadily over the past several years, so too does the need for high quality goods. Through an aggressive marketing plan which will primarily utilize social media, but may also rely on print media, radio spots, and other as of yet unnamed methods, we aim to become the first retailer that enters an individual’s mind when they think of hemp goods. We have set up our company website, Hempofnaturals.com, and are currently working on setting up an additional website, RollingNaturals.com, to sell our product directly to consumers online.

There has been some controversy surrounding industrial hemp, due to the fact that it comes from the same plant as marijuana. Due to these concerns, and the illegal nature of the sale of marijuana in the majority of states within the United States, Hemp Naturals, Inc. plans to follow all federal regulations and statutes pertinent to the sale of hemp-based goods. Hemp Naturals does not intend to import or export any products containing THC. The U.S. Customs Service has a “zero tolerance standard” for the importation of industrial hemp, meaning that a product cannot have any potentially dangerous substances contained in it or it will be considered adulterated and unfit for human consumption, and thus illegal to possess or use per U.S. Federal Law. In 2001 the DEA elaborated on this and clarified that any product with any quantity of THC in it at all cannot be imported into the United States. Since no hemp based products containing THC are legally permitted in the United States these products are not allowed to be exported out of the United States either. Because of the strict laws that exist with the U.S. importation and exportation of industrial hemp products, our business could be adversely affected and even if our products contain no THC there exists the possibility that any hemp-based products could be deemed illegal if a change in law were to occur. There are no foreign countries, to our knowledge, that have laws which could negatively affect the importation or exportation of our hemp based products since they will not contain any THC.
 
Business Progress
 
To date, our operations have consisted of developing our website and producing and distributing hemp-based rolling papers as promotion for the Company with the expectation of profitable operations in the next fiscal year.
 
We have two part time employees, Levi Jacobson our Chief Executive Officer and Maryna Bleier our Secretary. Currently, both Mr. Jacobson and Ms. Bleier have the flexibility to work on our business up to 25 to 30 hours per week, but are prepared to devote more time if necessary. We do not presently have pension, health, annuity, insurance, stock options, profit sharing, or similar benefit plans; however, we may adopt plans in the future. There are presently no personal benefits available to our officer and director. During the initial implementation of our business plan, we intend to hire independent consultants to assist in the development and execution of our business operations.
 
Competition
 
The industry in which Hemp Naturals, Inc. competes is highly competitive. Many Companies offer hemp-based goods such as clothes, cosmetics, and foods and at competitive prices. As we are small and have very limited resources we may not be able to compete with our larger, better financed competitors. We may also not be able to offer our goods at as low of prices as our competitors, making it difficult to make sales and increase brand awareness. We will also be in competition with non-hemp-based products.
