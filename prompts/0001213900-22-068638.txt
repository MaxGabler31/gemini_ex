ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview



We are a business consulting company providing financial consulting services to small and medium-sized enterprises (“SMEs”) and prior to August 1, 2022, we manage a private equity fund with approximately $1.3 million assets under management (“AUM”). Since our inception in 2015, the main focus of our consulting business has been providing comprehensive going public consulting services designed to help SMEs become public companies on suitable markets and exchanges. Our goal is to become an international financial consulting company with clients and offices throughout Asia and North America. On January 4, 2021, we established an office in California, USA, through our wholly owned subsidiary ATIF Inc., a California corporation, which was incorporated on October 26, 2020, and launched, in addition to our business consulting services, additional service models consisting of asset management, investment holding and media services to expand our business with a flexible business concept to achieve a goal of high growth revenue and strong profit growth.



We have to date primarily focused on helping clients going public on the OTC markets and exchanges in the U.S., but we are in the process of expanding our service to listing clients on domestic exchanges in China as well as the Hong Kong Stock Exchange.



Recent Developments



On February 3, 2021, we terminated our VIE agreements with Qianhai and upon termination, Qianhai transferred all of its business and employees to Huaya. In addition, on January 29, 2021, we sold our 51.2% equity interest in LGC. As a result of termination of relationship with shareholders of Qianhai and sale of all our equity interests in LGC, since February 3, 2021, we have no VIE structure in connection with our operations.



On February 16, 2021, we established ATIF-1, LP (“ATIF LP”) as a private equity fund through our indirectly-wholly owned subsidiary, ATIF-1 GP, LLC (“ATIF GP”), a Delaware limited liability company, as the general partner. As of July 31, 2022, we own a 76.6% interest in ATIF LP as a limited partner. As of July 31, 2022, ATIF LP manages, approximately $1.3 million assets under management (“AUM”). The investment strategy of the fund involves directional long and short investments in equity securities, primarily issued by U.S. large capitalization companies, and American Depositary Receipts (“ADRs”) related to Chinese companies of various sizes, including private companies. The investment manager for the fund is ATIF Inc. Due to significant volatility in stock market, the private equity fund lost $1.5 million in fiscal year 2022 as compared to gain $0.2 million in fiscal year 2021. On August 1, 2022, ATIF USA entered into and closed a Sale and Purchase Agreement with Asia Time (HK) International Finance Service Limited (the “Buyer”) pursuant to which ATIF US sold all of its membership interests in ATIF GP (the “Agreement”) to the Buyer for cash consideration of US$50,000. Upon the closing of the Agreement on August 1, 2022, ATIF GP is no longer our subsidiary and ATIF USA ceased to be the investment manager of ATIF LP.



On August 23, 2021, we completed a five (5) for one (1) reverse stock split (the “Reverse Split”) of our issued and outstanding ordinary shares, par value $0.001 per share.



On December 22, 2021, we established ATIF BD LLC, a California limited liability company (“ATIF BD”) and our wholly-owned subsidiary, engaged in consultancy and information technology support services.



On April 25, 2022, we established ATIF Investment Limited, a British Virgin Islands company (“ATIF Investment”) and our wholly-owned subsidiary, engaged in consultancy and information technology support services.



On May 31, 2022, we completed the transfer of our equity interest in ATIF HK and Huaya to Mr. Pishan Chi, our former director and CEO, for $nil consideration. The transfer of equity interest was to mitigate the potential risks arising from the PRC government provision of new guidance to and restrictions on China-based companies raising capital offshore. We determined that the transfer of our equity interest in ATIF HK and Huaya did not have a major effect on its operations and financial results as we did not change our way of running business. We also determined that the transfer of equity interest does not represent a strategic shift in our business because there was no change to our operation of our consulting services. There was no change to the nature of our business, and did not affect our customers in North America, which is the major geographic market area of our business.

On October 3, 2022, we established ATIF Southern US, LLC (“ATIF Southern”), a California LLC, of which we own 60% of its membership interest, and is engaged in equity investment business in Texas.



On October 6, 2022, we established ATIF Business Consulting LLC, a California LLC (“ATIF Consulting”) and our wholly-owned subsidiary, engaged in IPO consulting services in North America.



On October 7, 2022, we established ATIF Business Management LLC, a California LLC (“ATIF Management”) and our wholly-owned subsidiary, engaged in comprehensive services such as IR, legal services and secretarial services in North America in future.



Competitive Strengths



We believe that the following strengths enable us to capture opportunities in the financial service industry in China and differentiate us from our competitors:



Experienced and Highly Qualified Team



We have a highly qualified professional service team with extensive experience in going public consulting services. Our professional team members have an average of five years of experience in their respective fields of international finance and capital market, cross-border and domestic listing services, and marketing. The majority of the members of our team previously worked in the technology or finance industries. We highly value members of our qualified professional team and are on the constant lookout for new talents to join our team.
Recognition and Reputation Achieved from Our Previous Success



Since our inception in 2015, we have successfully helped eight clients to be quoted on the U.S. OTC markets and one client listed on the U.S Nasdaq market, respectively. Our proven track records and professionalism have won us recognition and reputation within the consulting service industry in China. We believe we are one of the few going public consulting service providers that possess the necessary resources and expertise to provide comprehensive personalized one-stop going public consulting services to clients.

  
Long-Term Cooperation Relationship with Third-Party Professional Providers



We have established long-term professional relationships with a group of well-known third-party professional providers both domestically and in the U.S., such as investment banks, certified public accounting firms, law firms, and investor relations agencies, whose services and support are necessary for us to provide high-quality one-stop going public consulting service to our clients. It took us years of hard work to demonstrate to these professional organizations that we are a worthy partner capable of providing high-quality professional services that conforms to their high standards. As a result, our clients are able to gain direct access to and obtain high-quality professional services from our third-party professional providers.



Long-Term Cooperation Relationships with Local Chamber of Commerce and Associations



We believe our recent success was at least partially attributable to our long-term cooperation relationships with local chambers of commerce and associations. There are no contractual relationships between us and these organizations. We were able to gain access to many prospective clients through events organized by these organizations. Our cooperation relationships with these local organizations help us to: (1) understand the evolving needs of our potential clients; (2) recognize the trends of the local business community we strive to serve; and (3) provide timely feedbacks to our potential clients and maintain open communication channels with local business communities.

DESCRIPTION OF OUR BUSINESS



Our Business



We are a British Virgin Islands business company. We are a business consulting company providing financial consulting services to small and medium-sized enterprises (“SMEs”). Since our inception in 2015, the focus of our consulting business has been providing comprehensive going public consulting services designed to help SMEs become public companies on suitable markets and exchanges. Our goal is to become an international financial consulting company with clients and offices throughout Asia and North America. On January 4, 2021, we established an office in California, USA, through our wholly owned subsidiary ATIF Inc., a California corporation, which was incorporated on October 26, 2020, and launched, in addition to our business consulting services, additional service models consisting of asset management, investment holding and media services to expand our business with a flexible business concept to achieve a goal of high growth revenue and strong profit growth. Clients located within United States will be serviced by ATIF Inc., while clients outside United States will be supported by ATIF Inc.’s business strategic cooperative partner Huaya.



Since our inception, our revenue has been mainly generated from our going public consulting services. In April 2020, we acquired a 51.2% equity interest in Leaping Group Co., Ltd. (“LGC”) and our revenue was mainly comprised of going public consulting services and event execution and planning services for the year ended July 31, 2020. On January 29, 2021, we completed a disposition of 51.2% of the equity interest of LGC with three individuals. For the years ended July 31, 2021 and 2020, we reported net loss of $6.6 million and $11.0 million from discontinued operations of LGC as a separate component in the consolidated statements of operations.



Beginning in August 2018, to complement and facilitate the growth of our going public consulting service, we launched AT Consulting Center to offer financial consulting programs in Shenzhen, and in September 2018, we acquired CNNM, or www.chinacnnm.com, a news and media website focused on distributing financial news and information. In July 2019, we launched an investment and financing analysis reporting business. We have not generated any revenue from this financial and news platform since its acquisition, and based on our current financial condition and operating performance, our management has assessed that the likelihood of future use of the financial and news platform is remote, and we provided full impairment on the financial and news platform in the year ended July 31, 2020.



In China, a fast-growing economy and a positive market environment have created many entrepreneurial and high-growth enterprises, many of which need assistance in obtaining development funds through financing. Due to restrictions imposed by China’s foreign exchange regulations, it is difficult for foreign capital to enter China’s capital market. Because of the strict listing policies and a relatively closed financial environment in mainland China, most small to medium sized enterprises in the development stage are unable to list on domestic exchanges in China. Therefore, many Chinese enterprises strive to enter international capital markets through overseas listing for equity financing. However, in China, there is a general lack of understanding of the international capital markets, as well as a lack of professional institutions that provide overseas going public consulting services to these companies, and many of them may not be familiar with overseas listing requirements.



We launched our consulting services in 2015. Our aim was to assist these Chinese enterprises by filling the gaps and forming a bridge between PRC companies and overseas markets and exchanges. We have a team of qualified and experienced personnel with legal, regulatory, and language expertise in several overseas jurisdictions. Our services are designed to help SMEs in China achieve their goal of becoming public companies. We create a going public strategy for each client based on many factors, including our assessment of the client’s financial and operational situations, market conditions, and the client’s business and financing requirements. Since our inception and up to July 31, 2022, we have successfully helped eight Chinese enterprises to be quoted on the U.S. OTC markets and are currently assisting our other clients in their respective going public efforts. All of our current and past clients have been Chinese companies, and we plan to expand our operations to other Asian countries, such as Malaysia, Vietnam, and Singapore, by as opportunities arises.

On January 4, 2021, we announced the relocation of our operating headquarter to California, USA, through our wholly owned subsidiary ATIF Inc., a California corporation incorporated on October 26, 2020, and launched, in addition to our business consulting services, additional service models consisting of asset management, investment holding and media services to expand our business with a flexible business concept to achieve a goal of high growth revenue and strong profit growth. As part of this relocation and to streamline the management chain and to improve management control with a goal of lower costs, we transition the services from our variable interest entity (“VIE”), Qianhai Asia Times (Shenzhen) International Financial Services Co., Ltd. (“Qianhai”), to ATIF Inc. and Huaya, and terminated the VIE agreements with Qianhai on January 31, 2021. Before the termination, operating revenue generated through Qianhai VIE amounted to $645,127, and net income (loss) amounted to $(1,562,037) for the years ended July 31, 2020. The termination of the Qianhai VIE agreements did not cause a material impairment of our long-lived assets (primarily including fixed assets such as office furniture and equipment and automobile) because such assets only amounted to $184,740 and $68,375 as of July 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. All of the fixed assets were transferred to Huaya upon termination of the VIE agreement. In addition, we had discussions with other business organizations to collaborate with a goal of leveraging their resources to assist us to grow our business centers in other jurisdictions. We believe that this streamlined management model and strategic partnership strategy is in line with the current fast-changing and competitive business environment and will provide us with strong growth capability. The termination of the VIE agreement with Qianhai did not adversely affect Huaya, our business, financial condition, and results of operations.



On January 14, 2021, the Company entered into the Sale and Purchase Agreement with the majority shareholders of LGC consisting of Jiang Bo, Jiang Tao and Wang Di (collectively the “LGC Buyers”) to sell all interests in LGC. Pursuant to the Sales and Purchase Agreement, the Company sold 10,217,230 ordinary shares of LGC in exchange for (i) 5,555,548 ordinary shares of the Company owned by the LGC Buyers, and (ii) payment by the LGC Buyers in the amount of US$2,300,000 plus interest at an interest rate of 10% per annum on the unpaid amount if the principal amount of US$2,300,000 is not paid by January 14, 2022. All principal and accrued and unpaid interest shall be due on January 14, 2023. As of the date of this prospectus, the 5,555,548 shares of ordinary shares owned by the LGC Buyers have been returned to the Company and the $2.3 million cash payment has not yet been received from the LGC Buyers. The Company recognized an estimated loss of approximately $6.1 million from this transaction, which were reflected in the pro forma financial information as included in the Company’s form 6-K as filed with SEC on February 4, 2021. After completion of the transaction, the Company shall no longer hold any shares of LGC and LGC shall no longer be subsidiary of ATIF. The Sales and Purchase Agreement closed on January 29, 2021.



We entered into the Sale Purchase Agreement because we believed that due to the continued impact of COVID-19 in China, it will take longer, and additional capital will be required for traditional entertainment and cinemas businesses like LGC to recover. Further, in light of the Company moving its headquarter to California and transitioning to a new business model focusing on business consulting, asset management, investment holding and media services, the Company no longer believes that its business has synergy with LGC’s cinema advertising and cinema operation business. Our management and LGC’s management also had different views of LGC’s future business direction.



On February 16, 2021, we established ATIF-1, LP (“ATIF LP”) as a private equity fund through our indirectly-wholly owned subsidiary, ATIF-1 GP, LLC (“ATIF GP”), a Delaware limited liability company, as the general partner. As of July 31, 2022, we own a 76.6% limited partner interest in ATIF LP. ATIF LP manages, as of July 31, 2022, approximately $1.3 million assets under management (“AUM”). The investment strategy of the fund involves directional long and short investments in equity securities, primarily issued by U.S. large capitalization companies, and American Depositary Receipts (“ADRs”) related to Chinese companies of various sizes, including private companies. The investment manager for the fund is ATIF Inc. Due to significant volatility in stock market, the private equity fund lost $1.5 million in fiscal year 2022 as compared to gain $0.2 million in fiscal year 2021. On August 1, 2022, ATIF USA entered into and closed a Sale and Purchase Agreement with Asia Time (HK) International Finance Service Limited (the “Buyer”), pursuant to which ATIF USA sold all of its membership interests in ATIF GP (the “Agreement”) to the Buyer for cash consideration of US$50,000. Upon the closing of the Agreement, ATIF GP is no longer our subsidiary and ATIF USA ceased to be the investment manager of ATIF LP.



On May 31, 2022, we completed the transfer of our equity interest in ATIF HK and Huaya to Mr. Pishan Chi for $nil consideration. The transfer of equity interest was to mitigate the potential risks arising from the PRC government provision of new guidance to and restrictions on China-based companies raising capital offshore. We determined that the transfer of our equity interest in ATIF HK and Huaya did not have a major effect on our operations and financial results as we did not change our way of running business. We also determined that the transfer of equity interest does not represent a strategic shift in our business because there was no change to our operation of our consulting services. There was no change to the nature of our business, and did not affect our customers in North America, which is the major geographic market area of our business. However, we intend to continue cooperating with Huaya in connection with the expansion and provision of our business services in China. Before the disposal of ATIF HK and Huaya, operating revenue generated through Huaya amounted to $366,508 and $401,292, and net income (loss) amounted to $(812,434) and $86,758 for the years ended July 31, 2022 and 2021 respectively. The disposal of Huaya did not cause a material impairment of our long-lived assets (primarily including fixed assets such as office furniture and equipment and automobile) because it had no long-lived assets as of May 31, 2022.

Marketing and Sales



We believe the success of our consulting business requires building mutually beneficial long-term relationships with relevant and influential entities, and we have developed our main marketing channels based on these relationships.



Since our inception, we have cultivated and maintained cooperation with a number of city and provincial chambers of commerce and business associations in China, including the Zhejiang Chamber of Commerce in Shenzhen and Guangdong, Shenzhen Industrial Park Association, Meixian Chamber of Commerce in Shenzhen, Wenzhou Chamber of Commerce in Shenyang, Shenzhen Elite Chamber of Commerce, and the SME Service Platform in Northeast China. There are no contractual relationships between us and these organizations. However, these local business organizations have helped our marketing efforts greatly, due to the fact that: (1) they have access to the information of local enterprises and often recommend and connect us with potential clients; (2) they help us organize going public briefings and international financial lectures with local enterprises; and (3) they are able to utilize relationships with local government to initiate and organize government sponsored financial forums to promote and introduce our consulting services to the local enterprises.



We also strive to maintain professional relationships with our former and prospective clients. Our former clients have benefited from our services and oftentimes are willing and able to introduce prospective clients to us. After nearly three years operating as a consulting service provider specialized in cross-border going public services, we have developed a database consisting of former and prospective clients, using each as a resource for business connections and social relations.



Our employees have been working in various industries for many years, and accumulated networks of business and social relations including personal connections, corporate associations, and governmental affiliations, which are all valuable resources through which we can potentially obtain new clients.



We are constantly seeking new and effective marketing channels in order to grow into an international consulting company with clients and branches throughout Asia. To complement and facilitate our growth perspectives, in 2018, we launched AT Consulting Center, we believe, it has the great potential in becoming instrumental in our marketing efforts for continued growth of our consulting business.



In addition to our marketing efforts described above, we also market our consulting services, through:




● | Social media, principally WeChat and Weibo; 
--+------------------------------------------------


● | Newsletters to our prospective clients; and 
--+------------------------------------------------


● | Business relationships with well-known corporations and web platforms with large online traffics that can direct traffic to our website through links on their websites. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Competition



We face competition from a number of consulting companies providing going public consulting services such as Greenpro Capital Corp., Forward Capital, and Dragon Victory, who recently entered going public consulting services in 2018. We believe that our relatively mature operating history of nearly three years differentiates our company from other competitors. Our comprehensive one-stop consulting services, through which we are directly involved in each of the three pre-defined phases of our clients’ going public process, are unlike the services provided by many of our competitors, who often act as mere initial order takers, and then outsource a majority of services to third-party providers.





5







Currently, many of the going public consulting providers in China operate on a relatively small scale, only with a few employees. We believe that we are currently one of the few consulting companies capable of providing comprehensive one-stop going public services to qualified enterprises. However, due to favorable market conditions, which may have been overheated by various Chinese government stimulus programs offered recently to encourage and reward enterprises going public, a number of companies have entered and are entering the going public consulting business. As such, we expect competition will become more intense, and it is possible that we will not be able to maintain the growth rate we have achieved previously. 



Major Customers



The majority of our clients are small to medium-sized enterprises seeking growth and expansion through going public on recognized exchanges, and $1.6 million and $0.9 million was generated from our consulting services for the fiscal years ended July 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Since our inception in 2015 through July 31, 2022, most of our former and current clients were based in mainland China. The number of our new consulting service clients was five and three for the fiscal years ended July 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Due to the nature of our consulting business, which requires us to dedicate a large amount of resources to each of our clients, we were able to generate a relatively large revenue from a small number of clients. As a result, we had three and three clients that accounted for more than 10% of our total revenues, for the fiscal years ended July 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. As we continue to expand and grow the number of clients, we expect the risks arising from customer concentration will be mitigated accordingly.
Employees



As of July 31, 2022, we had 11 full-time employees, including 1 in China and 10 in America. None of our employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements governing their employment with us. We believe our employee relations are good.

PRC Laws and Regulations relating to Foreign Investment



Investment activities in the PRC by foreign investors were principally governed by the Guidance Catalog of Industries for Foreign Investment, promulgated and as amended from time to time by MOFCOM and National Development and Reform Commission (“NDRC”), which was later divided into two legal documents, including the Catalog of Industries for Encouraged Foreign Investment, or the “Encouraged Catalog,” and the Special Administrative Measures for Access of Foreign Investment (Negative List), or the “Negative List.” Industries listed in the Negative List are divided into two categories: restricted and prohibited. Industries not listed in the Negative List are generally constituted “permitted,” and are open to foreign investment unless specifically restricted by other PRC regulations. For restricted industries, some are limited to equity or contractual joint ventures, while in some cases Chinese partners are required to hold the majority interests in such joint ventures. In addition, restricted category projects are subject to higher-level government approvals. Foreign investors are not allowed to invest in industries in the prohibited category. The latest Negative List was released by MOFCOM and NDRC on September 18,2021 and became effective on January 1, 2022.

The Foreign Investment Law adopts the management system of pre-establishment national treatment and negative list for foreign investment. Policies in support of enterprises shall apply equally to foreign-funded enterprises according to laws and regulations. Foreign investment enterprises shall be guaranteed that they could equally participate in the setting of standards, and the compulsory standards formulated by the State shall be equally applied.

According to the SME Promotion Law and the Opinions, our business is encouraged by the government and is in compliance with relevant regulations in PRC. There are no further regulations on management consulting industry in the PRC presently. However, we cannot assure that there will not be more regulations on the management consulting industry to be issued by PRC government in the future that could affect our business.



Regulation on Intellectual Property Rights



Regulations on trademarks



The Trademark Law of the People’s Republic of China was adopted at the 24th meeting of the Standing Committee of the Fifth National People’s Congress on August 23, 1982. Three amendments were made on February 22, 1993, October 27, 2001, and August 30, 2013, respectively. The last amendment was implemented on May 1, 2014. The regulations on the implementation of the trademark law of the People’s Republic of China were promulgated by the State Council of the People’s Republic of China on August 3, 2002, and took effect on September 15, 2002. It was revised on April 29, 2014 and April 23, 2019. The PRC Trademark Office under the State Administration of Market Regulation handles trademark registrations and grants a term of 10 years to registered trademarks and another 10 years if requested upon expiration of the first or any renewed 10-year term. Trademark license agreements must be filed with the PRC Trademark Office for record. The PRC Trademark Law has adopted a “first-to-file” principle with respect to trademark registration. Where a trademark to be registered is identical or similar to another trademark which has already been registered or been subject to a preliminary examination and approval for use on the same kind of or similar goods or services, the application for registration of such trademark may be rejected. Any person applying for the registration of a trademark may not prejudice the existing right first obtained by others, nor may any person register in advance a trademark that has already been used by another party and has already gained a “sufficient degree of reputation” through such party’s use. After receiving an application, the PRC Trademark Office will make a public announcement if the relevant trademark passes the preliminary examination. During the three months after this public announcement, any person entitled to prior rights and any interested party may file an objection against the trademark. The PRC Trademark Office’s decisions on rejection, objection, or cancellation of an application may be appealed to the PRC Trademark Review and Adjudication Board, whose decision may be further appealed through judicial proceedings. If no objection is filed within three months after the public announcement or if the objection has been overruled, the PRC Trademark Office will approve the registration and issue a registration certificate, at which point the trademark is deemed to be registered and will be effective for a renewable 10-year period, unless otherwise revoked. For licensed use of a registered trademark, the licensor shall file record of the licensing with the PRC Trademark Office, and the licensing shall be published by the PRC Trademark Office. Failure of the licensing of a registered trademark shall not be contested against a good faith third party.

In accordance with the Notice from the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology on Regulating the Use of Domain Names in Internet Information Services, which was promulgated by the MIIT on November 27, 2017 and came into effect on January 1, 2018, Internet access service providers shall verify the identity of each Internet information service provider, and shall not provide services to any Internet information service provider which fails to provide real identity information. The applicant will become the holder of such domain names upon completion of the registration procedure. As of July 31, 2020, we had completed registration of five domain names, “ipoex.com,” “chinacnnm.com,” “atifchina.com,” “atifus.com,” and “dpoex.com,” in the PRC and became the legal holder of such domain names.

Regulations on Patents



Pursuant to the Patent Law of the PRC, or the “Patent Law,” promulgated by the SCNPC on March 12, 1984, most recently amended on October 17, 2020, and effective from June 1, 2021, and the Implementation Rules of the Patent Law of the PRC, promulgated by the State Council on June 15, 2001 and most recently amended on January 9, 2010, there are three types of patents in the PRC: invention patent, utility model patent, and design patent. The protection period is 20 years for invention patent and 10 years for utility model patent and 15 years for design patent, commencing from their respective application dates. Any individual or entity that utilizes a patent or conducts any other activity in infringement of a patent without prior authorization of the patentee shall pay compensation to the patentee and is subject to a fine imposed by relevant administrative authorities and, if the infringement constitutes a crime, shall be held criminally liable. In the event that a patent is owned by two or more co-owners without an agreement regarding the distribution of revenue generated from the exploitation of any co-owner of the patent, such revenue shall be distributed among all the co-owners.



Existing patents can become narrowed, invalid, or unenforceable due to a variety of grounds, including lack of novelty, creativity, and deficiencies in patent application. In China, a patent must have novelty, creativity, and practical applicability. Under the Patent Law, novelty means that before a patent application is filed, no identical invention or utility model has been publicly disclosed in any publication in China or overseas or has been publicly used or made known to the public by any other means, whether in or outside of China, nor has any other person filed with the patent authority an application that describes an identical invention or utility model and is recorded in patent application documents or patent documents published after the filing date. Creativity means that, compared with existing technology, an invention has prominent substantial features and represents notable progress, and a utility model has substantial features and represents any progress. Practical applicability means an invention or utility model can be manufactured or used and may produce positive results. Patents in China are filed with the State Intellectual Property Office, or the “SIPO.” Normally, the SIPO publishes an application for an invention patent within 18 months after the filing date, which may be shortened at the request of applicant. The applicant must apply to the SIPO for a substantive examination within three years from the date of application.



PRC Laws and Regulations Relating to Merger and Acquisition



The Regulations on Mergers and Acquisitions of Domestic Companies by Foreign Investors, or the M&A Rules, adopted by six PRC regulatory agencies in August 2006 and amended in 2009, requires a foreign investor to obtain necessary approvals when engaged in certain forms of acquisition of a domestic enterprise and further requires an overseas special purpose vehicle formed for listing purposes through acquisitions of PRC domestic companies and controlled by PRC companies or individuals to obtain the approval of the CSRC, prior to the listing and trading of such special purpose vehicle’s securities on an overseas stock exchange. In September 2006, the CSRC published a notice on its official website specifying documents and materials required to be submitted to it by a special purpose vehicle seeking CSRC approval of its overseas listings. Pursuant to the Manual of Guidance on Administration for Foreign Investment Access, which was issued and became effective on December 18, 2008 by MOFCOM, notwithstanding the fact that (i) the domestic shareholder is connected with the foreign investor or not, or (ii) the foreign investor is the existing shareholder or the new investor, the M&A Rules shall not apply to the transfer of an equity interest in an incorporated foreign-invested enterprise from the domestic shareholder to the foreign investor. However, the application of the M&A Rules remains unclear.



Our PRC counsel, Dentons Law Firm, has advised us based on their understanding of the current PRC laws, rules, and regulations that the CSRC’s approval should not be required for the listing and trading of our ordinary shares on the NASDAQ in the context of our IPO, given that: (i) we established our PRC subsidiary, Huaya, by means of direct investment rather than by merger with or acquisition of PRC domestic companies; and (ii) no explicit provision in the M&A Rules classifies the respective contractual arrangements between Huaya, Qianhai, and its shareholders as a type of acquisition transaction falling under the M&A Rules.





10







However, there remains some uncertainty as to how the M&A Rules will be interpreted or implemented in the context of an overseas offering and the CSRC’s opinions summarized above are subject to any new laws, rules, and regulations or detailed implementations and interpretations in any form relating to the M&A Rules. We cannot assure you that relevant PRC government agencies, including the CSRC, would reach the same conclusion as we do. If the CSRC or any other PRC regulatory agencies subsequently determines that we need to obtain the CSRC’s approval for our IPO or if the CSRC or any other PRC government agencies promulgates any interpretation or implements rules that would require us to obtain CSRC or other governmental approvals for our IPO, we may face adverse actions or sanctions by the CSRC or other PRC regulatory agencies. Sanctions may include fines and penalties on our operations in the PRC, limitations on our operating privileges in the PRC, delays in or restrictions on the repatriation of the proceeds from our IPO into the PRC, restrictions on or prohibition of the payments or remittance of dividends by our PRC subsidiary, or other actions that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, reputation, and prospects, as well as the trading price of our ordinary shares. In addition, if the CSRC or other PRC regulatory agencies later promulgate new rules or explanations requiring that we obtain their approvals for our IPO, we may be unable to obtain a waiver of such approval requirements, if and when procedures are established to obtain such a waiver. Any uncertainties and/or negative publicity regarding such approval requirement could have a material adverse effect on the trading price of ordinary shares.



PRC Laws and Regulations Relating to Foreign Exchange



General administration of foreign exchange



The principal regulation governing foreign currency exchange in the PRC is the Administrative Regulations of the PRC on Foreign Exchange (the “Foreign Exchange Regulations”), which were promulgated on January 29, 1996, became effective on April 1, 1996, and were amended on January 14, 1997, and August 1, 2008. Under these rules, RMB is generally freely convertible for payments of current account items, such as trade- and service-related foreign exchange transactions and dividend payments, but not freely convertible for capital account items, such as capital transfer, direct investment, investment in securities, derivative products, or loans unless prior approval and prior registration by competent authorities for the administration of foreign exchange is obtained and made. Under the Foreign Exchange Regulations, foreign-invested enterprises in the PRC may purchase foreign exchange under the current accounts without the approval of SAFE to pay dividends by providing certain evidentiary documents, including board resolutions, tax certificates, or for trade- and services-related foreign exchange transactions, by providing commercial documents evidencing such transactions.
Circular No. 75, Circular No. 37, and Circular No. 13



Circular 37 was released by SAFE on July 4, 2014, and abolished Circular 75 which had been in effect since November 1, 2005. Pursuant to Circular 37, a PRC resident should apply to SAFE for foreign exchange registration of overseas investments prior to the establishment or control of an offshore special purpose vehicle, or SPV, using his or her legitimate domestic or offshore assets or interests. SPVs are offshore enterprises directly established or indirectly controlled by domestic residents for the purpose of investment and financing by utilizing domestic or offshore assets or interests they legally hold. Following any significant change in a registered offshore SPV, such as capital increase, reduction, equity transfer or swap, consolidation or division involving domestic resident individuals, the domestic individuals shall amend the registration with SAFE. Where an SPV intends to repatriate funds raised after completion of offshore financing to the PRC, it shall comply with relevant PRC regulations on foreign investment and foreign debt management. A foreign-invested enterprise established through return investment shall complete relevant foreign exchange registration formalities in accordance with the prevailing foreign exchange administration regulations on foreign direct investment and truthfully disclose information on the actual controller of its shareholders. 



If any shareholder who is a PRC resident (as determined by Circular 37) holds any interest in an offshore SPV and fails to fulfil the required foreign exchange registration with the local SAFE branches, the PRC subsidiaries of that offshore SPV may be prohibited from distributing their profits and dividends to their offshore parent company or from carrying out other subsequent cross-border foreign exchange activities. The offshore SPV may also be restricted in its ability to contribute additional capital to its PRC subsidiaries. Where a domestic resident fails to complete relevant foreign exchange registration as required, fails to truthfully disclose information on the actual controller of the enterprise involved in the return investment or otherwise makes false statements, the foreign exchange control authority may order them to take remedial actions, issue a warning, and impose a fine of less than RMB300,000 (approximately $43,000) on an institution or less than RMB50,000 (approximately $7,300) on an individual.





11







Circular 13 was issued by SAFE on February 13, 2015, and became effective on June 1, 2015. Pursuant to Circular 13, a domestic resident who makes a capital contribution to an SPV using his or her legitimate domestic or offshore assets or interests is no longer required to apply to SAFE for foreign exchange registration of his or her overseas investments. Instead, he or she shall register with a bank in the place where the assets or interests of the domestic enterprise in which he or she has interests are located if the domestic resident individually seeks to make a capital contribution to the SPV using his or her legitimate domestic assets or interests; or he or she shall register with a local bank at his or her permanent residence if the domestic resident individually seeks to make a capital contribution to the SPV using his or her legitimate offshore assets or interests. The qualified bank will directly examine the applications and accept registrations under the supervision of SAFE.



As of the date of this annual report, our shareholders have not completed registrations in accordance with Circular 37, they are currently working on their registrations in the local Administration of Exchange Control. The failure of our shareholders to comply with the registration procedures may subject each of our shareholders to warnings and fines. If the registration formalities cannot be processed retrospectively, then the repatriation of the financing funds, profits, or any other interests of our shareholders obtained through special purpose vehicles, for use in China, would be prohibited. As a result, any cross-border capital flows between our PRC subsidiary and its offshore parent company, including dividend distributions and capital contributions, would be illegal



Circular 19 and Circular 16



Circular 19 was promulgated by SAFE on March 30, 2015, and became effective on June 1, 2015. According to Circular 19, foreign exchange capital of foreign-invested enterprises shall be granted the benefits of Discretional Foreign Exchange Settlement (“Discretional Foreign Exchange Settlement”). With Discretional Foreign Exchange Settlement, foreign exchange capital in the capital account of a foreign-invested enterprise for which the rights and interests of monetary contribution has been confirmed by the local foreign exchange bureau, or for which book-entry registration of monetary contribution has been completed by the bank, can be settled at the bank based on the actual operational needs of the foreign-invested enterprise. The allowed Discretional Foreign Exchange Settlement percentage of the foreign exchange capital of a foreign-invested enterprise has been temporarily set to be 100%. The RMB converted from the foreign exchange capital will be kept in a designated account and if a foreign-invested enterprise needs to make any further payment from such account, it will still need to provide supporting documents and to complete the review process with its bank.



Furthermore, Circular 19 stipulates that foreign-invested enterprises shall make bona fide use of their capital for their own needs within their business scopes. The capital of a foreign-invested enterprise and the RMB if obtained from foreign exchange settlement shall not be used for the following purposes




● | directly or indirectly used for expenses beyond its business scope or prohibited by relevant laws or regulations; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | directly or indirectly used for investment in securities unless otherwise provided by relevant laws or regulations; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | directly or indirectly used for entrusted loan in RMB (unless within its permitted scope of business), repayment of inter-company loans (including advances by a third party) or repayment of bank loans in RMB that have been sub-lent to a third party; and 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | directly or indirectly used for expenses related to the purchase of real estate that is not for self-use (except for foreign-invested real estate enterprises). 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




Circular 16 was issued by SAFE on June 9, 2016. Pursuant to Circular 16, enterprises registered in the PRC may also convert their foreign debts from foreign currency to RMB on a self-discretionary basis. Circular 16 provides an integrated standard for conversion of foreign exchange capital items (including but not limited to foreign currency capital and foreign debts) on a self-discretionary basis applicable to all enterprises registered in the PRC. Circular 16 reiterates the principle that an enterprise’s RMB converted from foreign currency-denominated capital may not be directly or indirectly used for purposes beyond its business scope or purposes prohibited by PRC laws or regulations, and such converted RMB shall not be provided as loans to non-affiliated entities.





12







Circulars 16 and 19 address foreign direct investments into the PRC, and stipulate the procedures applicable to foreign exchange settlement. As we do not plan to transfer any proceeds raised to our subsidiaries in the PRC, such proceeds would not be subject to Circular 19 or Circular 16. However, if and when circumstances require funds to be transferred to our subsidiaries in the PRC from our offshore entities, then any such transfer would be subject to Circulars 16 and 19.



PRC Laws and Regulations Relating to Taxation



Enterprise Income Tax



The EIT Law was promulgated by the Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress on March 16, 2007, and became effective on January 1, 2008, and then amended on February 24, 2017 as well as December 29, 2018. The Implementation Rules of the EIT Law (the “Implementation Rules”) were promulgated by the State Council on December 6, 2007, and became effective on January 1, 2008, and was amended on April 23, 2019. According to the EIT Law and the Implementation Rules, enterprises are divided into resident enterprises and non-resident enterprises. Resident enterprises shall pay enterprise income tax on their incomes obtained in and outside the PRC at the rate of 25%. Non-resident enterprises setting up institutions in the PRC shall pay enterprise income tax on the incomes obtained by such institutions in and outside the PRC at the rate of 25%. Non-resident enterprises with no institutions in the PRC, and non-resident enterprises whose incomes having no substantial connection with their institutions in the PRC, shall pay enterprise income tax on their incomes obtained in the PRC at a reduced rate of 10%. An enterprise established outside of the PRC with its “de facto management bodies” located within the PRC is considered a “resident enterprise,” meaning that it can be treated in a manner similar to a PRC domestic enterprise for enterprise income tax purposes. The Implementing Rules of the EIT Law define a “de facto management body” as a managing body that in practice exercises “substantial and overall management and control over the production and operations, personnel, accounting, and properties” of the enterprise. It is more likely than not that the Company and its offshore subsidiary would be treated as a non-resident enterprise for PRC tax purposes.



The Arrangement between the Mainland China and Hong Kong Special Administrative Region for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and Tax Evasion on Income (the “Arrangement”) was promulgated by the State Administration of Taxation (“SAT”) on August 21, 2006, and came into effect on December 8, 2006. According to the Arrangement, a company incorporated in Hong Kong will be subject to withholding tax at the lower rate of 5% on dividends it receives from a company incorporated in the PRC if it holds a 25% interest or more in the PRC company. Pursuant to the Announcement of the State Administration of Taxation on Issues Relating to “Beneficial Owner” in Tax Treaties promulgated by SAT on February 3, 2018 and became effective on April 1, 2018, a beneficial ownership analysis will be applied in light of the actual circumstances of the specific cases to determine the status of a beneficial owner under the relevant tax treaty and whether or not to grant tax treaty benefits.



Before May 31,2022, Huaya is a resident enterprise and qualifies as a Small and Low Profit Enterprise and pays EIT tax at the rate of 10% in PRC. It is more likely than not that we and our offshore subsidiary would be treated as a non-resident enterprise for PRC tax purposes.



Value-added Tax



The Provisional Regulations on Value-Added Tax of the PRC (the “VAT Regulations”) were promulgated by the State Council on December 13, 1993, and took effect on January 1, 1994, which were last amended on November 19, 2017. The Rules for the Implementation of the Provisional Regulations on Value Added Tax of the PRC (the “Rules”) were promulgated by the Ministry of Finance (“MOF”) on December 25, 1993, and were last amended on October 28, 2011. Pursuant to the VAT Regulations and the Rules, entities or individuals in the PRC engaged in the sale of goods, the provision of processing, repairs, and replacement services and the importation of goods are required to pay VAT, on the value added during the course of the sale of goods or provision of services. Unless otherwise specified, the applicable VAT rate is 17% for taxpayers selling goods, labor services, or tangible movable property leasing services or importing goods, except otherwise specified; 11% for taxpayers selling transport services, postal services, basic telecommunications services, construction services, or real property leasing services, selling real property, transferring the land use right, or selling or importing the goods within specified scope listed, except otherwise specified; 6% for taxpayers selling services or intangible assets and not falling within the scope as specified in other items; and 3% for small-scale taxpayers.





13







The SAT and the MOF jointly promulgated Notice on Implementing the Pilot Program of Replacing Business Tax with Value-Added Tax in an All-round Manner (the “Notice”) on March 20, 2019, which became effective on April 1, 2019. Pursuant to this new circular, entities and individuals shall pay VAT at a rate of 9 % for providing transportation, postal services, basic telecommunications, construction or immovable property leasing services, selling any immovable property, or transferring the right to use land; rate of 13% for providing tangible movable property leasing services; rate of 0% for a cross-border taxable act within the territory of China and rate of 6% for conducting any taxable act other than the above-mentioned taxable acts.



According to the above-regulations, our PRC subsidiary is generally subject to a 3% VAT rate.



Additional Taxes



Before September 1, 2021, the Provisional Regulations of the People’s Republic of China on Urban Maintenance and Construction Tax, or the “Provisional Regulations,” promulgated by the State Council on February 8, 1985 and revised on January 8, 2011 governs the payment of urban maintenance and construction tax. According to the Provisional Regulations, all units and individuals paying consumption tax, VAT, and business tax are taxpayers of urban maintenance and construction tax, and shall pay urban maintenance and construction tax in accordance with the provisions of these regulations. The Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress passed the Tax Law of the People’s Republic of China on Urban Maintenance and Construction on August 11, 2020, which became effective after September 1, 2021. According to this law, the urban maintenance and construction tax is based on VAT and consumption tax actually paid by taxpayers. Therefore, if VAT is exempted, urban construction tax will also be exempted.



The Interim Provisions on Levying Educational Surcharges, or the “Interim Provisions,” was issued by the State Council on April 28, 1986 and revised on June 7, 1990, August 20, 2005, and January 8, 2011. According to the Interim Provisions, the educational surcharges shall be calculated and levied on the basis of the actual VAT, business tax, and consumption tax paid by various units and individuals. The education surcharges rate is 3%, which shall be paid at the same time as the VAT, business tax, and consumption tax.



The Notice on Expanding the Exemption Scope of Relevant Government Funds, or “The Notice,” was issued by the MOF and the SAT on January 29, 2016 and implemented from February 1, 2016. According to The Notice, with the approval of the State Council, the scope of exemption from education surcharges, local education surcharges, and water conservancy construction funds shall be expanded from the payers whose monthly sales volume or turnover does not exceed RMB30,000 (quarterly sales or turnover paid on a quarterly basis shall not exceed RMB90,000) to RMB100,000 (quarterly sales or turnover paid on a quarterly basis shall not exceed RMB300,000).



Dividend Withholding Tax



The Enterprise Income Tax Law and the Implementation Rules provides that since January 1, 2008, an income tax rate of 10% will normally be applicable to dividends declared to non-PRC resident investors which do not have an establishment or place of business in the PRC, or which have such establishment or place of business but the relevant income is not effectively connected with the establishment or place of business, to the extent such dividends are derived from sources within the PRC.



Pursuant to an Arrangement Between the Mainland of China and the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Incomes (“Double Tax Avoidance Arrangement”) and other applicable PRC laws, if a Hong Kong resident enterprise is determined by the competent PRC tax authority to have satisfied the relevant conditions and requirements under such Double Tax Avoidance Arrangement and other applicable laws, the 10% withholding tax on the dividends the Hong Kong resident enterprise receives from a PRC resident enterprise may be reduced to 5%. However, based on the Circular on Certain Issues with Respect to the Enforcement of Dividend Provisions in Tax Treaties (the “SAT Circular 81”) issued on February 20, 2009, by SAT, if the relevant PRC tax authorities determine, in their discretion, that a company benefits from such reduced income tax rate due to a structure or arrangement that is primarily tax-driven, such PRC tax authorities may adjust the preferential tax treatment. According to the Circular on Several Questions regarding the “Beneficial Owner” in Tax Treaties, which was issued on February 3, 2018, by the SAT and took effect on April 1, 2018, when determining the applicant’s status of the “beneficial owner” regarding tax treatments in connection with dividends, interests or royalties in the tax treaties, several factors, including without limitation, whether the applicant is obligated to pay more than 50% of his or her income in 12 months to residents in a third country or region, whether the business operated by the applicant constitutes the actual business activities, and whether the counterparty country or region to the tax treaties does not levy any tax or grant tax exemption on relevant incomes or levy tax at an extremely low rate, will be taken into account, and it will be analyzed according to the actual circumstances of the specific cases. This circular further provides that applicants who intend to prove his or her status of the “beneficial owner” shall submit the relevant documents to the relevant tax bureau according to the Announcement on Issuing the Measures for the Administration of Non-Resident Taxpayers’ Enjoyment of the Treatment under Tax Agreements.





14







We have not commenced the application process for a Hong Kong tax resident certificate from the relevant Hong Kong tax authority, and there is no assurance that we will be granted such a Hong Kong tax resident certificate. We also have not filed required forms or materials with the relevant PRC tax authorities to prove that we should enjoy the 5% PRC withholding tax rate.



PRC Laws and Regulations Relating to Employment and Social Welfare



Labor Law of the PRC



Pursuant to the Labor Law of the PRC, which was promulgated by the Standing Committee of the NPC on July 5, 1994, with an effective date of January 1, 1995, and was last amended on December 29, 2018, and the Labor Contract Law of the PRC, which was promulgated on June 29, 2007, became effective on January 1, 2008, and was last amended on December 28, 2012, with the amendments coming into effect on July 1, 2013, enterprises and institutions shall ensure the safety and hygiene of a workplace, strictly comply with applicable rules and standards on workplace safety and hygiene in China, and educate employees on such rules and standards.

Copyright Ordinance (Chapter 528 of the Laws of Hong Kong) (the “Copyright Ordinance”)



The Copyright Ordinance provides comprehensive protection for recognized categories of work such as literary, dramatic, musical, and artistic works, as well as for films, television broadcasts, and cable diffusion, and works made available to the public on the internet.



In the course of providing advertising services and digital media publication, certain copyrights may subsist in the works we create in relation to its publications, digital media content, and advertising materials, including artistic works (such as artworks and photos), films (such as videos), or literary works (such as text) that qualify for copyright protection without registration. It is not necessary to register a copyright nor are there other formalities required to obtain copyright protection for a work in Hong Kong. There is no official registry in Hong Kong for registration of copyright works.



The Copyright Ordinance restricts certain acts such as copying and/or issuing or making available copies to the public of a copyright work without the authorization from the copyright owner which, if done, constitutes “primary infringement” of copyright which does not require knowledge of infringement.



The Copyright Ordinance permits certain acts that can be done in relation to copyright works without authorization from the copyright owner, one of which being fair dealing with a copyright work for the purpose of criticism, review, or reporting current events if accompanied by a sufficient acknowledgement of such copyright work and its author.



Under the Copyright Ordinance, a person may incur civil liability for “secondary infringement” if that person, amongst others, possesses, sells, distributes, or deals with a copy of a work which is, and which he knows or has reason to believe to be, an infringing copy of the work for the purposes of or in the course of any trade or business without the consent of the copyright owner. However, the person will only be liable if, at the time he committed the act, he knew or had reason to believe that he was dealing with infringing copies of the work.

Slander is the publication of defamatory matter by word of mouth or in some other transient (temporary) form.



Section 5 of the DO provides that any person who maliciously publishes any defamatory libel, knowing the same to be false, shall be liable to imprisonment for two years, and, in addition, to pay such fine as the court may award.



There are several defenses available, including but not limited to (a) unintentional defamation; (b) an offer of amends; (c) defense of justification, which means the words were true in substance and in fact; (d) fair comment; and (e) publication which was privileged as prescribed in the schedule of the DO.
