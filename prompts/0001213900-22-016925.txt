Item 1. Business
Overview



Arcimoto, Inc. (the “Company”, “we”, “us”, or “our”) was incorporated in the State of Oregon on November 21, 2007. The Company’s mission is to catalyze the global shift to a sustainable transportation system. Over the past 14 years, the Company has developed technologies, platforms, and vehicles aimed squarely at rightsizing daily mobility. To date, the Company has introduced six vehicle products built on the first Arcimoto platform that target specific niches in the vehicle market: our flagship product, the Fun Utility Vehicle® (“FUV®”), for everyday consumer trips; the Deliverator® for last-mile delivery and general fleet utility; the Rapid Responder® for emergency services and security; the Cameo™ for film, sports and influencers; the Arcimoto Roadster, an unparalleled pure-electric on-road thrill machine; and the Flatbed, Arcimoto’s solution for a rightsized pickup truck. In February 2021, Arcimoto acquired Tilting Motor Works and is currently selling their TRiO motorcycle upgrade kit, which transforms a traditional two-wheeled motorcycle into a leaning three-wheeled motorcycle. In February 2022, the Company introduced a second vehicle platform prototype and the first product concept on that platform, a class 3 e-trike codenamed the Mean Lean Machine™.

Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company has experienced production and supply chain challenges related to extended lead times for delivery of parts and raw materials and may continue to do so in the foreseeable future.



The Company’s primary focus is on volume production planning in order to push to sustainable profitability. On April 19, 2021, the Company purchased an approximately 220,000 square foot facility to expand production capabilities. We have submitted an application for the Federal Department of Energy’s Advanced Technology Vehicle Manufacturing Loan Program (“ATVMLP”) to secure the funds necessary to execute our growth strategy.



Platform and Technologies



Arcimoto spent its first decade developing and refining eight generations of a new three-wheeled electric vehicle platform: a light-footprint, nimble reverse-trike architecture that features a low center of gravity for stability on the road; dual-motor front-wheel drive for enhanced traction; can be parked three to a space while carrying two large adults comfortably, and is more efficient, by an order of magnitude, than today’s gas-powered cars. The Company has secured 13 utility patents on various constituent technologies and vehicle platform architectures. As announced on June 10, 2020, Arcimoto has teamed with Munro & Associates to evaluate Arcimoto’s manufacturing processes and supply chain management in order to drive down costs and begin high-volume production of Arcimoto ultra-efficient electric vehicles. This project, which is estimated to take approximately two to four years, progressed significantly in 2021, primarily due to the purchase of a new production facility, continued production ramp planning, and product architecture sourcing-selection across all major vehicle subsystems.

Products



Arcimoto’s vehicle products are based on the Arcimoto Platform, which includes the basic lower frame structure and certain key components of our vehicles. While intended to serve very different market segments, an estimated 90% of the constituent parts are the same between all products currently in production and development.
FUV®



Arcimoto’s flagship product is the FUV. The FUV delivers a thrilling ride experience, exceptional maneuverability, comfort for two passengers with cargo, highly-efficient parking (three FUVs to a single parking space), and ultra-efficient operation, all at an affordable price. Over time, we anticipate offering the FUV with several option packages to meet the needs of a variety of customers.



We led with a consumer product because we are a consumer-first brand. We believe individuals should be able to choose more efficient, more affordable, and lighter-footprint mobility solutions, so that more of us can participate in the transition to a sustainable transportation future.



Rapid Responder®



The Rapid Responder was announced on February 15, 2019. The pure-electric Rapid Responder is developed on the Arcimoto platform, and designed to perform specialized emergency, security and law enforcement services at a fraction of the cost and environmental impact of traditional combustion vehicles. The Rapid Responder aims to deliver first responders to incidents more quickly and affordably than traditional emergency response vehicles.



Arcimoto is initially targeting the more than 50,000 fire stations across the United States that use traditional fire engines and large automobiles to respond to calls. Arcimoto also plans to market the Rapid Responder® as a solution for campus security and law enforcement applications.



Deliverator®



Development of the Deliverator was officially announced on March 19, 2019 with the reveal of the first Deliverator prototype. The Deliverator is currently in production.



The Deliverator is a pure electric, last-mile delivery solution designed to more quickly, efficiently, and affordably get goods where they need to go. We plan for the Deliverator to be customizable to carry a wide array of products, from pizza, groceries, and cold goods to the 65 billion parcels delivered worldwide annually.
Cameo™



Arcimoto completed a prototype of the Cameo, an FUV equipped with a rear-facing rear seat and a modified roof built for on-road filming in September 2020. We tested the Cameo prototype in several Arcimoto videos in September 2020 and have used the Cameo to shoot all of our own driving footage since its on-roading. Development of the Cameo has been completed.



The Cameo is aimed at the film industry, as well as the growing influencer and Do-It-Yourself (“DIY”) film market. The Cameo is currently available to prospective customers as a custom-modified FUV.

Arcimoto Roadster




The Arcimoto Roadster prototype was first introduced in a video released October 30, 2020. Conceived as a pure platform fun machine, the Roadster offers a lower center of gravity, lower overall weight, and potentially improved aerodynamics. We announced the formal development of the Roadster product, in collaboration with industry partners on November 16, 2020. The first production Roadster was unveiled on July 26, 2021. Roadsters are currently available for purchase in select states on the Arcimoto website, and are available to rent from our rental locations.
Arcimoto Flatbed



The Arcimoto Flatbed prototype was introduced at the FUV & Friends Summer Showcase on July 26, 2021. Similar to the Deliverator, it eschews the rear seat, this time for a pickup-style flatbed instead of an enclosed cargo area. Arcimoto announced a collaboration with Eugene-based Sherptek, and displayed a modular, expandable flatbed that could be used for the Flatbed model.



TRiO



On January 23, 2021, the Company entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement (the “Agreement”) with Tilting Motor Works, Inc. (“TMW”), a Washington corporation (the “Seller”), and its owner. TMW engages in the design, production, sales, and installation of a bolt on kit, named TRiO that converts a two wheeled motorcycle into a tilting three wheeled motorcycle. TMW was acquired to utilize the tilting technology in new three-wheeled micro-mobility vehicles.



The Mean Lean Machine™



Code named the Mean Lean Machine, or MLM, Arcimoto’s first concept on its new vehicle platform is intended to be a class 3 e-trike that features 200+ miles range with auxiliary batteries, carries 1 or 2 people, incorporates Arcimoto’s patented tilting technology developed by Tilting Motor Works, and a pedal generator for speed control and stationary recharge. More details will be announced in 2022 as we approach production and retail sale.



Since February 22, 2022, when Arcimoto first revealed the MLM, approximately 711 pre-orders to purchase have been received.



Customization



Opportunities exist for customization amongst all of the models. For example, we are currently exploring with a third party the installation of a small water tank and efficient water delivery system onto the Flatbed in order to create an effective firefighting first response vehicle.

Driverless Arcimoto



Our long-term goal is to offer the market one of the lowest cost, most efficient “last mile” human and goods shared transport solutions for the future road. We intend that our platform will provide a ready foundation for remote control and self-driving technology deployment, and have begun to demonstrate that capability.



At the FUV & Friends Summer Showcase on July 26, 2021, Arcimoto demonstrated progress on torque vectoring and other drive system software improvements, including “drive-by-wire” functionality, a foundational layer for a true driverless control system.



The first step toward that driverless control system was also on display at the Summer Showcase. A technology company, based in South San Francisco, demonstrated the first ever driverless FUV using remote control, a step toward ride-on-demand, where riders will be able to summon a vehicle to their location and then hop in and drive.



Sales and Distribution Model



Arcimoto’s sales and distribution model is direct. Customers place vehicle orders on our website, and the vehicle product will be delivered directly to the end user via a common carrier or our own delivery fleet. The website ordering and vehicle configuration system is functional, with additional development planned to further automate the sales process.



On October 26, 2020, we announced a partnership with DHL to provide nationwide home delivery of the FUV. They are currently handling the bulk of our customer deliveries.



Rental and Rideshare Model



We plan to augment this direct web purchase process with experience rental in key markets. This rental model gives prospective customers a direct experience with the physical product before purchasing. We opened our first Company-owned rental operations in San Diego, California and Eugene, Oregon in the second quarter of 2021. Additional rental vehicles are available at our franchise rental location, Arcimoto Key West in Key West, Florida, and at our rental partner in San Francisco, California. We entered into a rental partnership agreement with a hotel in Eugene, Oregon in the third quarter of 2021 to rent FUVs to hotel guests. During the fourth quarter of 2021, we entered into agreements with rental partners to rent our FUVs in Friday Harbor, Washington and Scottsdale, Arizona. During the first quarter of 2022, we have entered into various partnership rental agreements to rent our FUVs across certain major cities in Florida.



We plan to open additional Arcimoto-owned and operated rental locations in favorable markets in the future, while also further developing our model for franchise and partner rental operations, and aggressively pursuing partners for those operations.



Additionally, we are developing the technology necessary to enable rideshare on the platform. This technology takes the form of a versatile mobile application, unlocking the ability for Arcimoto or a potential partner to determine what level of human resources and interaction is necessary for a given rental location. The mobile application is currently being tested. We entered into a rideshare agreement during the second quarter of 2021 that enables us to rent our FUVs in Miami, Florida and Los Angeles, California.



Service



We are pursuing three different models for service of the FUV:



Service-on-demand



Our initial model is on-demand and on-site vehicle service by Arcimoto technicians or Arcimoto-authorized technicians. Service-on-demand will likely be the primary model during our West Coast release as the majority of the vehicles will be geographically located relatively near the factory or a mobile technician. We intend for customers to request service either through the Arcimoto mobile app or by calling a 24-hour service number.

In-market partnership



We are currently reviewing potential service partners located in our key distribution regions. We have contracted with Agero Driver Assistance Services, Inc. to provide our customers with roadside assistance. We are currently reviewing Agero’s network of pre-approved third-party service providers, as well as other third-party service providers, to perform service on Arcimoto vehicles. We are currently selecting, training, and certifying providers as we expand.



Rental facility service



We employ Arcimoto service technicians at some of our rental locations, depending on the dealer laws in the state. Customers near those rental locations are able to deliver their vehicle to that location for service needs.



Warranty



We provide a manufacturer’s warranty on all new and used vehicles we sell for the lesser of three years or thirty-six thousand miles. We accrue warranty reserve for the products sold by us, which includes our best estimate of the projected costs to repair or replace items under warranties and recalls when identified. These estimates are based on actual claims incurred to date and an estimate of the nature, frequency and costs of future claims. These estimates are inherently uncertain given our relatively short history of sales and changes to our historical or projected warranty experience may cause material changes to the warranty reserve in the future. The warranty reserve does not include projected warranty costs associated with our vehicles subject to operating lease accounting as the costs to repair these warranty claims are expensed as incurred. The portion of the warranty reserve expected to be incurred within the next 12 months is in the current portion of warranty reserves, while the remaining balance is in warranty reserve on the balance sheets. Warranty expense is recorded as a component of cost of revenues in the statements of operations.
Facility



In October 2017, we took possession of our new factory, the Arcimoto Manufacturing Plant (“AMP”), and immediately began retrofitting the space. In December 2017, all employees relocated to the new site and we began operations there. To make the new factory usable for our purposes, we updated the building with brighter energy efficient lighting, polished the production floor to improve cleanliness, painted to increase light levels, remodeled the employee facilities and commenced installation of the manufacturing equipment. Further, we enclosed approximately 8,000 square feet of loading dock area at the AMP to create a well-organized materials space with four truck loading bays, improving inventory management.



During the fourth quarter of 2018 we remodeled a 5,700 square foot inventory warehouse located across the street from the AMP into usable office spaces and moved non-manufacturing personnel into these new offices in order to free up production space in the AMP. We also leased an approximately 4,500 square foot retail location in San Diego California to serve as a dealer location and rental center.



During the fourth quarter of 2019 we leased an approximately 10,800 square foot building with warehouse and office space approximately six blocks east of the AMP. The office space is being used by our marketing team and the warehouse space is being used by R&D and for battery module manufacturing.



During the first quarter of 2020, we leased an approximately 10,800 square foot building with warehouse and office space next to the building leased during the fourth quarter of 2019. This location is being used for service operations.





7







During the fourth quarter of 2020, we leased an approximately 100 square foot office in Orlando Florida to serve as a dealer location. This location will serve as the administrative hub for a few planned rental locations around the Orlando area. We expect to fully utilize this office by the second quarter of 2022.



On December 23, 2020, we entered into a purchase agreement for the properties located at 311 Chambers St. and 1480 W. 3rd Ave., Eugene, Oregon. The properties consist of an approximately 220,000 square foot warehouse space situated on approximately 10.7 acres. During the first quarter of 2021, an additional 4.1 acres and 33,000 square feet of buildings to the south commonly known as 1593 W. 5th Ave. Eugene, Oregon was added to the purchase agreement. This purchase was consummated on April 19, 2021. This space is currently used for increased production capacity.



During the first quarter of 2021, we leased an approximately 15,000 square foot facility that consists of the second floor of the office building located at 155 Blair Blvd., Eugene, Oregon and also a warehouse located at 135 Blair Blvd., Eugene, Oregon to serve as a dealer location and rental center.



During the second quarter of 2021, we entered into a lease for an executive office space in Arlington, Virginia. The space will be used by an executive for office and general use. The term of the lease is one year which began on June 1, 2021 and automatically renews each month after the first year unless two months’ notice of cancellation is given.



During the second quarter of 2021, we entered into a lease for a commercial facility located at 2110 West Second Avenue, Eugene, Oregon. The term of the lease is month to month which began on approximately May 1, 2021 and automatically renews each month unless 30 days’ notice of cancellation is given. 



Governmental Programs, Incentives and Regulations



Many governmental standards and regulations relating to safety, fuel economy, emissions control, noise control, vehicle recycling, substances of concern, vehicle damage, recall, and theft prevention are applicable to new motor vehicles, engines, and equipment manufactured for sale in the United States, Europe, and elsewhere. In addition, manufacturing and other vehicle assembly facilities in the United States, Europe, and elsewhere are subject to stringent standards regulating air emissions, water discharges, and the handling and disposal of hazardous substances. In addition, the regulations in this area are constantly evolving, especially with the entry of new vehicles into the market.



Some of the significant standards and regulations affecting Arcimoto are discussed below:



Motor Vehicle Safety



The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (the “NHTSA”) defines a motorcycle as “a motor vehicle with motive power having a seat or saddle for the use of the rider and designed to travel on not more than three wheels in contact with the ground.” In order for a manufacturer to sell motorcycles in the United States, the manufacturer must self-certify to meet a certain set of regulatory requirements promulgated by the NHTSA in its Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards.



In 2018, Arcimoto developed an internal regulatory compliance team to ensure that the FUV production vehicles would meet Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards requirements for motorcycles. In the third quarter of 2019, we completed the vehicle testing begun in the first quarter of 2019. Arcimoto tested to verify robustness of its vehicle design, to demonstrate compliance with all Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards required for motorcycles, and to demonstrate proper function of voluntarily-added equipment such as the FUV’s 3+3 seat belts. At the end of the third quarter of 2019, vehicle testing and regulatory requirements were completed, and we initiated the sales process with our first customers.





8







The Company has had various recalls for issues that have been discovered and are in various stages of completion. All proper protocols have been followed for reporting these recalls to NHTSA and to our customers in a timely manner.



EPA certification



In accordance with 40 CFR 86, Arcimoto successfully completed SAE J2982 Range and MPGe testing, and EPA issued 2019, 2020 and 2021 Model Year Certificate of Conformity for demonstrated compliance as a fully zero emissions, battery-only 3-wheeled electric highway motorcycle.



Electromagnetic Compatibility



The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) is the federal agency responsible for implementing and enforcing the communications law and regulations, including 47 CFR-15, which regulates unlicensed radio-frequency transmissions, both intentional and unintentional. During 2019, Arcimoto demonstrated that the FUV is in compliance with all required electromagnetic compatibility requirements by testing the vehicle and its components at a test facility accredited by the American Association of Laboratory Accreditation (A2LA) for automotive, electromagnetic compatibility, information and communication technologies, and medical devices.
Motor Vehicle Manufacturer and Dealer Regulation



As with helmet laws and driver license requirements, state laws that regulate the manufacture, distribution, and sale of motor vehicles are a patchwork nationwide. Arcimoto plans to open its own retail distribution facilities or services in select states where Arcimoto is allowed by statute to be recognized as a dealer. In all other states, including those where Arcimoto is prohibited from selling directly from within the state, we plan to consummate sales at facilities in Oregon where the customer can pick up or have a common carrier pick up the vehicle.




Arcimoto is a registered dealer in Oregon and California, with Hawaii and Florida dealer applications nearly complete. Customers who are located in Arizona, Nevada, and Florida can purchase from Arcimoto by utilizing our existing Oregon dealership.



Rental Operations



Arcimoto’s approach to in-market experience relies on prospective customers renting Arcimoto vehicles. As such, we plan to open Company-owned sites in select locations and may additionally offer independent franchise rental operations in other locations.
State Tax Credits



The state of Oregon passed a tax credit qualifying Arcimoto vehicles for a $2,500 tax credit for individuals purchasing qualified electric vehicles and an additional $2,500 tax credit if the purchaser’s annual income is below a certain threshold. Additionally, the Arcimoto FUV qualifies for the California Clean Fuel Reward, offering a $1,500 rebate to California customers at point of sale.



We will continue to advocate that state legislatures and regulators include Arcimoto’s affordable, ultra-efficient vehicles in their clean vehicle incentive programs.





9







Federal Tax Credits



Arcimoto is part of a coalition of U.S. electric motorcycle manufacturers who are encouraging the federal government to expand the 10% electric motorcycle tax credit to include three-wheeled electric motorcycles as well.
Operator’s License and Helmet Requirements



State regulations regarding operator licensing and occupant helmet requirements are currently a nationwide patchwork with regard to three-wheeled vehicles. While the strong majority of states have some form of exemption from helmet and motorcycle license requirements for three-wheeled vehicles, the specific wording of each state’s statute may or may not include Arcimoto platform vehicles. For example, in our initial market states of California and Oregon, three wheeled vehicles that are “fully enclosed” or “enclosed cab” are exempt from helmet and motorcycle endorsement requirements. Washington’s helmet law, by contrast, requires compliance with rollover safety regulations and the presence of a steering wheel to exempt riders.



Arcimoto’s advocacy strategy is to work with state legislatures to advocate the normalization of these rules to reduce consumer confusion in the marketplace that comes from conflicting state-by-state regulations.



Pollution Control Costs



We are required to comply with stationary source air pollution, water pollution, and hazardous waste control standards that are now in effect or are scheduled to come into effect with respect to our manufacturing operations.
Intellectual Property



Patents



Our policy is to protect our competitive position by, among other methods, filing patent applications to protect technology and improvements that we consider important to the development of our business. We have generated a number of patents and expect this portfolio to continue to grow as we actively pursue additional technological innovation. As of December 31, 2021, we have 13 issued utility patents, including five patents covering novel aspects of the vehicle architecture expiring between 2031 and 2035, three patents covering vehicle battery systems expiring between 2035 and 2038, and two patents covering Arcimoto’s novel dual-motor gearbox design expiring between 2035 and 2037. At present, Arcimoto has an additional patent application undergoing examination that relates to the overall vehicle platform.



In addition to this intellectual property, we also rely on our proprietary knowledge and ongoing technological innovation to develop a competitive position in the market for our products. Each of these patents, patent applications, and know-how are integral to the conduct of our business, the loss of any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business.



Trademarks



Arcimoto, Inc. owns several trademarks including: “Arcimoto”, the winged “A” logo, “Fun Utility Vehicle”, “FUV”, “Deliverator”, and “Rapid Responder”. The Company has registered or applied for registration of these trademarks within the United States. The trademark “Arcimoto” has been registered in China.
