Our Strategy

Our strategy is centered on the vision of enabling smarter care at virtually every point of the healthcare continuum. Given the breadth of our portfolio and global client installed base, we believe we are well positioned to connect physicians and caregivers to patients and payers across all healthcare settings. Smarter care is a strategic imperative for healthcare organizations globally and requires a balance between managing costs while maintaining the highest quality of care. We believe that our solutions are well-positioned to facilitate such transformation in the future of healthcare by offering community connectivity, interoperability, data analytics, and consumer engagement features and functionality. These key strategic areas all help healthcare providers better manage populations of patients, especially those with costly chronic conditions, such as diabetes, asthma, and heart disease, to help bring down the cost of care and improve patient outcomes.

• | Community Connectivity – Our care coordination solutions improve safety and quality as a patient transitions from one care setting to another. We help build assessments, monitor results, track outcomes, and make modifications in a person’s care plan. Healthcare is a group effort, and having full visibility into a patient’s care plan is critical. Access to comprehensive patient information is key, and our community solutions help create an organized, longitudinal patient record spanning all points of care.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Interoperability – We employ a wide array of interoperability tools to support our clients’ desire to connect to numerous stakeholders in the industry, including other healthcare providers, labs, imaging facilities, public health entities and patients, as well as other third-party technology providers. Our unique open platform is a proven, scalable and user-friendly technology that connects both clinical and financial data across every setting. We also offer Application Programming Interfaces (“APIs”) based on the Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR). With this unique open platform, clients can connect to any certified application or device, which saves time and money and gives clients full access to a variety of innovative solutions.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Data Analytics – Healthcare organizations need to analyze dependencies, trends, and patterns so that they can develop business and clinical intelligence to better manage patient populations. Data-driven decisions require real-time, clean data for better decisions at the point of care. Insights and analytics serve as the foundation for informed analysis and effective planning.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Consumer Engagement – Our patient engagement software helps healthcare organizations achieve better outcomes, reduce emergency room visits, and decrease hospitalizations. Our software also integrates with solutions across an organization, regardless of a provider’s software. With a patient engagement platform, individuals and their families have the opportunity to become active members of their care team, which improves results.

Healthcare IT Industry
 The healthcare IT industry in which we operate is highly regulated and the services we provide are subject to a complex set of healthcare laws and regulations, among others, the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act (“MARCA”), the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (“HITECH”), the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”), regulations issued by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (“CMS”) and the Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”), a number of fraud and abuse laws, including the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and the False Claims Act, and the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (as amended, the “PPACA”).  In addition, the healthcare IT industry is subject to changing political, legislative, regulatory, and other industry standards, which create both significant opportunities as well as certain challenges.  These include: 

• | Provider Reimbursement: In recent years, there have been significant changes to provider payment models by the United States federal government to move more towards a value-based care model that have been followed by commercial payers and state governments. This leads to increasing pressure on healthcare organizations to reduce costs and increase quality, replacing fee-for-service models in part by expanding advanced payment models. Such changes to provider payments models could further encourage the adoption of healthcare IT as a means of improving quality of patient care through increased efficiency, care coordination, and improving access to complete medical documentation. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | The passage of MACRA in 2015 codified the creation of new payment models, such as ACOs, that will significantly expand the number of ambulatory healthcare professionals delivering care under payment programs that are driven by quality measures currently under development. Many of our clients are also involved with the Comprehensive Primary Care Plus program, which is working toward similar goals by emphasizing the role of the primary care provider. Another important driver of healthcare IT adoption in the primary care space is the Patient Centered Medical Home program, a voluntary program in which many of our clients are participating and that has a strong emphasis on quality measurement and patient engagement. Even where some of these programs will likely be adjusted in part by HHS under the new presidential Administration, significant levels of reimbursements will still require providers to capture, communicate, measure and share outcomes through technology solutions such as ours, given that those requirements are bound in federal statute.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | HITECH: In 2009, the United States federal government enacted HITECH, which authorized the EHR Incentive program (the “meaningful use” program). This law provided significant incentive funding by the Medicare and Medicaid programs to physicians and hospitals that can prove they have adopted and are appropriately using technology such as our EHR solutions. CMS establishes and oversees the criteria that healthcare providers must meet to receive HITECH stimulus funding, while the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (“ONC”) establishes and oversees the functionality that EHR products must meet. In order for our customers to qualify for funding under HITECH, our technology must meet various requirements for product certification under the regulations, and must enable our customers to achieve “Meaningful Use” as defined under CMS regulations. CMS regulations provide for a phase approach to implementation of the “Meaningful Use” standards. For each stage, a final rule is implemented by the ONC to adopt an initial set of standards, implementation specifications and certification criteria to enhance the use of health information technology and support its “Meaningful Use”. For providers to receive “Meaningful Use” incentive funds, they must use EHRs that are certified according to regulations put forth by the ONC. Currently, ONC recognizes a variety of Authorized Testing and Certification Bodies (“ATCBs”) eligible to test for and designate that EHRs are certified for “Meaningful Use” quality reporting. These ONC-ATCBs are the only organizations capable of designating that an EHR is certified for “Meaningful Use” incentive capture.

• | HIPAA: HIPAA and its implementing regulations contain substantial restrictions and requirements with respect to the use and disclosure of individuals’ protected health information. HIPAA applies to “Covered Entities,” such as certain healthcare providers, health plans, and health care clearinghouses, as well as business associates that performed functions on behalf of or provide services to Covered Entities. We consider ourselves a Covered Entity due to our acting as a “healthcare clearinghouse” through our provision of Allscripts Payerpath due to its filing of electronic healthcare claims on behalf of healthcare providers that are subject to HIPAA and HITECH. In addition, as a result of our dealings with certain clients and others in the healthcare industry, which may be considered Covered Entities under or otherwise subject to the requirements of HIPAA, we are, in some circumstances, considered a business associate under HIPAA. As a business associate, we are subject to the HIPAA requirements relating to the privacy and security of protected health information. Among other things, HIPAA requires business associates to (i) maintain physical, technical and administrative safeguards to prevent protected health information from misuse, (ii) report security incidents and other inappropriate uses or disclosures of the information, including to individuals and governmental authorities, and (iii) assist Covered Entities from which we obtain health information with certain of their duties under HIPAA. We have policies and safeguards in place intended to protect health information as required by HIPAA and have processes in place to assist us in complying with applicable laws and regulations regarding the protection of this data and responding to any security incidents.

transactions, including claims, remittance advices, and requests and responses for eligibility, which are called ANSI-5010. Additionally, HIPAA required entities to upgrade to the tenth revision of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems from the World Health Organization, also known as ICD-10, for use in reporting medical diagnoses and inpatient procedures by no later than October 1, 2015. These changes in coding standards required our clients to upgrade to more advanced versions of our solutions.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Federal Anti-Kickback Statute: The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits any person or entity from offering, paying, soliciting or receiving anything of value, directly or indirectly, for the referral of patients covered by Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs or the leasing, purchasing, ordering or arranging for or recommending the lease, purchase or order of any item, good, facility or services covered by these programs. Courts have interpreted the law to provide that a financial arrangement may violate this law if any one of the purposes of an arrangement is to encourage patient referrals or other federal healthcare program business, regardless of whether there are other legitimate purposes for the arrangement. There are several limited exclusions known as safe harbors that may protect some arrangements from enforcement penalties. Penalties for federal Anti-Kickback Statute violations can be severe, and include imprisonment, criminal fines, civil money penalties with triple damages (when the False Claims Act is implicated) and exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs. The PPACA broadened the reach of the fraud and abuse laws by, among other things, amending the intent requirement of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and the applicable criminal healthcare fraud statutes. Pursuant to the statutory amendment, a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. In addition, PPACA provides that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the civil False Claims Act or the civil monetary penalties statute. Many states have adopted laws similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, some of which apply to the referral of patients for healthcare items or services reimbursed by any source, not only the Medicare and Medicaid programs. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | False Claims Act: The federal False Claims Act prohibits anyone from, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, for payment to federal programs (including Medicare and Medicaid) claims for items or services that are false or fraudulent. Although we would not submit claims directly to payors, Allscripts could be held liable under the False Claims Act if they are deemed to “cause” the submission of false or fraudulent claims by, for example, providing inaccurate billing or coding information to customers through our revenue cycle/claims management services, or if our EHR products are found to have caused providers to have inaccurately attested to Meaningful Use criteria. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | PPACA: PPACA, which was signed into law in 2010, has impacted us and our clients. Since taking office, President Trump has continued to support the repeal of all or portions of the PPACA. As such, the PPACA may be repealed in part or in whole under the new presidential administration, but many components of the law, including those which have had a positive effect by requiring the expanded use of products such as ours to participate in certain federal programs, are expected to be included in any new legislation passed to replace it. Any provisions, such as those mandating reductions in reimbursement for certain types of providers or decreasing the number of covered lives in the United States or the depth of insurance coverage available to patients, may have a negative effect by reducing the resources available to our current and prospective clients to purchase our products. The repeal of, or any significant changes in, the incentive programs for Meaningful Use of EHRs could also reduce the resources or the incentive for customers to purchase our EHR products. Further, ambiguity remains for the industry as a whole regarding the future of many programs initially authorized by the PPACA, which may slow purchasing decisions as healthcare organizations wait for clarity. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We believe that these and other changes in laws and regulations, along with increasing pressure from private payers to move providers to quality-based payment programs and market opportunities to maximize the data that is increasingly being created and captured through the care process, will continue to drive adoption of healthcare IT products and services such as ours. For example, although many large physician groups have already purchased EHR technology, we expect those groups may choose to replace their older EHR technology to comply with future Quality Payment Program requirements and to add new features and functionality.  Further, opportunities for healthcare provider organizations to expand their care coordination efforts in order to successfully comply with new payment programs or to add software specific to the precision medicine expansion, as outlined in the 21st Century Cures Act passed in December 2016, could lead to additional demand for our solutions. We also seek replacement markets for health information exchanges and patient portals, despite their recent deployment.
 Business Organization
 We derive our revenues primarily from sales of our proprietary software (either as a direct license sale or under a subscription delivery model), which also serves as the basis for our recurring service contracts for software support and maintenance and certain transaction-related services. In addition, we provide various other client services, including installation, and managed services such as outsourcing, private cloud hosting and revenue cycle management.

During 2017, we completed the acquisitions of the EIS Business and NantHealth’s provider and patient engagement solutions business. These acquisitions initially resulted in the formation of four new operating segments: (i) EIS-Paragon, (ii) EIS-Enterprise Workflow Solutions (“EIS-EWS”), (iii) EIS-Classics and (iv) NantHealth. Refer to Note 2, “Business Combinations and Other Investments,” in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this Form 10-K for further information about these acquisitions. The EIS-Paragon operating segment provides integrated EHR and revenue cycle management solutions for the small hospital market segment and was integrated within our Hospitals and Health Systems operating segment during the fourth quarter of 2017. The EIS-EWS operating segment primarily provides document, content and supply chain management solutions. The EIS-Classics operating segment primarily provides revenue cycle management solutions. The NantHealth operating segment offers provider and patient engagement solutions. Based on the qualitative and quantitative criteria under Accounting Standards Codification Topic 280, Segment Reporting, we concluded that the EIS-Classics operating segments can be included as part of the Clinical and Financial reportable segment, while the EIS-EWS and NantHealth operating segments can be included as part of the Population Health reportable segment. As a result, as of December 31, 2017, we identified ten operating segments, which were aggregated into three reportable segments: (i) Clinical and Financial Solutions, (ii) Population Health and (iii) Netsmart.
 Information regarding financial data by segment is set forth in Part II, Item 7 of this Form 10-K, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and in Note 14, “Business Segments,” to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this Form 10-K. 
 Clients 
 As of December 31, 2017, approximately 75,000 physician practices, 3,400 hospitals and 100,000 coordinated community care organizations use our products and services. Our clients, which include some of the most prestigious medical groups and hospitals in the United States, often serve as reference sources for prospective clients that are interested in purchasing our solutions. No single client accounted for more than 10% of our revenue in the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015.
Research and Development
 Rapid innovation characterizes the healthcare IT industry. We believe our ability to compete successfully depends heavily on our ability to ensure a continual and timely flow of competitive products, services and technologies to the markets in which we operate. 
 Because of this, we continue to invest heavily into our research and development efforts. These efforts are primarily focused on developing new solutions as well as new features and enhancements to our existing solutions, which we believe will ensure that our solutions comply with continually evolving regulatory requirements and create additional opportunities to connect our systems to the healthcare community.
 Our total gross research and development spending was $359.1 million, $290.4 million and $234.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. These amounts consist of research and development expenses of $220.2 million, $187.9 million and $184.8 million, and capitalized software development costs of $138.9 million, $102.5 million and $49.3 million, for each of these periods respectively. We expense research and development expenses as incurred, and we capitalize software development costs incurred from the time technological feasibility of the software is established, or when the preliminary project phase is completed in the case of internal use software, until the software is available for general release. Non-capitalizable research and development costs and other software maintenance costs are expensed as incurred.

Competition
 The markets for our solutions and services are highly competitive, and are characterized by rapidly evolving technology and solution standards and user needs, as well as frequent introduction of new solutions and services. Some of our competitors may be more established, benefit from greater name recognition, and have substantially greater financial, technical, and marketing resources than we do. 
 Additionally, many of our prospective clients have invested substantial personnel and financial resources to implement and integrate competing solutions to ours. As a consequence, they may be reluctant or unwilling to migrate to our solutions. Third-party developers may be reluctant to build application services on our platform since they have invested in other competing technology platforms. 
 We compete primarily with numerous types of organizations, including developers of revenue cycle and practice management software and services, large system integrators, IT service providers, ambulatory and acute care EHR solutions, population health management and value-based care technologies, analytics systems, care management solutions and post-acute solutions. We generally compete on the basis of several factors, including breadth and depth of services (including our open architecture and the level of solution integration across care settings), integrated platform, regulatory compliance, reputation, reliability, accuracy, security, client service, total cost of ownership, innovation and industry acceptance, expertise and experience. 
 Moreover, we expect that competition will continue to increase as a result of consolidation in both the IT and healthcare industries. If one or more of our competitors or potential competitors were to merge or partner with another of our competitors, the change in the competitive landscape could adversely affect our ability to compete effectively.
 Our principal existing competitors in these markets include, but are not limited to (in alphabetical order) AdvancedMD, athenahealth Inc., Cerner Corporation, Change Healthcare, CPSI (Computer Programs and Systems Inc.), CureMD Healthcare, eClinicalWorks, Enli Health Intelligence, Epic Systems Corporation, Evolent Health, GE Healthcare, Greenway Medical Technologies, Harris Healthcare, Healthagen, Health Catalyst, Homecare Homebase (part of Hearst Health network), IBM Watson Health, IQVIA, Kareo, MEDHOST, Inc., Meditech (Medical Information Technology, Inc.), Navicure/Zirmed, NaviHealth (a Cardinal Health company), nThrive, Optum, Philips Wellcentive, Premier Inc., Quadramed, Quality Systems, Inc., Roper Industries, T-System, The TriZetto Group, Inc. (a division of Cognizant Technology Solutions, Inc.) and Wellsoft Corporation. 

Backlog
 We had a contract backlog of $4.6 billion and $4.1 billion as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, an increase of $500 million or 12%. Contract backlog represents the value of bookings and support and maintenance contracts that have not yet been recognized as revenue. Total contract backlog increased primarily due to an increase in bookings related to subscription-based agreements and managed services, such as outsourcing, private cloud hosting and revenue cycle management. We estimate that approximately 38% of our aggregate contract backlog as of December 31, 2017 will be recognized as revenue during 2018. 
Intellectual Property
 We rely on a combination of trademark, copyright, trade secret and patent laws in the United States and other jurisdictions, as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary technology and our brand. We also enter into confidentiality and proprietary rights agreements with our employees, consultants and other third parties and control access to software, documentation and other proprietary information. 
 Many of our products include intellectual property obtained from third parties. For example: 
  
• | Many of our products are built on technology provided by Microsoft Corporation, such as the Microsoft SQL Server information platform, the Microsoft .NET Framework and the Microsoft Azure cloud platform.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | We license content from companies such as OptumInsight, 3M Health Information Systems, Wolters Kluwer Health, Elsevier, IMO and Clinical Architecture, which we incorporate or use in certain solutions.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

It may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of our products and services. While we have generally been able to obtain licenses on commercially reasonable terms in the past, there is no guarantee that we can obtain such licenses in the future on reasonable terms or at all. Because of continuous healthcare IT innovation, current extensive patent coverage and the rapid rate of issuance of new patents, it is possible that certain components of our solutions may unknowingly infringe upon an existing patent or other intellectual property rights of others. Occasionally, we have been notified that we may be infringing certain patent or other intellectual property rights of third parties. While the outcome of any litigation or dispute is uncertain, we do not believe that the resolution any of these infringement notices will have a material adverse impact on our business.
 Geographic Information
 Historically, the majority of our clients and revenue have been associated with North America, where we have clients in the United States and Canada. While we remain focused on the North American market, which we expect will continue to drive our revenue in the future, we believe that there are opportunities for us globally as other countries face similar challenges of controlling healthcare costs while improving the quality and efficiency of healthcare delivery. As a result, we have increased our efforts to selectively expand the sales of many of our solutions outside of North America, primarily in the United Kingdom, the Middle East, Asia and Australia.
 During the year ended December 31, 2017, our domestic and international sales accounted for 97% and 3%, respectively, of our total revenue. Information regarding financial data by geographic segment is set forth in Note 16, “Geographic Information,” to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this Form 10-K. 
 Employees
 As of December 31, 2017, we had approximately 8,900 employees worldwide. None of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement or are represented by a labor union.  The increase over December 31, 2016 was due primarily to the acquisition of the EIS business.
