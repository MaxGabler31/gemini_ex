We are Aerospace Basic Quality System Standard (AS) 9100D certified, International Traffic in Arms (ITAR) registered, and have received approval of International Telecommunications Union (ITU) spectrum licensing for both X-Band and S-Band frequencies. We filed for X-band and S-band radio frequencies licensing in February 2021 and were granted approval through a published filing by the ITU on April 4, 2021. Our filing contains approved spectrum use for multiple X-Band and S-Band frequencies and five different orbital planes. Such licenses are held through Aurea Alas, Ltd., an Isle of Man company, a related party to Sidus Space. The ITU is the specialized agency responsible for principles and licensing of the use of orbit and spectrum. Before a satellite can use the spectrum and orbital resources it needs to fulfil its mission, it requires an associated ‘satellite filing’. The filing is a tool to obtain international recognition of these resources and it is a critical component to our offering, enabling users to demonstrate, test, and operate new technologies in space.

Corporate Sustainability
 
As we enter a period of time where the decisions we make regarding the environment become increasingly more important, it is imperative that we look towards solutions that are as eco-friendly as possible. The evolution of manufacturing has led us to the use of 3D printed materials. There are a myriad of benefits that come with this groundbreaking technology. Arguably, the most important is the reduced impact that it has on the environment. We believe our Lizzie Sat constellation will contribute to this reduced impact as a significant portion of our satellites are 3D printed. 
 
In addition, manufacturing parts with a 3D printer reduces overall energy waste and has a smaller carbon footprint compared to conventional machining. Additional benefits include the removal of waste and unnecessary energy that comes with conventional machining which often results in having more material scrapped during production of a part than the amount that makes up the part.. While these are the largest impacts, the effects can be seen even in smaller scales. Due to the massive reduction in weight 3D printing provides, less energy needs to be spent using cargo ships and commercial vehicles for transportation. With this reduction in weight also comes reduction in space required for material storage, reducing the need for large spaces and extra energy needed to maintain those facilities.
 
Looking toward the future, exciting developments may be incorporated including the use of more biodegradable and/or recycled materials that can be used to manufacture parts and further benefit the environment. Until these developments occur, we are doing our part through the practice of recycling approximately 5,000 lbs of metal a year as well as recycling any used oil and coolant. As technologies continue to advance, we remain dedicated to preserving the environment and continue to evolve with newer technologies as they develop.


Global Space Economy Overview
 
In recent years, the importance of the space economy has been growing as technological advances in both satellites and supporting terrestrial technologies have enabled new commercial use cases. These use cases include satellite broadband, remote imaging, Internet-of-Things (“IOT”)/Machine-to-Machine (“M2M”) communications, defense-related applications, as well as others. As a result, several new and existing operators have announced new satellite constellations to serve these use cases. Many of these announced constellations will consist of small LEO satellites rather than large GEO satellites. According to a October 2019 SpaceNews report, SpaceX alone has filed for up to 30,000, and Amazon and OneWeb have also announced plans to launch a significant number of satellites.
 
According to Morgan Stanley research, as reported in February 2021, the $350 billion global space industry could surge to over $1 trillion by 2040. In addition, Euroconsult expects that over the next decade, the total manufacturing and launch market value for small satellites is expected to reach $54.2 billion, more than three times the market value over 2011-2020. Although this indicates significant growth, it does not reflect the four-fold increase in the number of satellites resulting from the rise of cubesats, constellations and the introduction of low-cost systems for both manufacturing and launch, which will reduce average costs and market value.
 
Rapid growth in private investment in the commercial space industry has led to a wave of new companies reinventing major elements of the traditional space industry, including human spaceflight, satellites, and launch, in addition to unlocking entirely new market segments. Furthermore, government agencies have realized the value of the private commercial space industry and have become increasingly more supportive and reliant on private companies to catalyze innovation and advance national space objectives. In the United States, this has been evidenced by notable policy initiatives and by commercial contractors’ growing share of space activity.
 
Launch Market
 
We are witnessing a shift in the launch requirements of satellite operators, as the launch industry adjusts to the increasing volume of launches and the shift from larger satellites to small satellites. According to a study, conducted and published by the NASA Ames Research Center in 2016, in recent years, the satellite market has been undergoing a major evolution with new space companies replacing the traditional approach of deploying a few large, complex and costly satellites with a multitude of smaller, less complex and cheaper satellites. This new approach has created a sharp increase in the number of launched satellites and so the historic trends are no longer representative. Over the last 5 years, this increase has continued.
 
The launch industry’s initial response was the introduction of ridesharing, allowing multiple operators to share the cost of a large launch vehicle. This, combined with the emergence of new launch vehicles, reduced launch costs and increased access to space for small satellite operators. However, operators must wait until a particular rideshare is full for their launch. In addition, all small satellites on a single rideshare are delivered to a single orbital destination. From there, small satellites must either complete a time-consuming orbit raise to their desired orbit, requiring a significant on-board propulsion system or an in-space shuttle. While in-space shuttling reduces the need for satellite propulsion capability, shuttles add significant expense and take weeks or months to reach the desired orbit. The launch market will continue to evolve and we believe that many of these challenges related to desired orbit and timeline will be resolved and more options will be available to launch small satellites to meet the needs of the small satellite market.
 
Small Satellite Market
 
Another paradigm shift in the commercial space market is the rise of the small satellite market. Starting in 2018, the space industry began a dramatic transformation. Demand for large geosynchronous communications satellites dramatically declined as companies prepared to launch constellations consisting of hundreds or thousands of smaller, less expensive broadband satellites in low and medium Earth orbits. Euroconsult anticipates that approximately 13,910 satellites <500 kg will be launched in the next ten years, according to the 7th edition of its small satellite market report released in April 2021. This total represents a 38% increase over the 10,100 satellites that were expected in its previous edition.
 
Moreover, the rise of this market has also created a new market segment in nanosatellites and microsatellites, weighing less than 10 kg and between 10 and 100 kg, respectively. While these satellites can be deployed individually, they can also be operated as part of a constellation, a large group of satellites interconnected to provide a service, such as the Starlink satellite constellation’s offering of global internet connectivity. According to Euroconsult’s April 2021 small satellite market report, the next decade will be defined primarily by the rollout of multiple constellations, which will account for 84% of small satellites, mainly for commercial operators.

The number of small satellites launched has increased from 39 in 2011 to 1,202 in 2020. In just the period between 2019 to 2020 there has been over 300% growth going from 289 to 1202. According to a report published in 2021 by Bryce Space & Technology, 40% of all small satellites launched in last 10 years were launched in 2020.
 
The growth in the satellite constellations market is being driven by technological advances in ground equipment, new business models, expanded funding, and growing demand for high bandwidth and lower latency. Though this satellite constellation remains nascent in maturity, we anticipate considerable growth over the coming years in the launch industry as companies continue to seek versatile and low-cost ways to deliver single satellites to specific orbits, deploy their satellite constellations or solve their data needs through the use of existing space infrastructure. Furthermore, we anticipate the growth of the satellite constellations market to contribute business to our Satellite Services offerings. LEO satellite constellations have relatively short lifespans on orbit, resulting in a requirement to launch replenishment satellites every few years and therefore represents a recurring customer revenue stream.
 
According to Prospects for the Small Satellite Market – A Euroconsult Report 7th Edition April 2021, small satellites are often viewed by entrepreneurs as enablers of disruptive business models because of the growing data needs of the digital economy. Rapid, constant improvement of small satellites from one generation to the next means new capabilities and possibilities may constantly be developed. Further, investment in the space industry is still accelerating from 2020 and beyond. Vertically-integrated players attract the most funding because it is believed that in-house capabilities promote efficiencies, savings and flexibility. In the growing small satellite industry, with lower entry barriers and shorter timeframes, tangible investment opportunities in manufacturing are available. Between 2018 and 2020, start-ups involved in small satellite integration raised $1.4B (SpaceX excluded) while pure small satellite subsystems manufacturers, $0.2B. Among integrators, by far the most successful recipients of funding are vertically-integrated players who produce and operate their own constellation while directly providing service to the end user. Vertical integration becomes especially relevant when there is a recurring production need (e.g. limited lifetimes, need for cyclical replacements) and when economies of scale are possible. It can also be driven by the need to secure its supply chain and keeping key differentiators in house, or when no compatible supply is available.

Customer / Market Research
 
The need to provide commercial testing capabilities in space has been growing for many years and has become a requirement for many innovating companies. According to the Prospectus for the Small Satellite Market, 7th Edition released in April of 2021, Euroconsult anticipates that about 13,910 satellites <500 kg will be launched in the next ten years, according to the 7th edition of its small satellite market report. This total represents a 38% increase over the 10,100 satellites that were expected in its previous edition. The small satellite industry is gearing up for significant expansion in terms of capabilities and demand, with the number of satellites to be launched growing four-fold over 2021-2030, citing growth in manufacturing, launch and operations, and increasing government budgets for space. As the small satellite market grows, the requirement for rapid flight proven testing is becoming more crucial. Although ground-based testing is available, it does not provide a mirrored testing environment for spacecraft and subcomponent testing. We intend to address this need with our Sidus Constellation. Furthermore, customization of the Sidus Constellation with appropriate technology can provide subscription data and imagery services for customers whose needs prompt consideration for a separate constellation. Currently, our core market corresponds most directly with satellite manufacturing and offering LEO space-as-a-service solutions. However, we believe our addressable market can also continue to expand in similar and adjacent industries such as government and defense manufacturing. We have generated space-related manufacturing revenue since 2012, and we expect to generate revenue from our commercial constellation space offering in the first quarter of 2022 as we continue to finalize customers for LizzieSat-1 (LS-1). LS-1 is currently slated to launch in the fourth quarter of 2022 utilizing our SSIKLOPS platform aboard the ISS.

Sales and Marketing
 
We market our services to both government and commercial customers. Initially we are leveraging our existing relationships to help promote our expanded service offerings. We believe our executive management team has extensive reach in the space and satellite industry. Our Chief Sales and Revenue Officer focuses on new business sales, installed client base sales, marketing, and partner strategy.
 
Our marketing efforts focus on communicating the benefits of our solutions and educating our customers, the media and analysts about the advantages of our innovative technology. We strive to raise the awareness of our company, market our products and generate sales leads through industry events, public relations efforts, marketing materials, social media and our website. Attendance at key industry events is an important component of our marketing efforts. Our CEO, Carol Craig, has been invited to speak and participate in panel discussions at industry events and will continue to take advantage of these opportunities to spread awareness of our services. We believe a combination of these efforts strengthens our brand and may enhance our market position in our industry.
 
Competition
 
The small satellite services industry at-large is highly competitive but has significant barriers to entry, including the cost and difficulty associated with successfully developing, building, and launching a satellite constellation and obtaining various governmental and regulatory approvals. In addition to cost, there is a significant amount of lead time associated with obtaining the required licenses, building, and launching the satellite constellation, and developing and deploying the ground station technology. We currently face substantial general competition from other service providers that offer a range of space-based data collection options. There are also several competitors working to develop innovative solutions to compete in this industry.
Our Intellectual Property
 
We continually invest in innovative solutions and as of December 31, 2021 have 12 space related patents approved or pending, which ownership was transferred to us by our majority shareholder, Craig Technologies, at no charge. Our patented technologies include a print head for regolith-polymer mixture and associated feedstock for which a notice of allowance was received by us in October 2021; a heat transfer system for regolith which patent expires in June 2039; a method for establishing a wastewater bioreactor environment which patent expires in July 2039; vertical takeoff and landing pad and interlocking pavers to construct same which patent expires in April 2039; and high-load vacuum chamber motion feedthrough systems and methods which patent expires in May 2039.
 
We seek to establish and maintain our proprietary rights in our technology and products through a combination of patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets and contractual rights. We also seek to maintain our trade secrets and confidential information through nondisclosure policies, the use of appropriate confidentiality agreements and other security measures. We have registered a number of patents and trademarks in the United States and in other countries and have a number of patent filings pending determination. There can be no assurance, however, that these rights can be successfully enforced against competitive products in any particular jurisdiction. Although we believe the protection afforded by our patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets and contracts has value, the rapidly changing technology in the satellite and wireless communications industries and uncertainties in the legal process make our future success dependent primarily on the innovative skills, technological expertise and management abilities of our employees rather than on the protections afforded by patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws and contractual rights.
 
Certain of our products include software or other intellectual property licensed from third parties. While it may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of our products, we believe, based upon past experience and standard industry practice, that such licenses generally could be obtained on commercially reasonable terms. Nonetheless, there can be no assurance that the necessary licenses would be available on acceptable terms, if at all.
 
The industry in which we compete is characterized by rapidly changing technology, a large number of patents, and frequent claims and related litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights. We cannot assure that our patents and other proprietary rights will not be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, that others will not assert intellectual property rights to technologies that are relevant, or that our rights will give us a competitive advantage. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries may not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States.

The commercial space industry is driven by rapidly changing technologies and innovation, and our success will require significant expenditure in Research and Development to develop new technologies, services, products, and offerings. Thus far, we have not established a Research and Development department, nor have we incurred research and development expenses. We do not currently perform formal R&D and instead we engineer our solutions with additional enhancements and innovations as part of our normal design and engineering efforts. We intend on setting up a formal Research and Development team in the future so we can more easily streamline our new products and get to market faster. If we fail to raise adequate funds to develop a robust Research and Development department and strategy, we will likely be unable to execute on our business plan.
 
Regulatory
 
Our business is subject to extensive rules, regulations, statutes, orders and policies imposed by the government in the United States and in foreign jurisdictions.
 
International Telecommunications Union (ITU)
 
We are required to comply with the laws and regulations of, and often obtain approvals from, national and local authorities in connection with our services. As we expand service to additional countries and regions, we will become subject to additional governmental approvals and regulations. We will provide a number of services that rely on the use of radio-frequency spectrum, and the provision of such services is highly regulated. Satellites are to be operated in a manner consistent with the regulations and procedures of the International Telecommunication Union (“ITU”), a specialized agency of the United Nations, which require the coordination of the operation of satellite systems in certain circumstances, and more generally are intended to avoid the occurrence of harmful interference among different users of the radio spectrum.
 
We have received approval of International Telecommunications Union (ITU) spectrum licensing for both X-Band and S-Band frequencies. We filed for X-Band and S-Band Radio Frequencies licensing in February 2021 and were granted approval through a published filing by the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) on April 4, 2021. The ITU is the specialized agency responsible for principles and licensing of the use of orbit and spectrum. Before a satellite can use the spectrum and orbital resources it needs to fulfil its mission, it requires an associated ‘satellite filing’. The filing is a tool to obtain international recognition of these resources.
 
International Traffic in Arms Regulations (“ITAR”) and Export Compliance and Controls
 
Our business is subject to, and we must comply with, stringent U.S. import and export control laws, including the ITAR process which has been developed under the jurisdiction of the Department of State and is administered by the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls (DDTC) and Export Administration Regulations (“EAR”) of the Bureau of Industry and Security of the U.S. Department of Commerce. ITAR generally restricts the export of hardware, software, technical data, and services that have defense or strategic applications. The EAR similarly regulates the export of hardware, software, and technology that has commercial or “dual-use” applications (i.e., for both military and commercial applications) or that have less sensitive military or space-related applications that are not subject to ITAR. The regulations exist to advance the national security and foreign policy interests of the U.S.
 
The U.S. government agencies responsible for administering the ITAR and the EAR have significant discretion in the interpretation and enforcement of these regulations. The agencies also have significant discretion in approving, denying, or conditioning authorizations to engage in controlled activities. Such decisions are influenced by the U.S. government’s commitments to multilateral export control regimes, particularly the Missile Technology Control Regime concerning the spaceflight business.
 
Many different types of internal controls and measures are required to ensure compliance with such export control rules. In particular, we are required to maintain registration under ITAR; determine the proper licensing jurisdiction and classification of products, software, and technology; and obtain licenses or other forms of U.S. government authorizations to engage in activities, including the performance by foreign persons, related to and who support our spaceflight business. Under ITAR, we must receive permission from the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls to release controlled technology to foreign person employees and other foreign persons.

Employees/Human Capital
 
As of December 31, 2021, we had 37 employees, all of whom are full-time. We are not party to any collective bargaining agreements. Our workforce is concentrated in the “Florida Space Coast,” however we are accustomed to working as a cohesive team with remote workers which should be beneficial as we expand and add employees in different geographical areas nationwide and worldwide. Our management team is comprised of our CEO and four (4) of her direct reports who, collectively, have management responsibility for our business. Our management team places significant focus and attention on matters concerning our human capital assets, particularly our diversity, capability development, and succession planning. Accordingly, we regularly review employee development and succession plans for each of our functions to identify and develop our pipeline of talent.
