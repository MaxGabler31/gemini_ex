FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

Unless the context indicates otherwise, as used in this Annual Report, the terms OLB, we, us, our, our company and our business refer, to The OLB Group, Inc., including its subsidiaries named herein. Certain statements, other than purely historical information, including estimates, projections, statements relating to our business plans, objectives, and expected operating results, and the assumptions upon which those statements are based, are forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements generally are identified by the words believes, project, expects, anticipates, estimates, intends, strategy, plan, may, will, would, will be, will continue, will likely result, and similar expressions. Forward-looking statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties which may cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. Our ability to predict results or the actual effect of future plans or strategies is inherently uncertain. Factors which could have a material adverse effect on our operations and future prospects include, but are not limited to: changes in economic conditions, legislative/regulatory changes, availability of capital, interest rates, competition, and generally accepted accounting principles. These risks and uncertainties should also be considered in evaluating forward-looking statements and undue reliance should not be placed on such statements.
Overview of Operations
 
We are a Data Centric company with business activities focused three main areas: 

ZEUUS Data Centers
 ZEUUS Energy
 ZEUUS Cyber Security

All four divisions work synergistically with each other in an synergetic ecosystem which enables growth and business protection. These technologies and divisions all stem from the massive requirements in our Data Centers.

While we are currently negotiating for the purchase of three data centers, the recent acquisition by our ZEUUS Energy division of a unique, and scalable Wind Turbine technology has us very excited. We have recently opened a 500 sqm, brand new research and development facility in Montenegro where the final designs for the Wind Turbines are being tested and refined. We expect full commercial production of the Wind Turbines by the end of 3rd Quarter 2022.

We are also in negotiations for the acquisition of two cyber security companies and will update the market after we enter into definitive acquisition agreements.

Our mandate and focus are to harness the Cloud and provide all aspects of Data Services from protection to facilitation, to storage, to the sustainable energy consumption at all our Data Center locations.
