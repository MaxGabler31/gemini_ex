Item 1. Business 
Our Company
 
SPAR Group, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“SGRP”), and its subsidiaries (together with SGRP, “SPAR Group” or the “Company”), is a leading global merchandising and brand marketing services company, providing a broad range of sales enhancing services to retailers across most classes of trade and consumer goods manufacturers and distributors around the world.  Our goal is to be the most creative, energizing and effective global services company that drives sales, margins and operating efficiency for our clients. 
 
As of the end of 2021, we operated in 9 countries including the United States, Canada, Mexico, Brazil, South Africa, Australia, China, Japan and India.  Across all of these countries, we successfully execute programs through our multi-lingual logistics, reporting and communication technology, which provides clients value through real-time insight on store / product conditions.
 
With more than 50 years of experience, an average of 25,000 merchandising specialists’ network around the world working more than 11 million hours in store per year, we continue to grow our long-term relationships with some of the world’s leading businesses.  Our unique combination of resource scale, deep expertise, advanced technology and unwavering commitment to excellence, separates us from the competition. 
 
Our focus is services. Our team works closely with clients to determine their key objectives to execute globally, focusing on enhancing their sales and profit.  At retail, our merchandising brand marketing specialists perform a wide range of programs to maximize product sell-through to consumers.  Some of these programs include launching new products, installing displays, assembling product fixtures, and ensuring shelves are fully stocked and reordering when they are not.  We also assist with sales and customer service.  As retailers adapt to changes and new opportunities, our team engages in the total renovations and updating of stores, as well as preparing new locations for grand openings.  Our distribution associates work in retail and consumer goods distribution centers to prepare the centers to open, testing systems, putting away, picking product and providing peak staffing services for our clients.
 
We provide the “last two feet” of retail and consumer goods product merchandising and marketing. Our clients make great products. We ensure these products are presented in a compelling and exciting way exactly when and where they need to be to drive sales and margin.  Our technology adds to these services by providing clients with detailed insight across all aspects of individual stores.
 
Our commitment to excellence comes from our people and organizational culture. We are passionate about talent and building a culture of ideas and innovation. We know that attracting, supporting and encouraging our people to do great things for clients results in excellent work. This great work begets more work and creates an energy and enthusiasm for our people and the Company as a partner. We are proud of our people and their dedication to clients and our company success. 
 
We are also a results-driven organization that holds itself to a high standard of execution. We believe that our ability to meet or exceed our commitments to clients and the marketplace are part of how we define success. This is true if we are growing our core business, innovating with technology or testing new services. We aspire to be exceptional.
 
Our Industry
 
The merchandising and marketing outsourced services industry plays an important role in the growth and performance of some of the world’s most successful product and retail companies. Merchandising services includes placing orders, retail shelf maintenance, merchandising display setup, reconfiguring products on store shelves and replenishing product inventory. Additional marketing services include, but are not limited to, new store sets and remodels, audits, sales assistance, installation and assembly, product demos/sampling, promotion and more. The Company believes that merchandising and marketing services add value to retailers, manufacturers and other businesses by making a product more visible and more available to consumers.
 
Historically, retailers staffed their stores to ensure the store was well merchandised and product was properly featured and placed. However, in an effort to control costs and improve margins, most retailers have reduced store payroll and increased their reliance on manufacturers to set up their own products and merchandise the shelves on behalf of the retailer. To begin, manufacturers utilized their own sales representatives to do this work. Over time, this resulted in competing manufacturer representatives working in the same stores. This often led to the best presentation of merchandise resulting from the last manufacturer representative physically in the store. As a result, retailers began looking for third parties who could manage the merchandising process and ensure that the store, in total, was ready for the consumer. The result was the growth of the merchandising and marketing services industry. 
 
We believe this industry will continue to grow and is more important today than ever before. With the acceleration of digital and online retailing, the pressure on the physical store to remain relevant, efficient and compelling has never been higher. In addition, product manufacturers are constantly trying to grab the consumer’s attention and make sure they are everywhere the consumer wants to shop. These are exactly the issues merchandising and marketing services companies solve. 
 
Merchandising and marketing services companies work to ensure the store is exceptionally merchandised and products thoughtfully featured while enabling the retailer to maintain margins and leverage payroll. As the industry evolves, these services will continue to be a significant part of retailer and manufacturer success.
 
SPAR Group’s role in this industry is as one of the leading providers of these services to companies across the globe. With more than 50 years of history, the Company has established itself as a strategic partner to many of the world’s most exciting product manufacturers and retailers. 
 
Our Growth Strategy
 
As the need for flexibility and efficiency in merchandising and marketing services continues to increase, both in the United States and internationally, brand owners, consumer goods companies, manufacturers and retailers will continue to rely on third-party providers for these services. SPAR is uniquely able to meet these needs because of our global reach, more than 50-year track record, access to over 25,000 merchandisers, breadth of capability, unwavering focus on excellence and deep expertise. We combine great people, an understanding of what is needed and unique technologies, enabling us to offer enhanced service in-country and across geographies.
 
To capitalize on the growing demand, the Company’s business strategy is focused on four (4) priorities: 1) Grow the Core Business; 2) Introduce or Acquire New Services; 3) Invest in Technology; and 4) Expand Globally. The result of this strategic framework will be top-line growth, expanded margins, more value for clients and higher levels of free cash flow to allow us to invest for more growth.
 
Grow the Core Business
 
The Company is constantly pursuing new core business services while working to earn more business from current clients. We have a significant number of long-tenured clients that we invest resources in people, technology and time to ensure we understand their business, and are well-positioned to meet their needs in the future. This includes expanding the services we offer to existing clients. At the same time, we pursue and solicit requests for proposals (“RFPs”), we actively market our services, we participate in industry events and we continuously look for opportunities to grow our business. We believe our history, relationships, expertise, technology and scale are all competitive advantages for us. 
Introduce or Acquire New Services 
 
The Company believes in testing new ideas and services to increase revenues and expand client relationships. The changing retail landscape and need for enhanced digital, e-commerce and fulfillment capability shapes our thinking. Our objective is to identify and introduce new or complimentary capabilities that we believe the market and our clients need now and in the future. To accomplish this, we pursue partnerships, look for acquisitions and explore ideas based on market trends and our own unique client experiences. Our market positioning provides us with an unparalleled window to changes and opportunities in the markets we serve. We carefully measure the results of these tests and look for new services that can have a material impact on our financial and operational performance. 
Invest in Technology
 
We believe our current SPARView technology provides us a competitive advantage in the marketplace and is a core competitive strength. Our technology enables us to communicate, plan, track, analyze and optimize our merchandising and marketing services work. However, we recognize that technology and our opportunity to leverage technology continues to change. As a result, we are constantly adapting and innovating. We explore relationships within and across geographies with solution providers while making investments in our own solutions, with a focus to provide clients with better results, through broader capability. This will facilitate our ability to offer higher value services over time. Our objective is to provide technology to field merchandisers, our client partners and our management to make smarter decisions that yield better Company results.
Expand Globally 
 
The Company operates in 9 countries. This provides us the unique ability to offer our services across borders and geographies to drive incremental revenue and operating efficiencies. We have many global clients that we work with in multiple countries based on the results we deliver and value we create. We believe our ability to offer multi-country agreements is a unique differentiator for us in the marketplace and we will continue to capitalize on this to grow our business.
 
At the same time, we are continuously exploring ways to expand our current international businesses. As retail channels continue to consolidate around the globe, we look for unique, compelling financial opportunities to acquire, partner or organically grow into new segments, verticals and geographies. At the heart of this strategy is building upon our strength today and the leadership we have developed in country, regionally and around the world. 
 
Our Domestic and International Business
 
The Company has two (2) divisions: Domestic and International. The Domestic division is comprised of all operations within the United States. The International division is a consolidation of all other operations and joint ventures. 
 
The Company’s business is distributed across 9 countries and 5 continents. The Domestic business is led and operated from our global headquarters in Auburn Hills, Michigan. The International business is led from our global headquarters, but then has regional leadership and offices in the respective countries. 
 
Our approach to the international marketplace has historically been to establish joint ventures. We believe this approach enables us to bring the breadth of our global capabilities and tools while capitalizing on the strength and importance of local executive leadership and resources.
 
We continue to be excited about our international growth opportunities and the performance of our individual businesses.
 
The following table provides details of the structure of our Domestic and International businesses:

Our Labor Force 
 
Worldwide, the Company utilized a labor force up to approximately 25,000 people depending on seasonality in 2021, including the services of Field Specialists and Field Administrators provided by independent third parties.
 
The Company executes and administers its Domestic field services through the services of field merchandising, auditing, assembly and other field personnel (each a "Field Specialist"), substantially all of whom are provided to the Company and engaged by independent third parties and located, scheduled, deployed and administered domestically through the services of local, regional, district and other personnel (each a "Field Administrator"), and substantially all of the Field Administrators are in turn employed by other independent third parties.
 
As of December 31, 2021, the Company's Domestic Division's labor force totaled approximately 5,000 including the services of Field Specialists and Field Administrators furnished by independent third parties.

The Company considers its relations with its own employees and independent vendors to be generally good.
 
Our Competition
 
The marketing services industry is highly competitive. The Company's competition in the Domestic and International markets arises from a number of large enterprises. The Company also competes with a large number of relatively small enterprises with specific client, channel or geographic coverage, as well as with the internal marketing and merchandising operations of its existing and prospective clients. The Company believes that the principal competitive factors within its industry include breadth and quality of client services, cost, development and deployment of technology, the ability to execute specific client priorities rapidly and consistently over a wide geographic area and the ability to ideate and operate as a business partner delivering value above the base services. The Company believes that its current structure favorably addresses these factors and establishes it as a leader in many retailer and manufacturer verticals. The Company also believes it has the ability to execute major national and international initiatives and develop and administer national and international manufacturer programs.
