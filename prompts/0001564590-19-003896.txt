ITEM 1. | BUSINESS
--------+---------

 Capstead Mortgage Corporation operates as a self-managed real estate investment trust for federal income tax purposes (a “REIT”) and is based in Dallas, Texas.  Unless the context otherwise indicates, Capstead Mortgage Corporation, together with its subsidiaries, is referred to as “Capstead” or the “Company.”  Capstead was incorporated in the state of Maryland in 1985 and its common and preferred stocks are listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbols “CMO” and “CMOPRE,” respectively.
 Capstead’s investment strategy involves managing a leveraged portfolio of residential mortgage pass-through securities consisting of relatively short-duration adjustable-rate mortgage (“ARM”) securities issued and guaranteed by government-sponsored enterprises, either Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac, or by an agency of the federal government, Ginnie Mae.  These guaranteed residential mortgage pass-through securities are referred to as “Agency Securities,” and are considered to have limited, if any, credit risk.  This strategy differentiates Capstead from its peers because ARM loans underlying its investment portfolio can reset to more current interest rates within a relatively short period of time.  This positions the Company to benefit from a potential recovery in financing spreads that typically contract during periods of rising interest rates and can result in smaller fluctuations in portfolio values compared to portfolios containing a significant amount of longer-duration ARM and fixed-rate mortgage securities.  Duration is a common measure of market price sensitivity to interest rate movements.  A shorter duration generally indicates less interest rate risk.
 For further discussion of the Company’s business and financial condition, see Item 7 of this report, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” which is incorporated herein by reference.
 Competition
 As a residential mortgage REIT that focuses on investing in ARM Agency Securities, Capstead competes for the acquisition of suitable investments with other mortgage REITs, commercial banks, insurance companies, and institutional investors such as private equity funds, mutual funds, pension funds and sovereign wealth funds.  Many of these entities have lower yield requirements as well as greater financial resources and access to capital than the Company.  Increased competition for the acquisition of ARM Agency Securities can result in higher pricing levels for such assets.  In addition, the availability of ARM Agency Securities for purchase in the secondary markets varies substantially with changes in market conditions and ARM origination levels, which have not kept pace with related runoff in recent years.  Although higher pricing levels generally correspond to a higher book value per common share for the Company, higher prices paid for acquisitions can adversely affect portfolio yields and future profitability.
Regulation and Related Matters
 Operating as an internally-managed REIT investing in Agency Securities subjects Capstead to various federal tax and regulatory requirements.  For further discussion, see Item 1A of this report, “Risk Factors,” under the captions “Risks Related to Capstead’s Status as a REIT and Other Tax Matters” and “Risk Factors Related to Capstead’s Corporate Structure,” which is incorporated herein by reference.
Employees
 As of December 31, 2018, Capstead had 15 employees.
