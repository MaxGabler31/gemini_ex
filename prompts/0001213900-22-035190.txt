Products

Our primary product offering is jackets, and in the fiscal years ended March 31, 2022 and 2021, approximately 35% and 25%, respectively, of our total shipped pieces were jackets.



In response to high demand for PPE due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we started manufacturing PPE in 2020. Our PPE product offering consists of branded (washable) and disposable face masks, medical scrubs, protective coveralls, and surgical gowns. In order to advance our PPE market development efforts, we incorporated a new entity, Jerash The First, which received temporary permission from Jordan’s Food and Drug Administration to manufacture and export non-surgical PPE. Our production facility for PPE needs to meet certain structural requirements before we can receive a permanent permission and we are still planning the production facility. In September, 2020, we successfully registered as a medical device manufacturing facility with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the sale and export of our PPE products to the United States. We also received an ISO 13485 designation covering the manufacturing, packing, and selling of medical supplies. PPE had minimal contribution to our total revenue in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2022.

Manufacturing and Production



Our production facilities are located in Al Tajamouat Industrial City and in Al-Hasa County in the Tafilah Governorate of Jordan.



Our production facilities in Al Tajamouat Industrial City comprise five factories and four warehouses. Effective as of January 1, 2019, the government of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan converted Al Tajamouat Industrial City into a Development Zone. Following this change, we continued to operate under benefits similar to the Qualifying Industrial Zone designation, but were subject to a 10% corporation income tax plus a 1% social contribution. Starting from January 1, 2020, the corporation income tax increased to 14% plus 1% social contribution. On January 1, 2021, the corporation income tax increased to 16%. Effective January 1, 2022, we have been subject to an 18% or 20% corporate income tax plus a 1% social contribution. Currently, the first factory, which we own, employs approximately 1,500 people. Its primary functions are to house our management offices, as well as production lines, trims warehouse, and printing, sewing, ironing, and packaging units. The second factory, which we lease, employs approximately 1,500 people. Its primary function is to house our administrative and human resources personnel, merchandising and accounting departments, embroidery, printing, additional production lines, trims and finished products warehouses, and sewing, ironing, packing and quality control units. The third factory, which we lease, employs approximately 200 people. Its primary functions are to perform the cutting for our products. The fourth factory (under Paramount), which we lease, currently employs approximately 1,200 people. Its primary functions are to house additional production lines. The fifth factory (under MK Garments) currently employs approximately 700 people. Its primary function is to manufacture garments for orders from customers. On July 14, 2021, we executed a sale and purchase contract to acquire the land and building of the fifth factory, the closing of which deal has been postponed due to personal reasons of the seller in relation to health and quarantine requirements. We currently expect to complete this acquisition by the second quarter of fiscal 2023.



Our production facility in Al-Hasa County in the Tafilah Governorate of Jordan comprises a factory, which currently employs approximately 400 people and its primary functions are to manufacture garment products per customer orders. We commenced the construction of this factory in 2018 and we started operations in November 2019. This is a joint project with the Jordanian Ministry of Labor and the Jordanian Education and Training Department. According to our agreement with these government agencies, we will be using this factory without paying rent until December 2022, after which we anticipate entering into a lease agreement for the factory with the Jordanian Ministry of Labor for market rent. See “Item 2. Properties” below for more information regarding this factory.

In 2015, we commenced a project to build a 4,800 square-foot workshop in the Tafilah Governorate of Jordan, which was previously intended to be used as a sewing workshop for Jerash Garments, but which we now use as a dormitory to house management and supervisory staff who work at the factory in Al-Hasa County. Construction was temporarily suspended in March 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic and was subsequently completed and ready for use as of September 30, 2021.



In April 2021, we commenced a construction on a 189,000 square-foot housing facility for our multi-national workforce, situated on a 49,000 square-foot site owned by us, in Al Tajamouat Industrial City. We anticipate the completion and occupancy of the new building in August 2022. To meet increasing demand, we are also completing plans to construct an additional project on a nearby separate 133,000 square-foot parcel that we purchased in 2019 for $1.2 million, with 2/3 of the land allocated for our seventh factory and 1/3 for housing. We are closely monitoring market conditions and customer demands to optimize the construction plan.



Total annual capacity at our existing facilities was approximately 14 million pieces (average for product categories including t-shirts, polo shirts, pants, shorts, and jackets, and excluding PPE) as of March 31, 2022. Our production flow begins in the cutting department of our factory. Then the product is sent to the embroidery department for embroidery if applicable. From there, the product moves to be processed by the sewing unit, finishing department, quality control, and finally the ironing and packing units.



We do not have long-term supply contracts or arrangements with our suppliers. Most of our ultimate suppliers for raw materials, such as fabric, zippers, and labels, are designated by customers and we purchase such materials on a purchase order basis.



Employees



As of March 31, 2022, we had an aggregate of approximately 5,600 employees located in Jordan, Hong Kong, the People’s Republic of China, and the United States of America, all of which are full-time employees.

----+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




In fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021, we depended on a few key customers for our sales, and most of our sales in fiscal 2022 and 2021 were to one customer, VF Corporation.

We started producing garments for VF Corporation in 2012. Most of the products we manufacture are sold under The North Face Brand which is owned by VF Corporation. Currently, we manufacture primarily outerwear for The North Face. Approximately 67% and 62% of our sales in fiscal 2022 and 2021 were derived from the sale of manufactured products to VF Corporation, respectively. We are not party to any long-term contracts with VF Corporation or our other customers, and our sales arrangements with our customers do not have minimum purchase requirements. As is common in our industry, VF Corporation and our other customers place purchase orders with us after we complete detailed sample development and approval processes that we and our customers have agreed upon for their purchase of the relevant manufactured garments. It is through the sample development and approval processes that we and VF Corporation and our other customers agree on the purchase and manufacture of the garments. For fiscal 2022, VF Corporate issued approximately 9,500 purchase orders to us in amounts ranging from approximately $5 to $684,000. For fiscal 2021, VF Corporation issued approximately 5,400 purchase orders to us in amounts ranging from approximately $8 to $596,000.



Our customers are in the retail industry, which is subject to substantial cyclical variations. Consequently, there can be no assurance that sales to current customers will continue at the current rate or at all. In addition, our annual and quarterly results may vary, which may cause our profits and the market price of our common stock to decline.



We continue to seek to expand and strengthen our relationship with our current customers and other brand names. However, we cannot assure you that these brands will continue to buy our products in the same volumes or on the same terms as they did in the past or that we will be successful in expanding our relationship with other brand names.



Competition



The markets for the manufacturing of sportswear and outerwear are highly competitive. The competition in those markets is focused primarily on the price and quality of the product and the level of customer service. Our products compete with products of other apparel manufacturers in Asia, Israel, Europe, the United States, and South and Central America.



Competition with other manufacturers in the clothing industry focuses on reducing production costs, reducing supply lead time, design, product quality, and efficiency of supply to the customer. Since production costs depend to a large extent on labor costs, in recent years most production in the industry has been moved to countries where labor costs are low. Some of our competitors have lower cost bases, longer operating histories, larger customer bases, and other advantages over us which allow them to compete with us. As described in more detail under “—Conditions in Jordan” below, we are able to sell our products manufactured at our facilities in Jordan to the United States free from customs duties and import quotas under certain conditions. These favorable terms enable us to remain competitive on the basis of price. According to the Association Agreement between the European Union (the “EU”) and Jordan, which came into force in May 2002, and the joint initiative on rules of origin reviewed and improved in December 2018 by the EU and Jordan, goods manufactured by us in Jordan that are subsequently shipped to EU countries are shipped free from customs duties.



Conditions in Jordan



Our manufacturing facilities are located in Jordan. Accordingly, we are directly affected by political, security, and economic conditions in Jordan.



From time to time Jordan has experienced instances of civil unrest, terrorism, and hostilities among neighboring countries, including Syria and Israel. A peace agreement between Israel and Jordan was signed in 1994. Terrorist attacks, military activity, rioting, or civil or political unrest in the future could influence the Jordanian economy and our operations by disrupting operations and communications and making travel within Jordan more difficult and less desirable. Political or social tensions also could create a greater perception that investments in companies with Jordanian operations involve a high degree of risk, which could adversely affect the market and price for our common stock.



Jordan is a constitutional monarchy, but the King holds wide executive and legislative powers. The ruling family has taken initiatives that support the economic growth of the country. However, there is no assurance that such initiatives will be successful or will continue. The rate of economic liberalization could change, and specific laws and policies affecting manufacturing companies, foreign investments, currency exchange rates, and other matters affecting investments in Jordan could change as well.

In December 2019, COVID-19 was first identified in Wuhan, China. Less than four months later, on March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic—the first pandemic caused by a coronavirus. On March 17, 2020, Jordan announced a shutdown of non-essential activities as part of its proactive national efforts to limit the spread of COVID-19 and we suspended the operations of our facilities in Jordan as a result on March 18, 2020. On April 4, 2020, we resumed operations of our main production facilities in Al Tajamount Industrial City under the condition that only migrant workers, living in dormitories in Al Tajamouat Industrial City, are allowed to go to work in our factories under strict hygienic precautionary measures pursuant to an approval from the Jordanian Government dated April 1, 2020. Our Al-Hasa factory was also allowed to restart operation on April 26, 2020. Eventually, local employees were allowed to resume work on June 1, 2020. In fiscal 2022, our production facilities resumed full operation with additional medical and hygienic measures.



Trade Agreements



Because of the United States-Jordan Free Trade Agreement, which came into force on December 17, 2001, and was implemented fully on January 1, 2010, and the Association Agreement between the EU and Jordan, which came into force in May 2002, we are able to sell our products manufactured at our facilities in Jordan to the U.S. free from customs duties and import quotas under certain conditions and to EU countries free from customs duties.
Income Tax Incentives



Effective January 1, 2019, Jordan’s government converted the geographical area where Jerash Garments and its subsidiaries are located from a Free Zone to a Development Zone. Development Zones are industrial parks that house manufacturing operations in Jordan. In accordance with applicable law, Jerash Garments and its subsidiaries began paying corporate income tax in Jordan at a rate of 10% plus 1% social contribution. Starting from January 1, 2020, the corporate income tax rate in Jordan increased to 14% plus 1% social contribution. Effective January 1, 2021, this rate increased to 16% plus 1% social contribution. On January 1, 2022, this rate further increased to 18% or 20% plus 1% social contribution. For more information, see “Note 2—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies—Income and Sales Taxes.”



In addition, Jerash Garments and its subsidiaries are subject to local sales tax of 16%. However, Jerash Garments was granted a sales tax exemption from the Jordanian Investment Commission for the period June 1, 2015 to June 1, 2018 that allowed Jerash Garments to make purchases with no sales tax charge. This exemption was extended to February 5, 2023.



Government Regulation



Our manufacturing and other facilities in Jordan and our subsidiaries outside of Jordan are subject to various local regulations relating to the maintenance of safe working conditions and manufacturing practices. Management believes that we are currently in compliance in all material respects with all such regulations. We are not subject to governmental approval of our products or manufacturing process.
