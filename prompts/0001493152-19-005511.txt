General Overview
 
The Coffeesmiths Collective, Inc., formerly known as DOCASA, Inc. (hereinafter, the “Company,” “we,” “us,” “our,” or “Coffeesmiths Collective”) was incorporated in the State of Nevada on July 22, 2014, under the name of FWF Holdings, Inc. The Company changed its name on August 4, 2016. On August 4, 2016, the Company filed to change its fiscal year end from July 31 to August 31. On October 29, 2018, the majority of the shareholders of the Company approved the amendment to the Articles of Incorporation to change the Company’s name from “DOCASA, Inc.” to “The Coffeesmiths Collective, Inc.” The purpose of the name change will help further our brand identity and will reflect the major focus of our business operations as a specialty coffee company. The filing of the name change with the state of Nevada was completed and effected as of October 29, 2018. The Company filed with FINRA for a name change and symbol change on November 1, 2018. Both became effective on December 4, 2018.
 
On July 8, 2016, the Company experienced a change in control. Atlantik LP (“Atlantik”) acquired a majority of the issued and outstanding common stock of the Company in accordance with a stock purchase agreement by and between Atlantik and Nami Shams (the “Seller”). On the closing date, July 8, 2016, pursuant to the terms of the stock purchase agreement, Atlantik purchased from the Seller 115,000,000 shares of the Company’s outstanding restricted common stock for $200,000, representing 75.8% of the Company’s outstanding common stock at that time.
 
On September 1, 2016, the Company acquired 99.8% of the voting stock of the Department of Coffee and Social Affairs Limited, a United Kingdom corporation (the “DEPT-UK”), and the Company agreed to issue DEPT-UK’s majority shareholder 170,000,000 shares of the Company’s common stock—110,000,000 shares initially and 60,000,000 shares at a time determined by the Company’s Board of Directors but no later than December 31, 2018, which deadline was subsequently extended to August 31, 2018. Also, on September 1, 2016, the Company acquired 115,000,000 shares of the Company’s common stock from Atlantik in exchange for issuing Atlantik a promissory note for $320,000, which shares were then cancelled and which note has since been paid in full. As a result of the acquisition and the issuance of the initial 110,000,000 shares of common stock, and the cancellation of the 115,000,000 Atlantik shares, DEPT-UK is now the majority-owned subsidiary of the Company, and the Company experienced a change of control.
 
DEPT-UK formed a wholly-owned subsidiary, Department of Coffee and Internal Affairs Limited (“DCIA”), on September 11, 2014, as filed with the Registrar of Companies for England and Wales. As of December 31, 2018, DCIA has had no operations or activity.
 
On April 5, 2017, the Company formed Department of Coffee and Social Affairs IL, Inc. (“DEPT-IL”), an Illinois corporation.
 
On May 18, 2017, the Company formed Department of Coffee and Social Affairs White Space Limited (“DEPT-UKWS”), as filed with the Registrar of Companies for England and Wales. It is a subsidiary of DEPT-UK.
 
On November 1, 2017, DEPT-UK acquired Tapped and Packed Ltd (“Tapped”), a UK company, for a combination of cash and shares of common stock of the Company. Tapped became a subsidiary of DEPT-UK as a result of the transaction. Tapped has four shop locations in the UK which serve coffee and food.
 
On February 23, 2018, the Board of Directors determined to change the Company’s fiscal year end to December 31 from August 31. The Company believes this change will benefit the Company by aligning its reporting periods to be more consistent with peer coffee companies.
 
On May 23, 2018, DEPT-UK acquired Bea’s of Bloomsbury Limited (“Bea’s”), a UK company, for shares of common stock of the Company. Bea’s became a subsidiary of DEPT-UK as a result of the transaction. Bea’s has five shop locations in the UK which serves coffee and food.
 
On October 22, 2018, DEPT-UKWS changed its name to Dept. Cold Brew Ltd. (“Dept. Cold Brew”).
 
On November 15, 2018, DEPT-UK executed a Share Purchase Agreement with Thomas Acland, David Downie, William Vernon, Kate Elizabeth Acland, and Martyn Ward for the acquisition of Coffee Global Limited (a/k/a Cafe2u (“Cafe2u”)). Cafe2u became a subsidiary of DEPT-UK as a result of the transaction. Cafe2u is a franchisor for mobile coffee vans and has 85 third-party franchisee vans in the UK all operating under a master franchise agreement with Cafe2u.

On December 1, 2018, Coffeesmiths Collective executed a Capital Contribution Agreement with Paul Leisen, Joan Lundgren, John Sweeney, Jacob Muller and Travis Schaffner for the acquisition of Dollop Coffee, LLC (“Dollop”). Dollop became a subsidiary of Coffeesmiths Collective as a result of the transaction. Dollop has coffee cafes, provides roasting and distribution and has 16 locations in or near Chicago, Illinois.
 
On December 1, 2018, DEPT-UK executed a Share Purchase Agreement with Silverstream Investments Ltd. for the acquisition of The Roastery Department Ltd. (“The Roastery”). The Share Purchase Agreement provided Silverstream with preference shares of DEPT-UK in the amount of £2,750,000 ($3,506,433), which at closing was satisfied by the issuance of 2,750,000 shares. The Roastery became a subsidiary of DEPT-UK as a result of the transaction. The Roastery is a specialty coffee roaster and has one location in the UK.
 
On various dates, DEPT-UK executed various share purchase agreements and asset purchase agreements with various third parties for coffee shops, roastery, bakery and assets, as applicable. The acquired entities became subsidiaries of DEPT-UK. The acquired assets were incorporated into the operations of DEPT-UK. These acquisitions, in aggregate, were for $660,404 in cash and deferred cash payments of $594,692.
 
For financial reporting purposes, the acquisition of DEPT-UK and the change of control in connection with acquisition represented a “reverse merger” rather than a business combination, and DEPT-UK was deemed to be the accounting acquirer in the transaction. For the periods subsequent to August 31, 2016, the acquisition has been accounted for as a reverse-merger and recapitalization. DEPT-UK was considered the acquirer for financial reporting purposes, and the Company (The Coffeesmiths Collective, Inc., f/k/a DOCASA, Inc. and FWF Holdings, Inc.) is was considered the acquired company. Consequently, the assets and liabilities and the operations that are reflected in the historical financial statements prior to the DEPT-UK acquisition are those of DEPT-UK and have been recorded at the historical cost basis of DEPT-UK, and the financial statements after completion of that acquisition include the assets and liabilities of both the Company and DEPT-UK, and the historical operations of DEPT-UK prior to closing and operations of both companies from the closing of the acquisition.
 
We are currently devoting all of our efforts to the specialty coffee industry. The Company generates revenue through sales at 47 company-operated stores in the United Kingdom and the United States. Our objective is to continue to be recognized as one of the upper tier specialty coffee retail operations in our market. Similar to leading operators, we sell our proprietary coffee and related products, and complementary food and snacks.

Overview 
 
The Coffeesmiths Collective, Inc. (“Coffeesmiths”) is a family of independent specialty coffee shops and coffee companies based in the United States and the United Kingdom. The Company has rolled out and acquired specialty coffee shops and companies preserving, wherever appropriate, the strong individual identities of those regarded as “local institutions.” Coffeesmiths brings light touch economies of scale with the goal of enhancing the customer experience and increasing shareholder value without altering the fabric of the uniqueness of many of its established assets. The Company has a flagship brand, the award-winning Department of Coffee & Social Affairs, with coffee shops in the US and in the UK in which it is widely recognized as a market leader in the rapidly growing specialty coffee sector.
Competition
 
The UK and US coffee shop market is made up of branded coffee-focused and food-focused chains, independent specialty shops and chains and non-specialist including supermarket cafes, department store cafes, retail shops with cafes, pubs, hotels, motorway service stations, forecourts and fast food outlets. Certain branded coffee-focused chains currently have longer operating histories, larger customer bases, greater brand recognition and significantly greater financial, marketing and other resources than we do, however, their ability to deliver specialty quality coffee is limited. Our competitive edge is our focus and ability to provide consistent quality coffee to consumers. This is done through the hiring and training of highly skilled baristas, sourcing only the highest-grade single origin green coffee available and working with experts in the specialty coffee industry to continually innovate the way we make and talk about coffee.
