Evil Empire designs is committed to providing our customers with products and services that meet, conform to and exceed their individual motorcycle needs, ensuring their design, values and investment expectations are being met.

Our target market is middle and upper income female motorcycle enthusiasts. Evil Empire is a professional company that is dedicated to customizing motorcycles with a cutting edge style. Evil Empire designs aftermarket parts and accessories for female motorcyclist who want to express themselves with an original style of their own.

Company Goals And Objectives

Our goal is to be the number one provider of motorcycle customization parts, as defined by sales revenue, specifically targeted towards women within 5 years. Our objective is to engineer, prototype and manufacture new designs on a consistent schedule to not only stay current, but become a leader in the motorcycle aftermarket industry, while maintaining healthy profit margins. We intend to launch a minimum of two new products per year.
Products - Generally

Evil Empire offers a line of custom parts and accessories for Harley Davidson or metric motorcycles. Our quality parts are made in the USA and Evil Empire is dedicated to providing the highest standard of customer service.

We will engineer, prototype and manufacture new designs on a consistent schedule to stay current in the motorcycle aftermarket industry.

Industry

Motorcycle customization is a growth industry. And most of that growth is increasingly attributed to new female riders. As women take to riding in larger numbers, they tend to accessorize their bikes in order to display their individuality. We intent to assist these women by providing unique designs and high quality products to make their bikes their own.
Core Competencies

Evil Empire’s core competency is in understanding the “biker culture,” and the customization market. Our CEO, Sheila Cunningham, an avid motorcycle rider, has been featured in several magazines for her customization work. Her designs have struck a nerve among female riders who seek her out in customizing their own motorcycles.

Because we are a growth company requiring additional capital, we’ve chosen to incorporate with a view to listing the company so that our investors may achieve liquidity should that be required.

Products and Services

Aftermarket Body Parts

Evil Empire will concentrate on the research, design and development of the finest quality of aftermarket parts, including, but not limited to custom fiberglass saddlebags, side panels, and fenders, gas tanks, and seats. Our custom bags have already been featured in several motorcycle magazines.

Evil Empire will continue to design and manufacture billet floorboards and passenger floorboards, foot pegs, shifter pegs, shift linkages, exhaust tips, handlebar grips, mirrors, license place frames, and various types of billet accessories. Our first two products in this category - custom floorboards and handlebar grips - have already been featured in several magazines. Examples of some of our accessories are s follows:

Aftermarket Handlebars

Evil Empire will offer 3 different design handlebars varying is size and dimensions to accommodate the female rider. Offering them in Chrome Plating, Powdercoat and Raw form.
Apparel

We also offer t-shirts, hooded sweatshirts and hats that will display the Evil Empire name and Logo.

We are committed to providing our customers with products and services that meet, conform to and exceed their individual motorcycle needs.

Custom Design

In year two, after our launch and media blitz, we plan on offering a custom design service specifically for women. Ms. Cunningham will lead the effort as she already has a following of female riders and has customized several motorcycles.
Competitive Advantage

Our competitive advantage lies in the uniqueness of our designs and the quality of our merchandise. Our floorboards are manufactured in the United States, are designed correctly and are machined rather than stamped. These factors put us at the top end of the retail price range, but since our target market purchases top end motorcycles, it doesn’t make sense to expect them to customize an expensive motorcycle with cheap parts.
Pricing

We standardize our pricing on our website and throughout our dealer network. Discounting will not be allowed in order to keep the quality image of the product from being tarnished. Sale prices are to be expected at seasonal times and will be permitted, but the sale of the product through discount channels will not.
Marketing Plan

The Company has conducted both primary and secondary research resulting in key insights to implement our strategic plan.

Industry Analysis and Industry Trends

Based on information we have obtained from the Whiteboard Research Summary on Motorcycle Industry (the “Whiteboard Research Summary”), we believe that the demand for custom aftermarket motorcycle parts and accessories is highly dependent on the number of Harley-Davidson and metric motorcycles sold. We also believe the motorcycle industry itself is highly dependent on disposable income, confidence in the future of the economy, and leisure time. Prior to the recession of 2009, the largest market segment for the previous five years was composed of middle-aged males. As these consumers aged and as the recession hit, motorcycle manufacturers saw sales decline. In the USA, Harley-Davidson, the industry’s largest manufacturer reported a sales decline of 23.4%. In response, industry looked for new segments to exploit: expanding overseas, targeting younger/new riders, and targeting women.

The Whiteboard Research Summary gave us a snapshot of the overall market. In 2014, consumers in the United States purchased some 484,000 motorcycles; this figure reflects a 3.8 percent increase in total U.S. motorcycle sales over the previous year. The consensus for years going forward calls for a 3% annual growth. Wisconsin based Harley-Davidson had a total market share of 46.5%, up from 36% in 2013.

In 2013, Harley-Davidson’s 601+cc segment reached a market share of about 55% indicating a heavier weighting on this segment of sales. This segment is also our key target market since these bikes are higher end bikes and their riders are less sensitive to economic fluctuations. The Whiteboard Research Summary concluded that higher incomes, higher consumer confidence in the economy and higher gas prices all contribute to the growth of this market.

As part of our primary research, we surveyed riders at motorcycle shows across the USA and Canada. The results for the most part were as expected. Almost all the people we surveyed liked the designs of our handlebars and floorboards. They especially liked the sturdiness of the floorboards. The saddlebags were enthusiastically endorsed as well. One key insight we achieved from this research is that in colder weather (the Canadian motorcycle show), there was concern as to how cold the handlebars would get since they’re not insulated. Although this is mitigated by the fact that the majority of our target market is geographically located in California (according to 2013 data, the majority of motorcycle fans reside in California, where almost 800,000 motorcycles are registered.), we have begun designing a handlebar to withstand the Canadian weather.

As of 2013, roughly 12% of the riders in the USA were women – an increase of about 30% over the last decade according the Motorcycle Industry Council. Whether it is because they’ve been targeted, or because they realize the benefits of riding, Harley Davidson, the top-selling motorcycle brand among women in the U.S., sold more new on-road motorcycles to women in the U.S. in 2013.

According to a study conducted by Kelton and commissioned by Harley-Davidson recently commissioned Kelton to conduct a study surveying women riders. According to the results:

“Women riders are more than twice as likely to always feel happy (37% of riders vs. 16% of non-riders) and more than a third (34%) reported that they felt less stressed after starting to ride. Further, nearly twice as many always feel confident (35% of riders vs. 18% of non-riders).

According to the Harley-Davidson Women Riders Survey, the benefits of riding continue:


· | More riders than non-riders (40% vs. 18%) feel extremely satisfied with their careers. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | More than twice as many riders as non-riders (32% vs. 15%) agree that they feel beautiful daily. 
· | Women who ride are more content with their significant other (60 percent of riders vs. 38 percent of non-riders) and intimacy (51 percent riders; 35 percent non-riders). 
· | More riders than non-riders (75% vs. 64%) usually feel content instead of worried, and almost a quarter (23%) of riders report that they rarely feel anxious.” (http://www.motorcyclecruiser.com/news/women-flock-to-motorcycling-record-numbers)

Customers

Evil Empire’s ideal customer is an upper-middle to upper income female, between the ages of thirty-four and sixty-five. Younger riders may not have the discretionary income to afford our product, and the number of women riding after the age of sixty-five diminishes quickly due to the physical exertion and risk of motorcycle riding. She enjoys riding at least part of the time. She is individualistic and has a personal sense of style. She is confident in herself and her decisions. In short, a powerful, self-fulfilled woman.

We intend to appeal to her sense of individuality by offering products that will make her motorcycle stand out from the crowd. Evil Empire products will be easily available to our customer from our website and through motorcycle dealerships. At this time, to keep the final cost to the customer at a minimum, we do not intend to sell through wholesalers or jobbers. Initially we will target dealerships in California, Nevada and Arizona where seasonality in motorcycle riding and customization are not issues. Our research also indicates California has the highest number of motorcycle riders in the country.

Competition

Competition in the industry is fragmented with no clear market leader. Many of our competitors are well established. Many offer higher end aftermarket motorcycle parts and accessories. Some also offer customization and motorcycle sales. On a stand-alone basis our product offering is comparable to all, and superior to some.

Our niche: middle to high-income women who ride at least occasionally, with a sense of self and individuality is unexploited. We intend to fill the void and quickly become the go-to solution for these women.

Our competitive advantage is that we are actively targeting a new group of riders the motorcycle manufacturers are starting to exploit before our male-centric competition. In order to capitalize on this we intend to move quickly.

Obstacles we’ll have to overcome include the established competition and the motorcycle manufacturers themselves who often times offer similar products in their dealerships (although their offerings don’t match the quality of our offerings).

Strategy

Our strategy is based on targeting middle to high-income women who ride at least occasionally, with a sense of self.

Positioning

Evil Empire will position the Company and its products as a lifestyle brand, made in America for independent women. The intent is to form a “cult” of customers, in much the same way Harley-Davidson has created a cult of customers.

15

Promotion

Our CEO, Sheila Cunningham will conduct interviews with several motorcycle magazines in which she and her products have been featured. Evil Empire will also advertise in these magazines.

Our designs and logos are formulated to appeal to women who enjoy the cutting edge in style, and lifestyle. The conversation around these is designed to spark a following using social media, leading to word of mouth proliferation.

Evil Empire also intends to inundate trade shows, bike rallies, and other competitions. Our CEO is an accomplished rider and an avid motorcycle racer. We intend to exploit her image as something worthy of aspiration.

Each of our products are sold with a quality warranty card. Once filled, Evil Empire will begin building a database of customers to whom we can repeatedly market (the “Evil Empire Club”). These customers will get promotions on new products and minimally once a year be invited to a Evil Empire Club ride. The ride will consist of women in the club descending on an unsuspecting SPA town where they will be pampered for a weekend. The publicity generated from this event will be invaluable.

The cost of these promotions is minimal. Trade shows and magazine articles are the bigger expenses and have been accounted for in our financial projections.

Pricing

Evil Empire has priced its products in line with our competitors. The products are priced to reflect the quality of products and also to ensure a good profit for the Company. Evil Empire will compete on brand image, quality of product, and lifestyle.
Distribution Channels

Evil Empire products will be available on our website and through dealer-retailers. We will not be using wholesalers or jobbers to keep the final retail price in line with our competitors, and to ensure the quality lifestyle image we’re trying to create and maintain remains untarnished.
Competition and Competitive Strategy

We expect that we will compete for members with traditional aftermarket motorcycle parts businesses. We believe that we will face extensive challenges in attempting to compete because we do not have the ability to verify who is purchasing parts that compete with ours, at what cost, and the terms and conditions under which our competitors are offering the same or similar parts as ours. We believe that the market for our products is constantly changing in terms of how consumers purchase aftermarket motorcycle parts and what those consumers’ particular tastes may be.

Patents, Trademarks, Licenses, Franchise Restrictions and Contractual Obligations & Concessions

We rely on a combination of trademark laws, trade secrets, confidentiality provisions and other contractual provisions to protect our proprietary rights, which are primarily our brand names, product designs and marks. We hold one U.S. Design Patent, titled, Side Hardbag for a Motorcycle, which was granted Patent No. D830,056 (the “Patent”).  The Patent covers claims relating to the ornamental design for a side hardbag for a motorcycle.  Barring any unforeseen circumstances, the Company believes the Patent should be valid until November 2036, given that the Patent filing occurred in November 2016.
Compliance with Government Regulation

We will be required to comply with all regulations, rules and directives of governmental authorities and agencies applicable to the construction and operation of any facility in any jurisdiction which we would conduct activities. We do not believe that government regulation will have a material impact on the way we conduct our business, however, any government regulation imposing greater fees for Internet use or restricting information exchange over the Internet could result in a decline in the use of the Internet and the viability of Internet-based services, which could harm our business and operating results.
Research and Development Activities and Costs

We have not incurred any research and development costs for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2021.

Employees

As of the date hereof, we have 1 non-employee officer, Sheila Cunningham, who operates our company.  The Company also uses approximately 19 independent contractor consultants and advisors in connection with its operations.
Description of Properties

Our executive offices are located at 441 Eastgate Rd., Henderson, Nevada 89011, and our telephone number is (725) 666-3700. We do not own any real estate or other physical properties.
Bankruptcy or Similar Proceedings

We have never been subject to bankruptcy, receivership or any similar proceeding.
