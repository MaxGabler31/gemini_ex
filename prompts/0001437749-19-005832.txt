Item 1. Business
Overview 
 
We are a global, high-growth diagnostics company focused on developing and commercializing proprietary tests for immunology and infectious disease by leveraging the technological, product development, manufacturing, quality, regulatory, and sales and marketing capabilities we have developed over our sixteen year history. Our proprietary T-SPOT®1.TB test utilizes our T-SPOT technology platform to test for tuberculosis, which is the leading cause of infectious disease death worldwide.
 
On November 6, 2018, we completed the sale of our U.S. Laboratory Services Business to Quest, for gross proceeds of $170 million in cash. This Transaction represented a strategic business shift and it had a major effect on our operations and financial results. Following the Transaction, we have approximately 210 employees, including sales and marketing teams on three continents, and a laboratory in the United Kingdom.
 
Our T-SPOT.TB test
 
Tuberculosis is a common and, if not properly treated, potentially lethal infectious disease caused by the bacterium Mycobacterium tuberculosis, or MTB. MTB typically infects the lungs, but the lymph nodes, kidneys, brain and bones may also be infected. Those with latent tuberculosis infection, or LTBI, are asymptomatic and are not infectious; however, each person with LTBI has a 5% to 10% chance, on average, of progressing to active TB over his or her lifetime. This risk of progression to active TB is significantly elevated among individuals with weakened immune systems, such as those with human immunodeficiency virus, or HIV, or diabetes or those on drugs that suppress the immune system (e.g., those taking biologic therapies for autoimmune disease or those undergoing immune suppression post-transplantation). Without proper treatment, up to two thirds of individuals with active TB disease will die.
 
According to the World Health Organization, or the WHO, approximately 23% of the world’s population, or about 1.7 billion people, are infected with M. tuberculosis. Despite the availability of an effective treatment, TB is the leading cause of infectious disease death worldwide and remains one of the top ten causes of death worldwide from any cause. The WHO estimated that in 2017 approximately 10 million people developed TB disease, of which approximately 1.6 million people died.
 
There are three broad strategies to control TB: vaccination, finding and treating active TB disease, and finding and treating LTBI to prevent the development of new active TB disease cases. The United States has one of the most comprehensive LTBI screening programs in the world with screening of several high-risk groups, including healthcare workers, recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, or the CDC. Screening of healthcare workers is also recommended as part of the accreditation standards for U.S. hospitals. Other high-risk groups identified by CDC include persons with immunosuppressive conditions, such as persons receiving immunosuppressive agents or organ transplant recipients, and persons with human immunodeficiency virus, or HIV. In addition, TB screening is required in many cases for additional populations, such as day care staff, school teachers and students, and emergency response personnel.
 
We estimate that there are approximately 22 million LTBI tests performed each year in the United States, the majority of which are performed within the healthcare system in a variety of settings, including hospitals, public health offices, physicians’ offices and clinics. Outside the United States, we estimate the total number of tests exceeds 28 million each year, for a combined market size of over 50 million LTBI tests annually.
 
The primary test currently used for TB screening is the more than 100-year-old TST. The TST is administered by injecting an extract from cultured M. tuberculosis, called tuberculin or PPD, into the skin of a subject’s forearm using a needle and syringe. The injection of the PPD into the skin of a subject previously infected with MTB stimulates the immune response, including T cells, causing the formation of a hard lump at the site of the injection. Because it takes time for this reaction to occur, the subject must return 48 to 72 hours after the PPD injection to have the result read. The test result is graded by feeling for the boundaries of the swelling, marking these with a pen and then measuring the diameter with a ruler.
 
The TST suffers from several limitations, including an antiquated technique that results in substantial test variability, false negative results in immunocompromised patients, false positive results in patients who have been Bacille Calmette-Geurin, or BCG, vaccinated and boosting of results, which occurs when an infected subject’s reaction to an initially false-negative TST causes increased sensitivity in a subsequent test such that it tests positive. In addition to these technical drawbacks, the TST requires multiple patient visits, which increases its overall cost.

Our T-SPOT.TB test addresses the limitations of the TST by directly measuring antigen-specific T cells indicative of TB infection. We use two TB-specific antigens, ESAT-6 and CFP10, to stimulate T cells that have previously been exposed to MTB, which causes them to release a cytokine called interferon-gamma. Interferon-gamma is one of the dominant cytokines released by activated T cells when encountering MTB. In contrast to the PPD reagent used in the TST, these two antigens are not shared with the BCG vaccine or with most non-tuberculous mycobacteria. Because our test detects individual T cells via their release of interferon-gamma, our test is sometimes referred to generically as an IGRA.
 
Our proprietary T-SPOT.TB test leverages our T-SPOT technology platform, which allows us to measure the response of specific immune cells to inform the diagnosis, prognosis and monitoring of patients with immune-regulated conditions. Our T-SPOT.TB test has been approved for sale in over 50 countries, including the United States, where we have received premarket approval, or PMA, from the Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, in Europe, where we have obtained a CE mark, as well as in Japan and China. An interferon-gamma release assay, or IGRA, such as our T-SPOT.TB test has been included in clinical guidelines for TB testing in over 30 countries, including the United States, several European countries, China and Japan. In addition, we have established reimbursement for our test in the United States, as well as a Current Procedural Terminology, or CPT, code that is unique to our test. Outside the United States, we have established reimbursement in several countries where reimbursement applies, including Japan, Switzerland, Germany, France and South Korea. We have also established the cost-effectiveness of our test in several published studies. We believe the annual global market opportunity for our T-SPOT.TB test is well in excess of $1 billion, assuming we can largely displace the tuberculin skin test, or TST, in the developed world.
 
Our T-SPOT.TB commercialization strategy
 
We currently offer our T-SPOT.TB test as an in vitro diagnostic kit globally, meaning we sell test kits and associated accessories to laboratories that perform the testing themselves. We have also established a clinical testing laboratory in the United Kingdom, where we perform our T-SPOT.TB test on samples sent to us by customers. We market our service offering under the name Oxford Diagnostic Laboratories®, or ODL®.
 
Our test is widely reimbursed both internationally, with reimbursement established in Japan, Switzerland, Germany, France and South Korea, and in the U.S., where we have established a unique CPT code for our test.
 
We believe that clinical guidelines, which are recommendations issued by national medical societies or public health bodies, are a driving factor in a clinician’s decision to use a specific diagnostic test. IGRAs, such as our T-SPOT.TB test have been included in clinical guidelines for TB testing in over 30 countries, including the United States, several European countries, China and Japan. In recent years, the use of IGRAs has been increasingly recommended and our sales and marketing activities will continue to look to exploit these increasingly positive guidelines updates.
 

● | In December 2016, a publication titled “Official American Thoracic Society/Infectious Diseases Society of America/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Clinical Practice Guidelines: Diagnosis of Tuberculosis in Adults and Children” recommended use of IGRAs for testing for TB infection instead of the TST for patients over the age of five who meet the following criteria: 1) are likely to be infected with MTB, 2) have a low or intermediate risk of disease progression, 3) testing for LTBI is warranted, and 4) either have a history of BCG vaccination or are unlikely to return for a second visit to read the TST.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | In February 2018, the CDC issued a notification informing the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services that a revised tuberculosis technical instruction would go into effect on October 1, 2018. As of the effective date, when a test for cell-mediated immunity to TB is required, all civil surgeons must use an FDA-approved IGRA test; performing a skin test is no longer allowed.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | In June 2018, updated guidelines from the American Academy of Pediatrics, or AAP, were published in the AAP’s 2018 Red Book: Report of the Committee on Infectious Diseases, or the Red Book. The Red Book contains a composite summary of current recommendations representing the policy of the AAP on various aspects of infectious diseases and is issued every three years.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The AAP guidelines include specific recommendations for the use of IGRAs, such as our T-SPOT.TB test, and the recommended age for IGRA use was lowered from five years to two years in these updated guidelines.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | In May 2018, IGRAs, of which our T-SPOT.TB test is one of two available globally, were included in the World Health Organization’s first ever List of Essential In Vitro Diagnostics (EDL). The EDL includes the 113 most important tests recommended by the WHO for use at various levels of the health care system. These essential diagnostics satisfy the priority health care needs of the population and were selected with due regard to disease prevalence and public health relevance, evidence of efficacy and accuracy, and comparative cost-effectiveness. 58 of the tests listed are for the detection and diagnosis of a wide range of common conditions, providing an essential package that can form the basis for screening and management of patients. The remaining 55 tests are designed for the detection, diagnosis, and monitoring of WHO key disease areas, for which there is high quality evidence – HIV, tuberculosis (TB), malaria, hepatitis B and C, syphilis and human papilloma virus.

We believe that these guidelines, and similar national guidelines outside the United States in countries such as China, allow us to access the vast majority of the current TST market and assert the superiority of an IGRA in significant segments of the market.
 
We currently market our T-SPOT.TB test directly in the United States, Northern Europe and Japan. Outside of these territories, we have contracted with distributors who market and sell our test. In countries where we have a direct presence, we use a combination of sales managers, sales representatives, customer service staff and technical experts to interact with clinicians, nurses, administrative staff, laboratories and other groups who are involved in the implementation of TB screening programs. Our goal is to educate these groups about the clinical, operational and economic benefits of switching from the TST to our T-SPOT.TB test. Our customer service staff and technical experts are also involved in the practical training of customers to perform and order our T-SPOT.TB test as well as providing ongoing customer support. In addition to these teams, we offer a diverse array of marketing programs and services, which include advertising, medical education, attendance at scientific meetings and other awareness-raising activities.
 
We have been investing in product development initiatives that we believe will increase use of T-SPOT.TB by new and existing customers, enable TB testing in new locations and create more formidable barriers to entry within the LTBI testing market long-term. For example, in April 2018, we obtained a CE mark for the T-Cell SelectTM kit, which can be used to isolate mononuclear immune cells using positive selection via a magnetic bead cell separation system. Expected benefits of T-Cell Select include simplified workflow, improved throughput, reduced hands-on time and reduced labor costs in performing T-SPOT.TB. Furthermore, with T-Cell Select, blood samples can be collected in a single standard blood tube and stored for up to 54 hours at room temperature before use in the test, further extending our simplicity and logistics advantages for customers.
 
We also have a number of capabilities that we believe we can leverage in developing and commercializing products. We have a proven track record of running multi-center clinical trials, changing guidelines and establishing reimbursement, capabilities that are important to commercial success of diagnostic products. We have the experience and capability to gain regulatory clearance to manufacture and sell products meeting the regulatory requirements of numerous countries around the world. This, combined with our global sales and marketing infrastructure, which includes sales and marketing teams on three continents, and a laboratory in the United Kingdom allows us to generate revenues in a large number of countries. Our current customer base includes hospitals, commercial testing laboratories, importers and distributors.
 
T-SPOT.TB regulatory approvals and clinical validation 
 
Our T-SPOT.TB test is approved for commercial sale in over 50 countries. Key geographies where we have regulatory approval include:
 

● | The United States. We obtained PMA for our T-SPOT.TB test from the FDA in 2008. Since 2008, an additional ten PMA supplements have been approved, including supplements relating to manufacturing improvements and label extensions, such as those that enable overnight shipment of blood samples.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Europe. We obtained a CE mark in 2004, which allows us to sell our T-SPOT.TB test in Europe as well as other countries that accept the CE mark.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | China. We obtained initial approval for our T-SPOT.TB test from the China Food and Drug Administration, or the CFDA, in 2010. Consistent with CFDA re-registration requirements, we secured re-registration of our test in 2014, which will remain effective until November 2019.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Japan. We obtained approval for our T-SPOT.TB test from the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare, or MHLW, in 2012.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
In addition to being validated in multiple clinical studies, our T-SPOT.TB test has also been the subject of nearly 500 peer-reviewed publications in scientific journals including several meta-analyses.
 
In April 2018, we declared conformity enabling us to attach the CE mark for the T-Cell Select kit, which can be used to isolate mononuclear immune cells using positive selection via a magnetic bead cell separation system. In December 2018, we obtained acceptance of the regulatory notification for the T-Cell Select kit by the CFDA.
 
Our T-SPOT technology platform
 
The human immune system is composed of two principal branches: cellular (T cell) immunity and humoral (B cell and antibody-based) immunity. Through our T-SPOT technology platform we can efficiently measure marker-specific T cell responses at a single cell level and thereby inform the diagnosis, prognosis and monitoring of patients with immune-regulated conditions. We believe these areas are attractive because they involve large patient populations and chronic conditions that present the opportunity for both initial diagnosis and additional testing to monitor the conditions.
 
We employ a quantitative method to detect antigen-specific cells releasing immune messenger molecules, called cytokines, released by effector T cells. In relation to effector T cells, our technology is designed to selectively measure responses from this subtype of T cells because they are primarily present when active, replicating pathogens are inside the body, as opposed to other T cell subtypes that may be present long after an infection has been cleared from the body. For diagnosis and monitoring applications, it is more relevant to be able to measure the immune response associated with the current infection rather than the immune response associated only with past, cleared exposure.

Our T-SPOT technology offers many technical advantages including high analytical sensitivity, potential application across multiple diseases and conditions and standardization of white blood cell counts, which makes our technology particularly useful in immunocompromised patients, such as those undergoing transplant surgery or immunosuppressive therapy. We employ proprietary manufacturing processes and protocols designed to cost-effectively and reliably produce key elements of our T-SPOT technology, including the process for coating microtiter plates with cytokine antibodies, such as IFN-y antibodies, and our quality control testing procedures.
 
Competitive landscape
 
Our T-SPOT.TB test competes primarily with the TST. We believe our T-SPOT.TB test has a number of compelling advantages that make it a superior alternative to the more than 100-year-old TST, including superior sensitivity and specificity, simplicity of administration and elimination of variability due to subjective interpretation of results. Although the TST is often considered to be inexpensive, as the PPD reagent and other materials used in the test typically cost less than $5 per test, the materials cost is only one element of the total cost involved when conducting a TB screening program or TB control strategy. Substantial costs beyond the materials cost of the TST test include additional costs associated with: (i) false-negatives and false-positives, which risk non-detection and require additional confirmatory tests; (ii) individuals who fail to return within the prescribed period and, therefore, require re-testing; and (iii) implementing and maintaining training programs for healthcare workers who administer and read TST tests.
 
Several studies have been published investigating the costs or cost-effectiveness of a TB screening program in the healthcare worker setting using the TST and in comparison to our T-SPOT.TB test. We believe these studies are informative in demonstrating how expensive the TST actually is to implement and how using our T-SPOT.TB test in preference to the TST can be a more cost-effective solution when implementing TB screening programs.
 
Other than the TST, our principal competitor is the QuantiFERON®2-TB Gold Plus test, or QFN Plus, which was approved for sale in Japan in 2018, the U.S. in 2017 and has been available in Europe since 2016. Early publications suggest similar performance characteristics between QFN Plus and its predecessor.
 
We have been competing with QFN Plus, or prior versions of this test, since the launch of our T-SPOT.TB test in 2004. Based on our experience, we believe that we have several performance advantages over QFN Plus, including:
 

● | In our pivotal clinical studies conducted in support of our PMA, T-SPOT.TB test results were not impacted by immunocompromised status or immunosuppression. The U.S. package insert for the QFN Plus test notes that the performance of the USA format of the QFN Plus test has not been extensively evaluated with specimens from the following groups of individuals: individuals who have impaired or altered immune functions, individuals younger than age 17 years, and pregnant women. The package insert also notes that the minimum number of lymphocytes required for a reliable test result has not been established and may also be variable. We believe this is an important differentiating factor in patient populations with weakened immune systems, such as those on biologic therapies, corticosteroid or other immunosuppressive treatments, those with HIV and those undergoing dialysis or organ transplantation.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | In the FDA pivotal studies in the United States, our T-SPOT.TB test was shown to have sensitivity advantages over the QFN Plus test.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We have also been successful in securing differential reimbursement for T-SPOT.TB in certain geographies, including France and the U.S. In the U.S., where we have established a unique CPT code for our test, this differential reimbursement has been maintained even following recent adjustments to the Clinical Lab Fee Schedule based upon the provisions of the Protect Access to Medicare Act, or PAMA. In 2018, The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, reimbursement for our test under CPT code 86481 was approximately $100 per test; CMS reimbursement for QFN Plus under CPT code 86480 was approximately $77 per test. Under PAMA, reimbursement for our T-SPOT.TB test for the years 2019-2020 will remain unchanged from 2018 rates. In contrast, the reimbursement for QFN Plus will decrease to approximately $62 by 2020.
 
Other products
 
Our C6 Borrelia burgdorferi (Lyme) ELISA kit, or C6 Lyme ELISA kit, measures Lyme specific antibodies by leveraging a synthetic version of the C6 peptide antigen, a marker specific to Borrelia burgdorferi, the causative organism of Lyme disease in the U.S. The test kit is FDA cleared and CE marked in the European Union. The test has been the subject of over 20 peer-reviewed publications.
 
Our T-SPOT.CMV test utilizes our T-SPOT technology platform to measure the strength of a patient’s cellular immune response to antigens specific to cytomegalovirus, or CMV, and provides information that may be useful in informing management strategies of patients at risk of CMV infection and disease, such as transplant patients. Our T-SPOT.CMV test is CE marked as a kit in the European Union.
 
Neither test is currently a material source of revenues for the Company.

Pipeline
 
We have active development programs to enhance our T-SPOT.TB test offering. We are developing multiple product enhancements that aim to improve the clinical utility of our test and improve test workflow and automation. We believe these enhancements will also serve to increase the barriers to entry in both the U.S. and outside the U.S.
 
Product development activities are inherently uncertain, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain regulatory body clearance to market our products. Delays in obtaining regulatory clearance may allow for increased competition, thereby potentially impacting the successful commercialization of our products. In addition, we may terminate our development efforts with respect to one or more of our products under development at any time, including before or during clinical trials, based upon changed market conditions.
 
Intellectual property 
 
We seek to secure and maintain protection of the proprietary aspects of our technology platform and of our existing and planned products. We rely on a combination of patents, trademarks, trade secret and other intellectual property laws, and confidentiality, license and invention assignment agreements and other contracts to protect our intellectual property rights. In addition, we have developed substantial knowledge in the field of immunology diagnostics including proprietary methods that we believe provide us with a significant advantage relative to potential competitors.
 
The intellectual property relating to our T-SPOT.TB test that we own or license includes 12 issued U.S. patents and 13 issued patents and one pending patent application in other jurisdictions, as well as registered trademarks, proprietary manufacturing processes and protocols, and proprietary methods directed towards achieving rapid throughput in assay performance.
 
Our owned and licensed patents 
 
Many of the patent rights we own or in-license have claims directed to the use of ESAT-6 and/or CFP10 to detect Mycobacterium tuberculosis. We believe that these are the most important TB-specific antigens and we include peptides from both of these in our T-SPOT.TB test. We also believe that using an ELISPOT technique for an IGRA enhances its accuracy and suitability for use in testing individuals with compromised immune systems. Our T-SPOT.TB test employs this technique.
 
Our technology patents contain claims to methods of measuring marker-specific effector T cell responses at a single-cell level to certain peptides of ESAT-6 to diagnose TB infection. In December 2017, as part of the settlement of our patent infringement action, we received a one-time, lump sum payment of $27.5 million from Qiagen Inc., or Qiagen. The settlement agreement included a non-exclusive, royalty-free license to certain of our patents for use in Qiagen’s QFN products. See “Legal Proceedings” for more information. These patents expire in late 2019.
 
The inventions claimed in our patents relating to removal of granulocytes from stored blood samples may also have applications in relation to other diseases, conditions or situations where blood samples cannot be tested soon after the blood draw. This proprietary method is a core part of the T-SPOT technology as it improves the stability of stored blood enabling the overnight shipment of blood samples. The patents covering these inventions expire in 2027 (outside of the U.S.) and 2028 (U.S.).
 
We also have licensed certain patents related to the detection of antibody-secreting B cells specific for HLA. We also have two patents under license and acquired a patent family application, pending in four territories, relating to additional TB antigens. The expected expiration dates of the licensed patents range from April 2019 to May 2032. We can give no assurance that any of our current or future research and development programs will result in the development and validation of any diagnostic test that leverages any of these patents or patent applications or otherwise.
 
Our license and assignment agreements 
 
We currently rely upon several license agreements to obtain rights under certain patents that we believe may be necessary to make, use and sell our products. We may in the future rely, at least in part, upon licensing agreements with third parties to obtain patent rights and transfers of technology, information and know-how to enable us to take advantage of research work already completed, including potentially the identification of antigens useful for measuring disease conditions. We believe such licensing arrangements have enabled us, and may in the future enable us, to reduce the amount of time we need to develop and validate new diagnostic tests.
 
We have royalty obligations under some of our current license agreements that are measured in part based upon our sales levels. Where our royalty obligations are calculated on our net sales, the definition of net sales varies by agreement and typically resulted in a lower effective royalty rate on our service revenue than on sales of our kits. Currently, our aggregate royalty burden for our T-SPOT.TB test under all license and assignment agreements, as a percentage of gross product and service revenue, is in the low single digits. Under our license agreements, we may be responsible for paying, or contributing to, patent prosecution and maintenance costs or subject to diligence obligations. We believe we are in compliance with all obligations of our license agreements.

Tuberculosis related patents
 
In 2013, we entered into an assignment agreement with Isis Innovation Limited, now known as Oxford University Innovation Ltd., or Oxford Innovation, pursuant to which various patents we previously licensed from Oxford Innovation were assigned to us. We have ongoing obligations under the assignment agreement to make payments to Oxford Innovation until the patents expire and to continue to extend license rights to Oxford University, its employees, students, agents and appointees to use the technology for academic and research purposes. Our rights under the patents are subject to various grants of license rights, including (i) a license back to Oxford Innovation to maintain a pre-existing license for research use only, (ii) a pre-existing grant to a third party of non-exclusive rights under the patents covering a field of two infectious diseases, and (iii) a pre-existing grant to a third party of non-exclusive rights under the patents limited to the licensee’s internal use to monitor vaccine response.
 
The amount we pay to Oxford Innovation for our royalty obligation is equal to a royalty rate in the low single digits. Our aggregate royalty obligation payments to Oxford Innovation through December 31, 2018 have been $3.1 million. Our royalty obligations to Oxford Innovation will cease when there are no valid patent claims still in force.
 
Our license agreement with Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey, or Rutgers, grants us an exclusive license to certain patents to manufacture and commercialize kits for in vitro diagnostic assays relating to TB other than in the ELISA format. The license was made in 2006 and has been amended in 2009, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2016 and 2017. Our license is royalty-bearing, worldwide, with the right to sublicense. We have not granted any sublicenses under this license. Rutgers has reserved the right to grant one additional license to this technology, limited to an ELISA format. To date, we do not believe Rutgers has entered into any such license.
 
We must make semi-annual royalty payments to Rutgers. Although the agreement contains minimum royalty obligations, the amount of royalties due based on our actual sales utilizing the licensed patents has exceeded the minimum for a number of years and we expect our royalties on actual sales will continue to exceed the minimum for the duration of our royalty obligations. We pay a royalty rate in the low single digits. Our aggregate payments to Rutgers through December 31, 2018 for signing fees, annual fees, milestones and royalties, including minimum royalties, have been $3.5 million. Our royalty obligations to Rutgers will cease when there are no valid patent claims still in force covering licensed products or assays. Previously, we made a number of other payments to Rutgers for license issue fees, annual license fees and milestone payments. No such future payments are required under the license.
 
Other
 
Our C6 Lyme ELISA kit incorporates the VIsE protein and C6 peptide, the most immunodominant portion of the VIsE protein. The protein is the subject of a patent held by Tulane University, or Tulane. We have also licensed four patents that relate to our C6 Lyme ELISA kit. The license from Tulane grants us the exclusive right to use the C6 peptide in a diagnostic test for Lyme disease in humans. The license from Tulane has a royalty rate in the single digits and expires in 2019 in the U.S. and in 2020 in other jurisdictions.
 
Trademarks and other protection
 
The trademarks we employ in our business include T-SPOT, T-Cell Xtend, T-Cell Select, Oxford Diagnostic Laboratories, or ODL, the Oxford Immunotec logo, our laboratory logo and the word Immunetics. We have obtained registrations in the United States for T-SPOT, T-Cell Xtend, Oxford Diagnostic Laboratories, the Oxford Immunotec logo and the word Immunetics. We have also obtained or are seeking registrations for certain of these trademarks in other jurisdictions, including the United Kingdom, the European Community, Japan and China. We have also secured numerous internet domain name registrations.
 
We have a policy of requiring all our employees to sign agreements that obligate them to maintain in confidence all confidential information they receive during the course of their employment, except in certain circumstances. Substantially all of our employees are also bound by invention assignment obligations, which provide that rights to all inventions and other types of intellectual property, whether or not patentable, conceived by them during the course of employment are assigned to us. We seek to enter into similar confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our consultants.
 
Our trade secrets 

There are several areas in which we have developed trade secrets relating to manufacturing that we believe provide a competitive advantage with respect to our T-SPOT.TB test. It is essential to the performance of ELISPOT tests used to detect the release of interferon-gamma from stimulated T cells that the microtiter plates used in the test be smoothly coated with the proper amount of interferon-gamma antibodies. For volume manufacturing, these coated plates must also meet stringent shelf life requirements. Our plate-coating process meets these criteria and cost-effectively provides reliable results. We believe this approach results in significant cost savings for us without sacrificing our compliance with either good manufacturing practices or our own high standards.
 
As part of our test offerings, we use unique formulations of peptides and other reagents that we believe are important to the accuracy of our tests. Further, we have devoted substantial time and resources to the development of processes and techniques that have resulted in cost reductions in our test manufacture and in assay performance in our service laboratory. In our U.K. ODL facility, we have streamlined the workflow process to allow for rapid throughput, which reduces labor costs and reduces the time we take to provide test results to our customers. In addition, we have developed and validated automated solutions for the assay process, including proprietary protocols for maximizing efficiencies garnered from the automation equipment. These methods are useful in our current test offerings, and will be applicable to future tests we may develop using our T-SPOT technology and other platforms. We believe the manufacturing process and assay performance efficiencies we have developed and employ could not easily or quickly be developed by others.

Manufacturing and laboratory facilities
 
Our tests are generally manufactured by us from materials we obtain from a limited number of suppliers. We manufacture our T-SPOT.TB test at our U.K. corporate headquarters in Abingdon, England, where we currently lease approximately 2,800 square feet of manufacturing space. The lease covering this space expires in 2020 and our current rent for the manufacturing space is $95,000 annually, which is subject to change. Our manufacturing facility is certified to ISO 13485. Our space in Abingdon also includes 6,400 square feet of storage/warehouse space. The leases covering this space expires in 2025 and our current rent for the storage/warehouse space is $67,000 annually, which is subject to change.
 
In June 2018, the Company entered into a lease for a new space in Abingdon, England, which extends through June 30, 2033, or the 143 Park Lease, that will allow us to combine our manufacturing, laboratory, storage and office operations into a single facility.  The 143 Park Lease covers 27,000 square feet of laboratory, office, storage, manufacturing and other mixed use space.  Initial rent under the 143 Park Lease is approximately $39,000 per month. When the lease on the Company's existing manufacturing and laboratory facility expires in December 2020, or possibly sooner, and we fully occupy the space subject to the 143 Park Lease, rent will increase to $79,000 per month. Rent will be reviewed for possible increases on June 1, 2021 and every third anniversary after that date. Select functional groups moved into the facility in the second half of 2018.
 
In connection with the sale of our U.S. Laboratory Services Business to Quest, we entered into a sublease with Quest for approximately 9,000 square feet of warehousing and office space in Norwood, MA. The sublease expires in November 2020. The base rent for the space subject to sublease is approximately $17,000 per month.
 
Key supplier relationships

We use a broad range of materials in the manufacture and performance of our diagnostic tests. We purchase all raw materials used in our tests from external suppliers. We purchase some materials from single sources for reasons of quality assurance, sole source availability, cost effectiveness or constraints resulting from regulatory requirements. We work closely with our suppliers to assure continuity of supply while maintaining high quality and reliability. To date, we have not experienced any significant difficulty in locating and obtaining the materials necessary to fulfill our production schedules. Because we believe that the only material supply relationships we have are those that pertain to our T-SPOT.TB test, we summarize these relationships below.
 
Mabtech AB. We entered into a purchase agreement with Mabtech AB, or Mabtech, in 2010, which was amended in 2013 and again in 2017. Pursuant to this agreement, Mabtech supplies the antibodies used to coat the membrane plates and for the detection procedure in our tests. We provide rolling forecasts of our anticipated purchases and portions of those forecasts become binding orders. We receive pricing discounts based on the volume of our purchases. We have agreed to purchase these antibodies exclusively from Mabtech, although our exclusivity obligations may cease in the event Mabtech raises prices by more than a certain percentage over a defined period of time and declines to match a competitive third-party quotation for the antibodies.
 
The purchase agreement expires, unless earlier terminated, on December 31, 2023. Either party may terminate by providing written notice to the other in the event of a material uncured breach by the other party, a liquidation, insolvency, or bankruptcy proceeding involving the other party or cessation in trading by the other party.
 
EMD Millipore Corporation. We entered into a supply agreement with EMD Millipore Corporation, or Millipore, in 2009, which was amended in 2013 and 2014, and expired on December 31, 2018.

Pursuant to the agreement, Merck supplies us with the membrane plates used in tests incorporating our T-SPOT technology. We provide rolling forecasts of our anticipated purchases and portions of those forecasts become binding orders. We receive pricing discounts based on the size of our orders. The agreement expires, unless earlier terminated, on December 31, 2024. Each party has the right to terminate in the event of a material uncured default by the other party. Each party also has the right to terminate the Agreement upon at least twelve months’ prior written notice. In the event Merck exercises its right of termination, we may continue to purchase goods under the agreement for up to twelve months following termination.
 
MicroCoat Biotechnologie GmbH. Pursuant to our 2010 supply agreement with MicroCoat Biotechnologie GmbH, or MicroCoat, which was amended in 2016, MicroCoat performs antibody coating on membrane plates using plates and antibodies we supply. Under the supply agreement, we provide rolling forecasts of our anticipated purchases and portions of those forecasts become binding orders. We receive pricing discounts based on the size of our orders. These antibody-coated plates are a component of tests using our T-SPOT technology.
 
The current term of the agreement expires, unless earlier terminated, on December 31, 2019, subject to automatic renewals for additional one-year periods in the absence of specified notice by either party. Each party has the right to terminate in the event of a material uncured breach by the other party, or in the event of a bankruptcy or insolvency proceeding involving the other party.
 
StemCell Technologies, Inc. We entered into a supply agreement with StemCell Technologies, Inc., or StemCell, in 2008, which was amended in 2011 and again in 2017. Pursuant to this agreement, StemCell supplies us with a product that can be used with tests using our T-SPOT technology.
 
We have the exclusive right to market this product for use in association with ELISPOT tests to detect and/or quantify T-cells for use in the in vitro diagnosis, prognosis and/or clinical monitoring of infectious diseases, including tuberculosis, and non-infectious diseases and medical conditions, except our rights in China and India are non-exclusive. StemCell retains the right to sell this product for use in other applications and in our non-exclusive territories. We are obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to promote sales of the product for the applications to which we have exclusive rights.
 
 7


We paid a signing fee in the amount of $0.1 million and milestone payments in the aggregate amount of $0.2 million. We are not obligated to make additional milestone payments. We are obligated to pay an annual exclusivity fee during the term of the agreement, creditable against certain future purchases. Our product purchases exceeded the amount of the exclusivity fee in 2017. We receive pricing discounts based on our quarterly orders. We have also agreed to make StemCell our supplier of choice for certain types of products, subject to performance obligations of StemCell, and we are generally obligated to acquire all of our requirements for such products from StemCell.
 
The agreement expires, unless earlier terminated, on December 31, 2023, but will continue indefinitely thereafter in the absence of specified notice by either party. Each party may terminate for material uncured breach, the insolvency or bankruptcy of the other party or the cessation of trading by or dissolution of the other party.
 
Life Technologies Corporation. We entered into a supply and reseller agreement with Life Technologies Corporation, or Life Tech, in 2013, amended in 2014, 2016 and 2017, which expired on December 31, 2018. In January 2019, we entered into an amended and restated supply and reseller agreement with Life Tech, which will expire on December 31, 2019. Pursuant to the Agreement we purchase and resell a product that can be used in performing assays using our T-SPOT technology. We have a minimum annual purchase obligation under the agreement, as well as obligations to purchase certain amounts based on our rolling forecasts of anticipated purchases. Either party may terminate for a material uncured breach, the insolvency or bankruptcy of the other party, if one of our twelve-month forecasts does not reflect any anticipated purchases of product or if we purchase no product during a consecutive twelve-month period.
 
Key customer relationships 
 
Our customers include independent laboratories, large hospital systems and public and private institutions. Our customer relationships also include our distributors outside of the U.S. We believe our relationships with Quest and with two of our distributors are key customer relationships.
 
Quest Diagnostics, Incorporated. We have a supply agreement with Quest Diagnostics, Incorporated, or Quest, which was made as of the closing of the sale of our U.S. Laboratory service business to Quest. Pursuant to the supply agreement, we sell T-SPOT.TB kits and certain accessories to Quest. The agreement expires on November 6, 2025. Each party may terminate the supply agreement for a material uncured breach or in any event of bankruptcy or an equivalent winding up of the other party’s business.
 
Shanghai Fosun Long March Medical Science Co. Ltd. We have a distribution agreement with Shanghai Fosun Long March Medical Science Co. Ltd., or Fosun, pursuant to which Fosun distributes our TB-related products in China. Under the distribution agreement, Fosun serves as our exclusive distributor in a territory consisting of the People’s Republic of China, including Macau Special Administrative Regions, and also serves as our non-exclusive distributor in Hong Kong. Fosun commits to using its best efforts to promote, sell and distribute our products in the territory in compliance with our policies and procedures and applicable law. The agreement imposes certain annual minimum purchase obligations at agreed upon pricing and covers our products, as well as other accessories which may be used in conjunction with our products. Fosun is obligated to refrain from dealing in any products in the territory which would be competitive with ours through a period extending 12 months after the termination of the agreement.
 
The agreement expires on January 1, 2021. Either party may terminate the agreement for a material uncured breach or in the event of bankruptcy or an equivalent winding up of the other party’s business. We may terminate the agreement if Fosun does not meet the minimum purchase requirements, for late payment or if Fosun undergoes a change in control. We amended the agreement twice during 2018 to adjust the rebate available upon Fosun’s achievement of minimum purchase quantities.
 
Riken Genesis Co., Ltd. We sell our T-SPOT.TB test to a Japanese importer, Riken Genesis Co., Ltd., or Riken, which also serves as our marketing authorization holder in Japan, a position required by Japanese regulatory authorities. We entered into a marketing authorization holder agreement with Riken in 2011 and it was amended in 2013, 2016 and 2017. Pursuant to this agreement, Riken provides services for importation into Japan. We initially paid an initiation fee to Riken in the amount of ¥200,000, or approximately $1,600. We currently pay Riken a flat monthly fee in the amount of ¥150,000, or approximately $1,300, and also pay a single-digit percentage commission based on the prices at which end users purchase our products. The initial agreement with Riken had a one-year term and automatically renews for additional one-year periods in the absence of specified notice by either party. Either party may terminate for a material uncured breach or in the event of bankruptcy, insolvency or similar proceedings of the other party.
 
Government regulation
 
Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act 
 
In the United States, in vitro diagnostics, or IVDs, are regulated by the FDA as either medical devices or biological products under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, depending on their intended use. IVDs that are used as diagnostics are regulated as medical devices.
 
 8


Marketing pathways 
 
There are two regulatory pathways to receive authorization to market IVDs intended for diagnostic purposes: a premarket application, or PMA, and a 510(k) premarket notification. The FDCA establishes a risk-based standard for determination of the pathway for which a particular IVD device is eligible.
 
The information that must be submitted to the FDA to obtain clearance or approval to market a new medical device varies depending on how the medical device is classified by the FDA. Medical devices are classified into one of three classes on the basis of the controls necessary to reasonably ensure their safety and effectiveness. Class I devices are subject to general controls, including labeling and adherence to the FDA’s quality system regulation, which establishes device-specific good manufacturing practices. Class II devices are subject to general controls and special controls, including performance standards and post-market surveillance. Class III devices are subject to these requirements as well as to premarket approval. Most Class I devices are exempt from premarket submissions to the FDA; most Class II devices require the submission of a 510(k) premarket notification to the FDA; and Class III devices require submission of a PMA application. Our T-SPOT.TB test is a Class III device and our C6 Lyme ELISA kit is a Class II device. We have other Class II devices that have received 510(k) clearance from FDA that we acquired through our acquisition of Immunetics.
 
Premarket approval. The PMA process, by which we received marketing authorization for our T-SPOT.TB test in 2008, is complex, costly and time consuming. A PMA application must be supported by detailed and comprehensive scientific evidence, including clinical data, to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of the medical device for its intended purpose. If the device is determined to present a “significant risk,” the sponsor may not begin a clinical trial until it submits an investigational device exemption, or IDE, to the FDA and obtains approval from the FDA to begin the trial. After the PMA application is submitted, the FDA has 45 days to make a threshold determination that the application is sufficiently complete to permit a substantive review. If the application is complete, the FDA will accept it for filing. The FDA is subject to a non-binding performance goal review time for a PMA application of 180 days from the date of filing, although in practice this review time is often longer. Questions from the FDA, requests for additional data and referrals to advisory committees may delay the process considerably. Indeed, the total process may take several years and there is no guarantee that the PMA application will ever be approved. Even if approved, the FDA may limit the indications for which the device may be marketed. The FDA may also request additional clinical data as a condition of approval or after the PMA is issued. Any changes to the medical device may require a supplemental PMA application to be submitted and approved. Since we received initial PMA application approval of our T-SPOT.TB test in 2008, the FDA has granted approval for ten supplemental PMA applications for our T-SPOT.TB test, including supplements relating to the use of our T-Cell Xtend reagent with our T-SPOT.TB test.
 
510(k) Clearance. Our C6 Lyme ELISA kit has obtained 510(k) clearance from FDA. A traditional 510(k) submission requires demonstration of substantial equivalence to a previous legally marketed device that was not subject to PMA. If a substantial equivalence cannot be demonstrated and the test is of low to moderate risk, the FDA may allow a de novo 510(k) submission. Submission of either a traditional or de novo 510(k) notification is subject to a 90-day FDA review period. Questions from the FDA, requests for additional data and referrals to advisory committees may delay the process considerably and the FDA may ultimately limit the indications for which the device may be marketed. Marketing of an IVD medical device may begin as soon as FDA clearance is granted.
 
Post-marketing regulations and controls 
 
Under the medical device regulations, the FDA regulates quality control and manufacturing procedures by requiring us to demonstrate and maintain compliance with the quality system regulation, which sets forth the FDA’s current good manufacturing practices requirements for medical devices. The FDA monitors compliance with the quality system regulation and current good manufacturing practices requirements by conducting periodic inspections of manufacturing facilities. FDA inspections in the United States are typically unannounced. FDA inspections outside the United States are coordinated with the companies being inspected. Violations of applicable regulations noted by the FDA during inspections of our manufacturing facilities could adversely affect the continued marketing of our tests.
 
The FDA also enforces post-marketing controls that include the requirement to submit product reports to the agency when a manufacturer becomes aware of information suggesting that any of its marketed products may have caused or contributed to a death, serious injury or serious illness or any of its products has malfunctioned and that a recurrence of a malfunction would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury or illness. The FDA relies on product reports to identify product problems and utilizes these reports to determine, among other things, whether it should exercise its enforcement powers. The FDA also enforces the requirement that manufacturers submit reports of recalls and field actions to the FDA if the actions are initiated to reduce a risk to health posed by the device or to remedy a violation of the FDCA that may present a risk to health. The FDA may also require post-market surveillance studies for specified devices.
 
FDA regulations also govern, among other things, the preclinical and clinical testing, manufacture, distribution, labeling and promotion of medical devices and biological products. In addition to compliance with good manufacturing practices and product reporting requirements, we are required to comply with the FDCA’s general controls, including establishment registration, device listing and labeling requirements. If we fail to comply with any requirements under the FDCA, we could be subject to, among other things, fines, injunctions, civil penalties, recalls or product corrections, total or partial suspension of production, denial of premarket notification clearance or approval of products, rescission or withdrawal of clearances and approvals, and criminal prosecution. We cannot assure you that any final FDA policy, once issued, or future laws and regulations concerning the manufacture or marketing of medical devices will not increase the cost and time to market of new or existing tests. If we fail to comply with these FDA regulations or guidelines, we may be subject to warnings from, or enforcement action by, the FDA.

International Medical Device Regulations 
 
International marketing of medical devices is subject to foreign government regulations, which vary substantially from country to country. The European Commission is the legislative body responsible for directives with which manufacturers selling medical products in the European Union and the European Economic Area, or EEA, must comply. The European Union includes most of the major countries in Europe, while other countries, such as Switzerland, are part of the EEA and have voluntarily adopted laws and regulations that mirror those of the European Union with respect to medical devices. The European Union has adopted directives that address regulation of the design, manufacture, labeling, clinical studies and post-market vigilance for medical devices, including IVDs. Devices that comply with the requirements of a relevant directive, including the IVD Directive (Directive 98/79 EC), will be entitled to bear the CE conformity marking, indicating that the device conforms to the essential requirements of the applicable directives and, accordingly, can be marketed throughout the European Union and EEA.
 
Outside of the European Union, regulatory pathways for the marketing of medical devices vary greatly from country to country. In many countries, local regulatory agencies conduct an independent review of IVD medical devices prior to granting marketing approval. For example, in China, approval by the CFDA, must be obtained prior to marketing an IVD medical device. In Japan, approval by the MHLW following review by the Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency, or the PMDA is required prior to marketing an IVD. The process in such countries may be lengthy and require the expenditure of significant resources, including the conduct of clinical trials. In other countries, the regulatory pathway may be shorter and/or less costly. The timeline for the introduction of new IVD medical devices is heavily impacted by these various regulations on a country-by-country basis, which may become more lengthy and costly over time.
 
Our T-SPOT.TB test has been approved for sale in over 50 countries, including in Europe, China, and Japan. Our T-SPOT.TB test obtained a CE mark in 2004, CFDA approval in China in 2010 and re-registration in 2014, and MHLW approval in Japan in 2012. Our T-SPOT.CMV test obtained a CE mark in 2015 and our C6 Lyme ELISA kit obtained a CE mark in 2011.
 
Laboratory certification, accreditation and licensing 
 
Our laboratory located in the United Kingdom operates under accreditation by the United Kingdom Accreditation Service, or UKAS, for the International Standard: ISO 17025:2017 (General requirements for the competence of testing and calibration laboratories). Compliance with this standard is required to maintain accreditation and the continued use of the UKAS logo on our laboratory documentation. National Health Service (NHS)-based customers require that the testing services they procure operate to an accredited quality management system, which is evidenced by the UKAS accreditation. Therefore, a failure to maintain this accreditation could cause us to lose a substantial majority of our U.K. service business.
 
HIPAA and other privacy laws 
 
U.S. Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, or HIPAA, established for the first time in the United States comprehensive protection for the privacy and security of health information. The HIPAA standards apply to three types of organizations, or Covered Entities: health plans, healthcare clearing houses, and healthcare providers that conduct certain healthcare transactions electronically. Covered Entities and their Business Associates, as defined in HIPAA, must have in place administrative, physical, and technical standards to guard against the misuse of individually identifiable health information. Since the divestiture of our U.S. Laboratory Services Business, we are no longer a Covered Entity. We may conduct other activities that may implicate HIPAA, such as conducting clinical studies or entering into specific kinds of relationships with a Covered Entity or a Business Associate of a Covered Entity.
 
If we or our operations are found to be in violation of HIPAA, HITECH or their implementing regulations, we may be subject to penalties, including civil and criminal penalties, fines, and exclusion from participation in U.S. federal or state health care programs, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations. HITECH increased the civil and criminal penalties that may be imposed against Covered Entities, their Business Associates and possibly other persons, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorney’s fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions.
 
Our activities must also comply with international privacy laws that impose restrictions on the access, use, and disclosure of health information. For example, the European General Data Protection Regulation covers personal information of citizens of the European Union and imposes strict penalties for noncompliance. All of these laws may impact our business. Our failure to comply with these privacy laws or significant changes in the laws could significantly impact our business and our future plans.
 
U.S. federal and state “anti-kickback” restrictions 
 
The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, to induce either the referral of an individual, or the furnishing, recommending, or arranging for a good or service, for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. The term “remuneration” is not defined in the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value, including for example, gifts, discounts, the furnishing of supplies or equipment, credit arrangements, payments of cash, waivers of payment, ownership interests and providing anything at less than its fair market value.
 
 10


Many states have also adopted laws similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, some of which apply to the referral of patients for healthcare items or services reimbursed by any source, not only the Medicare and Medicaid programs, and do not contain identical safe harbors.
 
If we or our operations are found to be in violation of any of the laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, exclusion from participation in U.S. federal or state health care programs, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations. We may also be subject to similar foreign laws and regulations.
 
U.S. health care reform 
 
In March 2010, the PPACA was enacted, which included measures that significantly changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers. Changes were made to the PPACA as part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 to remove certain parts of the original legislation and the current Congress continues to make efforts to repeal and/or replace the PPACA. The Physician Payment Sunshine Act, enacted as part of PPACA, has not been repealed and requires medical device manufacturers to track certain financial arrangements with physicians and teaching hospitals, including any “transfer of value” made or distributed to such entities, as well as any investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Manufacturers are required to report this information to CMS. Various states have also implemented regulations prohibiting certain financial interactions with healthcare professionals and/or mandating public disclosure of such financial interactions. We may incur significant costs to comply with such laws and regulations now or in the future.
 
Other laws 
 
We are also subject to numerous U.S. federal, state and local laws as well as international laws relating to such matters as safe working conditions, manufacturing practices, environmental protection, fire hazard control, and transportation and disposal of blood and hazardous or potentially hazardous substances. We may incur significant costs to comply with such laws and regulations now or in the future. 
 
Employees
 
As of December 31, 2018, we had 210 employees. None of our employees is covered under a collective bargaining agreement. We have not experienced any work stoppages and we believe our employee relations are good.
 
Environmental matters
 
Our operations require the use of hazardous materials, which, among other matters, subjects us to a variety of national, state and local environmental, health and safety laws, regulations and permitting requirements, including those relating to the handling, storage, transportation and disposal of biological and hazardous materials and wastes. The primary hazardous materials we handle or use include human blood samples and solvents. Some of the regulations under the current regulatory structure provide for strict liability, holding a party liable for contamination at currently and formerly owned, leased and operated sites and at third-party sites without regard to fault or negligence. We could be held liable for damages and fines as a result of our, or others’, operations or activities should contamination of the environment or individual exposure to hazardous substances occur. We could also be subject to significant fines for failure to comply with applicable environmental, health and safety requirements. We cannot predict how changes in laws or development of new regulations will affect our business operations or the cost of compliance.
