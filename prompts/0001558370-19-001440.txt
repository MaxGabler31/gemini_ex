 Item 1. Business
 Overview
     We are a healthcare technology company disrupting the field of medication safety. For over thirty years, traditional pharmacy software systems have offered clinicians a binary view of drug-to-drug interactions, presenting an assessment of one single drug against one single drug. These legacy systems may be adequate to assess the safety of a medication regimen consisting of only one or two medications. However, the elderly, the chronically ill and those with behavioral health challenges, are more likely to be prescribed more than two medications, and are typically at high risk of an adverse drug event, or ADE. In these populations, many patients take more than 10 different medications a day and other technologies are inadequate to optimize safety and minimize risk. Our novel and proprietary Medication Risk Mitigation Matrix, or MRM Matrix, delivers a simultaneous, multi-drug review which identifies medication-related risks across a variety of safety factors and presents meaningful opportunities to mitigate such risks. We partner with health plans, at-risk provider groups and pharmacies to identify and substantially mitigate the risks associated with ADEs, to personalize medication regimens, and to promote adherence. By working with us, health plans and at-risk provider groups have reduced their pharmacy and medical spend and their hospital admissions rates.
     We are a leader in providing patient-specific, data-driven technology and solutions that enable healthcare organizations to optimize medication regimens to improve patient outcomes, reduce hospitalizations, lower healthcare costs and manage risk. We deliver our solutions through technology-enabled products and services for medication risk management, which includes bundled prescription fulfillment and reminder packaging services for client populations with complex prescription needs. We also provide health plan management services and pharmacy cost management services, which help our clients to properly characterize patient acuity (severity of health condition), optimize and reconcile the associated payments for care, assure vendor compliance with contracted terms and document clinical interactions. 
     Our cloud-based software solutions provide prescribers, pharmacists and healthcare organizations with sophisticated and innovative tools to better manage the medication-related needs of their patients. We believe we offer the first prospective clinical approach to medication risk management, which is designed to increase patient safety and promote adherence to a patient's personalized medication regimen. Furthermore, our medication risk management technology helps healthcare organizations lower costs by reducing ADEs, enhancing quality of care and avoiding preventable hospital admissions. Many of our products and services are built around our novel and proprietary MRM Matrix which enables optimization of a patient's medication regimen, personalized medication selection, dosage levels, and time-of-day administration, and reduction of the total medication burden by eliminating unnecessary prescriptions.
     The MRM Matrix analyzes a combination of clinical and pharmacology data, population-based algorithms and extensive patient-specific data, including medical history, lab results, medication lists and individual genomic data, to deliver "precision medicine" decision support. Some of our software-enabled solutions can be bundled with adherence-focused prescription fulfillment and reminder packaging services, which are informed by a patient's personalized MRM Matrix, through our three prescription fulfillment pharmacies. Our prescription fulfillment pharmacies are strategically located to efficiently distribute medications nationwide for our clients. These pharmacies use cutting-edge packaging technology that promotes adherence to patients' personalized regimens and dosing schedules. Our clinical pharmacists, located in eight call centers throughout the United States, are available to support prescribers at the point of care through our proprietary technology platform, including real-time secure messaging and support health plan members and prescribers with telephonic outreach and interventions based on drug therapy problems identified through the review of historical claims data.
 Our technology-driven approach to medication risk management represents an evolution from prevailing non-personalized approaches that primarily rely on single drug-to-drug interaction analysis. At the end of 2017, we were serving 170 healthcare organizations and, as of December 31, 2018, this number has grown to 224 healthcare organizations that focus on populations with complex healthcare needs and extensive medication requirements.
     Since our first year of active operations in 2011, our revenue has grown to $204.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. For the year ended December 31, 2018, we incurred a net loss of $47.3 million and earned Adjusted EBITDA of $29.3 million. See "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Non-GAAP Financial Measures — Adjusted EBITDA" for our definition of Adjusted EBITDA, why we present Adjusted EBITDA and a reconciliation of net income (loss) to Adjusted EBITDA. We had an annual revenue retention rate of 99% and client retention rate of 96% in 2018. See "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial

 We account for acquisitions using the purchase method of accounting. We allocated the purchase price to the assets acquired, including intangible assets and liabilities assumed, based on estimated fair values at the date of the acquisition. The results of operations from the acquisition are included in our consolidated financial statements from the acquisition date.
     Financing
     On February 12, 2019, we issued and sold convertible senior subordinated notes due 2026 with an aggregate principal amount of $325.0 million, or the 2026 Convertible Notes, in a private placement to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The 2026 Convertible Notes will bear interest at a rate of 1.75% per year, payable semiannually in arrears on February 15 and August 15 of each year, beginning on August 15, 2019. The 2026 Convertible Notes will mature on February 15, 2026, unless earlier converted or repurchased. The initial conversion rate for the notes is 14.2966 shares of our common stock per $1,000 principal amount of notes. This conversion rate is equal to an initial conversion price of approximately $69.95 per share of our common stock. Upon conversion, we will pay or deliver, as the case may be, shares of our common stock, cash or a combination thereof at our option. In connection with the offering of the 2026 Convertible Notes, we entered into convertible note hedge transactions with affiliates of certain of the initial purchasers, or the option counterparties, of the 2026 Convertible Notes pursuant to the terms of call option confirmations. We also entered into warrant transactions with the option counterparties. The convertible note hedge transactions are expected generally to reduce the potential dilution to our common stock upon conversion of the 2026 Convertible Notes and/or offset any potential cash payments we are required to make in excess of the principal amount of converted 2026 Convertible Notes, as the case may be. The warrant transactions could separately have a dilutive effect on our common stock to the extent that the market price per share of our common stock exceeds the strike price of the warrants.
     On September 6, 2017, we entered into an Amended and Restated Loan and Security Agreement, or, as amended, the Amended and Restated 2015 Line of Credit, whereby we amended and restated our revolving line of credit, which was originally entered into on April 29, 2015, and subsequently amended on May 1, 2018, August 31, 2018, October 19, 2018, December 31, 2018 and February 7, 2019.  The Amended and Restated 2015 Line of Credit provides for borrowings in an aggregate amount up to $60.0 million to be used for general corporate purposes, with a $1.0 million sublimit for cash management services and letters of credit and foreign exchange transactions.

             Our Strategy
     Further Penetrate the Programs of All-Inclusive Care for the Elderly Market
     We are the market leader in providing medication risk management to Programs of All-Inclusive Care for the Elderly, or PACE, a Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, sponsored program through which participating healthcare organizations provide fully integrated healthcare delivery on an at-risk basis for elderly adults, most of whom are dually eligible for Medicare and Medicaid. Our medication risk management PACE clients cover approximately 25% of the total PACE enrollees nationwide. 
     We believe that we have a significant opportunity to continue to grow within the PACE market and we expect our PACE clients to continue to grow to cover more eligible lives. This growth may be facilitated by existing state and federal initiatives that present expansion opportunities for PACE, including recently allowing the formation of PACE organizations by for-profit providers, and the creation of other PACE-like, at-risk organizations, many of which would be targets for our solutions. For example, the PACE Innovation Act of 2015 allows CMS to develop pilot programs using the PACE model of care to serve individuals under age 55 and at risk of needing nursing home care as well as other patients with chronic diseases. Recently the National PACE Association launched PACE 2.0, an initiative designed to facilitate the acceleration of growth in the number of PACE enrollees. The goal is to have approximately four times as many enrollees in the program within the next ten years, which would require the annual growth rate to approximately double.
 We have recently organized our PACE offerings under the CareVention HealthCare brand which offers a comprehensive set of solutions to our clients, including medication management and fulfillment, risk adjustment services, third party administrator services and electronic health records software. Working with our scalable solutions can help PACE organizations facilitate their growth.

     Continue Expansion into the Payor and At-Risk Provider Markets
     We believe that the growth in government healthcare programs and the shift to value-based care models are creating opportunities for many organizations to capture growing portions of the expanding healthcare market. Accordingly, we are actively targeting at-risk, value-based markets, including managed care organizations, physician provider groups, and self-insured companies.
     On January 1, 2017, we launched our Enhanced Medication Therapy Management, or EMTM, program, with a large, regional Medicare Part D Prescription Drug Plan, or Regional PDP. To execute this EMTM program, we are using our MRM Matrix and certain other services to perform medication risk stratification and medication safety reviews of complex medication regimens, providing an innovative, alternative approach to pharmacotherapy to the highest risk of the approximately 210,000 members of this Regional PDP, representing less than one percent of the entire eligible Part D market. We believe if we are successful in developing and delivering an EMTM program to the Regional PDP, we will be able to expand into a greater portion of the Part D market. CMS recently reported the results of the first year of the pilot and we exceeded the benchmark set by CMS for the savings in medical expenditures. We expect the pilot will result in a new set of required services being provided under the Medication Therapy Management, or MTM, benefit. All Part D plans will eventually have to conform to these new required services and we believe that through our participation in the pilot, we are one of a few healthcare organizations involved in defining this new service set.
     Medicare is another important market for us to penetrate and we have pursued avenues to accelerate our access to that market. In September 2017, we acquired the SRx business, a MTM company servicing approximately 450 health plans and 8.5 million Medicare lives. We believe the SRx client base is an ideal place to begin to market our medication risk management services to the Medicare market. We also intend to leverage our expertise and experience from our existing clients to expand to other at-risk providers and payors through increased investment in our sales force and marketing efforts.
     Continue to Innovate and Expand Platform Offerings to Meet Evolving Market Needs
     We believe our investments in human capital, technology and services capabilities position us to continue to pursue rapid innovation and expand our medication risk management solutions and other platform offerings to the broader healthcare marketplace. For example, we have developed and launched high-throughput medication risk stratification technology for identification of high-risk patients in need of clinical intervention, and we are developing a patient engagement application of our MRM Matrix solution.  Most recently, in order to expand our MRM Matrix solution, we acquired DoseMe, the developer of DoseMeRx, an advanced precision dosing tool to help physicians and pharmacists accurately dose patients’ high-risk parenteral medications based on individual needs. The addition of the DoseMe tool will allow us to enter markets where there is a high presence of intravenously administered medications.     Selectively Pursue Strategic Acquisitions and Partnerships
     Since our founding in 2009, we have successfully completed and integrated eleven acquisitions, which have significantly expanded our market footprint, enhanced our medication risk management offerings and added valuable complimentary services that can be sold into our existing customer base. We plan to continue to acquire assets and businesses and may enter into strategic partnerships that strengthen or expand our service offerings, capabilities and geographic reach and facilitate our entry into new markets. Our acquisition strategy is driven by our commitment to serving client needs, and we are continuously assessing the market for potential opportunities. 
     For example, in September 2017, we acquired the SRx business, a provider of MTM technology and services for Medicare, Medicaid, and commercial health plans. In 2018, we completed our acquisitions of Peak PACE, an organization that helps PACE organizations manage the business functions that drive the major sources of reimbursement revenue and utilization costs, Mediture, a provider of electronic health records solutions and third party administrator services in the PACE market, and Cognify, a leading electronic health records solutions and services provider in the PACE market. We believe these acquired businesses will give us exposure to a larger customer base that will enable us to leverage our technology in the broader market, as well as offer cross-selling opportunities.

     We believe we are well positioned to provide our products and services to international healthcare organizations that face challenges similar to those that our clients face domestically. Our solutions are readily scalable and can be utilized by healthcare organizations abroad seeking to achieve the IHI Triple Aim. We believe our solutions would provide significant value to the international healthcare landscape, which is frequently characterized by single-payor government-administered healthcare.     Our Core Technology
     Our goal is to enable prescribers to optimize the use of medications using a prospective approach to medication risk management in order to avoid ADEs and improve patient outcomes. Our proprietary science-based technology enables novel approaches for optimizing the medication regimen of individual patients and to overcome challenges associated with prevailing prescribing methodologies.
     Utilizing our MRM Matrix technology, clinicians obtain real-time information about the factors impacting a medication's effectiveness and safety for a particular patient grounded in evidence-based clinical data and extensive patient-specific data. Our technologies deliver prospective intervention and are designed to reduce ADEs, increase medication adherence and quality of care, and improve medication safety at the individual patient level. Our cloud-based applications are scalable, easily accessible to healthcare organizations, seamlessly integrated with client applications and databases, and customizable for use across the healthcare continuum of care. Many of our software systems provide secure communication between prescribers and our pharmacists, and our sophisticated medication decision-support tools are interoperable with many industry-leading electronic health record systems, or EHRs. We believe our innovative technologies offer a means of improving patient outcomes while mitigating medication-related and financial risk for healthcare organizations.
     Our cloud-based software solutions can incorporate comprehensive pharmacotherapy profiles, a combination of proprietary decision-support tools, risk alerts, e-prescribing, advanced precision-dosing functionality, real-time secure messaging and health literacy aids, among other functions. At the core our software is our proprietary MRM Matrix. Through a sophisticated rules engine, the MRM Matrix combines patient-specific data with the science of pharmacokinetics, the effects of what the body does to drugs, and pharmacodynamics, the effects of what the drug does to the body, to enable our clients to personalize the medication regimen of each patient. The MRM Matrix also draws upon pharmacoevidence, which considers published guidelines that denote potentially inappropriate medications for older adults, as well as pharmacoeconomics and efficacy or enhanced quality of life, of one pharmaceutical drug or drug therapy to another.
     The following charts contrast the prevailing approach to prescribing medications, which is often uncoordinated and non-personalized and results in inconsistent and ineffective medication regimens for the same patient, with our personalized approach utilizing our proprietary MRM Matrix.

Using automated, robotic dispensing machines, our scalable, high-performance systems allow for an array of medication packaging options, including multi-dose deep well cards and multi-dose pouches.
     Health Plan Management
     We take a prospective approach to risk adjustment, going beyond the typical strategy of providing retrospective reviews and claims data analysis. We identify opportunities for efficiency and performance improvement in coding patterns, data integrity and diagnosis volumes and trends. Our consultants help clients to refine processes and systems to capture timely, complete and accurate claims data. Our team of expert physicians and nurse consultants trains client staff 

 
  13

 
and providers about documentation and diagnosis coding, analyzes client data collection and submission processes and delivers meaningful analytics for understanding reimbursement complexities.
     Long-term optimization of risk adjustment outcomes is complex and, for many organizations, significantly affects financial performance. We specialize in helping clients optimize processes and systems to capture timely, complete and accurate data. Through these services, we currently help PACE and other healthcare organizations remain compliant with regulations, make reliable comparisons to internal and external benchmarks and identify high-volume/high-cost issues for quality program initiatives.
     We provide third party administrator services that optimize a health plan’s financial management function as well as fulfill regulatory requirements. Our expertise in health plan, particularly in PACE, enable our clients to focus on delivering high-quality care to their members. Our services include enrollment management, accounts receivable, claims adjudication, risk adjustment data submission, encounter data processing and submission and Medicare Part D data submission.
     Pharmacy Cost Management
     We design, implement and manage pharmacy cost-containment strategies for our post-acute care clients. Pharmacy cost management services help our clients reduce risk, increase compliance and optimize spending. For many of our clients, excessive pharmacy costs are a common driver of shrinking profit margins. Complex contract language, atypical dispensing practices and a lack of recourse for pricing errors contribute to inaccurate pharmacy budgets, improper reimbursement and waste. Our analytics provide real-time reporting, simplify drug-spend data and are designed to create contract transparency for our clients. By simplifying and adding oversight to the adjudication process, we help clients avoid risks associated with managing pharmacy costs by preventing overpayments and ensuring appropriate reimbursements.     Our Clients
     Our clients are typically at-risk healthcare organizations, primarily PACE organizations, managed-care organizations, including government and commercial plans, post-acute care facilities, pharmacies and other provider groups. We have strong and long-standing relationships with our clients, providing services under multi-year contracts. At the end of 2016, 2017, and 2018, we were serving 133, 170, and 224 healthcare organizations, respectively. Our annual revenue retention rate was 99%, 99%, and 98% for 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively, and our client retention rate was 96%, 95% and 93%, respectively, which we believe reflects strong client satisfaction with our solutions. During 2017, we signed a master agreement with Trinity Health Corporation covering 11 PACE facilities, which represented 18% of total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017 and 14% of total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2018. Prior to signing this master agreement, each of these PACE facilities had separate contracts with us and were considered separate, individual, clients. For the year ended December 31, 2016 no single client accounted for greater than 10% of revenue. On a combined basis, the 11 PACE facilities, now covered by the master agreement with Trinity Health Corporation, represented 17% of total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016. We believe our clients view us as a trusted partner that shares their commitment to improving medication-related health outcomes and reducing overall healthcare costs.
     PACE Organizations
     PACE, a federal and state collaboration, is one growing model serving the dual-eligible patient population that focuses on averting institutional-based placement. PACE embodies many of the characteristics and trends affecting the healthcare industry as a whole. Our proof of concept was to provide medication risk management technology and services to PACE organizations, which are responsible for elderly patients, typically with complex medication regimens. Over the past eight years, we have become the market-leader in providing PACE with medication risk management. Our PACE clients utilizing our medication risk management services cover approximately 25% of the total PACE enrollees nationwide. In addition to personalized medication management, we also provide health plan management services to PACE organizations.

 Managed Care Organizations
     Since 2004, the number of beneficiaries enrolled in Medicare Advantage, or MA, plans has more than tripled from 5.3 million to 20.4 million in 2018 and is expected to grow to 38 million by 2025. MA is a capitated program with payment rates that are calculated based on the acuity of the patients served. Accordingly, patients are assigned relative risk scores based on diagnosis, which need to be documented accurately each year for appropriate reimbursement. We have become the market leader in risk adjustment and front-end coding for PACE organizations and we plan to continue to expand these services to other MA programs. Furthermore, we believe our solutions are broadly applicable throughout the managed care landscape, including to the self-funded employer groups.
     Acute and Post-Acute Care Providers
     We are the market leader in pharmacy cost management solutions in the post-acute arena, helping facilities manage their pharmacy spend for their capitated patients. Our clients include approximately 1,300 of the more than 15,400 post-acute facilities in the United States. We believe there are significant opportunities to cross-sell our medication risk management solutions within this client base.
     At-Risk Provider Groups
     We contract with at-risk provider groups across the country for care transitions support and comprehensive medication management services.  We risk-stratify patient cohorts for these groups and identify patients at risk of an ADE. We then collaborate with these groups on appropriate levels of intervention to mitigate that risk. These interventions are performed by our clinical teams or in some cases the interventions are performed by employees of the at-risk provider.     Intellectual Property
     We create, own and maintain various intellectual property assets which, in the aggregate, are of material importance to our business. Our intellectual property assets include: one patent and twelve pending patent applications related to our innovations, products and services; trademarks related to our brands, products and services; copyrights in software, documentation, content and databases; and trade secrets relating to data processing, statistical methodologies, data security and other aspects of our business. We are licensed to use certain technology and other intellectual property rights owned and controlled by others, and, similarly, other companies are licensed on a non-exclusive basis to use certain technology and other intellectual property rights owned and controlled by us.
     We rely on patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws as well as confidentiality agreements, licenses and other agreements with employees, consultants, vendors and clients. We also seek to control access to and distribution of our proprietary software, confidential information and know-how, technology and other intellectual property. We have one issued patent for our medication management system and method, which is U.S. Pat. No. 8,392,220, issued on March 5, 2013. This issued patent expires on November 8, 2031. We also have five patent applications pending in the United States.  The first application, Application No. 14/579,283, filed on December 22, 2014 relates to medication risk mitigation systems and methods.  The second application, Application No. 15/008,555, filed on January 28, 2016, relates to medication risk mitigation matrix systems and methods. The third application, Application No. 16/026,686, filed on July 3, 2018, relates to medication regimens and associated methods.  The fourth application, Application No. 16,302,824, filed on November 19, 2018, relates to methods of treatment having reduced drug-related toxicity and methods of identifying the likelihood of patient harm arising from prescribed medications.  This application also has related foreign counterpart applications in Canada, China, Japan, Mexico and Europe. The fifth application, Application No. PCT/US2018/058405 filed on Oct 31, 2018 is related to population-based medication risk stratification and personalized medication risk score.  We also have a pending design patent application, Application No. 29/643,059, filed on April 4, 2018, related to a user interface for medication analysis.

         Our Competitive Landscape
     We compete with a broad and diverse set of businesses. We believe the competitive landscape is highly fragmented with no single competitor offering similarly expansive capabilities and solution offerings in medication risk management. Our competitive advantage is largely based on our analytical capabilities, healthcare industry expertise, breadth and depth of services, intellectual property, the size and quality of our underlying datasets and benchmarks, ease of use, reputation, innovation, security, price, reliability and client service. Our primary competitive challenge is to demonstrate to our existing and potential clients the value of utilizing our platforms rather than developing or assembling their own alternative capabilities or utilizing providers offering a subset of our services. However, we believe that the combination of our competitive strengths and successful culture of innovation, including our industry-leading analytics, the real-world-tested nature of our platforms and subject matter expertise of our associates, make it time and cost prohibitive for our clients or competitors to replace or replicate all that we offer without facing material risk.
     Current industry players providing medication risk management and related service offerings include large and small healthcare data analytics and consulting companies, community or long-term care pharmacies, national pharmacy providers, health plans, genomic testing labs and healthcare information technology companies, among others. Many of our competitors' solutions are regulatory-driven, retrospective in nature and offer no intervention at the point of care. The services offered by these organizations may include e-prescribing and EHRs utilizing single drug-to-drug interaction analysis, lab-based genomic evaluation, basic risk stratification solutions and other prevailing approaches to medication therapy management. Many health plans attempt to address non-adherence through outreach efforts, which often require the intervention of in-house or third-party consultants and have low success rates. Some healthcare information technology providers offer risk adjustment and pharmacy cost management services, but lack the comprehensive solutions we provide. Many genomic testing labs lack the ability to apply patient test results in a useful way at the point of care. Post-acute providers typically employ pharmacist consultants to review prescription regimens every 30 days, which is retrospective in nature and generally ineffective in improving patient outcomes. Furthermore, typical prescription fulfillment models are reimbursed on a fee-for-service basis and are incentivized based on prescription dispensing volumes. Our clients partner with us in order to prospectively address ADEs, lower healthcare costs and improve overall health outcomes, which often involves utilizing our software to reduce the number of prescriptions per patient to optimize prescription regimens.
     While we believe that no competitor provides the breadth of our suite of solutions, we nevertheless compete with other companies with regards to specific products or solutions and markets or care settings. We expect that competition will continue to increase as a result of consolidation in both the information technology and healthcare industries. The anticipated growth in healthcare spending, the shift to a value-based payment model, the rise of consumerism and changes in government regulation may draw increasing attention to healthcare data and analytics, and new competitors, such as management consultants, technology companies and start-ups may enter the market, and we may face increased competition from these sources.
     Healthcare Regulatory Environment
     We operate in a highly regulated industry and our business operations must comply with a number of complex and evolving federal and state agency requirements. While we believe we comply in all material respects with applicable healthcare laws and regulations, these laws can vary significantly from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, and the state and federal interpretation of existing laws and regulations, and their enforcement, may change from time to time. Additionally, a state or federal government enforcement body may disagree that we are in material compliance with applicable healthcare laws and regulations. Federal and state legislatures also may enact various legislative proposals that could materially impact certain aspects of our business.
     A non-exhaustive list of federal and state statutes, regulations, sub-regulatory guidance and contractual provisions that may apply to our business activities include:

 Healthcare Legislation
     In 2010, Congress passed major health reform legislation, mostly through the Affordable Care Act (ACA). Generally, the ACA was designed to expand coverage for the uninsured while at the same time containing overall healthcare costs. Following passage, the U.S. government has issued numerous rules and regulations to implement the provisions of the Act. While not all of these rules, regulations, and reforms affect our business directly, many continue to affect the coverage and plan designs that are or will be provided by many of our clients.
     The Trump Administration and the United States Congress, which now is divided with Democrats controlling the House and Republicans controlling the Senate, are considering a number of competing legislative and regulatory proposals which could, if passed into law, impact the healthcare system, the ACA, and/or the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Congress may take up legislation to reduce prescription drug costs, increase price transparency for consumers, restrict the sale of certain classes of drugs, and reform medication management practices, among others. While not all of the potential legislation, if enacted, would affect our business directly, many could impact some or many of our business arrangements directly or indirectly.  Given that legislative and regulatory change is still being formulated, we cannot predict with any certainty the outcome of any future legislation or regulation.
     A case currently pending before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, Texas v. U.S., challenges the constitutionality of the ACA. The action, brought by various state attorneys general, alleges the U.S. Congress invalidated the ACA when it zeroed out the tax-based shared responsibility payment, commonly known as the “individual mandate,” under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (Pub. L. 115-97). A procedural stay, granted by the lower court, leaves the ACA intact while the case remains under appeal. The Democratic-led U.S. House of Representatives has moved to intervene in the case. The changing wave in Congress could the trajectory of how the case will be prosecuted from the Government’s perspective, and may bode well for the ACA long term. The environment regarding the provisions of the ACA has somewhat stabilized, but specific outcomes are difficult to predict.  The timeframe for conclusion and final outcome of this litigation is uncertain given the possibility of appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court. A decision in Texas v. U.S. to change or invalidate the ACA could have a materially adverse effect on future business and operating results.
     On Oct. 24, 2018, President Trump signed legislation into law aimed at curbing the opioid crisis in the U.S. The Substance Use-Disorder Prevention that Promotes Opioid Recovery and Treatment for Patients and Communities Act (Pub. L. 115-271), or SUPPORT Act, includes provisions that address law enforcement, public health, and coverage under the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Broad in scope, the legislation increases federal oversight with respect to the production and distribution of opioids, bolsters fraud prevention safeguards, enhances oversight of prescription opioids, expands coverage of opioid addiction treatment services, and authorizes consumer education and provider training programs aimed at preventing and treating opioid use disorders. 
     Given the focus on addressing the opioid epidemic and the repeated call by the Administration to improve transparency in drug pricing and oversight, the legislative environment surrounding prescription drug is in flux. While not all legislative reforms affect our business directly, many continue to affect the coverage and plan designs that are or will be provided by many of our clients.
     On October 10, 2018, two pieces of legislation were enacted to enhance drug price transparency. The Know the Lowest Price Act (Pub. L. 115-262) and the Patient Right to Know Drug Prices Act (Pub. L. 115-263), each prevent various parties from instituting “gag” orders or clauses against pharmacists and pharmacies, which heretofore may have prevented a pharmacist from disclosing the lowest available price of a drug to a consumer.  These laws may have a financial impact on various stakeholders due to pressures to develop more competitive pricing. It is not clear how these changes might affect our business.
     PACE Organizations
     Our partnership with PACE organizations is a significant source of our current revenue stream. The PACE program is a unique, comprehensive managed care benefit for certain frail elderly individuals, most of whom are dually eligible for Medicare and Medicaid benefits, provided by a not-for-profit or public entity. The PACE program features a comprehensive medical and social service delivery system using an interdisciplinary team approach in an adult day health center that is supplemented by in-home and referral services in accordance with participants' needs. Financing for the program is capped, which allows providers to deliver all services participants need rather than only those

reimbursable under Medicare and Medicaid fee-for-service plans. PACE is a program under Medicare, and states can elect to provide PACE services to Medicaid program beneficiaries as an optional Medicaid benefit. The PACE program becomes the sole source of Medicaid and Medicare benefits for PACE participants.
     As PACE organization contractors, we are subject to numerous contractual obligations imposed by our partner organizations, as well as to various audit and certification requirements.
     HIPAA Healthcare Fraud Provisions
     HIPAA also created additional federal criminal statutes regarding fraud. Specifically, the HIPAA healthcare fraud statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully executing or attempting to execute a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, or to obtain by false or fraudulent pretenses any of the money or property owned by a healthcare benefit program, knowingly and willfully embezzling or stealing from a healthcare benefit program, and willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a healthcare offense. The HIPAA healthcare fraud statutes also prohibit, among other things, concealing a material fact or making a materially false statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. The ACA amended the intent standard for certain healthcare fraud statutes under HIPAA, like the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. Those found to have aided in a violation of these prohibitions are deemed by statute to have committed the offense and are punishable as a principal offender. More recently, the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 (H.R. 1892) enhanced the penalties associated with Anti-Kickback Statute violates.     State and Federal Data Privacy and Security Laws
     We process, collect, use and disclose individual patient data for patients directly or for our clients and therefore, are subject to various laws protecting privacy and security of the patient information. Certain segments of our company qualify as a "Covered Entity" under HIPAA, and others qualify as a "Business Associate" to our partners who are Covered Entities and as such we are required to comply with HIPAA and the HITECH Act, as implemented through regulations promulgated thereunder by HHS, including the HIPAA Omnibus Final Rule, the HIPAA Privacy Rule and the HIPAA Security Rule. HIPAA generally requires Covered Entities and their Business Associates to adopt certain safeguards to ensure the privacy and security of protected health information, or PHI, and to limit uses and disclosures of such PHI to those permissible under the law. When Covered Entities utilize Business Associates to provide services, pursuant to which the Business Associate may access the Covered Entity's PHI, the parties must enter into a Business Associate agreement through which the Business Associate must contractually agree to safeguard PHI in certain ways and to notify the Covered Entity of improper uses or disclosures of PHI.
     Covered Entities and Business Associates are required to have written policies and procedures addressing HIPAA compliance and must designate a Security Officer to oversee the development and implementation of the policies and procedures related to the safeguards to protect privacy of electronic PHI. Covered Entities must also designate a Privacy Officer, although the Privacy Officer and the Security Officer may be the same person. As part of their security policies and procedures, Covered Entities and Business Associates are required to conduct periodic risk assessments to identify vulnerabilities to electronic PHI. Additionally, Covered Entities and Business Associates are required to train all employees on their HIPAA policies and procedures. Further, in the event of a breach of PHI as defined by HIPAA, Covered Entities must notify affected individuals, HHS and sometimes the media, as well as take steps to mitigate damage, and they may be subject to fines and penalties. HIPAA violations can result in significant civil monetary penalties and/or imprisonment for up to ten years depending on the facts surrounding the violation.
     Many states also have similar data privacy and security laws that track federal requirements or impose different and/or more stringent conditions for use and disclosure of PHI. Failure to comply with these laws may also result in the imposition of significant civil and/or criminal penalties. The California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, or  the CCPA, will impose rules governing how businesses handle personal data of California residents. Companies that do business in California will be required to disclose the types of data they collect, the purpose for the data collection, how the data will be used, as well as expand organizational responsibilities pertaining to individual rights, accountability, and governance. Companies subject to the CCPA must comply by January 1, 2020.

 Federal and State Oversight of Medical Devices, Genomic Testing, Drugs, and Controlled Substances 
     Some technologies and software applications used in connection with healthcare analytics and genomic testing and analysis are considered medical devices and are subject to regulation by the Food and Drug Administration, or the FDA. The 21st Century Cures Act (Pub. L. 114-255), enacted in December 2016, included certain changes to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to exempt certain medical-related software from FDA regulation. In December 2017, FDA issued a draft guidance document, Clinical and Patient Decision Support Software, which set forth FDA’s proposed interpretation of the exemption under the 21st Century Cures Act for clinical decision support, or CDS, software. Although we believe that our technologies and software are not subject to active FDA regulation, there is a risk that the FDA could disagree. There is also a risk that FDA could final finalize its guidance for Clinical and Patient Decision Support Software in such a way that it excludes our software and technologies from the scope of the CDS exemption under the 21st Century Cures Act. If the FDA determines that any of our current or future services, technologies or software applications are regulated by the FDA as medical devices, we would become subject to various statutes, regulations and policies enforced by the FDA and other governmental authorities including both premarket and post-market requirements, and we would need to bring the affected services, technologies, and/or software into compliance with such requirements. FDA could also require that we cease marketing and/or recall the affected services, technologies, and software unless and until we bring them into compliance with FDA’s requirements.
     Clinical laboratories that perform human genomic testing are subject to oversight by CMS and state regulators.  The laboratories that we partner with for genomic testing must comply with the relevant CMS and state laws and regulations applicable to clinical laboratories and genomic testing.
     The Drug Enforcement Administration, or DEA, the FDA, and state regulators, such as state boards of pharmacy, regulate drug and controlled substance packaging, repackaging, purchasing, handling, storage, distribution, security, and dispensing activities. Our prescription fulfillment pharmacies must comply with the applicable FDA, DEA, and state statutes, regulations, and policies.  In addition, our prescription fulfillment pharmacies may be subject to periodic audits by state regulators, the DEA, and/or the FDA to assess our compliance with these requirements. 
     Noncompliance with applicable federal or state requirements, as described above, can result in an enforcement action that could substantially harm our business.
     Anti-Kickback Laws
     The federal Anti-Kickback Statute, or AKS, makes it unlawful for individuals or entities, among other things, to knowingly and willfully solicit, offer, receive or pay any kickback, bribe or other remuneration, directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, in exchange for or to induce or reward the referral of an individual to a person for the furnishing or arranging for the furnishing of any item or service for which payment may be made in whole or in part under a federal healthcare program, or the purchase, lease or order, or arranging for or recommending purchasing, leasing or ordering, any good, facility, service or item for which payment may be made in whole or in part under a federal healthcare program. Penalties for violations include criminal penalties and civil sanctions such as fines, imprisonment and possible exclusion from federal healthcare programs. More recently, the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 (H.R. 1892) enhanced the penalties associated with Anti-Kickback Statute violates.
     The federal AKS is an intent-based statute, but following amendment from the ACA, a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. Further, the failure of an arrangement to satisfy all elements of an AKS safe harbor will not necessarily make it illegal, but it may subject that arrangement to increased scrutiny by enforcement authorities. The federal AKS is applicable to us as operators of specialty pharmacies, contractors to health plans and providers, as well as contractors to various federal healthcare program payors. When our compensation arrangements implicate the AKS and/or state anti-kickback laws we evaluate whether we believe they fall within one of the safe harbors. If not, we consider the factors to identify the intent behind such arrangements and the relative risk of fraud and abuse. We also design business models that seek to reduce the risk that any such arrangements might be viewed as abusive and trigger AKS scrutiny or claims.
     In addition to the federal AKS, many states have anti-kickback prohibitions that may apply to arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by non-governmental third-party payors.

 Federal and State Self-Referral Laws
     The federal physician self-referral law, often referred to as the Stark Law, with limited exceptions, prohibits physicians from referring Medicare Program or Medicaid patients to an entity for the provision of certain designated health services, among them outpatient prescription medications, if the physician or a member of such physician's immediate family has a direct or indirect financial relationship (including an ownership or investment interest or a compensation arrangement) with the entity. The Stark Law also prohibits the entity from billing Medicare or Medicaid for such designated health services. A referral that does not fall within a statutory exception is strictly prohibited by the Stark Law. A violation of the Stark Law is punishable by civil sanctions, including overpayment liability, significant fines and exclusion from participation in Medicare and Medicaid Programs.
     We evaluate when these physician (or immediate family member) financial arrangements are created to strive to ensure we do not enter into a prohibited financial relationship and design structures that satisfy exceptions under the Stark Law.
     Our business may implicate federal and state physician self-referral laws to the extent our pharmacy, a designated health services entity, has financial arrangements in the form of ownership, investment or compensation with referring physicians or a referring physician's immediate family member. No physician has an ownership or investment interest in our business, but our pharmacy may have compensation arrangements with physicians who serve on its Clinical Advisory Panel and who order designated health services for patients enrolled in a PACE program. If any such compensation arrangements exist, we believe such compensation arrangements fall within an exception to the physician self-referral prohibition.
     A number of states have statutes and regulations that prohibit the same general types of conduct as those prohibited by the Stark Law, but some have even broader application, extending beyond Medicare and Medicaid Programs and including commercial and self payors.
     Federal and State False Claims Acts
     The federal false claims and civil monetary penalties laws, including the civil False Claims Act, impose criminal and civil liability on individuals and entities that, among other things, knowingly submit, or cause to be submitted, false or fraudulent claims for payment to the federal government or knowingly make, or cause to be made, a false statement in order to have a false claim paid. The civil False Claims Act provides for treble damages and mandatory and significant minimum penalties per false claim or statement ($10,781.40 to $21,562.80 per false claim). The qui tam or whistleblower provisions of the civil False Claims Act permit a private individual to bring actions on behalf of the federal government alleging that the defendant has submitted a false claim to the federal government, and to share in any monetary recovery. Our future activities relating to the manner in which we sell and market our services may be subject to scrutiny under these laws. False Claims Act qui tam lawsuits in healthcare are common, although the government often declines to pursue such actions following investigation. Analogous state false claims laws also may apply to our sales or marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by non-governmental third party payors.     Other State Laws
     The vast majority, if not all states have laws regulating licensure, registration and certification of pharmacies, pharmacists, pharmacy technicians and other pharmacy personnel. We are licensed in all states that require such licensure in which we do business and believe that we substantially comply with all state licensing laws applicable to our business. Where required by law, we also have pharmacists licensed in all states in which we dispense. If we violate state pharmacy licensure laws or engage in conduct prohibited under our license, we could be subject to enforcement action, including but not limited to suspension or loss of such pharmacy license
     The DEA, as well as some similar state agencies, requires our pharmacy locations to individually register in order to handle controlled substances, including prescription pharmaceuticals. Federal and various state laws also regulate specific labeling, reporting and record-keeping aspects related to controlled substances. We maintain DEA registrations for each of our facilities that require such registration and follow procedures intended to comply with all applicable federal and state requirements regarding dispensing controlled substances.
