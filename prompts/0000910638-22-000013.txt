Business Strategy
Accelerating Additive Manufacturing Adoption
We partner with customers to enable them to adopt and scale additive manufacturing in their production environments. We believe that our additive manufacturing capabilities can help customers solve a number of design and manufacturing challenges – such as improved lead times, enhanced design freedom, part consolidation and the ability for mass customization. We believe we have both the scale and the breadth of technologies, encompassing hardware platforms, materials and software, that our customers require for the successful implementation of additive manufacturing into their design and manufacturing processes. Using a strong application focus in each of our two business segments, we integrate our printer, material and software technologies in unique combinations to solve a customer’s product need. Once complete, we can scale the process for the customer to a certain production level through our Advanced Manufacturing solutions, and, with increasing demand, we can enable a customer to continue scaling to high volumes. This transfer of the workflow involves providing the printing systems, materials and software, along with the process definition, that results in a seamless transfer of capability to the manufacturer. We expect the result of this approach to drive recurring revenue streams as customers adopt additive manufacturing solutions and consume materials to produce parts, utilize software to manage the print process and manufacturing operations, and make use of our service offerings for maintenance and upgrades. Our proficiency in providing industry focused application and solution development for customers includes a number of internal assets and capabilities, including:
a.A full range of additive manufacturing hardware technologies and materials to address needs in metals, plastics, wax and bioprinting
b.A services infrastructure that includes industry and technology application experts, customer innovation and advanced manufacturing centers and post-sale service and support
c.A software suite that enables end-to-end additive manufacturing including design, simulation, process management and manufacturing execution 
d.Scale that includes significant and diverse experience in production parts and applications combined with a global reach to service our customers worldwide
As part of our strategy to enable customers to adopt additive manufacturing, in November 2021 we acquired Oqton, a software company that is a leader in the creation of a new breed of intelligent, cloud-based Manufacturing Operating System (MOS) platform. This platform is tailored for flexible production environments that increasingly utilize a range of advanced manufacturing and automation technologies, including additive manufacturing solutions, in their production workflows. The cloud-based solution leverages the Industrial Internet of Things, artificial intelligence, and machine learning technologies to deliver solutions to customers seeking to automate their digital manufacturing workflows, scale their operations and enhance their competitive position. In addition, in May 2021, we announced the acquisition of Additive Works, a Germany-based software company focused upon simulation-based optimization and automation of the additive manufacturing print preparation and workflow. This highly automated simulation software increases productivity by reducing set-up time while improving product yield, throughput, and component performance. 
Investing in Regenerative Medicine
As an early and continuing innovator in additive manufacturing, we have significant experience in bringing this technology to new markets. In 2021, we announced an expansion of our focus and investments in the application of additive manufacturing for regenerative medicine. Our approach in regenerative medicine involves three strategies. The first strategy is the use of additive manufacturing for human organ transplantation. Each year, end-stage organ failure kills millions of people. However, the supply of donated organs is insufficient to meet the needs of patients seeking transplantation. In 2021, we announced an expansion of our organ printing development program, including our work with a key strategic partner. This program was first established in 2017 and combines our 3D printing expertise with the regenerative medicine and biotechnology expertise of our partner. To date, our program has had a focus on developing the capability to print scaffolds for human lungs, with a long-term goal of allowing all patients with end-stage lung disease to receive transplants which will enable them to enjoy long and active lives. Based upon the progress made toward this goal, the program was expanded to include two additional human organs.
Our second strategy involves the application of our bio-printing technology to non-organ human applications. We are focused on internal development, often in conjunction with strategic or development partners, of applications that combine our bio-printing and materials expertise with the application expertise of our partners.
Our third regenerative medicine strategy extends our bio-printing technologies into research labs, providing advanced printing systems and unique biological materials to those that advance the science of medicine. We believe our ability to print high-precision, three-dimensional vascularized cellular structures can be used in a number of research areas such as the development of new, more effective drug therapies.
To support our regenerative medicine efforts, in December 2021 we acquired Volumetric, a biotech company whose mission is to develop the ability to manufacture human organs using bioprinting methods and the underlying technologies required to create these highly complex biological structures. This acquisition is expected to supplement and expand our existing capabilities in bioprinting and regenerative medicine. In addition, in May 2021, we announced the acquisition of Allevi, a developer of bioprinting solutions, comprising of bioprinters, biomaterials, and specialized laboratory software.
