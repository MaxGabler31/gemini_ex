ITEM 1. BUSINESS.
OUR BUSINESS



Overview 



We are an acquisition holding company focused on acquiring and managing a group of small businesses, which we characterize as those that have an enterprise value of less than $50 million, in a variety of different industries headquartered in North America. To date, we have completed six acquisitions and subsequently spun off two of the acquired companies.



On May 28, 2020, our subsidiary 1847 Asien Inc., or 1847 Asien, acquired Asien’s Appliance, Inc., a California corporation, or Asien’s. Asien’s has been in business since 1948 serving the North Bay area of Sonoma County, California. It provides a wide variety of appliance services, including sales, delivery/installation, in-home service and repair, extended warranties, and financing. Its main focus is delivering personal sales and exceptional service to its customers at competitive prices.



On September 30, 2020, our subsidiary 1847 Cabinet Inc., or 1847 Cabinet, acquired Kyle’s Custom Wood Shop, Inc., an Idaho corporation, or Kyle’s. Kyle’s is a leading custom cabinetry maker servicing contractors and homeowners since 1976 in Boise, Idaho and the surrounding area. Kyle’s focuses on designing, building, and installing custom cabinetry primarily for custom and semi-custom builders.



On March 30, 2021, our subsidiary 1847 Wolo Inc., or 1847 Wolo, acquired Wolo Mfg. Corp., a New York corporation, and Wolo Industrial Horn & Signal, Inc., a New York corporation (which we collectively refer to as Wolo). Headquartered in Deer Park, New York and founded in 1965, Wolo designs and sells horn and safety products (electric, air, truck, marine, motorcycle and industrial equipment), and offers vehicle emergency and safety warning lights for cars, trucks, industrial equipment and emergency vehicles.



On October 8, 2021, our subsidiary 1847 Cabinet acquired High Mountain Door & Trim Inc., a Nevada corporation, or High Mountain, and Sierra Homes, LLC d/b/a Innovative Cabinets & Design, a Nevada limited liability company, or Innovative Cabinets. Headquartered in Reno, Nevada and founded in 2014, High Mountain specializes in all aspects of finished carpentry products and services, including doors, door frames, base boards, crown molding, cabinetry, bathroom sinks and cabinets, bookcases, built-in closets, and fireplace mantles, among others, working primarily with large homebuilders of single-family homes and commercial and multi-family developers. Innovative Cabinets is headquartered in Reno, Nevada and was founded in 2008. It specializes in custom cabinetry and countertops for a client base consisting of single-family homeowners, builders of multi-family homes, as well as commercial clients.



Our first acquisition was on March 3, 2017, pursuant to which our subsidiary 1847 Neese Inc., or 1847 Neese, acquired Neese, Inc., or Neese, a business specializing in providing a wide range of land application services and selling equipment and parts in Grand Junction, Iowa. On April 19, 2021, we sold 1847 Neese back to the original owners.



On April 5, 2019, our subsidiary 1847 Goedeker Inc., or 1847 Goedeker, acquired substantially all of the assets of Goedeker Television Co., or Goedeker Television, a one-stop e-commerce destination for home furnishings, including appliances, furniture, home goods and related products. On October 23, 2020, we distributed all of the shares of 1847 Goedeker that we held to our shareholders, so we no longer own 1847 Goedeker.



Through our structure, we offer investors an opportunity to participate in the ownership and growth of a portfolio of businesses that traditionally have been owned and managed by private equity firms, private individuals or families, financial institutions or large conglomerates. We believe that our management and acquisition strategies will allow us to achieve our goals to grow regular distributions to our common shareholders and increasing common shareholder value over time.



We seek to acquire controlling interests in small businesses that we believe operate in industries with long-term macroeconomic growth opportunities, and that have positive and stable earnings and cash flows, face minimal threats of technological or competitive obsolescence and have strong management teams largely in place. We believe that private company operators and corporate parents looking to sell their businesses will consider us to be an attractive purchaser of their businesses. We make these businesses our majority-owned subsidiaries and actively manage and grow such businesses. We expect to improve our businesses over the long term through organic growth opportunities, add-on acquisitions and operational improvements.

Our Market Opportunity



We acquire and manage small businesses, which we characterize as those that have an enterprise value of less than $50 million. We believe that the merger and acquisition market for small businesses is highly fragmented and provides significant opportunities to purchase businesses at attractive prices. For example, according to GF Data, platform acquisitions with enterprise values greater than $50.0 million commanded valuation premiums 30% higher than platform acquisitions with enterprise values less than $50.0 million (8.2x trailing twelve month adjusted EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization) versus 6.3x trailing twelve month adjusted EBITDA, respectively).



We believe that the following factors contribute to lower acquisition multiples for small businesses:




● | there are typically fewer potential acquirers for these businesses; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | third-party financing generally is less available for these acquisitions; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | sellers of these businesses may consider non-economic factors, such as continuing board membership or the effect of the sale on their employees; and 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | these businesses are generally less frequently sold pursuant to an auction process. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




We believe that our management team’s strong relationships with business brokers, investment and commercial bankers, accountants, attorneys and other potential sources of acquisition opportunities offers us substantial opportunities to purchase small businesses. See Item 10“Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance” for more information about our management team.



We also believe that significant opportunities exist to improve the performance of the businesses upon their acquisition. In the past, our manager has acquired businesses that are often formerly owned by seasoned entrepreneurs or large corporate parents. In these cases, our manager has frequently found that there have been opportunities to further build upon the management teams of acquired businesses. In addition, our manager has frequently found that financial reporting and management information systems of acquired businesses may be improved, both of which can lead to substantial improvements in earnings and cash flow. Finally, because these businesses tend to be too small to have their own corporate development efforts, we believe opportunities exist to assist these businesses in meaningful ways as they pursue organic or external growth strategies that were often not pursued by their previous owners.



Our Strategy 



Our long-term goals are to grow regular distributions to our common shareholders and to increase common shareholder value over the long-term. We plan to continue focusing on acquiring businesses. Therefore, we intend to continue to identify, perform due diligence on, negotiate and consummate platform acquisitions of small businesses in attractive industry sectors.



Unlike buyers of small businesses that rely on significant leverage to consummate acquisitions (as demonstrated by the data presented by total enterprise value, or TEV, below), we plan to limit the use of third-party (i.e., external) acquisition leverage so that our debt will not exceed the market value of the assets we acquire and so that our debt to EBITDA ratio will not exceed 1.25x to 1 for our operating subsidiaries. We believe that limiting leverage in this manner will avoid the imposition on stringent lender controls on our operations that would otherwise potentially hamper the growth of our operating subsidiaries and otherwise harm our business even during times when we have positive operating cash flows. Additionally, in our experience, leverage rarely leads to “break-out” returns and often creates negative return outcomes that are not correlated with the profitability of the business.

Management Strategy



Our management strategy involves the identification, performance of due diligence, negotiation and consummation of acquisitions. After acquiring businesses, we attempt to grow the businesses both organically and through add-on or bolt-on acquisitions. Add-on or bolt-on acquisitions are acquisitions by a company of other companies in the same industry. Following the acquisition of companies, we seek to grow the earnings and cash flow of acquired companies and, in turn, grow regular distributions to our common shareholders and to increase common shareholder value over time. We believe we can increase the cash flows of our businesses by applying our intellectual capital to improve and grow our businesses.



We seek to acquire and manage small businesses. We believe that the merger and acquisition market for small businesses is highly fragmented and provides opportunities to purchase businesses at attractive prices. We believe we will be able to acquire small businesses for multiples ranging from three to six times EBITDA. We also believe, and our manager has historically found, that significant opportunities exist to improve the performance of these businesses upon their acquisition.



In general, our manager oversees and supports the management team of our businesses by, among other things:




● | recruiting and retaining managers to operate our businesses by using structured incentive compensation programs, including minority equity ownership, tailored to each business; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | regularly monitoring financial and operational performance, instilling consistent financial discipline, and supporting management in the development and implementation of information systems; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

● | assisting the management teams of our businesses in their analysis and pursuit of prudent organic growth strategies; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | identifying and working with business management teams to execute on attractive external growth and acquisition opportunities; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | identifying and executing operational improvements and integration opportunities that will lead to lower operating costs and operational optimization; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | providing the management teams of our businesses the opportunity to leverage our experience and expertise to develop and implement business and operational strategies; and 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | forming strong subsidiary level boards of directors to supplement management teams in their development and implementation of strategic goals and objectives. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




We also believe that our long-term perspective provides us with certain additional advantages, including the ability to:




● | recruit and develop management teams for our businesses that are familiar with the industries in which our businesses operate; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | focus on developing and implementing business and operational strategies to build and sustain shareholder value over the long term; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | create sector-specific businesses enabling us to take advantage of vertical and horizontal acquisition opportunities within a given sector; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | achieve exposure in certain industries in order to create opportunities for future acquisitions; and 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | develop and maintain long-term collaborative relationships with customers and suppliers. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




We intend to continually increase our intellectual capital as we operate our businesses and acquire new businesses and as our manager identifies and recruits qualified operating partners and managers for our businesses.



Acquisition Strategy 



Our acquisition strategies involve the acquisition of small businesses in various industries that we expect will produce positive and stable earnings and cash flow, as well as achieve attractive returns on our invested capital. In this respect, we expect to make acquisitions in industries wherein we believe an acquisition presents an attractive opportunity from the perspective of both (i) return on assets or equity and (ii) an easily identifiable path for growing the acquired businesses. We believe that attractive opportunities will increasingly present themselves as private sector owners seek to monetize their interests in longstanding and privately held businesses and large corporate parents seek to dispose of their “non-core” operations.



We believe that the greatest opportunities for generating consistently positive annual returns and, ultimately, residual returns on capital invested in acquisitions will result from targeting capital light businesses operating in niche geographical markets with a clearly identifiable competitive advantage within the following industries: business services, consumer services, consumer products, consumable industrial products, industrial services, niche light manufacturing, distribution, alternative/specialty finance and in select cases, specialty retail. While we believe that the professional experience of our management team within the industries identified above will offer the greatest number of acquisition opportunities, we will not eschew opportunities if a business enjoys an inarguable moat around its products and services in an industry which our management team may have less familiarity.



From a financial perspective, we expect to make acquisitions of small businesses that are stable, have minimal bad debt, and strong accounts receivable. In addition, we expect to acquire companies that have been able to generate positive pro forma cash available for distribution for a minimum of three years prior to acquisition. Our previous acquisitions met these acquisition criteria.

We benefit from our manager’s ability to identify diverse acquisition opportunities in a variety of industries. In addition, we rely upon our management teams’ experience and expertise in researching and valuing prospective target businesses, as well as negotiating the ultimate acquisition of such target businesses. In particular, because there may be a lack of information available about these target businesses, which may make it more difficult to understand or appropriately value such target businesses, our manager will:




● | engage in a substantial level of internal and third-party due diligence; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | critically evaluate the management team; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | identify and assess any financial and operational strengths and weaknesses of any target business; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | analyze comparable businesses to assess financial and operational performances relative to industry competitors; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | actively research and evaluate information on the relevant industry; and 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | thoroughly negotiate appropriate terms and conditions of any acquisition. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




The process of acquiring new businesses is time-consuming and complex. Our manager has historically taken from 2 to 24 months to perform due diligence on, negotiate and close acquisitions. Although we expect our manager to be at various stages of evaluating several transactions at any given time, there may be significant periods of time during which it does not recommend any new acquisitions to us.



Upon an acquisition of a new business, we rely on our manager’s experience and expertise to work efficiently and effectively with the management of the new business to jointly develop and execute a business plan.



While primarily seek to acquire controlling interests in a business, we may also acquire non-control or minority equity positions in businesses where we believe it is consistent with our long-term strategy.



As discussed in more detail below, we intend to raise capital for additional acquisitions primarily through debt financing, primarily at our operating company level, additional equity offerings by our company, the sale of all or a part of our businesses or by undertaking a combination of any of the above.



Our primary corporate purpose is to own, operate and grow our operating businesses. However, in addition to acquiring businesses, we expect to sell businesses that we own from time to time. Our decision to sell a business will be based upon financial, operating and other considerations rather than a plan to complete a sale of a business within any specific time frame. We may also decide to own and operate some or all of our businesses in perpetuity if our board believes that it makes sense to do so. Upon the sale of a business, we may use the resulting proceeds to retire debt or retain proceeds for future acquisitions or general corporate purposes. Generally, we do not expect to make special distributions at the time of a sale of one of our businesses; instead, we expect that we will seek to gradually increase regular common shareholder distributions over time.



There are several risks associated with our acquisition strategy, including the following risks, which are described more fully in Item 1A “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business and Structure”:




● | we may not be able to successfully fund future acquisitions of new businesses due to the unavailability of debt or equity financing on acceptable terms, which could impede the implementation of our acquisition strategy; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | we may experience difficulty as we evaluate, acquire and integrate businesses that we may acquire, which could result in drains on our resources, including the attention of our management, and disruptions of our on-going business; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | we face competition for businesses that fit our acquisition strategy and, therefore, we may have to acquire targets at sub-optimal prices or, alternatively, forego certain acquisition opportunities; and 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | we may change our management and acquisition strategies without the consent of our shareholders, which may result in a determination by us to pursue riskier business activities. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Strategic Advantages



Based on the experience of our manager and its ability to identify and negotiate acquisitions, we believe that we are strongly positioned to acquire additional businesses. Our manager has strong relationships with business brokers, investment and commercial bankers, accountants, attorneys and other potential sources of acquisition opportunities. In negotiating these acquisitions, we believe our manager will be able to successfully navigate complex situations surrounding acquisitions, including corporate spin-offs, transitions of family-owned businesses, management buy-outs and reorganizations.





5







We believe that the flexibility, creativity, experience and expertise of our manager in structuring transactions provides us with strategic advantages by allowing us to consider non-traditional and complex transactions tailored to fit a specific acquisition target.



Our manager also has a large network of deal intermediaries who expose us to potential acquisitions. Through this network, we have a substantial pipeline of potential acquisition targets. Our manager also has a well-established network of contacts, including professional managers, attorneys, accountants and other third-party consultants and advisors, who may be available to assist us in the performance of due diligence and the negotiation of acquisitions, as well as the management and operation of our businesses once acquired.



Valuation and Due Diligence



When evaluating businesses or assets for acquisition, we perform a rigorous due diligence and financial evaluation process. In doing so, we seek to evaluate the operations of the target business as well as the outlook for the industry in which the target business operates. While valuation of a business is, by definition, a subjective process, we define valuations under a variety of analyses, including:

● | discounted cash flow analyses; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | evaluation of trading values of comparable companies; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | expected value matrices; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------


● | assessment of competitor, supplier and customer environments; and 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | examination of recent/precedent transactions. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




One outcome of this process is an effort to project the expected cash flows from the target business as accurately as possible. A further outcome is an understanding of the types and levels of risk associated with those projections. While future performance and projections are always uncertain, we believe that our detailed due diligence review process allows us to more accurately estimate future cash flows and more effectively evaluate the prospects for operating the business in the future. To assist us in identifying material risks and validating key assumptions in our financial and operational analysis, in addition to our own analysis, we engage third-party experts to review key risk areas, including legal, tax, regulatory, accounting, insurance and environmental. We may also engage technical, operational or industry consultants, as necessary.



A further critical component of the evaluation of potential target businesses is the assessment of the capability of the existing management team, including recent performance, expertise, experience, culture and incentives to perform. Where necessary, and consistent with our management strategy, we actively seek to augment, supplement or replace existing members of management who we believe are not likely to execute the business plan for the target business. Similarly, we analyze and evaluate the financial and operational information systems of target businesses and, where necessary, we actively seek to enhance and improve those existing systems that are deemed to be inadequate or insufficient to support our business plan for the target business.



Financing



We finance acquisitions primarily through additional equity and debt financings. We believe that having the ability to finance most, if not all, acquisitions with the general capital resources raised by our company, rather than financing relating to the acquisition of individual businesses, provides us with an advantage in acquiring attractive businesses by minimizing delay and closing conditions that are often related to acquisition-specific financings. In this respect, we believe that, at some point in the future, we may need to pursue additional debt or equity financings, or offer equity in our company or target businesses to the sellers of such target businesses, in order to fund acquisitions.
Our Competitive Advantages



We believe that our manager’s collective investment experience and approach to executing our investment strategy provide us with several competitive advantages. These competitive advantages, certain of which are discussed below, have enabled our management to generate very attractive risk- adjusted returns for investors in their predecessor firms.

Robust Network. Through their activities with their predecessor firms and their comprehensive marketing capabilities, we believe that the management team of our manager has established a “top of mind” position among investment bankers and business brokers targeting small businesses. By employing an institutionalized, multi-platform marketing strategy, we believe our manager has established a robust national network of personal relationships with intermediaries, seasoned operating executives, entrepreneurs and managers, thereby firmly establishing our presence and credibility in the small business market. In contrast to many other buyers of and investors in small businesses, we believe that we can buy businesses at value-oriented multiples and through our asset management activities with a group of professional, experienced and talented operating partners, create appreciable value. We believe our experience, track record and consistent execution of our marketing and investment activities will allow us to maintain a leadership position as the preferred partner for today’s small business market.
Disciplined Deal Sourcing. We employ an institutionalized, multi-platform approach to sourcing new acquisition opportunities. Our deal sourcing efforts include leveraging relationships with more than 3,000 qualified deal sources through regular calling, mail and e-mail campaigns, assignment of regional marketing responsibilities, in-person visits and high-profile sponsorship of important conferences and industry events. We supplement these activities by retaining selected intermediary firms to conduct targeted searches for opportunities in specific categories on an opportunistic basis. As a result of the significant time and effort spent on these activities, we believe we established close relationships and unique “top of mind” awareness with many of the most productive intermediary sources for small business acquisition opportunities in the United States. While reinforcing our market leadership, this capability enables us to generate a large number of attractive acquisition opportunities.
Differentiated Acquisition Capabilities in the Small Business Market. We deploy a differentiated approach to acquiring businesses in the small business market. Our management concentrates their efforts on mature companies with sustainable value propositions, which can be supported by our resources and institutional expertise. Our evaluation of acquisition opportunities typically involves significant input from a seasoned operating partner with relevant experience, which we believe enhances both our diligence and ongoing monitoring capabilities. In addition, we approach every acquisition opportunity with creative structures, which we believe enables us to engineer mutually attractive scenarios for sellers, whereas competing buyers may be limited by their rigid structural requirements. We believe our commitment to conservative capital structures and valuation will enhance each acquired operating subsidiary’s ability to deliver consistent levels of cash available for distribution, while additionally supporting reinvestment for growth.
Value Proposition for Business Owners. We employ a creative, flexible approach by tailoring each acquisition structure to meet the specific liquidity needs and certain qualitative objectives of the target’s owners and management team. In addition to serving as an exit pathway for sellers, we seek to align our interests with the sellers by enabling them to retain and/or earn (through incentive compensation) a substantial economic interest in their businesses following the acquisition and by typically allowing the incumbent management team to retain operating control of the acquired operating subsidiary on a day-to-day basis. We believe that our company is an appealing buyer for small business owners and managers due to our track record of capitalizing portfolio companies conservatively, enhancing our ability to execute on its strategic initiatives and adding equity value. As a result, we believe business owners and managers will find our company to be a dynamic, value-added buyer that brings considerable resources to achieve their strategic, capital and operating needs, resulting in substantial value creation for the operating subsidiary.
Operating Partner. Our manager has consistently worked with a strong network of seasoned operating partners - former entrepreneurs and executives with extensive experience building, managing and optimizing successful small businesses across a range of industries. We believe that our operating partner model will enable us to make a significant improvement in the operating subsidiary, as compared to other buyers, such as traditional private equity firms, which rely principally upon investment professionals to make acquisition/investment and monitoring decisions regarding not only the business, financial and legal due diligence aspects of a business but also the more operational aspects including industry dynamics, management strength and strategic growth initiatives. We typically engage an operating partner soon after identifying a target business for acquisition, enhancing our acquisition judgment and building the acquisition team’s relationship with the subsidiary’s management team. Operating partners usually serve as a member of the board of directors of an operating subsidiary and spend two to four days per month working with the subsidiary’s management team. We leverage the operating partner’s extensive experience to build the management team, improve operations and assist with strategic growth initiatives, resulting in value creation.
Small Business Market Experience. We believe the history and experience of our manager’s partnering with companies in the small business market allows us to identify highly attractive acquisition opportunities and add significant value to our operating subsidiaries. Our manager’s investment experience in the small business market prior to forming our company has further contributed to our institutional expertise in the acquisition, strategic and operational decisions critical to the long-term success of small businesses. Since 2000, the management team of our manager has collectively been presented with several thousand investment opportunities and actively worked with more than 30 small businesses on all facets of their strategy, development and operations, which we have successfully translated into unique, institutionalized capabilities directed towards creating value in small businesses.
Intellectual Property



Our manager owns certain intellectual property relating to the term “1847.” Our manager has granted our company a license to use the term “1847” in its business.



Employees



As of December 31, 2021, our company had three full-time employees (excluding our operating subsidiaries described below).

OUR CORPORATE STRUCTURE AND HISTORY



Our company is a Delaware limited liability company that was formed on January 22, 2013. Your rights as a holder of common shares, and the fiduciary duties of our board of directors and executive officers, and any limitations relating thereto, are set forth in the operating agreement governing our company and differ from those applying to a Delaware corporation. However, subject to certain exceptions, the documents governing our company specify that the duties of our directors and officers will be generally consistent with the duties of directors and officers of a Delaware corporation.



Our company is classified as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Under the partnership income tax provisions, our company is not expected to incur any U.S. federal income tax liability; rather, each of our shareholders will be required to take into account his or her allocable share of company income, gain, loss, deduction and credit. As a holder of our shares, you may not receive cash distributions sufficient in amount to cover taxes in respect of your allocable share of our net taxable income. We will file a partnership return with the IRS and will issue you with tax information, including a Schedule K-1, setting forth your allocable share of our income, gain, loss, deduction, credit and other items. The U.S. federal income tax rules that apply to partnerships are complex, and complying with the reporting requirements may require significant time and expense. See “Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations” included in our amended registration statement on Form S-1 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC, on January 31, 2022, for more information.



We currently have four classes of limited liability company interests - the common shares, the series A senior convertible preferred shares, the series B senior convertible preferred shares and the allocation shares. All of our allocation shares have been and will continue to be held by our manager.



On March 3, 2017, our newly formed wholly-owned subsidiary 1847 Neese acquired all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of Neese for an aggregate purchase price of $6,655,000, consisting of: (i) $2,225,000 in cash; (ii) 450 shares of the common stock of 1847 Neese, valued by the parties at $1,530,000, constituting 45% of its capital stock; (iii) the issuance of a vesting promissory note in the principal amount of $1,875,000 (which was determined to have a fair value of $395,634) due June 30, 2020; and (iv) the issuance of a short-term promissory note in the principal amount of $1,025,000 due March 3, 2018.

On May 28, 2020, our newly formed wholly-owned subsidiary 1847 Asien acquired all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of Asien’s for an aggregate purchase price of $1,918,000 consisting of: (i) $233,000 in cash; (ii) the issuance of an amortizing promissory note in the principal amount of $200,000; (iii) the issuance of a demand promissory note in the principal amount of $655,000; and (iv) 415,000 common shares of our company, having a mutually agreed upon value of $830,000 and a fair value of $1,037,500, which could be repurchased by 1847 Asien for a period of one year following the closing at a purchase price of $2.50 per share. The shares were repurchased by 1847 Asien on July 29, 2020. As a result of this transaction, we own 95% of 1847 Asien, with the remaining 5% held by Leonite Capital LLC, or Leonite, and 1847 Asien owns 100% of Asien’s. 1847 Asien was formed in the State of Delaware on March 24, 2020 and Asien’s was formed in the State of California on February 6, 2004.

On October 8, 2021, 1847 Cabinet acquired all of the issued and outstanding capital stock or other equity securities of High Mountain and Innovative Cabinets for an aggregate purchase price of $16,567,845 (subject to adjustment), consisting of (i) $10,687,500 in cash (subject to adjustment) and (ii) the issuance by 1847 Cabinet of 6% subordinated convertible promissory notes in the aggregate principal amount of $5,880,345.



The purchase price is subject to a post-closing working capital adjustment provision. Under this provision, the sellers delivered to 1847 Cabinet at the closing an unaudited balance sheet of High Mountain and Innovative Cabinets and a calculation of estimated net working capital of High Mountain and Innovative Cabinets as of that date. On or before the 75th day following the closing, 1847 Cabinet must deliver to the sellers an unaudited balance sheet of High Mountain and Innovative Cabinets and its calculation of the final net working capital of High Mountain and Innovative Cabinets as of the closing date. If such final net working capital exceeds the estimated net working capital, 1847 Cabinet must, within seven days, pay to the sellers an amount of cash that is equal to such excess. If the estimated net working capital exceeds the final net working capital, the sellers must, within seven days, pay to 1847 Cabinet an amount in cash equal to such excess. As of the date of this report, the post-closing working capital adjustment has not been completed notwithstanding the fact that the date of this report is past the 75th day following closing. 1847 Cabinet has agreed with the sellers to finalize the post-working capital adjustment.



As a result of this transaction, 1847 Cabinet owns 92.5% of High Mountain and Innovative Cabinets, with the remaining 7.5% held by Leonite. High Mountain was formed in the State of Nevada on April 4, 2014 and Innovative Cabinets was formed in the State of Nevada on June 17, 2008.



On May 14, 2021, we formed 1847 HQ Inc. as a wholly-owned subsidiary in the State of Delaware to manage our benefit plans.

The following chart depicts our current organizational structure:







See “—Our Manager” for more details regarding the ownership of our manager.



OUR MANAGER



Overview of Our Manager 



Our manager, 1847 Partners LLC, is a Delaware limited liability company. It has two classes of limited liability interests known as Class A interests and Class B interests. The Class A interests, which give the holder the right to the profit allocation received by our manager as a result of holding our allocation shares, are owned in their entirety by 1847 Partners Class A Member LLC; and the Class B interests, which give the holder the right to all other profits or losses of our manager, including the management fee payable to our manager by us, are owned in their entirety by 1847 Partners Class B Member LLC. 1847 Partners Class A Member LLC is owned 52% by Ellery W. Roberts, our Chief Executive Officer, 38% by 1847 Founders Capital LLC, which is owned by Edward J. Tobin, and approximately 9% by Louis A. Bevilacqua, the managing member of Bevilacqua PLLC, our outside counsel, with the balance being owned by a former contractor to such law firm. 1847 Partners Class B Member LLC is owned 54% by Ellery W. Roberts, 36% by 1847 Founders Capital LLC and 10% by Louis A. Bevilacqua. Mr. Roberts is also the sole manager of both entities. In the future, Mr. Roberts may cause 1847 Partners Class A Member LLC or 1847 Partners Class B Member LLC to issue units to employees of our manager to incentivize those employees by providing them with the ability to participate in our manager’s incentive allocation and management fee.
Key Personnel of Our Manager 



The key personnel of our manager are Ellery W. Roberts, our Chief Executive Officer, and Edward J. Tobin. Each of these individuals will be compensated entirely by our manager from the management fees it receives. As employees of our manager, these individuals devote a substantial majority of their time to the affairs of our company.



Collectively, the management team of our manager has more than 60 years of combined experience in acquiring and managing small businesses and has overseen the acquisitions and financing of over 50 businesses.

Acquisition and Disposition Opportunities



Our manager has exclusive responsibility for reviewing and making recommendations to our board of directors with respect to acquisition and disposition opportunities. If our manager does not originate an opportunity, our board of directors will seek a recommendation from our manager prior to making a decision concerning such opportunity. In the case of any acquisition or disposition opportunity that involves an affiliate of our manager or us, our nominating and corporate governance committee, or, if we do not have such a committee, the independent members of our board of directors, will be required to authorize and approve such transaction.



Our manager will review each acquisition or disposition opportunity presented to our manager to determine if such opportunity satisfies the acquisition and disposition criteria established by our board of directors. The acquisition and disposition criteria provide that our manager will review each acquisition opportunity presented to it to determine if such opportunity satisfies our acquisition and disposition criteria, and if it is determined, in our manager’s sole discretion, that an opportunity satisfies the criteria, our manager will refer the opportunity to our board of directors for its authorization and approval prior to the consummation of any such opportunity.



Our investment criteria include the following:




● | Revenue of at least $5.0 million 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Current year EBITDA/Pre-tax Income of at least $1.5 million with a history of positive cash flow 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Clearly identifiable “blueprint” for growth with the potential for break-out returns 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Well-positioned companies within our core industry categories (consumer-driven, business-to-business, light manufacturing and specialty finance) with strong returns on capital 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Opportunities wherein building management team, infrastructure and access to capital are the primary drivers of creating value 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Headquartered in North America 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------




We believe we will be able to acquire small businesses for multiples ranging from three to six times EBITDA. With respect to investment opportunities that do not fall within the criteria set forth above, our manager must first present such opportunities to our board of directors. Our board of directors and our manager will review these criteria from time to time and our board of directors may make changes and modifications to such criteria as we make additional acquisitions and dispositions.



If an acquisition opportunity is referred to our board of directors by our manager and our board of directors determines not to timely pursue such opportunity in whole or in part, any part of such opportunity that we do not promptly pursue may be pursued by our manager or may be referred by our manager to any person, including affiliates of our manager. In this case, our manager is likely to devote a portion of its time to the oversight of this opportunity, including the management of a business that we do not own.



If there is a disposition, our manager must use its commercially reasonable efforts to manage a process through which the value of such disposition can be maximized, taking into consideration non-financial factors such as those relating to competition, strategic partnerships, potential favorable or adverse effects on us, our businesses, or our investments or any similar factors that may reasonably perceived as having a short- or long-term impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.



Management Services Agreement



The management services agreement sets forth the services performed by our manager. Our manager performs such services subject to the oversight and supervision of our board of directors.



In general, our manager performs those services for us that would be typically performed by the executive officers of a company. Specifically, our manager performs the following services, which we refer to as the management services, pursuant to the management services agreement:




● | manage our day-to-day business and operations, including our liquidity and capital resources and compliance with applicable law;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------






11








● | identify, evaluate, manage, perform due diligence on, negotiate and oversee acquisitions of target businesses and any other investments; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | evaluate and oversee the financial and operational performance of our businesses, including monitoring the business and operations of such businesses, and the financial performance of any other investments that we make; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | provide, on our behalf, managerial assistance to our businesses; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | evaluate, manage, negotiate and oversee dispositions of all or any part of any of our property, assets or investments, including disposition of all or any part of our businesses; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | provide or second, as necessary, employees of our manager to serve as our executive officers or other employees or as members of our board of directors; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | perform any other services that would be customarily performed by executive officers and employees of a publicly listed or quoted company. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




We and our manager have the right at any time during the term of the management services agreement to change the services provided by our manager. In performing management services, our manager has all necessary power and authority to perform, or cause to be performed, such services on our behalf, and, in this respect, our manager is the only provider of management services to us. Nonetheless, our manager is required to obtain authorization and approval of our board of directors in all circumstances where executive officers of a corporation typically would be required to obtain authorization and approval of a corporation’s board of directors, including, for example, with respect to the consummation of an acquisition of a target business, the issuance of securities or the entry into credit arrangements.



While our Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Ellery W. Roberts, intends to devote substantially all of his time to the affairs of our company, neither Mr. Roberts, nor our manager, is expressly prohibited from investing in or managing other entities. In this regard, the management services agreement does not require our manager and its affiliates to provide management services to us exclusively.



Secondment of Our Executive Officers



In accordance with the terms of the management services agreement, our manager may second to us our executive officers, which means that these individuals will be assigned by our manager to work for us during the term of the management services agreement. Our board of directors has appointed Mr. Roberts as an executive officer of our company. Although Mr. Roberts is an employee of our manager, he will report directly, and be subject, to our board of directors. In this respect, our board of directors may, after due consultation with our manager, at any time request that our manager replace any individual seconded to us and our manager will, as promptly as practicable, replace any such individual; however, our Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Roberts, controls our manager, which may make it difficult for our board of directors to completely sever ties with Mr. Roberts. Our manager and our board of directors may agree from time to time that our manager will second to us one or more additional individuals to serve on our behalf, upon such terms as our manager and our board of directors may mutually agree.



Indemnification by our Company



We have agreed to indemnify and hold harmless our manager and its employees and representatives, including any individuals seconded to us, from and against all losses, claims and liabilities incurred by our manager in connection with, relating to or arising out of the performance of any management services. However, we will not be obligated to indemnify or hold harmless our manager for any losses, claims and liabilities incurred by our manager in connection with, relating to or arising out of (i) a breach by our manager or its employees or its representatives of the management services agreement, (ii) the gross negligence, willful misconduct, bad faith or reckless disregard of our manager or its employees or representatives in the performance of any of its obligations under the management services agreement, or (iii) fraudulent or dishonest acts of our manager or its employees or representatives with respect to our company or any of its businesses.



Termination of Management Services Agreement



Our board of directors may terminate the management services agreement and our manager’s appointment if, at any time:




● | a majority of our board of directors vote to terminate the management services agreement, and the holders of at least a majority of the outstanding shares (other than shares beneficially owned by our manager) then entitled to vote also vote to terminate the management services agreement; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------






12








● | neither Mr. Roberts nor his designated successor controls our manager, which change of control occurs without the prior written consent of our board of directors; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | there is a finding by a court of competent jurisdiction in a final, non-appealable order that (i) our manager materially breached the terms of the management services agreement and such breach continued unremedied for 60 days after our manager receives written notice from us setting forth the terms of such breach, or (ii) our manager (x) acted with gross negligence, willful misconduct, bad faith or reckless disregard in performing its duties and obligations under the management services agreement, or (y) engaged in fraudulent or dishonest acts in connection with our business or operations; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | our manager has been convicted of a felony under federal or state law, our board of directors finds that our manager is demonstrably and materially incapable of performing its duties and obligations under the management services agreement, and the holders of at least 66 2/3% of the then outstanding shares, other than shares beneficially owned by our manager, vote to terminate the management services agreement; or 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | there is a finding by a court of competent jurisdiction that our manager has (i) engaged in fraudulent or dishonest acts in connection with our business or operations or (ii) acted with gross negligence, willful misconduct, bad faith or reckless disregard in performing its duties and obligations under the management services agreement, and the holders of at least 66 2/3% of the then outstanding shares (other than shares beneficially owned by our manager) vote to terminate the management services agreement.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




In addition, our manager may resign and terminate the management services agreement at any time upon 120 days prior written notice to us, and this right is not contingent upon the finding of a replacement manager. However, if our manager resigns, until the date on which the resignation becomes effective, it will, upon request of our board of directors, use reasonable efforts to assist our board of directors to find a replacement manager at no cost and expense to us.



Upon the termination of the management services agreement, seconded officers, employees, representatives and delegates of our manager and its affiliates who are performing the services that are the subject of the management services agreement will resign their respective position with us and cease to work at the date of such termination or at any other time as determined by our manager. Any director appointed by our manager may continue serving on our board of directors, subject to the terms of the operating agreement.



If we terminate the management services agreement, we have agreed to cease using the term “1847”, including any trademarks based on the name of our company that may be licensed to them by our manager, under the licensing provisions of the management services agreement, entirely in our business and operations within 180 days of such termination. Such licensing provisions of the management services agreement would require our company and its businesses to change their names to remove any reference to the term “1847” or any reference to trademarks licensed to them by our manager. In this respect, our right to use the term “1847” and related intellectual property is subject to licensing provisions between our manager, on the one hand, and our company, on the other hand.



Except with respect to the termination fee payable to our manager due to a termination of the management services agreement based solely on a vote of our board of directors and our shareholders, no other termination fee is payable upon termination of the management services agreement for any other reason. See “—Our Manager as a Service Provider—Termination Fee” for more information about the termination fee payable upon termination of the management services agreement.



While termination of the management services agreement will not affect any terms and conditions, including those relating to any payment obligations, that exist under any offsetting management services agreements or transaction services agreements, such agreements will be terminable by our businesses upon 60 days prior written notice and there will be no termination or other similar fees due upon such termination. Notwithstanding termination of the management services agreement, our manager will maintain its rights with respect to the allocation shares it then owns, including its rights under the supplemental put provision of our operating agreement. See “—Our Manager as an Equity Holder—Supplemental Put Provision” for more information on our manager’s put right with respect to the allocation shares.





13







Our Relationship with Our Manager, Manager Fees and Manager Profit Allocation



Our relationship with our manager is based on our manager having two distinct roles: first, as a service provider to us and, second, as an equity holder of the allocation shares.



As a service provider, our manager performs a variety of services for us, which entitles it to receive a management fee. As holder of our allocation shares, our manager has the right to a preferred distribution in the form of a profit allocation upon the occurrence of certain events. Our manager paid $1,000 for the allocation shares. In addition, our manager will have the right to cause us to purchase the allocation shares then owned by our manager upon termination of the management services agreement.



These relationships with our manager are governed principally by the following agreements:




● | the management services agreements relating to the services our manager performs for us and our businesses; and 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | our operating agreement relating to our manager’s rights with respect to the allocation shares it owns and which contains the supplemental put provision relating to our manager’s right to cause us to purchase the allocation shares it owns.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




We also expect that our manager will enter into offsetting management services agreements and transaction services agreements with our businesses directly. These agreements, and some of the material terms relating thereto, are discussed in more detail below. The management fee, profit allocation and put price under the supplemental put provision will be our payment obligations and, as a result, will be paid, along with other company obligations, prior to the payment of distributions to common shareholders.



The following table provides a simplified description of the fees and profit allocation rights held by our manager. Further detail is provided in the following subsections.




Description | Fee Calculation | Payment Term 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

14







Our Manager as a Service Provider



Management Fee 



We will pay our manager a quarterly management fee equal to 0.5% (2.0% annualized) of its adjusted net assets, as discussed in more detail below (which we refer to as the parent management fee).



Subject to any adjustments discussed below, for performing management services under the management services agreement during any fiscal quarter, we will pay our manager a management fee with respect to such fiscal quarter. The management fee to be paid with respect to any fiscal quarter will be calculated as of the last day of such fiscal quarter, which we refer to as the calculation date. The management fee will be calculated by an administrator, which will be our manager so long as the management services agreement is in effect. The amount of any management fee payable by us as of any calculation date with respect to any fiscal quarter will be (i) reduced by the aggregate amount of any offsetting management fees, if any, received by our manager from any of our businesses with respect to such fiscal quarter, (ii) reduced (or increased) by the amount of any over-paid (or under-paid) management fees received by (or owed to) our manager as of such calculation date, and (iii) increased by the amount of any outstanding accrued and unpaid management fees.



The management fee will be paid prior to the payment of distributions to our common shareholders. If we do not have sufficient liquid assets to pay the management fee when due, we may be required to liquidate assets or incur debt in order to pay the management fee.



Offsetting Management Services Agreements 



Pursuant to the management services agreement, we have agreed that our manager may, at any time, enter into offsetting management services agreements with our businesses pursuant to which our manager may perform services that may or may not be similar to management services. Any fees to be paid by one of our businesses pursuant to such agreements are referred to as offsetting management fees and will offset, on a dollar-for-dollar basis, the management fee otherwise due and payable by us under the management services agreement with respect to a fiscal quarter. The management services agreement provides that the aggregate amount of offsetting management fees to be paid to our manager with respect to any fiscal quarter shall not exceed the management fee to be paid to our manager with respect to such fiscal quarter.



Our manager entered into offsetting management services agreements with 1847 Neese, 1847 Goedeker, 1847 Asien, 1847 Cabinet and 1847 Wolo. See Item 7 “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Management Fees” for a description of these agreements. Our manager may also enter into offsetting management services agreements with our future subsidiaries, which agreements would be in the form prescribed by our management services agreement. The offsetting management fee paid to our manager for providing management services to a future subsidiary will vary.



The services that our manager provides under the offsetting management services agreements include: conducting general and administrative supervision and oversight of the subsidiary’s day-to-day business and operations, including, but not limited to, recruiting and hiring of personnel, administration of personnel and personnel benefits, development of administrative policies and procedures, establishment and management of banking services, managing and arranging for the maintaining of liability insurance, arranging for equipment rental, maintenance of all necessary permits and licenses, acquisition of any additional licenses and permits that become necessary, participation in risk management policies and procedures; and overseeing and consulting with respect to our business and operational strategies, the implementation of such strategies and the evaluation of such strategies, including, but not limited to, strategies with respect to capital expenditure and expansion programs, acquisitions or dispositions and product or service lines. If our manager and the subsidiary do not enter into an offsetting management services agreement, our manager will provide these services for our subsidiaries under our management services agreement.

Example of Calculation of Management Fee with Adjustment for Offsetting Management Fees



In order to better understand how the management fee is calculated, we are providing the following example:




Quarterly management fee: | | (in thousands) | 
----------------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------+----------------+--
1 | Consolidated total assets | | $ | 100,000 | 
2 | Consolidated accumulation amortization of intangibles | | | 5,000 | 
3 | Total cash and cash equivalents | | | 5,000 | 
4 | Adjusted total liabilities | | | (10,000 | )
5 | Adjusted net assets (Line 1 + Line 2 – Line 3 – Line 4) | | | 90,000 | 
6 | Multiplied by quarterly rate | | | 0.5 | %
7 | Quarterly management fee | | $ | 450 | 
Offsetting management fees: | | | | 
8 | Acquired company A offsetting management fees | | $ | (100 | )
9 | Acquired company B offsetting management fees | | | (100 | )
10 | Acquired company C offsetting management fees | | | (100 | )
11 | Acquired company D offsetting management fees | | | (100 | )
12 | Total offsetting management fees (Line 8 + Line 9 – Line 10 – Line 11) | | | (400 | )
13 | Quarterly management fee payable by Company (Line 7 + Line 12) | | $ | 50 | 




The foregoing example provides hypothetical information only and does not intend to reflect actual or expected management fee amounts.



For purposes of the calculation of the management fee:




● | “Adjusted net assets” will be equal to, as of any calculation date, the sum of (i) our consolidated total assets (as determined in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP) as of such calculation date, plus (ii) the absolute amount of our consolidated accumulated amortization of intangibles (as determined in accordance with GAAP) as of such calculation date, minus (iii) total cash and cash equivalents, minus (iv) the absolute amount of our adjusted total liabilities as of such calculation date.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | “Adjusted total liabilities” will be equal to, as of any calculation date, our consolidated total liabilities (as determined in accordance with GAAP) as of such calculation date after excluding the effect of any outstanding third-party indebtedness.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | “Quarterly management fee” will be equal to, as of any calculation date, the product of (i) 0.5%, multiplied by (ii) our adjusted net assets as of such calculation date; provided, however, that with respect to any fiscal quarter in which the management services agreement is terminated, we will pay our manager a management fee with respect to such fiscal quarter equal to the product of (i)(x) 0.5%, multiplied by (y) our adjusted net assets as of such calculation date, multiplied by (ii) a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days from and including the first day of such fiscal quarter to but excluding the date upon which the management services agreement is terminated and the denominator of which is the number of days in such fiscal quarter.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | “Total offsetting management fees” will be equal to, as of any calculation date, fees paid to our manager by the businesses that we acquire in the future under separate offsetting management services agreements. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------






16







Transaction Services Agreements 



Pursuant to the management services agreement, we have agreed that our manager may, at any time, enter into transaction services agreements with any of our businesses relating to the performance by our manager of certain transaction-related services in connection with the acquisitions of target businesses by us or dispositions of our property or assets. These services may include those customarily performed by a third-party investment banking firm or similar financial advisor, which may or may not be similar to management services, in connection with the acquisition of target businesses by us or our subsidiaries or disposition of subsidiaries or any of our property or assets or those of our subsidiaries. In connection with providing transaction services, our manager will generally receive a fee equal to the sum of (i) 2.0% of the aggregate purchase price of the target business up to and equal to $50 million, plus (ii) 1.5% of the aggregate purchase price of the target business in excess of $50 million and up to and equal to $100 million, plus (iii) 1.0% of the aggregate purchase price over $100 million, subject to annual review by our board of directors. The purchase price of a target business shall be defined as the aggregate amount of consideration, including cash and the value of any shares issued by us on the date of acquisition, paid for the equity interests of such target business plus the aggregate principal amount of any debt assumed by us of the target business on the date of acquisition or any similar formulation. The other terms and conditions relating to the performance of transaction services will be established in accordance with market practice.



Our manager may enter into transaction services agreements with our subsidiaries and future subsidiaries, which agreements would be in the form prescribed by our management services agreement.



The services that our manager will provide to our subsidiaries and future subsidiaries under the transaction services agreements will include the following services that would be provided in connection with a specific transaction identified at the time that the transaction services agreement is entered into: reviewing, evaluating and otherwise familiarizing itself and its affiliates with the business, operations, properties, financial condition and prospects of the future subsidiary and its target acquisition and preparing documentation describing the future subsidiary’s operations, management, historical financial results, projected financial results and any other relevant matters and presenting such documentation and making recommendations with respect thereto to certain of our manager’s affiliates.



Any fees received by our manager pursuant to such a transaction services agreement will be in addition to the management fee payable by us pursuant to the management services agreement and will not offset the payment of such management fee. A transaction services agreement with any of our businesses may provide for the reimbursement of costs and expenses incurred by our manager in connection with the acquisition of such businesses.



Transaction services agreements will be reviewed, authorized and approved by our board of directors on an annual basis.



Reimbursement of Expenses



We are responsible for paying costs and expenses relating to its business and operations. We agreed to reimburse our manager during the term of the management services agreement for all costs and expenses that are incurred by our manager or its affiliates on our behalf of, including any out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred in connection with the performance of services under the management services agreement, and all costs and expenses the reimbursement of which are specifically approved by our board of directors. 



We will not be obligated or responsible for reimbursing or otherwise paying for any costs or expenses relating to our manager’s overhead or any other costs and expenses relating to our manager’s conduct of its business and operations. Also, we will not be obligated or responsible for reimbursing our manager for costs and expenses incurred by our manager in the identification, evaluation, management, performance of due diligence on, negotiation and oversight of potential acquisitions of new businesses for which we (or our manager on our behalf) fail to submit an indication of interest or letter of intent to pursue such acquisition, including costs and expenses relating to travel, marketing and attendance of industry events and retention of outside service providers relating thereto. In addition, we will not be obligated or responsible for reimbursing our manager for costs and expenses incurred by our manager in connection with the identification, evaluation, management, performance of due diligence on, negotiating and oversight of an acquisition by us if such acquisition is actually consummated and the business so acquired entered into a transaction services agreement with our manager providing for the reimbursement of such costs and expenses by such business. In this respect, the costs and expenses associated with the pursuit of add-on acquisitions may be reimbursed by any businesses so acquired pursuant to a transaction services agreement. 



All reimbursements will be reviewed and, in certain circumstances, approved by our board of directors on an annual basis in connection with the preparation of year-end financial statements.



17







Termination Fee 



We will pay our manager a termination fee upon termination of the management services agreement if such termination is based solely on a vote of our board of directors and our shareholders; no other termination fee will be payable to our manager in connection with the termination of the management services agreement for any other reason. The termination fee that is payable to our manager will be equal to the product of (i) two (2) multiplied by (ii) the sum of the amount of the quarterly management fees calculated with respect to the four fiscal quarters immediately preceding the termination date of the management services agreement. The termination fee will be payable in eight equal quarterly installments, with the first such installment being paid on or within five (5) business days of the last day of the fiscal quarter in which the management services agreement was terminated and each subsequent installment being paid on or within five (5) business days of the last day of each subsequent fiscal quarter, until such time as the termination fee is paid in full to our manager.
Our Manager as an Equity Holder



Manager’s Profit Allocation 



Our manager owns 100% of our allocation shares, which generally will entitle our manager to receive a 20% profit allocation as a form of preferred distribution. Upon the sale of a subsidiary, our manager will be paid a profit allocation if the sum of (i) the excess of the gain on the sale of such subsidiary over a high-water mark plus (ii) the subsidiary’s net income since its acquisition by us exceeds the 8% hurdle rate. The 8% hurdle rate is the product of (i) a 2% rate per quarter, multiplied by (ii) the number of quarters such subsidiary was held by us, multiplied by (iii) the subsidiary’s average share (determined based on gross assets, generally) of our consolidated net equity (determined according to GAAP with certain adjustments). In certain circumstances, after a subsidiary has been held for at least 5 years, our manager may also trigger a profit allocation with respect to such subsidiary (determined based solely on the subsidiary’s net income since its acquisition). The calculation of the profit allocation and the rights of our manager, as the holder of the allocation shares, are governed by the operating agreement.



Our board will have the opportunity to review and approve the calculation of manager’s profit allocation when it becomes due and payable. Our manager will not receive a profit allocation on an annual basis. Instead, our manager will be paid a profit allocation only upon the occurrence of one of the following events, which we refer to collectively as the trigger events:




● | the sale of a material amount, as determined by our manager and reasonably consented to by a majority of our board of directors, of the capital stock or assets of one of our subsidiaries or a subsidiary of one of our subsidiaries, including a distribution of our ownership of a subsidiary to our shareholders in a spin-off or similar transaction, which event we refer to as a sale event; or 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | at the option of our manager, for the 30-day period following the fifth anniversary of the date upon which we acquired a controlling interest in a business, which event we refer to as a holding event. If our manager elects to forego declaring a holding event with respect to such business during such period, then our manager may only declare a holding event with respect to such business during the 30-day period following each anniversary of such fifth anniversary date with respect to such business. Once declared, our manager may only declare another holding event with respect to a business following the fifth anniversary of the calculation date with respect to a previously declared holding event. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




We believe this payment timing, rather than a method that provides for annual allocation payments, more accurately reflects the long-term performance of each of our businesses and is consistent with our intent to hold, manage and grow our businesses over the long term. We refer generally to the obligation to make this payment to our manager as the “profit allocation” and, specifically, to the amount of any particular profit allocation as the “manager’s profit allocation.”



Definitions used in, and an example of the calculation of profit allocation, are set forth in more detail below.



The amount of our manager’s profit allocation will be based on the extent to which the “total profit allocation amount” (as defined below) with respect to any business, as of the last day of any fiscal quarter in which a trigger event occurs, which date we refer to as the “calculation date”, exceeds the relevant hurdle amounts (as described below) with respect to such business, as of such calculation date. Our manager’s profit allocation will be calculated by an administrator, which will be our manager so long as the management services agreement is in effect, and such calculation will be subject to a review and approval process by our board of directors. For this purpose, “total profit allocation amount” will be equal to, with respect to any business as of any calculation date, the sum of:




● | the contribution-based profit (as described below) of such business as of such calculation date, which will be calculated upon the occurrence of any trigger event with respect to such business; plus 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the excess of our cumulative gains and losses (as described below) over the high-water mark (as described below) as of such calculation date, which will only be calculated upon the occurrence of a sale event with respect to such business, and not on a holding event (we generally expect this component to be the most significant component in calculating total profit allocation amount).
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




Specifically, manager’s profit allocation will be calculated and paid as follows:




● | manager’s profit allocation will not be paid with respect to a trigger event relating to any business if the total profit allocation amount, as of any calculation date, with respect to such business does not exceed such business’ level 1 hurdle amount (based on an 8% annualized hurdle rate, as described below), as of such calculation date; and 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

● | manager’s profit allocation will be paid with respect to a trigger event relating to any business if the total profit allocation amount, as of any calculation date, with respect to such business exceeds such business’ level 1 hurdle amount, as of such calculation date. Our manager’s profit allocation to be paid with respect to such calculation date will be equal to the sum of the following: 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | 100% of such business’ total profit allocation amount, as of such calculation date, with respect to that portion of the total profit allocation amount that exceeds such business’ level 1 hurdle amount (but is less than or equal to such business’ level 2 hurdle amount (which is based on a 10% annualized hurdle rate, as described below), in each case, as of such calculation date. We refer to this portion of the total profit allocation amount as the “catch-up.” The “catch-up” is intended to provide our manager with an overall profit allocation of 20% of the business’ total profit allocation amount until such business’ level 2 hurdle amount has been reached; plus 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | 20% of the total profit allocation amount, as of such calculation date, that exceeds such business’ level 2 hurdle amount as of such calculation date; minus 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | the high-water mark allocation, if any, as of such calculation date. The effect of deducting the high-water mark allocation is to take into account profit allocations our manager has already received in respect of past gains attributable to previous sale events. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




The administrator will calculate our manager’s profit allocation on or promptly following the relevant calculation date, subject to a “true-up” calculation upon availability of audited or unaudited consolidated financial statements, as the case may be, to the extent not available on such calculation date. Any adjustment necessitated by the true-up calculation will be made in connection with the next calculation of manager’s profit allocation. Because of the length of time that may pass between trigger events, there may be a significant delay in our ability to realize the benefit, if any, of a true-up of our manager’s profit allocation.



Once calculated, the administrator will submit the calculation of our manager’s profit allocation, as adjusted pursuant to any true-up, to our board of directors for its review and approval. The board of directors will have ten business days to review and approve the calculation, which approval shall be automatic absent disapproval by the board of directors. Our manager’s profit allocation will be paid ten business days after such approval.



If the board of directors disapproves of the administrator’s calculation of manager’s profit allocation, the calculation and payment of manager’s profit allocation will be subject to a dispute resolution process, which may result in our manager’s profit allocation being determined, at our cost and expense, by two independent accounting firms. Any determination by such independent accounting firms will be conclusive and binding on us and our manager.



We will also pay a tax distribution to our manager if our manager is allocated taxable income by us but does not realize distributions from us at least equal to the taxes payable by our manager resulting from allocations of taxable income. Any such tax distributions will be paid in a similar manner as profit allocations are paid.



For any fiscal quarter in which a trigger event occurs with respect to more than one business, the calculation of our manager’s profit allocation, including the components thereof, will be made with respect to each business in the order in which controlling interests in such businesses were acquired or obtained by us and the resulting amounts shall be aggregated to determine the total amount of manager’s profit allocation. If controlling interests in two or more businesses were acquired at the same time and such businesses give rise to a calculation of manager’s profit allocation during the same fiscal quarter, then manager’s profit allocation will be further calculated separately for each such business in the order in which such businesses were sold.





19







The profit allocations and tax distributions will be paid prior to the payment of distributions to our shareholders. If we do not have sufficient liquid assets to pay the profit allocations or tax distributions when due, we may be required to liquidate assets or incur debt in order to pay such profit allocation. Our manager will have the right to elect to defer the payment of our manager’s profit allocation due on any payment date. Once deferred, our manager may demand payment thereof upon 20 business days’ prior written notice.



Termination of the management services agreement, by any means, will not affect our manager’s rights with respect to the allocation shares that it owns, including its right to receive profit allocations, unless our manager exercises its put right to sell such allocation shares to us.



Example of Calculation of Manager’s Profit Allocation



Our manager will receive a profit allocation at the end of the fiscal quarter in which a trigger event occurs, as follows (all dollar amounts are in millions):
Assumptions



Year 1:



Acquisition of Company A

Acquisition of Company B



Year 4



Company A (or assets thereof) sold for $25 capital gain (as defined below) over its net book value of assets at time of sale, which is a qualifying trigger event

Company A’s average allocated share of our consolidated net equity over its ownership is $50

Company A’s holding period in quarters is 12 (assuming that Company A is acquired on the first day of the year)

Company A’s contribution-based profit since acquisition is $5



Year 6:



Company B’s contribution-based profit since acquisition is $7

Company B’s average allocated share of our consolidated net equity over its ownership is $25

Company B’s holding period in quarters is 20

Company B’s cumulative gains and losses are $20

Manager elects to have holding period measured for purposes of profit allocation for Company B

Supplemental Put Provision 



In addition to the provisions discussed above, in consideration of our manager’s acquisition of the allocation shares, our operating agreement contains a supplemental put provision pursuant to which our manager will have the right to cause us to purchase the allocation shares then owned by our manager upon termination of the management services agreement.



If the management services agreement is terminated at any time or our manager resigns, then our manager will have the right, but not the obligation, for one year from the date of such termination or resignation, as the case may be, to elect to cause us to purchase all of the allocation shares then owned by our manager for the put price as of the put exercise date.



For purposes of this provision, the “put price” is equal to, as of any exercise date, (i) if we terminate the management services agreement, the sum of two separate, independently made calculations of the aggregate amount of manager’s profit allocation as of such exercise date or (ii) if our manager resigns, the average of two separate, independently made calculations of the aggregate amount of manager’s profit allocation as of such exercise date, in each case, calculated assuming that (x) all of the businesses are sold in an orderly fashion for fair market value as of such exercise date in the order in which the controlling interest in each business was acquired or otherwise obtained by us, (y) the last day of the fiscal quarter ending immediately prior to such exercise date is the relevant calculation date for purposes of calculating manager’s profit allocation as of such exercise date. Each of the two separate, independently made calculations of our manager’s profit allocation for purposes of calculating the put price will be performed by a different investment bank that is engaged by us at our cost and expense. The put price will be adjusted to account for a final “true-up” of our manager’s profit allocation.



We and our manager can mutually agree to permit us to issue a note in lieu of payment of the put price when due; provided, that if our manager resigns and terminates the management services agreement, then we will have the right, in our sole discretion, to issue a note in lieu of payment of the put price when due. In either case the note would have an aggregate principal amount equal to the put price, would bear interest at a rate of LIBOR plus 4.0% per annum, would mature on the first anniversary of the date upon which the put price was initially due, and would be secured by the then-highest priority lien available to be placed on our equity interests in each of our businesses.



Our obligations under the put provision of our operating agreement are absolute and unconditional. In addition, we will be subject to certain obligations and restrictions upon exercise of our manager’s put right until such time as our obligations under the put provision of our operating agreement, including any related note, have been satisfied in full, including:




● | subject to our right to issue a note in the circumstances described above, we must use commercially reasonable efforts to raise sufficient debt or equity financing to permit us to pay the put price or note when due and obtain approvals, waivers and consents or otherwise remove any restrictions imposed under contractual obligations or applicable law or regulations that have the effect of limiting or prohibiting us from satisfying our obligations under the supplemental put agreement or note;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | our manager will have the right to have a representative observe meetings of our board of directors and have the right to receive copies of all documents and other information furnished to the board of directors;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | our company and its businesses will be restricted in their ability to sell or otherwise dispose of their property or assets or any businesses they own and in their ability to incur indebtedness (other than in the ordinary course of business) without granting a lien on the proceeds therefrom to our manager, which lien will secure our obligations under the put provision of our operating agreement or note; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | we will be restricted in our ability to (i) engage in certain mergers or consolidations, (ii) sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of all or a substantial part of our business, property or assets or all or a substantial portion of the stock or beneficial ownership of our businesses or a portion thereof, (iii) liquidate, wind-up or dissolve, (iv) acquire or purchase the property, assets, stock or beneficial ownership or another person, or (v) declare and pay distributions to our common shareholders.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------







23







We have also agreed to indemnify our manager for any losses or liabilities it incurs or suffers in connection with, arising out of or relating to its exercise of its put right or any enforcement of terms and conditions of the supplemental put provision of our operating agreement.



The put price will be paid prior to the payment of distributions to our shareholders. If we do not have sufficient liquid assets to pay the put price when due, we may be required to liquidate assets or incur debt in order to pay the put price.



Termination of the management services agreement, by any means, will not affect our manager’s rights with respect to the allocation shares that it owns. In this regard, our manager will retain its put right and its allocation shares after ceasing to serve as our manager. As a result, if we terminate our manager, regardless of the reason for such termination, it would retain the right to exercise the put right and demand payment of the put price.

Appliance Services



We also offer a variety of appliance services, including delivery, installation, warranty service and appliance repair and maintenance. We are the largest independent appliance service company in Sonoma County. Our service technicians are experts, averaging 15 years of field experience with factory training. They are vendor certified to handle our customers’ kitchen appliance, laundry, and outdoor appliance service needs. We also offer extended warranties.
Pricing 



We provide premium and super premium products to the North Bay customer. A significant number of the appliances in our 5,700 SKU catalog are subject to a unilateral minimum retail price policy, or UMRP, or minimum advertised pricing restrictions. UMRP restricts a reseller from discounting the customer price for an appliance below a vendor published UMRP and product promotions are solely those specified by the vendor and unilaterally available. We thrive in the premium market by proving the customer with a higher overall perceived value as well as a competitive total invoice cost by offering premium service at reasonable rates. Our sales associates are industry professionals with an average more than 15 years of experience selling appliances. This team of six averages over eleven years seniority with the senior member having been with us for 26 years. The premium appliance market requires this expertise as very often sales and customer service teams are interacting with designers, builders, and contractors, as well as our core customer, the homeowner. Our hard earned reputation for this expertise in sales, installation and service accretes to its advantage when it competes directly across product lines that are also available from other local resellers and big box competitors. Our merchant and sales team are responsible to ensure that pricing and promotion for these appliances are competitive.



Vendor/Supplier Relationships 



We offer more than 36 brands and approximately 5,700 SKUs available for purchase. This depth of vendor relationships gives consumers numerous options in all product categories. Our top vendors and suppliers are listed in the table below.




Supplier | Total Purchases (2020) | | Total Purchases (2021) | | | Percent of Purchases (2021) 
-------------------------+--------------------------+-----------+--------------------------+---+-----------+------------------------------
Riggs Distributing, Inc. | $ | 3,063,734 | | $ | 2,558,915 | | 28.4 | %
Whirlpool | | 1,176,219 | | | 1,203,187 | | 13.3 | %
General Electric | | 1,527,220 | | | 2,411,825 | | 26.7 | %
Middleby / Viking Range | | 647,809 | | | 786,557 | | 8.7 | %
Miele | | 780,726 | | | 383,245 | | 4.3 | %
Fisher Paykel | | 202,258 | | | 455,073 | | 5.0 | %
R&B | | 238,647 | | | 132,625 | | 1.5 | %
Blue Star | | 437,816 | | | 349,615 | | 3.9 | %
Zephyr | | 258,055 | | | 212,444 | | 2.4 | %
Beko Appliances | | 143,091 | | | 248,323 | | 2.8 | %




Products are purchased from all suppliers on an at-will basis. We have no long-term purchase agreements with any supplier. Relationships with suppliers are subject to change from time to time. Changes in relationships with suppliers occur periodically and could positively or negatively impact our net sales and operating profits. We believe that we can be successful in mitigating negative effects resulting from unfavorable changes in the relationships with suppliers through, among other things, the development of new or expanded supplier relationships. Please see Item 1A “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Retail and Appliances Business” and Item 1A “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business and Structure—The COVID-19 pandemic may cause a material adverse effect on our business” for a description of the risks related to our supplier relationships, including those associated with the COVID-19 pandemic.



BrandSource Membership



We are part of the member-owned buying group, BrandSource, which has an internal marketing company as well as a company to finance their purchases from some brands.



Members of BrandSource can compete with box stores by banding together under the buying group; the dealers/members own the buying group/co-op. Simply put, the group aids members in helping them buy better, reduce costs, drive business into their stores and educate them in a way an independent dealer could not do it alone.





25







We believe that the benefits of our membership with this group include:




● | $19 billion dollar buying power allowing members to compete on the price of products (same as box store); 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | BrandSource finance through Progressive Leasing so members can get credit approved to purchase goods; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | BrandSource marketing so members can compete for consumer store traffic. This includes turnkey websites, digital and social marketing, as well as print and video marketing. This allows members to actually out-market the box stores locally; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | National and regional education forums for members to be “in the know” on industry trends, vendor product knowledge and idea exchange; and 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | BrandSource AVB retail technology solutions and consulting. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Marketing



We market our products through a variety of methods, both digital and traditional. Some examples include digital advertising, radio, billboards and “go local” marketing.



Digital Advertising



We participate in pay-per-click ads, digital banner ads, YouTube videos, Facebook posts, and similar digital media, through our membership in BrandSource. We also have a professional and easy-to-use website (www.asiensappliance.com), which allows customers to research, compare, and order products online. This site is hosted and maintained by BrandSource.
Radio 



We run radio spots on various stations throughout the year, with most spots promoting our brand. These advertisements strive to promote our experience, expertise, service, local ownership, and more than 70 years in business. Some radio spots are paid for by appliance manufacturers, in which case we will promote the quality of the brand, rather than the price.
Billboards 



We have secured two prominent billboards in Sonoma County:




● | Northbound 101 across from the Corby Avenue auto row in Santa Rosa. We advertise on it half the year at different intervals. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Southbound 101 in Petaluma near the Petaluma Village Premium Outlets. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




In many cases, as with the radio ads, appliance manufacturers will pay for advertising on the billboards.



“Go Local” Marketing



We also participate in the “GO LOCAL” marketing organization for locally-owned independent businesses. Members of this organization use a shared brand, targeted advertising, and a rewards card to increase sales and gain market share.
Customers and Markets



We currently serve customers in the areas of Sonoma, Napa, Marin, Lake and Mendocino counties, California. The large majority of customers are homeowners and their contractors, with the homeowner being key in the final decisions. We have a diverse customer base, with no one customer accounting for more than 5% of total revenue.
Customer Support



Customer Service is of critical importance to our success. We primarily conduct customer service in person or on the telephone, although web-initiated chat, text and email are available and rapidly growing coordination and communication. We believe in allowing our customer to set the preferred method for communication. Our role in providing premium appliances can often require substantial pre-sales support, such as when quoting a multi-appliance bid package for a builder. Since 2020, there has been a material shift toward online sales and the appliance industry is no exception. In 2019, the most popular search terms for the appliance industry ended with the modifier “near me” and in 2020 that modifier was replaced with “delivered.” Confirming availability, managing backordered product and coordinating delivery and installation are all critical service functions for us in the extended COVID-19 environment.



Our customer service is available to field inbound customer calls from 8:00 am to 5:30 pm PST, Monday through Friday and Saturday from 9:00 am to 5:00 pm.





26








Logistics



The large majority of our inventory consists of customers’ completed orders, most of which are selected from models on display in our extensive showroom. We do, however, maintain a supply of common and in-demand appliances for walk-in customers who are looking to make same-day purchases.



We take ownership of inventory when it is delivered to our warehouse. At this point, warehouse staff unloads the product, determines the delivery location and arranges for delivery of the product. Customers may arrange for a delivery service or their third-party installers and contractors to pick-up their appliances at our warehouse or have it scheduled for drop-off or installation. We will coordinate third-party delivery or recommend factory trained third-party installation services when necessary. We also offer installation services. Another important service is haul-away of a customer’s used appliances. This service is included with drop-off or installation. We contract with a local third-party recycling firm to ensure that used appliances receive optimum recycling and appropriate disposal.



Our return and exchange policy is designed to be as worry-free and customer friendly as possible. A customer may cancel or exchange an item that is on order or is not subject to a vendor mandated restocking fee. We may pass any supplier assessed restocking fee on to the customer in the event a special ordered appliance is returned or exchanged without defect.



Competition



We compete with big box retailers, independent appliance retailers, hybrid retail and direct-to-consumer companies and web only companies. As a hybrid retail and direct-to-consumer company, we have the ability to successfully rival the offerings of each competitor, utilizing impressions from both online and traditional marketing, our consultative selling practice and customer service expertise, and a curated assortment of premier brands to attract and retain new customers.



The U.S. appliance market in general is highly fragmented with thousands of local and regional retailers competing for share. Our primary competitors in the appliance market include big box retailers, such as Home Depot, Lowe’s and Costco; specialty retailers, such as TeeVax, Ferguson and Premier Bath and Kitchen; and online marketplaces, such as Amazon.



The shifting landscape to online sales in the segment is providing a significant market share capture and positioning opportunity for companies. We are rapidly evolving our business processes to capitalize on this market shift. While premium brands continue to place restrictions on the pure ecommerce distribution models, we are adapting the concierge selling available on our showroom floor for the web customer at home. The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated this shift and is rewarding the entrepreneurial innovation necessary for this transition. This ongoing adaptation and continual process improvement will allow us to continue to enjoy a preferred reseller status with the premium brands that differentiate our offerings.



Competitive Strengths



Based on management’s belief and experience in the industry, we believe that the following competitive strengths enable us to compete effectively.




● | Name and reputation. We believe that we enjoy a long-standing (more than 70 years) reputation with vendors and customers for our focus on offering a full line of appliances, including premium brands unavailable from the competition, with consultative selling, competitive pricing and superior customer service. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Highly experienced management and personnel. We believe that our personnel are its most important asset. We have an experienced management team with decades of industry knowledge and a team of experienced, knowledgeable and skilled field personnel. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Diverse product and service offerings. We offer a full line of top brands from U.S. and international manufacturers. We currently offer approximately 5,700 appliance SKU’s. We also offer delivery, installation and repair and maintenance services provided by our highly knowledgeable personnel. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------






27








● | Inventory discipline. Resellers in the appliance industry are experiencing unprecedented supply chain issues with backorder on many appliance categories. Increasingly, the most success in appliance sales is found for those with available inventory on hand. We react quickly to the expression of customer demand by confirming availability for products and placing orders to reserve potential stock needs. Our curated assortment allows us to react to micro-trends and adjust assortment and buying decisions quickly. On the showroom floor, our experienced team has quickly pivoted to first sell what is available and then over-communicate with the customer when an item is on backorder. As a result, we are maintaining a low cancelation rate. Customer service processes and resources to allow more efficient ongoing customer communication and coordination will allow us to earn loyalty within our market by exceeding the service levels customers receive from other specialty retailers. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Extended repair, delivery, and loaner services. Approximately 60%-70% of our sales are “duress” sales to replace broken or antiquated equipment. It is not uncommon for service to provide a gateway sales. A customer looking to replace their appliance still wants a quality product and they need it quickly. This is where the value of our full-service approach wins customer loyalty. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Online sales expertise. We believe that our ability to transact online, big ticket, home delivery sales give us strategic positioning and capability to sell more products to our current customer base, as well as to add new big ticket product categories. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Membership in BrandSource. As discussed in more detail above, we believe that our membership in BrandSouce provides us with a number of competitive advantages. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Growth Strategies



We will strive to grow our business by pursuing the following growth strategies:




● | Digital strategy. We plan to implement best-in-class solutions from parallel industries focused on a click-to-brick digital strategy. This includes enhancing our web presence and digital advertising while providing tools to facilitate consultation, guided customer support and service. We also plan to enhance the full-cycle customer relationship including loyalty, incentives for referral, and long-tail satisfaction surveys. We also plan to enhance our geographic reach through installation partnerships. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Increase local marketing spend. We plan to increase our local marketing spending. Outreach messaging will increase the emphasis on us as a trusted community resource and other local first values. We plan to build incrementally on ad spending where a return is measurable. This involves first optimizing local market internet search and digital advertising campaigns, while at the same time innovating a COVID-19 appropriate approach to what was traditionally outside sales by more regularly engaging builders, designers, and contractors and encouraging regular digital meeting place. We plan to provide local leadership by being efficient and providing secure online tools to enable project management and data exchange. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Store growth. We are actively looking for underserved and growing communities on the west coast that echo the attributes that serve our success in the current Sonoma County location. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Intellectual Property



We do not own any registered intellectual property for our retail and appliances business. The agreements with our suppliers generally provide us with a limited, non-exclusive license to use the supplier’s trademarks, service marks and trade names for the sole purpose of promoting and selling their products.



To protect intellectual property, we rely on a combination of laws and regulations, as well as contractual restrictions. We rely on the protection of laws regarding unregistered copyrights for certain content we create. We also rely on trade secret laws to protect our proprietary technology and other intellectual property. To further protect our intellectual property, we enter into confidentiality agreements with our executive officers and directors.

Employees



As of December 31, 2021, we employed 21 full-time employees. The following table sets forth the number of employees by function.




Department/Function | Employees | 
-----------------------+-----------+---
Accounting/Finance | | 1 
Sales and Marketing | | 8 
Customer Service | | 6 
Warehouse and Delivery | | 4 
Administrative | | 2 
TOTALS | | 21




None of our employees are represented by labor unions, and we believe that we have an excellent relationship with our employees.



Regulation



Our business is subject a variety of laws and regulations applicable to companies that are conducting business on the Internet. Jurisdictions vary as to how, or whether, existing laws governing areas such as personal privacy and data security, consumer protection or sales and other taxes, among other areas, apply to the Internet and e-commerce, and these laws are continually evolving. For example, certain applicable privacy laws and regulations require us to provide customers with our policies on sharing information with third parties, and advance notice of any changes to these policies. Related laws may govern the manner in which we transfer sensitive information or impose obligations on us in the event of a security breach or inadvertent disclosure of such information. Additionally, tax regulations in jurisdictions where we do not currently collect state or local taxes may subject us to the obligation to collect and remit such taxes, or to additional taxes, or to requirements intended to assist jurisdictions with their tax collection efforts. New legislation or regulation, the application of laws from jurisdictions whose laws do not currently apply to our business, or the application of existing laws and regulations to the Internet and e-commerce generally could result in significant additional taxes on our business. Further, we could be subject to fines or other payments for any past failures to comply with these requirements. The continued growth and demand for e-commerce is likely to result in more laws and regulations that impose additional compliance burdens on companies doing business on the Internet.
CUSTOM CARPENTRY BUSINESS



Our custom carpentry business is operated through our subsidiaries Kyle’s, High Mountain and Innovative Cabinets. Kyle’s was acquired in the third quarter of 2020 and High Mountain and Innovative Cabinets were acquired in the fourth quarter of 2021. This business segment accounted for approximately 39.8% and 12.8% of our total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
Overview



We specialize in all aspects of finished carpentry products and services, including doors, door frames, base boards, crown molding, cabinetry, bathroom sinks and cabinets, bookcases, built-in closets, and fireplace mantles, among others. We also install windows and kitchen countertops. We primarily service large homebuilders and homeowners of single-family homes and commercial and multi-family developers in the greater Reno-Sparks-Fernley metro area in Nevada and in the Boise, Idaho area.
Products and Services



We provide a wide variety of finished carpentry products and services to single-family homeowners and builders, builders of multi-family homes, as well as commercial clients in the greater Reno-Sparks-Fernley metro area in Nevada, which is one of the fastest growing economic regions in the Western U.S. This includes selling and installing doors, door frames, basic trim, base boards, crown molding, kitchen and bathroom cabinets and countertops, walk-in closets, bookcases, fireplace mantles, even staircases, staircase handles and spindles.



We also install windows in this market. Revenue from window installation is projected to grow significantly. Window installation does not require any manufacturing or assembly of windows and minimal inventory levels of product is needed. We can simply either install the windows that have already been purchased by the client or buy them for a specific job and install them.



We also build cabinets for every area of a home - kitchen and bath cabinets, fireplace mantels and surrounds, entertainment systems and wall units, bookcases and office cabinets - in Boise, Idaho and the surrounding area, for builders, designers and homeowners when they are building a new home or conduct remodeling. In this market, most of the focus has been on supplying custom or semi-custom builders of residential properties.





29







Manufacturing



Most of our services consist of design, assembly, and installation services. As a result, we do not manufacture most of our products, although we do have limited manufacturing operations consisting of value-add activities such as drilling pre-manufactured doors for holes and attaching hinges



In the Boise, Idaho market, Kyle’s operates a cabinet shop that is equipped with state-of-the-art tools operated by skilled cabinetmakers. It manufactures its cabinets using its computer numerical control machinery in order to maximize efficiency. The details of each custom cabinet it makes are created by its own employees, from hand sanding to staining and painting to adding a wide array of specialty finishes, coatings, distressing and glazing.



Pricing 



Our strategy has been to deliver quality and performance at a value-based price target. Our pricing model is generally offering better features or efficiencies than general market competitors in each product category to our builder markets.
Supplier Relationships 



We source products and raw materials from multiple regional, national and foreign suppliers. Certain of our products and materials come from Asian-based suppliers. Products and materials from Asian-based suppliers may be subjected to import tariffs, depending on various foreign policies of the US government. As such, we continue to explore partnership or supplier opportunities to optimize our costs.



The primary raw materials used in the manufacture of Kyle’s products are melamine and veneered sheet goods, lumber, doors and hardware. Cost of these raw materials is a key factor in pricing its products.



We have historically purchased certain key products and raw materials from a limited number of suppliers. We purchase products and raw materials on the basis of purchase orders. While we believe that there is an ample supply of most of the products and raw materials that we need, in the absence of firm and long-term contracts, we may not be able to obtain a sufficient supply of these products and raw materials from our existing suppliers or alternates in a timely fashion or at a reasonable cost. If we fail to secure a sufficient supply of key products and raw materials in a timely fashion, it would result in a significant delay in delivering our products and services, which may cause us to breach our sales contracts with our customers. Furthermore, failure to obtain sufficient supply of these products and raw materials at a reasonable cost could also harm our revenue and gross profit margins. Please see Item 1A “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Custom Carpentry Business” for a description of the risks related to our supplier relationships.



Furthermore, the COVID-19 pandemic has had and may continue to have an adverse impact on the overall supply chain, including labor shortages at saw mills, shipping delays, and increased prices, all of which may negatively affect our profitability and financial condition. See Item 1A “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business and Structure—The COVID-19 pandemic may cause a material adverse effect on our business.”



Sales and Marketing



In the Reno-Sparks-Fernley, Nevada market, we primarily work with large homebuilders of single-family homes, single-family homeowners and commercial and multi-family developers with revenue that is well diversified across multiple large homebuilding companies such as Mountain West, MSL, DR Horton, Tanamera, Allco Construction, Artisan Communities, Toll Brothers and Lennar, to name several of the more prominent commercial relationships we maintain.



In the Boise, Idaho market, we primarily work with custom or semi-custom home builders, but due to strong housing demands in the area, we are also tapping into the residential multi-family, new construction segment of the market.



We have high customer retention levels and have generated a considerable number of broader revenue opportunities through direct and specific interaction with our customer base. We have negotiated pricing with several long-term recurring contractor customers, which have accounted for a majority of our revenues. There can be no assurance that we will maintain or improve the relationships with those customers. If we cannot maintain long-term relationships with major customers or replace major customers from period to period with equivalent customers, the loss of such sales could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Please also see Item 1A “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Custom Carpentry Business—The loss of any of our key customers could have a materially adverse effect on our results of operations.”





30







We primarily rely on direct consumer marketing and our extensive relationships with local builders to market our products. We also maintain websites at www.kylescabinets.com and www.innovativecabinetsanddesign.com and conduct social media marketing through Facebook pages.



Competition



The finished carpentry industry consists of contractors that provide specialist finish carpentry services, such as on-site construction and the installation of doors, windows, stairs, shelving, cupboards, cabinets and decks. Carpenters experience steep competition from do-it-yourself (DIY) homeowners in the housing alterations and additions market and from other skilled tradespeople in the new building construction market, such as general building contractors’ in-house staff.



We compete with numerous competitors in our primary markets, with reputation, price, workmanship and services being the principal competitive factors. We primarily compete with other specialty builders in our markets, such as Franklin’s, Western Idaho, and to a lesser extent against national retail chains such as Home Depot and Lowes. Barriers to entry exist from other similar companies coming into the regions given the pool of available labor working in finished carpentry in the regions, and the close working relationships that exist between industry players in the regions. These barriers to entry are also experienced by larger competitors from outside the regions, providing them with substantial challenges in establishing a foothold. As a result of the implementation of our business strategy, which is delivering high value, quality products and customized solutions and installations, we anticipate that we will continue to effectively compete against the aforementioned competition.



Competitive Strengths



Based on management’s belief and experience in the industry, we believe that the following competitive strengths enable us to compete effectively.




● | Superior name and reputation. We are well established in our markets (including for over 40 years in the Boise market), and have built strong reputations for best-in-class processes, product quality, and timeliness. We have strong visibility both online and among industry professionals. Over our many years in business, we have established a stellar reputation for integrity, superior service, and genuine concern for our clients and their businesses. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Established blue-chip clients. We have customer lists that include many regional contractors in the areas that we service, many of whom have used us as their go-to vendors for many years. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Streamlined operations. We believe that our processes and operational systems have led to higher than average efficiencies, accuracy and profitability. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Diversified capabilities. We have diversified capabilities to support large homebuilders of single-family homes and commercial and multi-family developers, providing flexibility toward trending markets and growth opportunities. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Outstanding growth opportunities. Our portfolio, brand and reputation, and streamlined operational platform can be leveraged for expansion, both in existing regions, and other high-value surrounding areas. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Strong regional presence. We operate in the in the greater Reno-Sparks-Fernley metro area, which is one of the fastest growing economic regions in the Western U.S. due to its day drive distance to many of the largest commercial centers and port facilities in the United States and favorable tax and business regulation environment. There are multiple national homebuilders and multi-family developers are active in the region. We are among the largest custom carpentry companies in this region. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Growth Strategies



We will strive to grow our business by pursuing the following growth strategies.




● | Product line expansion. There are a number of opportunities to expand our product and servicing offerings. Notably, as discussed above, we intend to expand our window installation services, which has a large market potential. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Geographic expansion. With more service requests in the surrounding area, there is immediate opportunities for expansion to homeowners and contractors located near Twin Falls, McCall, and Sun Valley areas of Idaho, as well as Northern Nevada. We believe that we are well positioned to expand into these surrounding areas. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------






31








● | Expansion to commercial projects. There are opportunities for us to exploit additional opportunities in the commercial real estate sector. That could be office buildings and hotel and resort properties. In the Boise market, we primarily focus on the residential single family, new construction segment of the construction market. Evidence of market demand is ongoing for multi-family projects, both within our current customer markets and within other potential customers. Given appropriate infrastructure to support the market’s volume, immediate market penetration for multi-family projects could be achieved. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Capacity and infrastructure expansion. In the Boise market, we plan to purchase more machinery and build a separate finishing facility with automated spray finishing for stains, clear lacquers and pigmented lacquers. In the Reno market, we are in the process expanding our warehouse space and operations. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Employees



As of December 31, 2021, our custom carpentry companies employed 145 full-time employees. The following table sets forth the number of employees by function.




Department/Function | Employees
--------------------+----------
Management | | 5 
Office Employees | | 17 
Design | | 6 
Front End/ Build | | 7 
Finish | | 5 
Load/ Deliver | | 3

Specialty | | 1 
TOTALS | | 145




None of the employees are represented by labor unions, and we believe that our custom carpentry companies have excellent relationships with their employees.



Regulation



The facility in Boise, Idaho is subject to Idaho Department of Environmental Quality in connection with air quality and regulations relating to pollution and the protection of the environment, including those governing emissions to air, discharges to water, storage, treatment and disposal of waste, remediation of contaminated sites and protection of worker health and safety.



We believe that we are in substantial compliance with all applicable requirements. However, our efforts to comply with environmental requirements do not remove the risk that we may be held liable, or incur fines or penalties, and that the amount of liability, fines or penalties may be material, for, among other things, releases of hazardous substances occurring on or emanating from current or formerly owned or operated properties or any associated offsite disposal location, or for contamination discovered at any of our properties from activities conducted by previous occupants.



Permits are required for certain of our operations, and these permits are subject to revocation, modification and renewal by issuing authorities. Governmental authorities have the power to enforce compliance with their regulations, and violations may result in the payment of fines or the entry of injunctions, or both.



Changes in environmental laws and regulations or the discovery of previously unknown contamination or other liabilities relating to our properties and operations could result in significant environmental liabilities. In addition, we might incur significant capital and other costs to comply with increasingly stringent air emission control laws and enforcement policies which would decrease our cash flow.

AUTOMOTIVE SUPPLIES BUSINESS



Our automotive supplies business is operated by Wolo. This business segment, which was acquired at the end of the first quarter of 2021, accounted for approximately 18.6% of our total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2021.
Overview 



Our automotive supplies business is headquartered in Deer Park, New York and was founded in 1965. We design and sell horn and safety products (electric, air, truck, marine, motorcycle and industrial equipment), and offer vehicle emergency and safety warning lights for cars, trucks, industrial equipment and emergency vehicles. Focused on the automotive and industrial after-market, we sell our products to big-box national retail chains, through specialty and industrial distributors, as well as on- line/mail order retailers and OEMs. With a stellar reputation for innovative design, our current product line consists of over 455 products, including 54 patented products, as well as over 90 exclusive trademarks.
Products 



We design and sell over 455 products comprised of branded vehicle horns, warning lights, sirens, back-up alarms and accessories.



Horns



We design and sell an innovative and extensive selection of electromechanical, air and electronic-speaker horns. The horns are used in many industries such as: heavy duty truck, motorcycle, marine, industrial and the automotive aftermarket. We also sell hand-held gas horns which can be used for sporting events, as well as marine, construction sites and outdoor activities.



Our top-selling product is the Bad Boy horn, which has a one-piece design that requires no hoses. It installs in minutes by simply transferring the vehicle’s factory horn wires to the compressor, and mounts with one bolt included in kit. The Bad Boy produces a powerful dual tone air horn sound that is two times louder than the factory horn. It is compact in size to fit any car, truck, motorcycle and any 12-volt vehicle that wants a loud air horn sound. A heavy-duty maintenance free compressor provides years of dependable service.



In the past three years, we have brought a number of new and innovative horn products to the markets to which we sell. Some highlights include:




● | Midnight Express. A high-pressure truck train horn that is three trumpets, all metal and painted semi-gloss black. Train horns are purchased by the vehicle owner that wants the ultra-powerful sound of a train. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Quadraphonic Express. Four metal trumpets that are triple chrome plated, produce an ultra-powerful train horn sound that will be heard and will dress-up the appearance of any vehicle. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Nexgen Express Train Horn. A totally new design by us, a state-of-the-art fully electronic train horn, compact in size and produces more than 150-watts output. Engineered to fit into the engine compartment of cars, SUVs and even compact vehicles with a simple two wire hook-up, Nexgen offers two distinctive train horn sounds controlled by a wireless key fab. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Mighty Mo. An industrial equipment horn designed to withstand off-road and construction site conditions, while being able to penetrate noisy environments and still be heard. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Compressor and Tank Systems 



We also sell air compressor systems, consisting of air storage tanks, compressors and everything needed to hookup a high-pressure air horn. Two years ago, we started offering complete kits of train horns and choice of high-pressure air systems. Additionally, we offer replacement parts for all products, replacement parts are a profitable sale.
Electric Sirens and Speakers 



We have an array of emergency electronic sirens with built-in public address systems used by emergency responders.



Back-Up Alarms 



We offer a variety of back-up alarm systems from basic beep-style horn sold in all aftermarket retailers, to hi-tech intelligent alarms that adjust audio output to be louder than surrounding ambient noise. Our Model BA-697 has three super bright 1-watt LEDs that flash while the vehicle is in reverse and the auditable warning sound is turned on. In addition, we have a selection of white noise “Psss Psss” sound alarms required in the state of California.

Warning Lights 



We offer a large selection of warning lights for road assistance as well as emergency vehicles, construction, road safety and snow plowing vehicles. Warning lights come in a variety of types, sizes and shapes such as rotating, strobe and state-of-the-art LED models ranging in sizes from 8 inches to fifty-seven 57 inches. A recent addition to warning lights that has become an everyday bestseller for us is the new WATCHMAN®, which is a 24-inch magnet light bar that can be converted to permanent mounting in minutes with no special tools. Because of the products’ popularity, we designed a larger 48” version of the Watchman, which has seen very good acceptance in the market.



Another recent addition is Luminous, a high-performance, low profile linear light bar designed with the latest state-of-the-art electronic circuitry that has low power consumption and will provide years of reliable service. Luminous produces an intense beam of light which can be seen 360 degrees even in bright daylight. Available in three lengths in color amber, blue, red, green and any combination of colors. Luminous is certified SAE J845 Class 1 and California Title 13.



Manufacturing



Approximately 95% of our manufacturing is outsourced to contract manufacturers in China and Taiwan. The additional 5% of in-house manufacturing consists of changes to fully assembled products, as per custom orders. For example, converting the voltage of a horn for truck use, or the standard color of a particular warning light.



We have implemented a strict quality control program which is run by our warehouse/production manager. We believe that our high quality standards assure customers that they are getting the best and most reliable products in the market. Our manufacturing operations are designed to allow low-cost production of a wide variety of products while maintaining a high level of customer service and quality.



We believe that our manufacturing facilities generally have sufficient capacity to meet our current business requirements and our currently anticipated sales.



Vendor/Supplier Relationships 



We have developed long term relationships with our 22 contact manufacturers based in China and Taiwan. All materials are sourced by the contract manufacturers. Our top 10 vendors and suppliers are listed in the table below.

We have established relationships with our vendors, with many of these relationships spanning more than 15 years. We implement vendor agreements with all our major accounts and some mid-size accounts. The typical length of a vendor agreement is 2-3 years, and in most cases automatically renew.



We have also established volume discounts with our suppliers which help to offset increased material, tariffs’ and increased labor costs domestically and overseas. With the unstable world market, we have carefully started to engage secondary suppliers to make sure we have no interruptions in the supply chain and to be sure we maintain a competitive price.



We believe that our strong relationships with suppliers yield high quality, competitive pricing and overall good service to our customers. Although we cannot be sure that our sources of supply will be adequate in all circumstances, we believe that we can develop alternate sources in a timely and cost-effective manner if our current sources become inadequate. Due to availability of numerous alternative suppliers, we do not believe that the loss of any single supplier would have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations. See Item 1A “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Automotive Supply Business” for a description of the risks related to our supplier relationships.

Sales and Marketing



Our sales team consists of an in-house national sales manager who coordinates with contracted sales representatives from thirteen regional sales companies in North America, Mexico, Puerto Rico, the U.K., Europe, the Middle East and the industrial aftermarket. The sales representative’s agreement with us is limited to automotive, internet-based companies and occasionally motorcycle aftermarket distributors.



Sales representatives are responsible for the solicitation and development of new accounts, as well as working with existing customers to develop promotions and incentives for our products. We have had relationships with these regional sales companies for 13 to 15 years on-average. All major customers are serviced frequently by their sales representatives.



Our innovative retail product packaging design is also a highly effective marketing tool in direct-to-consumer selling. Featuring quick response (QR) barcode technology, customers are able to scan product packaging using their smart phone or mobile device to instantly see product information, watch demonstration videos, or even hear horn demos. There is no need for special in-store displays or additional shelf space as all information is accessible directly by scanning the product packaging. It is like having a virtual sales associate in-store. Packaging also features scan-back’s, an instant rebate that is applied at the register upon checkout.



Additional marketing programs include in-store promotional programs for customers, e-commerce via our website, as well as email blasts and customer print catalogs. We mail print and/or electronic CD catalogs to established accounts every 18 months with new product information inserted via supplemental sell-sheets. The full product catalog was last updated in 2019 and a new 2021-2022 catalog will be finished and ready to be mailed in the first or second quarter of 2022. There will also be a digital version of the catalog available for download. New product launches and updates are also sent to customers via email blast periodically.



We exhibit at key industry and customer tradeshows and belongs to the National Marine Manufacturers Association and American Boat and Yacht Council.



Customers



We sell products to the automobile aftermarket, national retailers, direct-to-consumer, mail order, web-based retailers, public safety equipment wholesalers, industrial wholesalers, as well as the motorcycle and marine aftermarkets.



We serve approximately 220 customers, including Amazon, AutoZone, Advanced Auto Parts, CarQuest, Aries, das, Grainger, FleetFarm and J&P Cycles. Internationally, we sell products in Canada, Mexico, Europe, and Amsterdam. Most of our online customers such as Amazon ship direct internationally. A majority of our sales are made to repeat customers, with many of our customer relationships spanning more than 10 years. We believe that our customers appreciate the ease of doing business with all orders placed electronically via electronic data interchange, or EDI.



Sales agreements are in place with about 25% of our customers, including all national and midsize accounts. Sales agreements specify new store allowances, terms of sale (discounts), annual stock adjustment, freight routing, company trade shows, rebates and advertising programs. Agreement lengths and renewal terms are based on the individual customer relationship.



In recent years, we have entered into the motorcycle and industrial (fleet maintenance) aftermarkets, as well a product line of horns for the marine parts aftermarket. The following diagram illustrates our target markets.

Order Fulfillment



Our efficient fulfillment process uses an intergraded EDI system for receiving orders, advanced shipping notices and invoicing. The custom software is integral in reducing manual order entry, as well the prevention of errors.



Implementing an EDI system has allowed us to maintain the minimum fulfillment threshold rate of 95%, as well as avoid fines from customers for order fulfillment errors and fill rate. The following diagram illustrates our order fulfillment process.








Research and Development



For the development of new products, we have implemented a streamlined R&D process. The average R&D process from initial design to sending a product sample for tooling is approximately 6-12 months.

● | Step 1: Identify and confirm a problem and/or need for a product
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------


● | Step 2: Draw up many possible solutions and discuss with sales manager and warehouse manager, whose focus in on the market demand
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Step 3: Narrow down to the three best options and create handmade prototype to test which solution works best.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Step 4: Send sample prototype to patent attorney to determine ability to patent and send hand sample to a draftsman for 3D drawing
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Step 5: The 3D drawing is approved, and a 3D print is made. The 3D print sample is tested, and any necessary modifications are made
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Step 6: The 3D drawing and printed sample are sent to one of our suppliers to start the tooling process

Competition



The sale of automotive aftermarket items is highly competitive in many areas, including customer service, product availability, store location, brand recognition and price. We believe that we have established our brand as an industry-leader in developing innovative products for the automobile aftermarket industry, especially in horn design and technology (electric, air, truck, marine, motorcycle and industrial equipment). Current competitors in related industries are FIAMM, Grote, Peterson Manufacturing Company, ECCO, Vixen Horns, HornBlasters and Klienn.
Competitive Advantages



Based on management’s belief and experience in the industry, we believe that the following competitive strengths enable us to compete effectively.




● | Established name and reputation. We believe that we have maintained our excellent reputation in the industry for over 55 years through bringing exclusive products and designs to market to meet current and future needs. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Patents and trademarks. We have been granted 54 patents from the U.S., China, Taiwan and the EU with three additional patents pending. About half of our patents are utility patents, which protect a products’ methods of functionality. Utility patents are a difficult barrier for competitors to overcome, therefore these products have a higher profit margin. The other half of our patents are design patents. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Long-term supplier and customer relationships. We have established relationships with our vendors, with many of these relationships spanning more than 15 years, and a majority of our sales are made to repeat customers, with many of our customer relationships spanning more than 10 years.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | International licensing agreements. We have a licensing agreement with a large wholesale supplier of auto parts in the U.K. for its patented Bad Boy Horn. The U.K. supplier also has retail chain stores and this agreement has been generating year-over-year sales growth for us. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Expansion Opportunities



Management sees the below as the key initiatives for our continued growth strategy:




● | Increase sales through new products and online marketing. We are aggressively pursuing our current market share and building sales by adding new products to existing accounts. Additionally, we will continue to expand our online sales platforms which include Wolo-mfg.com, Wolo-USA.com, Autozone.com, Amazon.com, BestAutoAccessories.com and Autoaccessoriesgarage.com, among others. There also exists significant growth potential in the purchasing of available key URL’s and implementing enhanced search engine optimization strategies. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Expand into traditional market and original equipment replacement horns. The automotive aftermarket has multiple channels of distribution, and one in which we have limited distribution is the traditional channel. This channel distributes products through wholesale warehouse distributors such as Federated Auto Parts, Pronto Auto Parts, Bumper-To-Bumper and Auto Value. Traditional distribution primarily services the DIFM (Do-It-For-Me) or professional installers. Most of the products sold are direct original equipment replacement parts which are researched based on year/make/model of the vehicle needing parts. We have limited distribution into the traditional channel, primarily due to the fact that there are no original equipment replacement horns in our product offerings. We believe that with minor product enhancements, we can offer products to serve this channel and improve market share into the traditional channel.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Expand into growing international markets. Currently, we sell our products in the US, Canada, Mexico, Europe and the Middle East. There is great growth opportunity in Mexico, where AutoZone currently has over 550 stores, and is continuing to expand aggressively. Additionally, we have identified Canada and the Netherlands as expansion markets specifically for our Motorcycle Air Horn. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Additional focus on the municipal and public safety markets. We have identified a significant demand for certified warning lights within the municipal and public safety markets. The certification of existing products is immediately possible and very cost effective. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Grow presence within the marine marketplace. We see immediate growth opportunities existing within the marine market with certified horns that meet US Coast Guard regulations and other regulatory standards. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
