Industry Trends
The mobile industry has experienced tremendous growth for more than 20 years. As the largest technology platform in the world, mobile connectivity has changed the way we work, the way we live and the way we connect with each other. The scale and pace of innovation in mobile technology, especially around connectivity and computing capabilities, is also impacting industries beyond wireless. 
Looking ahead, Inseego is working with other leaders in the wireless industry to develop 5G technology, which is the next generation of wireless technology. With the newly defined 5G New Radio (“5G NR”) standard, 5G is being designed to support faster data rates, lower network latency and wider bandwidths of spectrum. Incorporating many of the innovations developed for 4G, 5G is also expected to be scalable and adaptable across a variety of use cases, which include, among others: empowering new industries and services, such as autonomous vehicles and industrial applications, through ultra-reliable, ultra-low latency communication links; and connecting a significant number of IoT service and devices, including the connected home and smart cities devices, with connectivity designed to meet ultra-low power, complexity and cost requirements. 5G is also expected to enhance mobile broadband services, including ultra-high definition (4K) video streaming and augmented and virtual reality, with multi-gigabit speeds.
Most 5G devices are expected to include multimode support for 3G, 4G and Wi-Fi, enabling service continuity where 5G has yet to be deployed and simultaneous connectivity across 4G and Wi-Fi technologies, while also allowing mobile operators to utilize current network deployments. At the same time, 4G is expected to continue to evolve in parallel with the development of 5G and become fundamental to many of the key 5G technologies, such as support for unlicensed spectrum, gigabit LTE user data rates and LTE IoT with connectivity designed to meet the needs of ultra-low power, complexity and cost applications. The first phase of 5G networks are expected to support mobile broadband services in lower spectrum bands below 6 GHz as well as higher bands above 6 GHz, including millimeter wave (mmWave).
According to the Global 5G Market Report issued in January 2018 by Netscribes, Inc. (“Netscribes”), 5G technology is projected to service business frameworks required into 2020 and beyond. Due to socioeconomic transformations brought about by advancements in smart/connected city applications, mobile 5G is projected to be the “next big thing” in connected asset evolution. While mobile 4G LTE will continue to drive substantial volumes over the next decade, Netscribes predicts that the global 5G market will grow at a rate in excess of 95 percent, to greater than $250 billion by 2025. 5G technology is expected to address the rising demands for advanced applications, continued adoption of IoT devices and applications, and the rising bandwidth demands associated with said applications.
We continue to work closely with mobile operators, chipset suppliers and infrastructure companies around the world on 5G developments and trials in preparation for commercial network launches.

The adoption of IoT technology continues to grow as companies across a wide range of industries are leveraging IoT technologies to increase efficiency, gain better customer insights, facilitate compliance and build new business models. IoT growth is expanding broadly, and adoption is particularly strong in the telematics and transportation industries and in industrial IoT markets such as smart city infrastructure, utilities and energy management. We are building IoT capabilities by leveraging business models that monetize usage on most major carrier networks. We have developed IoT solutions that address key market needs for asset tracking applications, telematics, SD WAN failover management and various other industrial applications. In addition, our IoT customers can turn the data that our solutions provide into actionable insights to develop new services and create revenue growth.
Our IoT solutions enable applications for various vertical markets, such as fleet and asset tracking and telematics, smart city applications to improve public safety, traffic management and energy management. Our telematics business offers a full array of solutions to both businesses and consumers that combine location-based software, services and data intelligence. We enable our customers to track, safeguard and optimize their most prized assets: people, vehicles, equipment and data. Inseego telematics, sold under the Ctrack brand, is a top commercial telematics provider globally. We serve both the enterprise and small and medium-sized business market segments with advanced solutions and scale in distribution, research and development, and customer support. Additionally, we have made significant strides into the burgeoning aviation vertical.
Strategic Realignment
On September 21, 2016, we entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”), by and among Inseego and Novatel Wireless, on the one hand, and T.C.L. Industries Holdings (H.K.) Limited and Jade Ocean Global Limited (collectively, the “Purchasers”) on the other hand. The Purchase Agreement related to the proposed sale of our subsidiary, Novatel Wireless, which included the Company’s MiFi branded hotspots and USB modem product lines (the “MiFi Business”), to the Purchasers for $50.0 million in cash, subject to potential adjustment for Novatel Wireless’s working capital as of the closing date. 
In June 2017, we terminated the Purchase Agreement due to delays and uncertainty in securing approval of the transactions contemplated by the Purchase Agreement from the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (“CFIUS”) and announced key leadership changes and a Company-wide restructuring designed to improve execution, enhance financial performance and drive profitable growth as we worked to create sustainable long-term value for shareholders. As part of the restructuring plan, among other actions, we implemented cost reduction measures which included a series of targeted reductions across our businesses and geographies, and rationalization of our businesses. As a result of the termination of the transaction described above and the institution of certain restructuring initiatives, we retained our ownership interest in Novatel Wireless and the MiFi Business. 
One of the many benefits associated with the retention of the MiFi Business is the retention of know-how and intellectual property essential to the development of advanced wireless technologies, such as the newly emerging 5G NR standard.
