ITEM 1. BUSINESS
In this report, we use the terms “the Company,” “we,” “us” and “our” to refer to AECOM and its consolidated subsidiaries. Unless otherwise noted, references to years are for fiscal years. Our fiscal year consists of 52 or 53 weeks, ending on the Friday closest to September 30. For clarity of presentation, we present all periods as if the year ended on September 30. We refer to the fiscal year ended September 30, 2021 as “fiscal 2021” and the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022 as “fiscal 2022.”

Our business focuses primarily on providing fee-based knowledge-based services. We primarily derive income from our ability to generate revenue and collect cash from our clients through the billing of our employees’ time spent on client projects and our ability to manage our costs. AECOM Capital primarily derives its income from real estate development sales and management fees.
During the first quarter of fiscal 2020, we reorganized our operating and reporting structure to better align with our ongoing professional services business. This reorganization better reflected our continuing operations after the sale of our Management Services segment, the sale of our self-perform at-risk civil infrastructure and power construction businesses, and the sale of our oil & gas construction business. Our Management Services and self-perform at-risk construction businesses were part of our former Management Services segment and represented a substantial portion of the revenue of our former Construction Services segment, respectively. These businesses are classified as discontinued operations in all periods presented.
We report our continuing business through three segments, each of which is described in further detail below: Americas, International, and AECOM Capital (ACAP). Such segments are organized by the differing specialized needs of the respective clients and how we manage the business. We have aggregated various operating segments into our reportable segments based on their similar characteristics, including similar long-term financial performance, the nature of services provided, internal processes for delivering those services, and types of customers.

● | Americas: Planning, consulting, architectural and engineering design, and construction and program management services to commercial and government clients in the United States, Canada, and Latin America in major end markets such as transportation, facilities, water, government, environmental, and energy. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | International: Planning, consulting, architectural and engineering design services and program management to commercial and government clients in Europe, the Middle East, India, Africa, and the Asia-Australia-Pacific regions in major end markets such as transportation, facilities, water, government, environmental, and energy. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | AECOM Capital (ACAP): Invests primarily in and develops real estate projects. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our Americas and International Segments 
Our Americas and International segments comprise a broad array of services, generally provided on a fee-for-service basis. These services include advisory, planning, consulting, architectural and engineering design, program management and construction management for industrial, commercial, institutional and government clients worldwide. For each of these services, our technical expertise includes civil, structural, process, mechanical, geotechnical systems and electrical engineering, architectural, landscape and interior design, urban and regional planning, project economics, cost consulting and environmental, health and safety work. Our Americas segment provides services generally in the United States, Canada and Latin America. Our International segment provides similar services generally in Europe, the Middle East, India, Africa and the Asia-Australia-Pacific regions. 
With our technical, advisory and program management expertise, we are able to provide our clients a broad spectrum of services. For example, within our environmental service offerings, we provide remediation, regulatory compliance planning and management, environmental modeling, climate adaptation and resilience, environmental and social impact assessment and environmental permitting for major capital/infrastructure projects. 
In addition, our industry is undergoing a digital transformation, and we are investing in digital capabilities to extend our advantages, improve overall delivery, and create distinct solutions for clients that differentiate us from competitors. Clients are asking for innovative and more advanced solutions to increasingly complex challenges, where our digital suite of products and investments in innovation are creating a more holistic approach to our work. For example, in fiscal 2022, we launched PipeInsights™, which is a digital pipe inspection tool that accelerates the time and reduces the cost of inspection with a high degree of accuracy with embedded Machine Learning capabilities.
Our services may be sequenced over multiple phases. For example, in the area of program management and construction management services, our work for a client may begin with a small consulting or planning contract, and may later develop into an overall management role for the project or a series of projects, which we refer to as a program. Program and construction management contracts may employ small or large project teams and, in many cases, operate as an outsourcing arrangement with our staff located at the project site.

Our AECOM Capital Segment
ACAP typically partners with investors and experienced developers as co-general partners. ACAP may, but is not required to, enter into contracts with our other AECOM affiliates to provide design, owners engineer, construction management, development and operations and maintenance services for ACAP funded projects. ACAP development activity is conducted through joint ventures or subsidiaries that may be consolidated or unconsolidated for financial reporting purposes depending on the extent and nature of our ownership interest. In addition, in connection with the investment activities of ACAP, AECOM or an affiliate may provide guarantees of certain financial obligations, including guarantees for completion of projects, repayment of debt, environmental indemnity obligations, and other lender required guarantees. ACAP focuses on investing in co-general partner equity opportunities with high quality partners, primarily targeting “build-to-core” investments in the top U.S. markets across all property types.
Thinking and Acting Globally
AECOM is at its best when we think and act globally. Our strategy is focused on setting a new standard of excellence in the professional services industry. First, our operating structure promotes greater connectivity and collaboration across our seven regions and five global business lines. We drive growth by prioritizing our core markets, leaning into our greatest strengths and ensuring our best talent and resources are focused on nurturing client relationships. We are transforming the way we deliver work through technology and digital platforms improving the client experience and increasing efficiency. Lastly, we are building upon our position as a leading ESG company, unified by our purpose to deliver a better world.

Environmental, Social and Governance Matters
We are committed to being a leader in environmental sustainability, social responsibility, and corporate governance.
We embrace sustainability by striving to make a positive, lasting impact on society and the environment. Sustainability is at the core of what we do and how we operate — focusing on the environmental, social and governance impact of our business. Through our projects and our operations, we have both a significant opportunity and a responsibility to protect, enhance and restore the world’s natural and social systems.

​

We are committed to addressing the effects of climate change as a key priority for our sustainability program by improving resilience and working to advance increasingly ambitious greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets. To this point, in fiscal 2022, we were among the first companies globally to have set net zero emissions reduction targets approved by the Science Based Targets Initiative (SBTi), which are designed to exceed the goals of the Paris Agreement on climate change. These net zero emissions reduction goals include a near-term target to reduce Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions by 50% by 2030 and a long-term target to reduce total emissions by 90% by 2040. These commitments build upon our commitments as a signatory to the UN Global Compact. 
In addition, we continue to invest in proprietary innovations and digital solutions. This includes a solution to combat globally pervasive emerging contaminants, such as our proprietary DE-FLUOROTM water treatment solution to destroy per and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) on-site. In addition, we are leading on decarbonization measurement, biodiversity impact and re-wilding through our innovative work at the National Capital Laboratory (NCL) in the U.K., where we are restoring 100 acres of forest and reintroducing lost species. Our work at the NCL won the 2022 Verdantix Innovation Excellence Award for Sustainability Strategy Implementation for success in analyzing and measuring biodiversity impact.
We maintain an internal Global ESG Council to coordinate and drive our ESG initiatives across AECOM worldwide, and our Board has oversight over ESG matters. Additional information regarding our ESG initiatives is located on the investor relations section of our website, at https://investors.aecom.com/esg. 
Human Capital Management
Our principal asset is our employees, and large percentages of our employees have technical and professional backgrounds and undergraduate and/or advanced degrees. At the end of our fiscal 2022, we employed approximately 50,000 persons, of whom approximately 18,000 were employed in the United States. Over 450 of our domestic employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements or by specific labor agreements, which expire upon completion of the relevant project. We believe that the quality and level of service that our professionals deliver are among the highest in our industry. 
We are committed to enhancing our position as a leading employer in our industry. The foundation of our continuing success is our ability to attract, recruit and retain the industry’s best, diverse talent by offering a compelling employee value proposition that promises competitive pay and benefits, flexibility and a foundation of learning and career growth, an inclusive culture that supports well-being and encourages collaboration and innovation, and a shared commitment to our values and purpose. This understanding informs our approach to managing our human capital resources. Our human capital objectives and initiatives are overseen by our Board as per our Corporate Governance Guidelines.
Health and Safety. Core to our corporate values is safeguarding our people and fostering a culture of caring that promotes the wellbeing of our employees, contractors and business partners. We safeguard our people, projects and reputation by striving for zero employee injuries and illnesses, while operating and delivering our work responsibly and sustainably. We maintain our industry’s best-in-class lost workday case and recordable incident rates, and our safety performance is consistently recognized by key clients across the regions where we work as well as by recognized safety organizations. AECOM supports community uptake of approved Covid-19 vaccines as the most effective measure to end the global pandemic and we strongly encourage that employees receive an approved vaccine. Employees supporting clients through site visits and face-to-face meetings abide by client-worksite Covid-19 protocols, which may include documentation establishing proof of immunization or proof of negative Covid-19 test. We have taken and will continue to take critical steps to keep our people, clients and communities safe from Covid-19.
Equity, diversity and inclusion. We are committed to advancing equity, diversity and inclusion in our organization and within our industry. We build safe and respectful work environments where our employees are invited to bring their talents, backgrounds and expertise to bear on some of the world’s most complex problems and where every person has the opportunity to thrive personally and professionally. We are advancing efforts globally in four key areas: 1) Building a workforce reflective of the communities we serve through our recruitment efforts, building leadership accountability, and partnering with nonprofit organizations and universities to build the talent pipeline for the future; 2) Enriching communities through pro-bono work, volunteerism, philanthropy and strategic partnerships; 3) Expanding understanding and empathy among employees through employee resource groups, ED&I events and celebrations, and family-friendly benefit policies; and 4) Prioritizing social equity and impact in every project we pursue and the innovative solutions we deliver.

​

Freedom to Grow. As we move beyond the pandemic, we are continuing to evolve the way we work and offer our employees more freedom of movement and more choices in their personal and professional lives. Freedom to Grow is our global framework designed to support employees in finding the balance and flexibility they need to be their best and deliver for clients, and a key factor in our ability to attract and retain talent. Employees and managers can evaluate work schedules and locations and align on an arrangement that prioritizes client and team responsibilities while supporting individual needs and includes two-to-three days a week in the office as an expectation. Our Freedom to Grow program goes far beyond just when and where we work. We consider our people’s holistic experience, respecting diversity in work, communication and thinking styles.

Workplace of the future. Drawing on the experiences of our teams and our clients during the pandemic, we developed a space and technology framework that allows for seamless connectivity between home offices, company offices and client sites, and a new global workplace design that accounts for reduced capacity requirements and prioritizes sustainability, collaboration and engagement. We are also advancing initiatives to enable the digital delivery of our work by establishing best practices and governance protocols for the digital reuse of core elements of the design process.

​

Technical and professional development. We continue to invest in our people and programs that enrich our employees’ experience, foster a culture of collaboration and opportunity with an emphasis on global connectivity and leader effectiveness, and position AECOM as the best place to work in our industry. These efforts include offering competitive employee health and well-being programs to support employees and their families, expanding access to and developing professional and technical training programs, delivering new digital tools to enhance connectivity, networking and collaborations among employees, introducing four distinct career paths.
Our digital learning platform, AECOM University, delivers self-directed, personalized learning experiences for critical skill building, technical certification and continued education. We also provide high-quality, structured training programs through our Global Business Line Technical Academies, which are created by our global experts and business line leaders to deliver the latest technical training courses on key global topics, practices and markets that are relevant to our global business. A full range of professional development programs called Leadership at all Levels cultivates innovative thinkers, supportive managers, and impactful leaders through coaching and skill building at every career level. These programs are based on our four pillars of Leadership Capabilities, which outline the behaviors we want our leaders to demonstrate and exemplify for the collective success as an organization.

Purpose and impact. As the world’s trusted infrastructure consulting firm and a leader in environmental, social and corporate governance (ESG), we are determined and well-positioned to deliver positive, impactful and Sustainable Legacies for our company, our communities and our planet. Through strategic nonprofit partnerships, pro-bono work, skills-based volunteering and philanthropy, and Blueprint for a Better World, our corporate responsibility platform, we are focused on delivering access to safe and secure infrastructure to those who need it most, creating opportunity for the leaders of tomorrow and protecting our planet so that our company can fulfill its purpose to deliver a better world. As part of the Blueprint pro-bono program, our technical experts partnered with nonprofit organizations in their local communities to provide critical design, engineering and infrastructure solutions. In addition, we have maintained our commitment to our enterprise strategic nonprofit partners – Engineers Without Borders and Water for People.

Our Clients
Our clients consist primarily of national, state, regional and local governments, public and private institutions and major corporations. The following table sets forth our total revenue attributable to these categories of clients for each of the periods indicated:
​

​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​

​
No single client accounted for 10% or more of our revenue in any of the past five fiscal years. Approximately 6%, 8%, and 8% of our revenue was derived through direct contracts with agencies of the U.S. federal government in the years ended September 30, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. 
Contracts
The price provisions of the contracts we undertake can be grouped into several broad categories: cost-reimbursable contracts, guaranteed maximum price contracts, and fixed-price contracts. For the year ended September 30, 2022, our revenue was comprised of 41%, 33%, and 26% cost-reimbursable, guaranteed maximum price, and fixed-price contracts, respectively.
Cost-Reimbursable Contracts
Cost-reimbursable contracts include cost-plus fixed fee, cost-plus fixed rate, and time-and-materials price contracts. Under cost-plus contracts, we charge clients for our costs, including both direct and indirect costs, plus a negotiated fee or rate. We recognize revenues based on actual direct costs incurred and the applicable fixed rate or portion of the fixed fee earned as of the balance sheet date. Under time-and-materials price contracts, we negotiate hourly billing rates and charge clients based on the actual time we expend on the project. In addition, clients reimburse us for materials and other direct incidental expenditures, including payments to subcontractors, incurred in connection with our performance under the contract. Time-and-material price contracts may also have a fixed-price element in the form of not-to-exceed or guaranteed maximum price provisions. 
Some cost-plus contracts provide for award fees or a penalty based on performance criteria in lieu of a fixed fee or fixed rate. Other contracts include a base fee component plus a performance-based award fee. In addition, we may share award fees with subcontractors. We generally recognize revenue to the extent of costs actually incurred plus a proportionate amount of the fee expected to be earned. We take the award fee or penalty on contracts into consideration when estimating revenue and profit rates, and record revenue related to the award fees when there is sufficient information to assess anticipated contract performance and a significant reversal of the award fee is not probable. Once an award is received, the estimated or accrued fees are adjusted to the actual award amount.
Some cost-plus contracts provide for incentive fees based on performance against contractual milestones. The amount of the incentive fees varies, depending on whether we achieve above, at, or below target results. We originally recognize revenue on these contracts based upon expected results. These estimates are revised when necessary based upon additional information that becomes available as the contract progresses.

11



​

Guaranteed Maximum Price Contracts
Guaranteed maximum price (GMP) contracts share many of the same contract provisions as cost-plus and fixed-price contracts. As with cost-plus contracts, clients are provided a disclosure of all project costs, and a lump sum percentage fee is separately identified. We provide clients with a guaranteed price for the overall project (adjusted for change orders issued by clients) and a schedule including the expected completion date. Cost overruns or costs associated with project delays in completion could generally be our responsibility. For many of our commercial or residential GMP contracts, the final price is generally not established until we have subcontracted a substantial percentage of the trade contracts with terms consistent with the master contract, and we have negotiated additional contract limitations, such as waivers of consequential damages as well as aggregate caps on liabilities and liquidated damages. Revenue is recognized for GMP contracts as project costs are incurred relative to total estimated project costs.
Fixed-Price Contracts
Fixed-price contracts include both lump-sum and fixed-unit price contracts. Under lump-sum contracts, we perform all the work under the contract for a specified price. Lump-sum contracts are typically subject to price adjustments if the scope of the project changes or unforeseen conditions arise. Under fixed-unit price contracts, we perform a number of units of work at an agreed price per unit with the total payment under the contract determined by the actual number of units delivered. Revenue is recognized for fixed-price contracts using the input method measured on a cost-to-cost basis.
Some of our fixed-price contracts require us to provide surety bonds or parent company guarantees to assure our clients that their project will be completed in accordance with the terms of the contracts as further disclosed in Note 18—Commitments and Contingencies. In such cases, we may require our primary subcontractors to provide similar performance bonds and guarantees and to be adequately insured, and we may flow down the terms and conditions set forth in our agreement on to our subcontractors. There may be risks associated with completing these projects profitably if we are not able to perform our services within the fixed-price contract terms.
Joint Ventures
Some of our larger contracts may operate under joint ventures or other arrangements under which we team with other reputable companies, typically companies with which we have worked for many years. This is often done where the scale of the project dictates such an arrangement or when we want to strengthen either our market position or our technical skills.

12



​

Backlog
Backlog represents revenue we expect to realize for work completed by our consolidated subsidiaries and our proportionate share of work to be performed by unconsolidated joint ventures. Backlog is expressed in terms of gross revenue and, therefore, may include significant estimated amounts of third party or pass-through costs to subcontractors and other parties. We report transaction price allocated to remaining unsatisfied performance obligations (RUPO) of $20.8 billion, as described in Note 4, Revenue Recognition, in the notes to our consolidated financial statements. The most significant differences between our backlog and RUPO are backlog contains revenue we expect to record in the future where we have been awarded the work, but the contractual agreement has not yet been signed, unconsolidated joint venture backlog where we expect to realize income through equity earnings rather than revenue, and revenue related to service contracts that extend beyond the termination provision of those contracts, where RUPO requires us to assume the contract will be terminated at its earliest convenience. Accordingly, RUPO is $19.4 billion lower than backlog. For non-government contracts, our backlog includes future revenue at contract rates, excluding contract renewals or extensions that are at the discretion of the client. For contracts with a not-to-exceed maximum amount, we include revenue from such contracts in backlog to the extent of the remaining estimated amount. We calculate backlog without regard to possible project reductions or expansions or potential cancellations until such changes or cancellations occur. No assurance can be given that we will ultimately realize our full backlog. Backlog fluctuates due to the timing of when contracts are awarded and contracted and when contract revenue is recognized. Many of our contracts require us to provide services over more than one year. Our backlog for the year ended September 30, 2022 increased $1.6 billion, or 4.1%, to $40.2 billion as compared to $38.6 billion for the corresponding period last year, primarily due to an increase in our Americas design and construction management business. 
The following summarizes backlog (in billions):
​

​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ 
----------------------+---+---------------+------+------+---+-----
​ | ​ | September 30,
​ | | 2022 | | 2021
Backlog: | | ​ | | | ​ | 
Americas segment | ​ | $ | 35.1 | ​ | $ | 33.4
International segment | ​ | | 5.1 | ​ | | 5.2 
Total backlog | ​ | $ | 40.2 | ​ | $ | 38.6

​
Competition
The markets we serve are highly fragmented and we compete with a large number of regional, national and international companies. We have numerous competitors, ranging from small private firms to multi-billion dollar companies, some of which have greater financial resources or that are more specialized and concentrate their resources in particular areas of expertise. The extent of our competition varies according to the particular markets and geographic area. The degree and type of competition we face is also influenced by the type and scope of a particular project. The technical and professional aspects of our services generally do not require large upfront capital expenditures and, therefore, provide limited barriers against new competitors.
We believe that we are well positioned to compete in our markets because of our reputation, our cost effectiveness, our long-term client relationships, our extensive network of offices, our employee expertise, and our broad range of services. In addition, as a result of our extensive national and international network, we are able to offer our clients localized knowledge and expertise, as well as the support of our worldwide professional staff. In addition, through investments in technology and innovation, we are able to bring advanced solutions to clients.

13



​

Seasonality
We experience seasonal trends in our business. Our revenue is typically higher in the last half of the fiscal year. The fourth quarter of our fiscal year (July 1 to September 30) is typically our strongest quarter. We find that the U.S. federal government tends to authorize more work during the period preceding the end of our fiscal year, September 30. In addition, many U.S. state governments with fiscal years ending on June 30 tend to accelerate spending during their first quarter, when new funding becomes available. Further, our construction management revenue typically increases during the high construction season of the summer months. Within the United States, as well as other parts of the world, our business generally benefits from milder weather conditions in our fiscal fourth quarter, which allows for more productivity from our on-site civil services. Our construction and project management services also typically expand during the high construction season of the summer months. The first quarter of our fiscal year (October 1 to December 31) is typically our lowest revenue quarter. The harsher weather conditions impact our ability to complete work in parts of North America and the holiday season schedule affects our productivity during this period. For these reasons, coupled with the number and significance of client contracts commenced and completed during a particular period, as well as the timing of expenses incurred for corporate initiatives, it is not unusual for us to experience seasonal changes or fluctuations in our quarterly operating results.
Risk Management and Insurance
Risk management is an integral part of our project management approach and our project execution process. We have an Office of Risk Management that reviews and oversees the risk profile of our operations. Also, pursuant to our internal delegations of authority, a group of senior members of our risk management team evaluates risk through internal risk analyses of higher-risk projects, contracts or other business decisions. We maintain insurance covering professional liability and claims involving bodily injury and property damage. Wherever possible, we endeavor to eliminate or reduce the risk of loss on a project through the use of quality assurance/control, risk management, workplace safety and similar methods.
Regulations
Our business is impacted by environmental, health and safety, government procurement, anti-bribery and other government regulations and requirements. Below is a summary of some of the significant regulations that impact our business.
Environmental, Health and Safety. Our business involves the planning, design, program management, construction management, and operations and maintenance at various project sites, including, but not limited to, nuclear facilities, hazardous waste and Superfund sites, hydrocarbon production, distribution and transport sites, and other infrastructure-related facilities. We also regularly perform work in and around sensitive environmental areas, such as rivers, lakes and wetlands.
Significant fines, penalties and other sanctions may be imposed for non-compliance with environmental and health and safety laws and regulations, and some laws provide for joint and several strict liabilities for remediation of releases of hazardous substances, rendering a person liable for environmental damage, without regard to negligence or fault on the part of such person. These laws and regulations may expose us to liability arising out of the conduct of operations or conditions caused by others, or for our acts that were in compliance with all applicable laws at the time these acts were performed. For example, there are a number of governmental laws that strictly regulate the handling, removal, treatment, transportation and disposal of toxic and hazardous substances, such as the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, and comparable national and state laws, that impose strict, joint and several liabilities for the entire cost of cleanup, without regard to whether a company knew of or caused the release of hazardous substances. In addition, some environmental regulations can impose liability for the entire clean-up upon owners, operators, generators, transporters and other persons arranging for the treatment or disposal of such hazardous substances related to contaminated facilities or project sites. Other federal environmental, health and safety laws affecting us include, but are not limited to, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, the National Environmental Policy Act, the Clean Air Act, the Clean Air Mercury Rule, the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Toxic Substances Control Act, and the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act, as well as other comparable national and state laws. Liabilities related to environmental contamination or human exposure to hazardous substances, comparable national and state laws or a failure to comply with applicable regulations could result in substantial costs to us, including cleanup costs, fines and civil or criminal sanctions, third-party claims for property damage or personal injury, or cessation of remediation activities.
Some of our business operations are covered by Public Law 85-804, which provides for indemnification by the U.S federal government against claims and damages arising out of unusually hazardous or nuclear activities performed at the request of the U.S. federal government. Should public policies and laws change, however, U.S. federal government indemnification may not be available in the case of any future claims or liabilities relating to hazardous activities that we undertake to perform.

Government Procurement.  The services we provide to the U.S. federal government are subject to Federal Acquisition Regulation, the Truth in Negotiations Act, Cost Accounting Standards, the Services Contract Act, export controls rules and Department of Defense (DOD) security regulations, as well as many other laws and regulations. These laws and regulations affect how we transact business with our clients and, in some instances, impose additional costs on our business operations. A violation of specific laws and regulations could lead to fines, contract termination or suspension of future contracts. Our government clients can also terminate, renegotiate, or modify any of their contracts with us at their convenience; and many of our government contracts are subject to renewal or extension annually.
Anti-Bribery and other regulations. We are subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar anti-bribery laws, which generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. The U.K. Bribery Act of 2010 prohibits both domestic and international bribery, as well as bribery across both private and public sectors. In addition, an organization that “fails to prevent bribery” committed by anyone associated with the organization can be charged under the U.K. Bribery Act unless the organization can establish the defense of having implemented “adequate procedures” to prevent bribery. To the extent we export technical services, data and products outside of the U.S., we are subject to U.S. and international laws and regulations governing international trade and exports, including, but not limited to, the International Traffic in Arms Regulations, the Export Administration Regulations, and trade sanctions against embargoed countries. We provide services to the DOD and other defense-related entities that often require specialized professional qualifications and security clearances. In addition, as engineering design services professionals, we are subject to a variety of local, state, federal, and foreign licensing and permit requirements and ethics rules.
Raw Materials
We purchase most of the raw materials and components necessary to operate our business from numerous sources. However, the price and availability of raw materials and components may vary from year to year due to customer demand, production capacity, market conditions, and material shortages. While we do not currently foresee the lack of availability of any particular raw materials in the near term, prolonged unavailability of raw materials necessary to our projects and services or significant price increases for those raw materials could have a material adverse effect on our business in the near term.
Government Contracts
Generally, our government contracts are subject to renegotiation or termination of contracts or subcontracts at the discretion of the U.S. federal, state or local governments, and national governments of other countries.
Trade Secrets and Other Intellectual Property
We rely principally on trade secrets, confidentiality policies and other contractual arrangements to protect much of our intellectual property.
