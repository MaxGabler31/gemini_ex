Overview

We are a biopharmaceutical company developing approaches to activate and co-stimulate a patients immune system against cancer. Our co-stimulatory antibody is designed to harness the body's natural antigen specific immune activation and tolerance mechanisms to reprogram the immunity and provide a long-term, durable clinical effect. Our T-cell activating platform (TCAP) produces therapies designed to turn immunologically cold tumors hot, and be administered in combination with checkpoint inhibitors and other immuno-modulators to increase clinical effectiveness. Unlike many other patient specific immunotherapy approaches, our drugs are off-the-shelf which means that we can administer drug immediately without extracting patient material at a substantially lower cost of goods sold. Our TCAP product candidates from our ImPACT® and ComPACT platforms are produced from allogeneic cell lines expressing tumor-specific proteins common among cancers. We are currently enrolling patients in our Phase 2 clinical trial for advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), in combination with Bristol-Myers Squibbs nivolumab (Opdivo®). We also have numerous preclinical programs at various stages of development. 

Through our ImPACT® platform technology our initial TCAP, we have developed product candidates that consist of live, allogeneic off-the-shelf genetically-modified, irradiated human cancer cells. These cells secrete a broad spectrum of Cancer Testis Antigens (CTAs), classified functionally as tumor-specific neoantigens, together with the gp96 protein. Our ImPACT® technology achieves this by reprogramming live tumor cells to secrete gp96 to serve as a chaperone for tumor antigens to activate and expand T-cell immunity; thereby, transforming the allogeneic cells into machines that have been shown to activate a robust killer CD8+ T cell immune attack against a patients cancer. Unlike autologous or personalized monotherapy approaches that either require the extraction of blood or tumor tissue from each patient or the creation of an individualized treatment, our product candidates are fully allogeneic, and do not require extraction of individual patients material or custom manufacturing. As a result, our product candidates can be mass-produced and have the ability to be readily available for immediate patient use. Because each patient receives the same treatment, we believe that our immunotherapy approach offers logistical, manufacturing and other cost benefits, compared to patient-specific or precision medicine approaches.

Our Combination Pan-antigen Cytotoxic Therapy (ComPACT) our second TCAP, is a dual-acting immunotherapy designed to deliver T-cell activation and enhanced, T-cell specific co-stimulation in a single treatment. ComPACT helps unlock the bodys natural defenses and builds upon ImPACT® by also providing alternative co-stimulation targeting enhanced T-cell activation and expansion. It has the potential to simplify combination immunotherapy development with enhanced safety for oncology patients, as it is designed to deliver the gp96 heat shock protein with each selected tumor cell lines neoantigens (CTAs) and a T-cell co-stimulatory fusion protein (e.g. OX40L) into a single intradermal treatment. ComPACT serves as a booster to expand the number of antigen-specific T-cells compared to co-stimulator alone, while also enhancing the activation of cancer antigen-specific CD8+ memory T-cells for an extended time after treatment. ComPACT has the potential to be a cost-effective approach compared to conventional immunotherapies.

Pelican Therapeutics, Inc. (Pelican), a subsidiary of Heat, is a biotechnology company focused on the development of monoclonal antibody and fusion protein-based therapies designed to activate the immune system. PTX-35, which is currently in preclinical IND enabling activities, is Pelicans lead product candidate targeting the T-cell co-stimulator, TNF receptor superfamily member 25 (TNFRSF25). It is designed to harness the body's natural antigen specific immune activation and tolerance mechanisms to reprogram the immunity and provide a long-term, durable clinical effect. When combined with immunotherapies, including the ImPACT® and ComPACT platform technologies, PTX-35 has been shown to enhance antigen specific T-cell activation to eliminate tumor cells. PTX-15, Pelicans second product candidate, is a human TL1A-lg fusion protein designed as a shorter half-life agonist of TNFRSF25. 

In June 2016, Pelican was awarded a $15.2 million Cancer Prevention Institute of Texas (CPRIT) grant (the CPRIT Grant) to support further development of PTX-35 and fund a Phase 1 clinical trial to examine potential benefits to patients with several types of cancers, such as lung, lymphoma, prostate, pancreatic and ovarian. 

Our wholly-owned subsidiary, Zolovax, Inc. (Zolovax), is engaged in preclinical studies to develop therapeutic and preventative vaccines to treat infectious diseases based on our gp96 vaccine technology, with a current focus on the development of a Zika vaccine in collaboration with the University of Miami. Other infectious diseases of interest include HIV, West Nile virus, and dengue and yellow fever.

Product Candidates in Development

The following table summarizes the product candidates for which we are engaged in development activities. Heat and Pelicans combined pipeline is focused on dual-acting immunotherapies that incorporate a T-cell antigen driven activator and a T-cell co-stimulator into a single treatment.

Clinical Pipeline 

HS-110 (viagenpumatucel-L)  Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) 

Using our licensed ImPACT® platform technology, we developed the product candidate, HS-110 (viagenpumatucel-L) as a potential treatment for patients with non-small cell lung cancer. HS-110 is our first biologic product candidate designed to stimulate a patients own T-cells to attack cancer. HS-110 is made of a cancer cell line that has been genetically modified using the ImPACT® technology platform and is designed to secrete a wide range of cancer-associated antigens related to lung cancer bound to gp96 proteins, thereby activating a broad, T-cell medicated immune response against a patients cancer.
We are currently conducting a Phase 2 trial of HS-110, in combination with nivolumab (Opdivo®), a Bristol-Myers Squibb anti-PD-1 checkpoint inhibitor, to treat patients with NSCLC. The multicenter clinical trial evaluates the safety and efficacy of HS-110 in combination with nivolumab in patients with advanced NSCLC whose cancers have progressed after one or more lines of therapy. Promising interim results for the first 15 patients enrolled suggest HS-110 plays an integral role in tumor reduction and may enhance efficacy of checkpoint inhibitors in lung cancer patients. Primary and secondary trial endpoints include safety and tolerability, immune response, objective response rate, duration of response, and progression-free and overall survival. The trial enrolled 15 patients into the Phase 1b portion, and initiated enrollment in the Phase 2 portion of the trial in March 2017. 

Preclinical Pipeline 

HS-130 

We have initiated the IND-enabling development of HS-130 for the treatment of NSCLC. This product will utilize our ComPACT technology, which is designed to intradermally deliver both cellularly secreted cancer associated antigens bound to a secretory version of the gp96 heat shock protein, as well as a T-cell co-stimulatory fusion protein (e.g. OX40L). We have begun manufacturing activities for this product candidate. 

PTX-35

Pelican is focused on the development of monoclonal antibody and fusion-protein based therapies designed to activate the immune system. Pelican is currently in preclinical studies for its lead compound PTX-35, a humanized affinity matured monoclonal antibody that is a functional agonist of human TNFRSF25. This antibody provides highly selective and potent stimulation of antigen specific memory CD8+ cytotoxic T-cells. These cells are instrumental in eliminating cancer cells. Prior to our acquisition of 80% of Pelican, Pelican had completed (1) humanization and affinity maturation of PTX-35; (2) PTX-35 epitope mapping or mapping of the binding site on the TNFRSF25 receptor that is recognized by PTX-35; and (3) stability/development studies of PTX-35. We have begun manufacturing activities for this product candidate. 

The preclinical studies with the murine precursor to PTX-35 show advantages over competing T-cell co-stimulator programs based on the specific expansion of CD8+ cancer specific T-cells.

PTX-15 

PTX-15 is a human TL1A-Ig fusion protein that acts as an agonist of TNFRSF25 with many of the advantages of PTX-35 described above and a shorter in vivo half-life. We have begun manufacturing activities for PTX-15.

Additional Indications

We continue to evaluate additional indications for the ImPACT® and ComPACT platform technologies, along with the PTX-35 and PTX-15 compounds. Specifically, using ComPACT, we have developed cell lines for several other cancers with the first product candidate being a second-generation therapy for NSCLC (HS-130). Our decision to further pursue any product candidates, or any additional product candidates, will be based in part upon available funding and partnering opportunities. 

The success of our ImPACT® and ComPACT platform therapies will depend on the clinical and regulatory success of our product candidates and our ability to retain, on commercially reasonable terms, financial and managerial resources, which are currently limited. To date, we have not received final regulatory approval for any of our product candidates or derived any revenues from their sales. Moreover, there can be no assurance that we will ever receive regulatory approval for any of our product candidates or derive any revenues from their sales.

Recent Developments

On February 27, 2018, we presented interim results at the 2018 Keystone Symposia Conference, Immunological Memory: Innate, Adaptive and Beyond (XI1) from our Phase 2 study, investigating HS-110 in combination with Bristol-Myers Squibbs anti-PD-1 checkpoint inhibitor, nivolumab (Opdivo®), in patients with advanced NSCLC whose cancers have progressed after treatment with one or more lines of therapy.

Among the 35 patients in the Intent-to-Treat (ITT) population, 6 patients (17%) achieved a partial response and 14 patients (40%) achieved disease control.  Evaluable ITT patients (those who underwent at least one follow-up scan regardless of treatment duration) demonstrated overall response and disease control rates of 26% and 67%, respectively.  Overall responses appeared durable and long lasting. The survival data are still maturing, and median overall survival has not yet been reached. The combination of HS-110 and nivolumab was well tolerated, with no additional toxicities compared to what has been observed with single agent checkpoint inhibitors.

As predefined in the clinical protocol, patient subgroups were evaluated for levels of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) and for PD-L1 checkpoint protein expression on tumor cells.  Four of 9 cold tumor patients with low TIL levels (<10%) at baseline had partial responses. HS-110 also showed a durable effect in patients with low levels of PD-L1, with 3 of 9 patients responding. Both of these patient populations respond poorly to checkpoint inhibitors. 

2017 Developments

·
 On December 7, 2017, we received written responses from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”) following a granted Type C meeting regarding the planned registrational HS-110 clinical trial design for the treatment of NSCLC. The discussion focused on elements of proposed clinical trial designs, both single-arm and controlled, which the FDA agreed would be appropriate to support a registrational trial of HS-110. Clinical endpoints and post-marketing commitments were also discussed in the context of accelerated approval.

·
 On October 30, 2017, Pelican received the second tranche in the amount of $6.5 million of its $15.2 million CPRIT Grant award. The CPRIT award supports the pre-clinical development, manufacturing and clinical development of a 70-patient, Phase 1 clinical trial for PTX-35. 

·
 On September 27, 2017, we announced a manufacturing agreement with KBI Biopharma, Inc. a global biopharmaceutical contract development and manufacturing organization, for cGMP product of Pelican’s PTX-35 antibody and PTX-15 fusion protein. Under the agreement, KBI Biopharma will offer comprehensive development and manufacturing services, which is expected to offer advantages such as speed, productivity, stability and flexibility over traditional approaches to cell line development.

·
 On June 28, 2017, Pelican reported that it was on track to meet product development milestones and received the first tranche in the amount of approximately $1.8 million of its $15.2 million CPRIT Grant award.

·
 On May 1, 2017, we announced the completion of the acquisition of an 80 percent controlling interest in Pelican. 

·
 On March 21, 2017, we reported promising interim results for the Phase 1b portion of the trial evaluating HS-110 in combination with Bristol-Myers Squibb’s checkpoint inhibitor, nivolumab (Opdivo®), for the treatment of advanced NSCLC. 

ImPACT®/ComPACT Platform Technology Advantages

We seek to increase the percentage of patients responding to checkpoint inhibitors with a combination treatment that is designed to activate the immune defense mechanisms to seek out and kill cancer cells. ImPACT® and ComPACT, the TCAP therapies, have been shown to stimulate an immune response against the full antigenic repertoire of cancer cells, not just one or a handful of antigens. The technologies are designed to combine a broad antigen targeting of known CTAs and unknown tumor associated antigens, complexed with a potent immune adjuvant. The activated immune response generated by our TCAP therapies may be useful in treating a wide range of cancers and infectious diseases.

·
 TCAP therapies are administered with checkpoint inhibitors and other immuno-modulators with the goal of enhancing immune response through T-cell activation. Genetically engineered allogenic cells are injected into the patient to elicit an immune response against the patient’s own tumor. The treatment primes immune recognition and triggers the body to stimulate the adaptive, T-cell mediated immune system to seek and destroy the cancer cells.

·
 TCAP therapies are allogeneic, off-the-shelf therapies designed to activate the immune system to turn immunologically "cold" tumors "hot." With ImPACT®, therapies can be administered alongside checkpoint inhibitors and other immuno-modulators to increase effectiveness. Our ComPACT therapy combines T-cell activators and highly selective co-stimulators within a single treatment, simplifying combination immunotherapy, while providing superior immune activation and reduced treatment costs. 

·
 Our “off-the-shelf,” cancer-fighting therapies are designed to expand cancer reactive immune cells to recognize and kill cancer cells. They jump-start immune recognition of common, cancer associated neo-antigens that are re-expressed in the cancer upon malignant transformation. When used alongside checkpoint inhibitors, they have been shown to boost T-cell activity to more effectively target and destroy cancer cells.

·
 We don’t require invasive procedures or the isolation of patient tissues. We are not extracting anything from anyone. This eliminates the inconvenience and costs associated with securing, storing and transporting patient samples, while eliminating potential surgical risks.

·
 Our therapies do not require an additional adjuvant, or immune stimulant. Other immunotherapies may require the addition of an adjuvant to enhance effectiveness and reduce toxicity. Our product candidate incorporates gp96, itself a powerful biological adjuvant, ensuring that no additional immune adjuvants are necessary to generate an activated, T-cell mediated immune response.

·
 Custom manufacturing is not necessary. Our products are mass-produced and readily available for immediate patient use. Each patient receives the same treatment, offering logistical, manufacturing and other cost benefits, compared to patient-specific or “personalized” medicine approaches.

PTX-35/PTX-15 Advantages

·
 Pelican provides access to two T-cell co-stimulators that further broadens our pipeline and strengthens our portfolio within the emerging T-cell co-stimulation space. We believe the use of these therapeutic agents, in combination with other immunotherapies, have the potential to be synergistic with our TCAP and dramatically improve patient outcomes.

·
 Pelican is the only company with a disclosed preclinical pipeline targeting the T-cell co-stimulator, TNFRSF25. We believe PTX-35 can activate antigen-specific memory CD8+ cytotoxic T-cells and eliminate tumor cells in patients. This approach is designed to harness the body's natural antigen specific immune activation and tolerance mechanisms to reprogram immunity, and provide a long-term, durable therapeutic effect. When combined with immunotherapies, including the ImPACT® and ComPACT platform technologies, PTX-35 enhances antigen specific T-cell activation to eliminate tumor cells. 

·
 Preclinical studies with the murine precursor to PTX-35 show advantages over competing T-cell co-stimulator programs based on CD8+ T-cell specificity.

·
 PTX-15 is a human TL1A-Ig fusion protein that acts as an agonist of TNFRSF25 with many of the advantages of PTX-35 described above and a shorter in vivo half-life.

Strategy

Our objective is to become a leading biopharmaceutical company specializing in the development and commercialization of allogeneic, off-the-shelf immunotherapies. ImPACT® and ComPACT are designed to address two synergistic mechanisms of action: robust activation of cancer-specific killer T-cells and T-cell co-stimulation to further enhance patients' immune activity and immune memory. Pelicans lead compound, PTX-35, is a humanized affinity matured TNFRSF25 agonist antibody, and potential best-in-class T-cell co-stimulator due to its preferential antigen specific memory CD8+ T-cells that are considered most potent in eliminating cancer cells. Preclinical studies with PTX-35 show advantages over competing T-cell co-stimulator programs. In addition, Pelican is the only company with a disclosed program targeting TNFRSF25 for use in immuno-oncology, with a broad, pioneering intellectual property estate. 

We believe future cancer immunotherapies will involve multiple agents and our platforms could work synergistically with other therapies, such as checkpoint inhibitors, which are designed to reverse tumor-induced immune suppression. We are focused on discovering, developing, and applying the ImPACT® and ComPACT platform technologies; and our PTX-35/PTX-15 compounds in combination with other immunotherapies towards a number of disease indications. The key elements of our strategy are:

·
 Develop and obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates. We are currently enrolling patients in the Phase 2 portion of the HS-110 trial in combination with nivolumab (Opdivo®), a Bristol-Myers Squibb anti-PD-1 checkpoint inhibitor to treat patients with advanced NSCLC. Beyond NSCLC – depending upon funding and partnering opportunities – we plan to expand the current clinical trial in additional patient populations and initiate new clinical trials with added immune modulators.

·
 Maximize commercial opportunity for the ImPACT® and ComPACT technology, as well as our PTX-35 and PTX-15 compounds. Our current product candidates target large markets with significant unmet medical needs. For each of our product candidates, we seek to retain all manufacturing, marketing and distribution rights, which should give us the ability to maximize the economic potential of any future U.S. or international commercialization efforts. 

·
 Enhance our partnering efforts. We are continually exploring partnerships for licensing and other collaborative relationships for Heat and Pelican, and remain opportunistic in seeking strategic partnerships.

·
 Further expand our broad patent portfolio. We have made a significant investment in the development of our patent portfolio to protect our technologies and programs, and we intend to continue to do so. We have obtained exclusive rights to six different patent families directed to therapeutic compositions and methods related to our platform and preclinical development programs for cancer, and have filed certain additional patent applications that are owned by us. The ImPACT®/ComPACT patent portfolio comprise more than 13 issued patents and 20 pending patent applications. These patents and applications cover the United States, Europe, and Japan, as well as several other countries having commercially significant markets. In total, Pelican holds approximately 34 granted U.S. and foreign patents, and approximately 16 U.S. and foreign patents pending. 

·
 Manage our business with efficiency and discipline. We believe we have efficiently utilized our capital and human resources to develop and acquire our product candidates and programs and create a broad intellectual property portfolio. We operate cross-functionally and are led by an experienced management team with backgrounds in developing and commercializing product candidates. We use project management techniques to assist us in making disciplined strategic program decisions and to attempt to limit the risk profile of our product pipeline.

·
 Obtain additional non-dilutive grant funding in addition to Pelican’s $15.2 million CPRIT Grant. To more fully develop our technologies and compounds, and their application to a variety of human diseases, we plan to continue to seek and access external sources of grant funding on our own behalf and in conjunction with our academic and other partners to support the development of our pipeline programs. While we intend to work with our academic partners to secure additional grant funding, these partners have no obligation to work with us to secure such funding. We also intend to continue to evaluate opportunities and, as appropriate, acquire or license technologies that meet our business objectives.

The Oncology Market and Current Treatments

The American Cancer Society estimates that 1.7 million people in the United States will be diagnosed with cancer in 2018. The lifetime probability of being diagnosed with an invasive cancer is 39.7% for men and 37.6% for women. It is projected that 609,000 Americans will die from cancer in 2018.

Lung cancer is the second-most commonly diagnosed cancer in the U.S. An estimated 222,500 new cases of lung cancer were diagnosed in 2017, accounting for about 25% of all cancer diagnosis. Despite continuous advances made in the field of cancer research every year, there remains a significant unmet medical need, as the overall five-year relative survival rate for lung cancer patients is 15% for men and 21% for women. Only 16% of lung cancers are diagnosed at a localized stage, for which the five-year survival is 55%. The American Cancer Society estimates that one in four deaths in the United States is due to cancer.

Pelican Acquisition

On March 7, 2017, we entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement (the Purchase Agreement) with Pelican, a related party and certain stockholders of Pelican holding a majority of the outstanding shares (the Majority Pelican Stockholders) to purchase shares of the outstanding capital stock of Pelican (the Pelican Acquisition). The Purchase Agreement was conditioned upon the holders of at least 80% of the outstanding capital stock of Pelican on a fully diluted basis participating in the Pelican Acquisition. On April 28, 2017, we closed the Pelican Acquisition (the Closing) and additional Pelican stockholders executed Joinders to the Purchase Agreement (the Additional Participating Pelican Stockholders, together with the Initial Participating Pelican Stockholders, collectively, the Participating Pelican Stockholders). The Participating Pelican Stockholders included Jeff Wolf, our Chief Executive Officer and a director, John Monahan and Edward Smith, two of our directors, the Chairman of our Scientific Advisory Committee at the time of the Closing and/or entities controlled by them. Each Participating Pelican Stockholder exchanged approximately 84.7% of the shares of Pelican common stock held by such Participating Pelican Stockholder in exchange for a pro rata share of (i) an aggregate of 133,106 shares, adjusted for the one-for-ten reverse stock split effective January 19, 2018 (the Stock Consideration) of our restricted common stock, and (ii) aggregate cash consideration of $0.5 million (the Cash Consideration), all of which was held in escrow for a period of up to six (6) months to secure certain indemnification and other obligations of Pelican and the Participating Pelican Stockholders in connection with the Pelican Acquisition and of which is currently being distributed to the Participating Pelican Stockholders.

In addition to the payments described above, under the terms of the Purchase Agreement, we agreed to cause Pelican to make cash payments to the Participating Pelican Stockholders upon the achievement of certain clinical and commercialization milestones set forth below, as well as low single digit royalty payments and payments upon receipt of sublicensing income, all as described in more detail in the Purchase Agreement: 

(1) 
 $2.0 million upon Pelicans dosing of the first patient in its first Phase 1 trial for an oncology indication; 
 (2) 
 $1.5 million upon Pelicans dosing of the first patient in its first Phase 2 trial for an oncology indication; 
 (3) 
 $3.0 million upon successful outcome of the first Phase 2 trial for an oncology indication;
 (4) 
 $6.0 million upon Pelicans dosing of the first patient in its first Phase 3 trial for an oncology indication; 
 (5) 
 $3.0 million upon Pelicans dosing of the first patient in its first Phase 3 trial for a non-oncology indication; 
 (6) 
 $7.5 million upon successful outcome of the first Phase 3 trial for an oncology indication;
 (7) 
 $3.0 million upon successful outcome of the first Phase 3 trial for a non-oncology indication;
 (8) 
 $7.5 million upon acceptance of a Biologics License Application (BLA) submission for an oncology indication;
 (9) 
 $3.0 million upon acceptance of a BLA submission for a non-oncology indication;
 (10)
 $7.5 million upon first product indication approval in the United States or Europe for an oncology indication; and
 (11)
 $3.0 million upon first product indication approval in the United States or Europe for a non- oncology indication. 

Pelican has been awarded a $15.2 million grant to fund preclinical and some clinical activities from CPRIT. The CPRIT Grant is subject to customary CPRIT funding conditions. We have provided Pelican approximately $1.2 million to satisfy Pelicans matching fund obligation under the first two years of the CPRIT Grant and Pelican has received approximately $8.3 million CPRIT Grant funding to date. 

In connection with the Pelican Acquisition, the Participating Pelican Stockholders enter into a Stockholders Agreement (the Stockholders Agreement) with us with respect to the Pelican common stock retained by the Participating Pelican Stockholders (the Retained Shares). The Stockholders Agreement, contains restrictions on transfer of the Retained Shares and drag-along rights in the event of a consolidation or merger of Pelican with another entity after the date of the Purchase Agreement or the sale of all or substantially all of Pelicans assets or a transaction in which at least fifty percent (50%) of the voting rights attached to the Pelican securities are sold. In addition, Participating Pelican Stockholders will have co-sale rights in connection with our transfer of the Pelican common stock that we own.

CPRIT Grant

In May 2016, Pelican was awarded a $15.2 million CPRIT Grant from CPRIT for development of Pelicans lead product candidate, PTX-25. The CPRIT Grant is expected to allow Pelican to develop PTX-25 through a 70-patient Phase 1 clinical trial. The Phase 1 clinical trial will be designed to evaluate PTX-25 in combination with other immunotherapies. The CPRIT Grant is subject to customary CPRIT funding conditions including a matching funds requirement where Pelican will match $0.50 for every $1.00 from CPRIT. Consequently, Pelican is required to raise $7.6 million in matching funds over the three year project. 

As of December 31, 2017, we have provided approximately $1.2 million in matching funding and we have $6.4 million remaining to provide over the three-year project, with $2.9 million remaining for the second CPRIT fiscal year (June 2017 through May 2018) of the award, and $3.5 million for the third CPRIT fiscal year (June 2018 through May 2019).

As of December 31, 2017, CPRIT has provided $8.3 million of the total $15.2 million grant. The remaining $6.9 million will become available in the third CPRIT fiscal year (June 2018 through May 2019).

The CPRIT Grant, as is customary for all CPRIT awards, contains a requirement that Pelican pay CPRIT a royalty on sales of commercial products developed using CPRIT funds equal to between three and five percent of revenue until such time as CPRIT has been paid an aggregate amount equal to 400% of the grant award proceeds. After 400% of the grant award proceeds has been paid, Pelican will pay CPRIT a royalty of 0.5% in perpetuity.

Intellectual Property 

Our goal is to obtain, maintain and enforce patent protection for our products, formulations, processes, methods and other proprietary technologies; preserve our trade secrets and exclusive rights in our unique biological materials; and operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of other parties, both in the United States and in other countries. Our policy is to actively seek to obtain, where appropriate, the strongest intellectual property protection possible for our current product candidates (ImPACT® and ComPACT therapy), as well as Pelicans product candidates and any future product candidates, proprietary information and proprietary technology through a combination of contractual arrangements and patents, both in the United States and abroad. However, even patent protection may not always afford us with complete protection against competitors who seek to circumvent our patents. See Risk Factors  Risks Relating to Our Business  We have limited protection for our intellectual property, which could impact our competitive position.

We will continue to depend upon the skills, knowledge and experience of our scientific and technical personnel, as well as that of our advisors, consultants and other contractors, none of which is patentable. To help protect our proprietary know-how, which is not patentable, and for inventions for which patents may be difficult to enforce, we currently rely and will in the future rely on trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements to protect our interests. To this end, we require all of our employees, consultants, advisors and other contractors to enter into confidentiality agreements that prohibit the disclosure of confidential information and, where applicable, require disclosure and assignment to us of the ideas, developments, discoveries and inventions important to our business.

The Heat and Pelican programs are supported by growing patent estates that are comprised of intellectual property owned by Heat or Pelican, or exclusively licensed from the University of Miami. ImPACT®, PTX-15, and PTX-35 are protected by issued patents and various pending patent applications while ComPACT is protected by pending patent applications. In total, Heat holds approximately 13 granted U.S. and foreign patents and approximately 20 U.S. and foreign patents pending. In total, Pelican holds approximately 34 granted U.S. and foreign patents and approximately 16 U.S. and foreign patents pending.

Heats foundational ImPACT® patent coverage is from the Modified Heat Shock Proteins-Antigenic Peptide Complex patent family, which is exclusively licensed from the University of Miami (the University), and granted as US Patent No. 8,685,384. This patent expires in 2019, not including any patent term adjustments or extensions. Further ImPACT® coverage is found in:

Patents are granted or pending in the U.S. and various foreign jurisdictions (such as Europe, Japan, China, Canada, Australia, Mexico, Korea, Israel, Singapore, and Hong Kong). US Patent No. 9,603,925, with term to 2034 (not including any patent term adjustments or extensions), covers PTX-15 compositions in combination with additional therapies. US Patent No. 9,499,627, with term to 2030 (not including any patent term adjustments or extensions), covers PTX-15 uses in therapies to delay transplant rejections. US Patent No. 9,839,670, with term to 2026 (not including any patent term adjustments or extensions), covers PTX-35 compositions in combination with a tumor antigen. Recent patent applications assigned to Pelican are intended to provide further compositional coverage for PTX-35.

License Agreements

The Modified Heat Shock Proteins-Antigenic Peptide Complex patent family is licensed pursuant to the terms of an exclusive license agreement that was entered into by Heat in July 2008 and subsequently assigned to our subsidiary Heat Biologics I, Inc. which issued to the University shares of its common stock representing seven and one-half percent (7.5%) of its common stock. The term of the license is the length of the last to expire patent, unless terminated earlier. The license agreement grants Heat Biologics I, Inc. exclusive, worldwide rights to make, use or sell licensed materials based upon the patent-related rights. As consideration for the rights granted in the license agreement, Heat Biologics I, Inc. was obligated to pay the University an upfront license fee of $150,000, additional yearly payments initially of $10,000 that increased to $20,000 in 2013 and a milestone payment of $500,000 upon approval of a BLA for the lung cancer vaccine covered by the patents rights being licensed. 

The Allogeneic Cancer-Based Immunotherapy patent family is licensed to Heat Biologics 1, Inc. pursuant to the terms of an exclusive license agreement that was entered into with the University in February 2011 and the Heat Shock Protein GP96 Vaccination and Methods of Using Same patent family is licensed to Heat Biologics 1, Inc. pursuant to the terms of an exclusive license agreement that was also entered into with the University in February 2011. No upfront, annual or milestone payments are required to be paid to the University under either of these license agreements. The license agreements grant Heat Biologics I, Inc. exclusive, worldwide rights to make, use or sell licensed materials based upon the patent-related rights. 

As consideration for the rights granted in each of these three license agreements, Heat Biologics I, Inc. is obligated to pay royalties equal to a percentage (in the low-to-mid single digits) of net sales of products covered by the patent-related rights in the respective license agreements. These royalty rates are subject to reduction if additional license rights from third parties are required to commercialize licensed products. In the event of a sublicense to a third party, Heat Biologics I, Inc. is obligated to pay royalties to the University equal to a percentage of sublicense income. Each of these additional license agreements also provides that the licensee will not have to pay more than the above-noted royalty rates and sublicense fees if more than one license from the University is required to sell products covered by the licensed patent-related rights. 

All of the above-described license agreements provide that the licensor has the right to terminate a subject license if the licensee: (1) has not introduced, or at least used its best efforts to introduce, a licensed product in the commercial marketplace in the United States, European Union, or Japan by December 31, 2020; (2) has not otherwise exercised diligence to bring licensed products to market; or (3) files, or has filed against it, a proceeding under the Bankruptcy Act, is adjudged insolvent, makes an assignment for the benefit of its creditors, or has an unreleased or unsatisfied writ of attachment or execution levied upon it. Upon an uncured material breach of an obligation under any one of the above license agreements by a party, the other party has the right to terminate that agreement upon 90 days notice or 30 days notice if the breach relates to payments due to the University. In the event of a termination, Heat Biologics I, Inc. will be obligated to pay all amounts that accrued prior to such termination. Each of the above license agreements also contains other customary clauses and terms as are common in similar agreements between industry and academia, including the licensees agreement to indemnify the University for liabilities arising out of the negligence of the licensee, making the license grant subject to the Bayh-Dole act (35 U.S.C. 200 et seq.), the reservation of the licensor of the right to use the licensed intellectual property rights for its internal, non-commercial purposes, limitations/disclaimers of various warranties and representations, reporting and record-keeping requirements, and licensee liability insurance requirements.

In July 2011, we exercised an option agreement with the University of Michigan (U.Mich) and entered into a license agreement with U.Mich pursuant to which we are U.Michs exclusive licensee and have the right to use, market, offer for sale, sell and/or sublicense materials and processes related to certain cancer cell lines. The term of the license is perpetual, unless terminated earlier by us or by U.Mich where U.Mich can only terminate for our material breach of this agreement. As consideration for the rights granted in the license agreement, we agreed to pay U.Mich up-front license fees and additional yearly and milestone payments. We also assumed under the license agreement responsibility for any infringement of third party rights caused by our use of the licensed materials. We paid an option fee of $2,000, a license issue fee of $10,000 and are obligated to pay an annual maintenance fee of $10,000 each year until the first commercial sale of a licensed product at which time the annual maintenance fee increases to $50,000. In addition, we are obligated to make milestone payments of $25,000, $50,000 and $75,000 upon completion of a Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 trial using a licensed product and $250,000 upon the first commercial sale of a licensed product and $350,000 upon annual net sales of $100,000,000 or more. The license agreement provides that the licensor has the right to terminate the license should we cease to carry on our business, fail to make a required payment or otherwise materially breach or default in our obligations under the license agreement following the giving of notice and an opportunity to cure any such breach. The license agreement provides that if we do not achieve the following milestones within the required period, U.Mich has the right to terminate the license agreement: completion of a Phase 1 clinical trial on or before January 1, 2015, a Phase 2 clinical trial on or before January 1, 2017, a Phase 3 clinical trial on or before January 1, 2019 and the first commercial sale of a product that includes the materials supplied by U.Mich on or before January 1, 2020. The license agreement also contains other customary clauses and terms as are common in similar agreements between industry and academia.

In October 2016, our wholly-owned subsidiary, Zolovax, Inc., entered into an agreement with the University for the license and development of a portfolio of patents leveraging its gp96 platform to target the Zika virus and other infectious diseases. The preclinical studies using the licensed technology have been initiated and are progressing. The term of the license is the length of the last to expire patent, unless terminated earlier. The license agreement grants Zolovax, Inc. exclusive, worldwide rights to make, use or sell licensed materials based upon the patent-related rights. As consideration for the rights granted in this license agreement, the licensee paid an upfront fee, is obligated to pay annual payments commencing on the third anniversary of the license agreement and royalties equal to a percentage (in the low-to-mid single digits) of net sales of products covered by the patent-related rights in the respective license agreements. These royalty rates are subject to reduction if additional license rights from third parties are required to commercialize licensed products. In the event of a sublicense to a third party, Zolovax, Inc. is obligated to pay royalties to the University equal to a percentage of sublicense income. The license agreement provides for diligence milestones payments of up to an aggregate of $1,450,000 that include pre-IND meeting with the FDA, IND submission to the FDA and dosing first patient in a Phase 1 clinical trial. The license agreement also provides that the licensee will not have to pay more than the above-noted royalty rates if more than one license from the University is required to sell products covered by the licensed patent-related rights. The license agreement provides that the licensor has the right to terminate a subject license if the licensee has engaged in certain bankruptcy events or has breached the terms of the license agreement which includes having (i) failed to make a required payment; (ii) failed to achieve a milestone or not otherwise exercised diligence to bring licensed products to market; (iii) failed to possess insurance coverage, or (iv) filed a false report. Upon an uncured material breach of an obligation that remains uncured for 30 days after notice thereof , the other party has the right to terminate that agreement.

In June 2016, we entered into an exclusive license agreement with Shattuck Labs, Inc. (Shattuck) pursuant to which we licensed to Shattuck certain provisional patent applications and know-how related to fusion proteins to treat cancer and other diseases that were not being developed by us. Shattuck paid us an initial license fee of $50,000 and is obligated to pay us fees upon its receipt of sublicensing income, achievement of certain milestones and royalties upon sales of commercial products. Inasmuch as the technology that we out-licensed is in the early stages of development and there is a low likelihood of success for any technology at such stage, there can be no assurance that any products will be developed by Shattuck or that we will derive any revenue from Shattuck. 

Pelican License Agreements 

Under license agreements with the University, Pelican has obtained exclusive rights to five different patent families each directed to therapeutic compositions and methods related to targeting TNFRSF25/TL1A for the purpose of modulating immune responses. These families comprise approximately 34 granted U.S. and foreign patents, and approximately 16 U.S. and foreign patent applications. These patents and applications cover the United States, Europe and Japan as well as several other countries having commercially significant markets. As partial consideration for the initial two license agreements with the University, Pelican issued the University 300,000 shares of its common stock.

As consideration for the rights granted under the initial license agreement, Pelican is obligated to pay the University certain upfront license fees, aggregate milestone payments of $400,000 ((i) upon submission of an IND, (ii) approval of an IND, (iii) completion of a Phase 1 clinical trial and (iv) the earlier of May 2022 or approval of a NDA), an annual minimum royalty payment $20,000 and royalties (mid-range single digits) based on net sales on commercialized products covered by the patent-related rights set forth above. As consideration for the rights granted under the second license agreement, Pelican is obligated to pay the University certain upfront license fees, aggregate milestone payments of $650,000 ((i)upon submission of an NDA, (ii) approval of a NDA; (iii) completion of Phase 1 clinical trial and (iv) the earlier of May 2022 or approval of an NDA), an annual minimum royalty payment $20,000 and royalties (mid-range single digits) based on net sales on commercialized products covered by the patent-related rights set forth above. As consideration for the rights granted in the third license agreement, Pelican is obligated to pay the University certain upfront license fees, past and future patent costs, an annual minimum royalty payment $20,000 and royalties (mid-range single digits) based on net sales on commercialized products covered by the patent-related rights set forth above. The third license agreement with the University provides that in the event that Pelican terminates its second license agreement with the University, Pelican is obligated to pay the University an annual minimum royalty payment of $20,000 for each year after 2014 during the term of the third license agreement as well as milestone payments that aggregate $400,000 upon achievement of the following milestones: (i) submission of an IND; (ii) approval of a NDA; (iii) completion of a Phase 1 clinical trial; and (iv) the earlier of May 31, 2022 or approval of a NDA. The royalty rates are subject to reduction if additional license rights from third parties are required to commercialize licensed products. In the event of a sublicense to a third party, Pelican is obligated to pay royalties to the University equal to a percentage of sublicense income. The third license agreement also provides that Pelican will not have to pay more than above royalty rates and sublicense fees if more than one license from the University is required to sell products covered by the licensed patent-related rights. 

All of the above-described Pelican license agreements provide that the licensor has the right to terminate a subject license if the licensee (1) has not introduced, or at least used its best efforts to introduce, a licensed product in the commercial marketplace in the United States, European Union, or Japan by December 31, 2022 (December 2020 for the November 2013 license agreement); (2) has not otherwise exercised diligence to bring licensed products to market; or (3) files, or has filed against it, a proceeding under the Bankruptcy Act, is adjudged insolvent, makes an assignment for the benefit of its creditors, or has an unreleased or unsatisfied writ of attachment or execution levied upon it. Upon an uncured material breach of an obligation under any one of the above license agreements by a party, the other party has the right to terminate that agreement upon 90 days notice or 30 days notice if the breach relates to payments due to the University. In the event of a termination, Pelican will be obligated to pay all amounts that accrued prior to such termination. Each of the above license agreements also contains other customary clauses and terms as are common in similar agreements between industry and academia, including the licensees agreement to indemnify the University for liabilities arising out of the negligence of the licensee, making the license grant subject to the Bayh-Dole act (35 U.S.C. 200 et seq.), the reservation of the licensor of the right to use the licensed intellectual property rights for its internal, non-commercial purposes, limitations/disclaimers of various warranties and representations, reporting and record-keeping requirements, and licensee liability insurance requirements.

Manufacturing

We rely on third-party manufacturers to produce and store our product candidates for clinical use and currently do not own or operate manufacturing facilities. 

We have retained Lonza, Inc. a vendor, which has begun manufacturing of HS-110 to be used in our Phase 2 and potential Phase 3 clinical trials. We entered into an eight-year Manufacturing Services Agreement, dated October 20, 2011, with the vendor (the Manufacturing Agreement). The Manufacturing Agreement provides that the vendor will manufacture products based on our ImPACT® technology intended for use in pharmaceutical or medicinal end products, including, without limitation, products in a final packaged form and labeled for use in clinical trials or for commercial sale to end users in accordance with the terms and conditions of individual statements of work. The Manufacturing Agreement requires that we purchase a certain minimum percentage of our annual global product requirements from the vendor. The Manufacturing Agreement may be terminated by the parties upon mutual agreement, and by each party for a material breach by the other party that is not cured within the cure period, upon notice that a clinical trial for which product is being produced under the agreement is suspended or terminated or upon the other partys insolvency, dissolution or liquidation.

The HS-110 product used in the inventors Phase 1, and in our Phase 2 clinical trial continues to be manufactured under cGMP (current good manufacturing practices). The vaccine cell line is grown in large quantities, dispensed into individual doses, frozen in liquid nitrogen, irradiated to render cell replication incompetent and quality tested in compliance with FDA guidelines. The vaccine is irradiated, which is a commonly used attenuation process that eliminates the ability of the gp96-Ig-containing vaccine cell lines to replicate but allows them to remain metabolically active and secrete gp96-Ig. The batches of frozen, irradiated vaccine are stable for long periods of time, and are thawed immediately prior to administration to patients. Sufficient material to dose a subset of patients in the HS-110 clinical studies has already been produced, and preparations are underway to produce quantities required for trial completion and subsequent clinical trials.

Heat has also begun development of an additional product, HS-130, for treatment of NSCLC. This product will utilize our ComPACT technology, which is designed to deliver the gp96 heat shock protein and a T-cell co-stimulatory fusion protein (OX40L). We have begun the cGMP manufacturing and nonclinical IND enabling activities to support the clinical development of this product. 

Pelican is focused on the development of monoclonal antibody and fusion-protein based therapies designed to activate specific T-cell subsets of the immune system. We retained KBI Biopharma, a vendor, for development of two products; PTX-35 and PTX-15. PTX-35 is a humanized affinity matured monoclonal antibody that is a functional agonist of human TNFRSF25. This antibody provides highly selective and potent stimulation of memory CD8+ cytotoxic T-cells. This is a class of T-cell that is responsible for eliminating tumor cells in patients. PTX-15 is a human TL1A-Ig fusion protein with many of the same functional qualities of PTX-35 but a shorter in vivo half-life. Pelican has begun the nonclinical IND enabling activities to support the clinical development of these products. 

Competition

The pharmaceutical industry and biologics industry are each highly competitive and characterized by a number of established large companies, and mid-sized companies, as well as smaller companies like ours. If our competitors market products that are less expensive, safer or more effective than any future products developed from our product candidates, or that reach the market before our approved product candidates, we may not achieve commercial success. Technological developments in our field of research and development occur at a rapid rate and we expect competition to intensify as advances in this field are made. We will be required to continue to devote substantial resources and efforts to our research and development activities. As a biotechnology company with cancer immunotherapy agents as lead product candidates, we compete with a broad range of companies. At the highest level, cancer immunotherapy can be seen as both a complement and a potential competitor to any oncology therapy, most notably chemotherapy, radiotherapy, biologics and small molecule drugs. Not only do we compete with companies engaged in various cancer treatments including radiotherapy and chemotherapy but we also compete with various companies that have developed or are trying to develop immunology vaccines for the treatment of cancer. Certain of our competitors have substantially greater capital resources, large customer bases, broader product lines, sales forces, greater marketing and management resources, larger research and development staffs with extensive facilities and equipment than we do and have more established reputations as well as global distribution channels. Our most significant competitors, among others, are fully integrated pharmaceutical companies such as Eli Lilly and Company, Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, Merck & Co., Inc., Novartis AG, MedImmune, LLC (a wholly owned subsidiary of AstraZeneca plc), Johnson & Johnson, Pfizer Inc., MerckKGaA and Sanofi SA, and more established biotechnology companies such as Genentech, Inc. (a member of the Roche Group), Amgen Inc., Celgene Corporation, Gilead Sciences, Inc. and its subsidiary Kite Pharma, Inc., and competing cancer immunotherapy companies such as, Juno Therapeutics, Inc., Bluebird Bio, Inc., Transgene SA, Valeant Pharmaceuticals International, Inc., NewLink Genetics Corporation, Agenus Inc., NovaRx Corporation, Aduro Biotech, Inc., Advaxis, Inc., ImmunoCellular Therapeutics, Ltd., Immunovaccine Inc., Oxford BioMedica plc, Bavarian Nordic A/S, Celldex Therapeutics, Inc., Telesta Therapeutics Inc. and others, some of which have substantially greater financial, technical, sales, marketing, and human resources than we do. These companies might succeed in obtaining regulatory approval for competitive products more rapidly than we can for our products. In addition, competitors might develop technologies and products that are less expensive, safer or more effective than those being developed by us or that would render our technology obsolete. In addition, the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry is characterized by rapid technological change. Because our research approach integrates many technologies, it may be difficult for us to remain current with the rapid changes in each technology. If we fail to stay at the forefront of technological change, we may be unable to compete effectively. Our competitors may render our technologies obsolete by advancing their existing technological approaches or developing new or different approaches.

We expect to compete with other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, and our competitors may:

·
 develop and market products that are less expensive, more effective or safer than our future products;

·
 commercialize competing products before we can launch any products developed from our product candidates;

·
 operate larger research and development programs, possess greater manufacturing capabilities or have substantially greater financial resources than we do;

·
 initiate or withstand substantial price competition more successfully than we can;

·
 have greater success in recruiting skilled technical and scientific workers from the limited pool of available talent;


12


·
 more effectively negotiate third-party licenses and strategic relationships; and

·
 take advantage of acquisition or other opportunities more readily than we can.
 
We expect to compete for market share against large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, smaller companies that are collaborating with larger pharmaceutical companies, new companies, academic institutions, government agencies and other public and private research organizations.

The primary treatments for non-small cell lung cancer are surgery, radiation, chemotherapy, checkpoint inhibitors, and various combinations of each of these treatments. A large number of patients, particularly with advanced disease, are refractory to these treatments and are subsequently treated with a number of emerging biologic agents, including immunotherapy. Some examples of therapies commonly attempted with stage IIIB/IV NSCLC patients include: Opdivo® (nivolumab), Keytruda® (pembrolizumab), Alimta® (pemetrexed), Avastin® (bevacizumab), Tarceva® (erlotinib), Gemzar® (gemcitabine), Paraplatin® (carboplatin), Taxol® (paclitaxel), Taxotere® (docetaxel), and Navelbine® (vinorelbine). It is unlikely that biologic agents will compete with more traditional therapies in the short-term, but many oncologists believe that such therapies will eventually become the mainstay of lung cancer therapy. None of these agents have proven particularly effective for stage IIIB/IV NSCLC patients, with the most effective therapies only increasing survival by a few months. As a result, we do not consider these agents to be direct competitors to HS-110 because they are likely to be given either in sequence or in conjunction with some of the agents listed. Furthermore, many patients cannot tolerate many of the chemotherapeutics listed. Thus, we believe if HS-110 has a positive safety profile (without observation of local or systemic toxicities, none of which have been seen to date), it is likely that HS-110 would be preferred both by physicians and patients in this stage of disease.

Our strategy is to emphasize what we believe to be our competitive advantages, which our products in development are expected to have less side effects than most other cancer therapies, be available at lower prices than other therapies, and ultimately could work on many types of cancer and not just one specific type.

Government Regulation
 
FDA Approval Process

In the United States, pharmaceutical products are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, (the FDC Act), and other federal and state statutes and regulations, govern, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, storage, recordkeeping, approval, labeling, promotion and marketing, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, sampling, and import and export of pharmaceutical products. Biological products used for the prevention, treatment, or cure of a disease or condition of a human being are subject to regulation under the FDC Act, except the section of the FDC Act which governs the approval of new drug applications, or NDAs. Biological products are approved for marketing under provisions of the Public Health Service Act, or PHSA, via a Biologics License Application, or BLA. However, the application process and requirements for approval of BLAs are very similar to those for NDAs, and biologics are associated with similar approval risks and costs as drugs. Failure to comply with applicable U.S. requirements may subject a company to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as FDA refusal to approve pending NDAs or BLAs, warning or untitled letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, civil penalties, and criminal prosecution.

Pharmaceutical product development for a new product or certain changes to an approved product in the United States typically involves preclinical laboratory and animal tests, the submission to the FDA of an investigational new drug application, or IND, which must become effective before clinical testing may commence, and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to establish the safety and effectiveness of the drug for each indication for which FDA approval is sought. Satisfaction of FDA pre-market approval requirements typically takes many years and the actual time required may vary substantially based upon the type, complexity, and novelty of the product or disease.

Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, formulation, and toxicity, as well as animal trials to assess the characteristics and potential safety and efficacy of the product. The conduct of the preclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements, including good laboratory practices. The results of preclinical testing are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND along with other information, including information about product chemistry, manufacturing and controls, and a proposed clinical trial protocol. Long term preclinical tests, such as animal tests of reproductive toxicity and carcinogenicity, may continue after the IND is submitted.


13


A 30-day waiting period after the submission of each IND is required prior to the commencement of clinical testing in humans. If the FDA has neither commented on nor questioned the IND within this 30-day period, the clinical trial proposed in the IND may begin.

Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational new drug or biologic to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of a qualified investigator. Clinical trials must be conducted: (1) in compliance with federal regulations; (2) in compliance with good clinical practice, or GCP, an international standard meant to protect the rights and health of patients and to define the roles of clinical trial sponsors, administrators, and monitors; as well as (3) under protocols detailing the objectives of the trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety, and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. Each protocol involving testing on U.S. patients and subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND.

The FDA may order the temporary or permanent discontinuation of a clinical trial at any time, or impose other sanctions, if it believes that the clinical trial either is not being conducted in accordance with FDA requirements or presents an unacceptable risk to the clinical trial patients. The study protocol and informed consent information for patients in clinical trials must also be submitted to an institutional review board, or IRB, for approval. An IRB may also require the clinical trial at the site to be halted, either temporarily or permanently, for failure to comply with the IRBs requirements, or may impose other conditions.

Clinical trials to support NDAs or BLAs for marketing approval are typically conducted in three sequential phases, but the phases may overlap. In Phase 1, the initial introduction of the drug or biologic into healthy human subjects or patients, the product is tested to assess metabolism, pharmacokinetics, pharmacological actions, side effects associated with increasing doses, and, if possible, early evidence on effectiveness. Phase 2 usually involves trials in a limited patient population to evaluate the effectiveness of the drug or biologic for a particular indication, dosage tolerance, and optimum dosage, and to identify common adverse effects and safety risks. If a compound demonstrates evidence of effectiveness and an acceptable safety profile in Phase 2 evaluations, Phase 3 trials are undertaken to obtain the additional information about clinical efficacy and safety in a larger number of patients, typically at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, to permit the FDA to evaluate the overall benefit-risk relationship of the drug or biologic and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the product. In most cases, the FDA requires two adequate and well-controlled Phase 3 clinical trials to demonstrate the efficacy of the drug or biologic. A single Phase 3 trial with other confirmatory evidence may be sufficient in rare instances where the study is a large multicenter trial demonstrating internal consistency and a statistically very persuasive finding of a clinically meaningful effect on mortality, irreversible morbidity or prevention of a disease with a potentially serious outcome and confirmation of the result in a second trial would be practically or ethically impossible.

After completion of the required clinical testing, an NDA or BLA is prepared and submitted to the FDA. FDA approval of the NDA or BLA is required before marketing of the product may begin in the United States. The NDA or BLA must include the results of all preclinical, clinical, and other testing and a compilation of data relating to the products pharmacology, chemistry, manufacture, and controls. The cost of preparing and submitting an NDA or BLA is substantial. The submission of most NDAs and BLAs is additionally subject to a substantial application user fee, currently exceeding $2,421,459, and the manufacturer and/or sponsor under an approved new drug application are also subject to an annual program fee which is currently set at $304,162. These fees are typically increased annually.

The FDA undertakes to perform an initial filing review within 60 days from its receipt of an NDA or BLA to determine whether the application will be accepted for filing based on the agencys threshold determination that it is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review. The FDA has agreed to certain performance goals in the review of NDAs and BLAs. Most such applications for standard review drug or biologic products are reviewed within ten to 12 months; most applications for priority review drugs or biologics are reviewed in six to eight months. The FDA can extend these reviews by three months. Priority review can be applied to drugs that the FDA determines offer major advances in treatment, or provide a treatment where no adequate therapy exists. For biologics, priority review is further limited only for products intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease relative to the currently approved products. The review process for both standard and priority review may be extended by the FDA for three additional months to consider certain late-submitted information, or information intended to clarify information already provided in the submission.


14


The FDA may also refer applications for novel drug or biologic products, or drug or biologic products that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy, to an advisory committee  typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts  for review, evaluation, and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it generally follows such recommendations. Before approving an NDA or BLA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP. Additionally, the FDA will inspect the facility or the facilities at which the drug is manufactured. FDA will not approve the product unless compliance with current good manufacturing practice, or cGMP, is satisfactory and the NDA or BLA contains data that provide substantial evidence that the drug or biologic is safe and effective in the indication studied.

After the FDA evaluates the NDA or BLA and the manufacturing facilities, it issues either an approval letter or a complete response letter. A complete response letter generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing, or information, in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. If, or when, those deficiencies have been addressed to the FDAs satisfaction in a resubmission of the NDA or BLA, the FDA will issue an approval letter. The FDA has committed to reviewing such resubmissions in two or nine months depending on the type of information included.

An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug or biologic with specific prescribing information for specific indications. As a condition of NDA or BLA approval, the FDA may require a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or REMS, to help ensure that the benefits of the drug or biologic outweigh the potential risks. REMS can include medication guides, communication plans for healthcare professionals, and elements to assure safe use, or ETASU. ETASU can include, but are not limited to, special training or certification for prescribing or dispensing, dispensing only under certain circumstances, special monitoring, and the use of patient registries. The requirement for a REMS can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the product. Moreover, product approval may require substantial post-approval testing and surveillance to monitor the products safety or efficacy. Once granted, product approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or problems are identified following initial marketing.

Changes to some of the conditions established in an approved application, including changes in indications, labeling, or manufacturing processes or facilities, require submission and FDA approval of a new NDA or BLA or NDA or BLA supplement before the change can be implemented. An NDA or BLA supplement for a new indication typically requires clinical data similar to that in the original application, and the FDA uses the same procedures and actions in reviewing NDA or BLA supplements as it does in reviewing NDAs or BLAs.

Post-Approval Requirements

Once an NDA or BLA is approved, a product will be subject to certain post-approval requirements. For instance, the FDA closely regulates the post-approval marketing and promotion of drugs and biologics, including standards and regulations for direct-to-consumer advertising, off-label promotion, industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities and promotional activities involving the internet. Drugs and biologics may be marketed only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved labeling.

Adverse event reporting and submission of periodic reports is required following FDA approval of an NDA or BLA. The FDA also may require post-marketing testing, known as Phase 4 testing, REMS, and surveillance to monitor the effects of an approved product, or the FDA may place conditions on an approval that could restrict the distribution or use of the product. In addition, quality control, drug manufacture, packaging, and labeling procedures must continue to conform to cGMPs after approval. Drug and biologic manufacturers and certain of their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies. Registration with the FDA subject entities to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA, during which the agency inspects manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with cGMPs. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the areas of production and quality-control to maintain compliance with cGMPs. Regulatory authorities may withdraw product approvals or request product recalls if a company fails to comply with regulatory standards, if it encounters problems following initial marketing, or if previously unrecognized problems are subsequently discovered.

Additional Controls for Biologics

To help reduce the increased risk of the introduction of adventitious agents, the PHSA emphasizes the importance of manufacturing controls for products whose attributes cannot be precisely defined. The PHSA also provides authority to the FDA to immediately suspend licenses in situations where there exists a danger to public health, to prepare or procure products in the event of shortages and critical public health needs, and to authorize the creation and enforcement of regulations to prevent the introduction or spread of communicable diseases in the United States and between states.


15


After a BLA is approved, the product may also be subject to official lot release as a condition of approval. As part of the manufacturing process, the manufacturer is required to perform certain tests on each lot of the product before it is released for distribution. If the product is subject to official release by the FDA, the manufacturer submits samples of each lot of product to the FDA together with a release protocol showing a summary of the history of manufacture of the lot and the results of all of the manufacturers tests performed on the lot. The FDA may also perform certain confirmatory tests on lots of some products, such as viral vaccines, before releasing the lots for distribution by the manufacturer. In addition, the FDA conducts laboratory research related to the regulatory standards on the safety, purity, potency, and effectiveness of biological products. As with drugs, after approval of biologics, manufacturers must address any safety issues that arise, are subject to recalls or a halt in manufacturing, and are subject to periodic inspection after approval.

Cell- and Tissue-Based Biologics

Establishments that manufacture cell and tissue-based products must comply with the FDAs current good tissue practices, or cGTP, which are FDA regulations that govern the methods used in, and the facilities and controls used for, the manufacture of such products. The primary intent of the cGTP requirements is to ensure that cell- and tissue-based products are manufactured in a manner designed to prevent the introduction, transmission and spread of communicable disease. FDA regulations also include requirements for a unified registration and listing system, donor screening and testing, adverse reaction reporting, and labeling. 

Cell- and tissue-based products may also be subject to the same approval standards, including demonstration of safety and efficacy, as other biologic and drug products if they meet certain criteria such as if the cells or tissues are more than minimally manipulated or if they are intended for a non-homologous use. Products manufactured using the ImPACT® technology meet this threshold and therefore are considered biological drugs. Manufacture of ImPACT® products are subject to both cGTP and cGMP regulations for manufacturing quality. Marketing of these products in the United States will require FDA approval under the BLA pathway as discussed above.

Non-U.S. Regulation

Before our products can be marketed outside of the United States, they are subject to regulatory approval of the respective authorities in the country in which the product should be marketed. The requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary widely from country to country. No action can be taken to market any product in a country until an appropriate application has been approved by the regulatory authorities in that country. The current approval process varies from country to country, and the time spent in gaining approval varies from that required for FDA approval. In certain countries, the sales price of a product must also be approved. The pricing review period often begins after market approval is granted. Even if a product is approved by a regulatory authority, satisfactory prices might not be approved for such product.
 
In Europe, marketing authorizations may be submitted at a centralized, a decentralized or national level; however, the centralized procedure is mandatory for the approval of biotechnology products and provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization that is valid in all European Union member states. There can be no assurance that the chosen regulatory strategy will secure regulatory approval on a timely basis or at all.

While we intend to market our products outside the United States in compliance with our respective license agreements, we have not made any applications with non-U.S. authorities and have no timeline for such applications or marketing.
 
Research and Development
 
We have built an internal and external research and development organization that includes expertise in discovery research, preclinical development, product formulation, analytical chemistry, manufacturing, clinical development and regulatory and quality assurance. Sponsors of clinical trials of FDA-regulated products, including drugs, are required to register and disclose certain clinical trial information. Our cancer trials have been registered on clinicaltrials.gov. Information related to the product, patient population, phase of investigation, study sites and investigators, and other aspects of the clinical trial is then made public as part of the registration. Sponsors are also obligated to discuss the results of their clinical trials after completion. Disclosure of the results of these trials can be delayed until the new product or new indication being studied has been approved. Competitors may use this publicly available information to gain knowledge regarding the progress of development. Research and development expenses were $8.3 million and $9.3 million during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.

Employees 

As of December 31, 2017, we had a total of 19 full-time employees. We believe our relationships with our employees are satisfactory. None of our employees is represented by a labor union. We anticipate that we will need to identify, attract, train and retain other highly skilled personnel to pursue our development program. Hiring for such personnel is competitive, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to retain our key employees or attract, assimilate or retain the qualified personnel necessary for the development of our business.
