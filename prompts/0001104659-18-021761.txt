Item 1. Business.
DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS
 
General Development of Business
 
Retractable Technologies, Inc. was incorporated in Texas in 1994.  Our business is the manufacturing and marketing of safety medical products (predominately syringes) for the healthcare industry.  We have manufacturing facilities in Little Elm, Texas and use manufacturers in China as well.  We have developed several new products in the last few years, including the EasyPoint® needle which can be used with, among other things, prefilled syringes.
 
In 2007, we filed a lawsuit claiming that we have been blocked from gaining market access due to actions taken by BD.  In August 2017, a district court dismissed our remaining claims against BD and entered a take nothing judgment.  We have filed for appeal.
 
Financial Information
 
We do not report in segments.  See Item 8 for our financial statements.
 
Principal Products, Markets, and Distribution
 
Our goal is to become a leading provider of safety medical products.  Our principal products were designed to protect healthcare workers and others from needlestick injuries, cross-contamination through reuse, and reduce disposal costs.  The VanishPoint® products accomplish these goals by retracting the needle when the plunger handle is fully depressed while the needle is still in the patient.  This pre-removal activation virtually eliminates exposure to the contaminated needle, reducing the risk of needlestick injuries.  Activation is easily accomplished in one step, using one hand.  Upon activation of the retraction mechanism, VanishPoint® products are rendered unusable, reducing the risk of disposal-related injuries or reuse.
 
VanishPoint® syringe sales have historically comprised most of our sales.  VanishPoint® syringe sales were 98.2%, 93.0% and 89.9% of our revenues in 2015, 2016, and 2017.
 
Our VanishPoint® safety products currently consist of tuberculin, insulin, and allergy antigen VanishPoint® syringes; 0.5mL, 1 mL, 2mL, 3mL, 5mL, and 10mL VanishPoint® syringes; and the VanishPoint® autodisable syringe.  We also sell the VanishPoint® IV catheter; the VanishPoint® blood collection tube holder; and the VanishPoint® blood collection set.  The Patient Safe® syringe protects patients by reducing the risk of bloodstream infections associated with catheter hub contamination.  Our Patient Safe® products currently consist of 3mL, 5mL, 10mL, 20mL, 30mL, 60mL syringes and the Patient Safe® Luer cap.

In the second quarter of 2016, we began selling the EasyPoint® needle.  EasyPoint® needles made up 6.0% of revenues in 2017.  The EasyPoint® is a retractable needle that can be used with Luer lock syringes, Luer slip syringes, and prefilled syringes to give injections.  The EasyPoint® needle can also be used to aspirate fluids and collect blood.
 
We currently have under development additional safety products that add to or build upon our current product line offering.  These products include: retractable needles and syringes, glass syringes, dental syringes, IV catheter introducers, and blood collection sets.
 
Our products are sold to and used by healthcare providers primarily in the U.S. (with 21.7% of revenues in 2017 generated from sales outside the U.S.) which include, but are not limited to, acute care hospitals, alternate care facilities, doctors offices, clinics, emergency centers, surgical centers, long-term care facilities, Veterans Administration facilities, military organizations, public health facilities, and prisons.
 
Under the current supply chain system in the U.S. acute care market, the vast majority of decisions relating to the contracting for and purchasing of medical supplies are made by the representatives of group purchasing organizations (GPOs) and purchasing representatives rather than the end-users of the product (nurses, doctors, and testing personnel).  The GPOs and larger manufacturers often enter into contracts which can prohibit or limit entry in the marketplace by competitors.
 
We distribute our products throughout the U.S. through general line and specialty distributors.  We also use international distributors.  We have developed a national direct marketing network in order to market our products to health care customers and their purchaser representatives.  Our marketers make contact with all of the departments that affect the decision-making process for safety products, including the purchasing agents.  They call on acute care and alternate care sites and speak directly with the decision-makers of these facilities.  We employ trained sales representatives and clinicians, including nurses and/or medical technologists that educate healthcare providers and healthcare workers on the use of safety devices through on-site clinical training, exhibits at related tradeshows, and publications of relevant articles in trade journals and magazines.  These employees provide clinical support to customers.  In addition to marketing our products, the network demonstrates the safety and cost effectiveness of our products to customers.
 
The American Journal of Infection Control published an article in its November 2017 issue that estimates that more than 300,000 healthcare workers in the United States suffer sharps injuries (such as needlesticks) annually.  The article is the most recent of a series of articles published over the past few years (several of which were published in the AOHP Journal).  The data shows that the number of sharps injuries has remained essentially unchanged over the past several years.
 
Sources and Availability of Raw Materials
 
We own the printing plates used to print artwork on packaging and the molds used to manufacture the plastic components of our products in the U.S.  Other product components, including needle adhesives and packaging materials, are purchased from various suppliers.  There are a variety of such suppliers in the United States.
Intellectual Property
 
Intellectual property rights are material to our business, particularly patent rights.  The patents licensed to us by Thomas J. Shaw, our founder and CEO, have varying expiration dates.  Importantly, the VanishPoint® syringes, which are constructed using a variety of patents, will cease to be covered by a patent in 2020 unless further patented improvements are made to the design.  All of our products are manufactured using patents owned by Thomas J. Shaw and we have a Technology License Agreement with Mr. Shaw granting us the exclusive right to manufacture, market, and sell the products.  Mr. Shaw is paid a 5% royalty on our gross sales pursuant to the terms of the Technology License Agreement.

The Company has registered the following trade names and trademarks for our products: VanishPoint®, EasyPoint®, Patient Safe®, VanishPoint® logos, RT with a circle mark, the Spiral Logo used in packaging VanishPoint® products, the color coded spots on the ends of our VanishPoint® syringes and others.  Company slogans The New Standard for Safety and We Make Safety Safe also have been granted registered trademark protection.
 
We are involved in patent litigation detailed in Item 3.
 
Seasonality
 
Historically, unit sales have increased in the latter part of the year due, in part, to the demand for syringes during the flu season.
 
Working Capital Items
 
Our significant accounting policies are set forth in the notes to our financial statements in Item 8.  Our inventory practices will vary in response to demand.  Order backlog is not material to our business.
Dependence on Customers
 
Although our business has historically derived significant percentages of its revenues from a few customers, we do not believe that the loss of any one of these customers would have a material adverse effect on our business.
 
We do not believe that existing contracts or subcontracts with the government are reasonably likely to be renegotiated or terminated.
 
Government Approval and Government Regulations
 
For all products manufactured for sale in the domestic market, we have given notice of intent to market to the FDA, and the devices were shown to be substantially equivalent to the predicate devices for the stated intended use.
 
For all products manufactured for sale in the domestic market and foreign market, we hold a Quality Management System certification to ISO 13485. For all products manufactured for sale into European Union countries, we hold a Full Quality Assurance System certification to Directive 93/42/EEC Annex II (excluding section 4).  Both of these certifications are issued by our notified body, bsi, and are reviewed annually.
 
We will continue to comply with applicable regulations of all countries in which our products are registered for sale.
 
Competitive Conditions
 
Major domestic competitors include BD and Medtronic Minimally Invasive Therapies (Medtronic, formerly known as Covidien).  Terumo Medical Corp., Smiths Medical, and B Braun are additional competitors with smaller market shares. BD and Medtronic have controlling U.S. market share; greater financial resources; larger and more established sales, marketing, and distribution organizations; and greater market influence, including long-term and/or exclusive contracts.  Additionally, BD may be able to use its resources to improve its products through research or acquisitions or develop new products which may compete with our products.
 
We compete primarily on the basis of healthcare worker and patient safety, product performance, and quality.  We believe our competitive advantages include, but are not limited to, our leadership in quality and innovation. We believe our products continue to be the most effective safety devices in todays market.  Our syringe products include passive safety activation, require less disposal space, and are activated while in the patient, reducing exposure to the contaminated needle.  Our price per unit is competitive or even lower than the competition once all the costs incurred during the life cycle of a syringe are considered. Such life cycle costs include disposal costs, testing and treatment costs for needlestick injuries, and treatment for contracted illnesses resulting from needlestick injuries.

EasyPoint® retractable needles offer unique safety benefits not found in other commercially available safety needles.  Manually activated safety needles, such as BDs SafetyGlide and Eclipse needles, and Medtronics Magellan needle, must be removed from the patient, exposing the contaminated needle prior to activation of the manual safety mechanism.  EasyPoint® needles allow for activation of the automated retraction mechanism while the needle is still in the patient, reducing exposure to the contaminated needle and effectively reducing the risk of needlestick injuries.  BDs Integra needle allows for retraction from the patient but must be used in conjunction with a BD Integra 3mL syringe. The Integra needle does not have a luer fitting, making it incompatible with commonly used luer-fitting syringes and pre-filled syringes.  In addition, the safety feature of the Integra needle/syringe combination can only be activated when the plunger handle is fully depressed and the contents have been expelled.  EasyPoint® retractable needles are compatible with luer-fitting syringes, including pre-filled syringes.  In addition, EasyPoint® retractable needles may be activated with fluid in the syringe, making it applicable for aspiration procedures such as blood collection.
 
Research and Development
 
We spent approximately $609,000; $572,000; and $608,000 in 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively, on research and development.
 
Environmental Compliance
 
We believe that we do not incur material costs in connection with compliance with environmental laws.
 
Employees
 
As of March 1, 2018, we had 150 employees. 146 of such employees were full time employees.
 
Financial Information about Geographic Areas
 
We have minimal long-lived assets in foreign countries.  Shipments to international customers generally require a prepayment either by wire transfer or an irrevocable confirmed letter of credit.  We do extend credit to international customers on some occasions depending upon certain criteria, including, but not limited to, the credit worthiness of the customer, the stability of the country, banking restrictions, and the size of the order.  All transactions are in U.S. currency.  If customers designate a specific destination for its order, we attribute sales to countries based on the destination of shipment.

Most large international sales of VanishPoint® products are filled by production from Chinese manufacturers.  In the event that we become unable to purchase such product from our Chinese manufacturers, we would need to find an alternate manufacturer for the blood collection set, IV catheter, Patient Safe® syringe, 0.5mL insulin syringe, 0.5mL autodisable syringe, and 2mL, 5mL, and 10mL syringes and we would increase domestic production for the 1mL and 3mL syringes.
 
We do not maintain patent or trademark protection in all foreign countries, but, where possible, have taken steps to protect our patents and trademarks in those countries where we routinely conduct a material amount of business.  Our lack of patent and trademark protection, particularly in certain foreign countries, heightens the risk that our designs may be copied by a competitor.
