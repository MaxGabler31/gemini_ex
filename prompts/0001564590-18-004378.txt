Overview
 We are a medical technology company developing and commercializing a robotic device, the ARTAS System, that assists physicians in performing many of the repetitive tasks that are a part of a follicular unit extraction surgery, or FUE, a type of hair restoration procedure. We believe the ARTAS System is the first and only physician-assisted robotic system that can identify and dissect hair follicular units directly from the scalp and create recipient implant sites. The ARTAS System includes the ARTAS Hair Studio application, an interactive three-dimensional patient consultation tool that enables a physician to create a simulated hair transplant model for use in patient consultations. We received clearance from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, in April 2011 to market the ARTAS System in the U.S., and we have sold the ARTAS System into 36 other countries. As of December 31, 2017, we have sold 94 ARTAS Systems in the U.S. and 159 internationally. As of December 31, 2017, the ARTAS System and ARTAS Hair Studio application are protected by over 81 patents in the U.S. and over 110 international patents.
 The ARTAS System is comprised of the patient chair, the cart, which includes the robotic arm, integrated vision system, artificial intelligence algorithms and a series of proprietary end effectors, which are the various devices at the end of the robotic arm, such as the automated needle and punch, that interact with the patient’s scalp and hair follicles and perform various clinical functions.
 The image below depicts the ARTAS System cart, including the robotic arm and the needle mechanism which houses the automated needle and punch used for follicle dissection and site making, and the ARTAS User Interface.

Market Overview
 According to data collected by the International Society of Hair Restoration Surgery, or ISHRS, the global market for hair restoration procedures was approximately $4.1 billion in 2017. We believe the global hair restoration market will continue to grow due to several factors, including:
  
• | An aging population with disposable income and an increased acceptance of aesthetic procedures. According to data from the American Society for Aesthetic Plastic Surgery, or ASAPS, in 2016, Americans spent more than $15 billion on combined surgical and nonsurgical aesthetic procedures. Male aesthetic procedures have increased 325% since 1997.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | A market shift to less invasive hair restoration procedures such as follicular unit extraction which, according to ISHRS, have increased from less than 10% of hair restoration procedures performed in 2004 to about 52.6% in 2017.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | A greater number of physicians seeking patient direct pay procedures, such as hair restoration, due to increased government and private payor reimbursement restrictions.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 This growing market has a significant potential patient population with approximately 35 million males in the United States suffering from androgenic alopecia, or AGA, also referred to as male pattern baldness. We have FDA clearance to market the ARTAS System in the U.S. for dissecting hair follicles from the scalp of men diagnosed with AGA who have black or brown straight hair. With this clearance we are able to market the ARTAS System to physicians to treat this growing market.
 The Hair Loss Market 
 According to the census conducted by ISHRS, in 2016, an estimated $4.1 billion was spent globally on surgical hair restoration treatments, representing a 64% increase over the estimated $2.5 billion spent in 2014. In general, the global market for aesthetic procedures marketed towards men is significant and growing. For example, according to ASAPS statistics, the number of aesthetic procedures performed on men in the U.S. increased 325% from 1997 to 2015, to approximately $1.3 billion. The patient market for hair loss is significant with approximately 35 million men suffering from AGA in the United States alone.

Hair Loss Treatment Options and Their Limitations
 The treatments for hair loss can broadly be divided between non-surgical options and surgical procedures. 
 Non-Surgical Options 
 Non-surgical options for hair loss include prescription therapeutics and non-prescription remedies. In the U.S., the FDA has authorized two prescription therapeutics for hair loss: Rogaine which is applied topically, and Propecia which is ingested in pill form. Both Rogaine and Propecia have several drawbacks, including limited efficacy in some individuals and the need for strict patient compliance in order for the treatment to have meaningful effect. Both products require strict usage without breaks and often require a minimum of six months before meaningful effect is visible. Furthermore, while uncommon and not affecting all men, Propecia can cause multiple side-effects given its systemic administration, including impotence, swelling, dizziness and weakness. In addition to prescription therapeutics, non-surgical remedies for hair loss include wigs, hair pieces and spray-on applications, which also have significant drawbacks primarily due to an unnatural aesthetic look. 
 Surgical Procedures 
 Surgical procedures to address hair loss continue to evolve and become more popular. The first of these therapies, hair plugs, was developed in the late 1950s. Due to the size of the transplanted hair follicle groups, or plugs, the transplants resulted in an unnatural look with the patient often having a “doll-hair” like appearance, the clumping or grouping of hair follicles in a visibly uniform pattern. Because of the poor aesthetic results of hair plugs, strip surgery, or FUT, follicular unit transplantation and FUE became increasingly more popular. 
 FUE is significantly less invasive than strip surgery. In this procedure, the physician or technician removes individual hair follicles from the patient’s scalp without removing a strip of tissue. FUE can be performed with manual hand-held punches, automated hand-held devices or with the ARTAS System. Use of manual or automated hand-held devices requires significant time, and demands that complicated, repetitive and tedious tasks be performed by a trained technician (under the supervision of a physician) or physician. We have developed the 
 
4


ARTAS System to provide robotic assistance for many of the tedious and repetitive tasks that are part of an FUE procedure.
 Strip Surgery 
 In an FUT procedure, or strip surgery, the physician uses a sharp scalpel to surgically remove a large strip of the patient’s scalp, approximately eight inches in length, and one-half inch in width and depth, from the donor area. The subsequent wound is sutured or stapled closed. Following the surgical removal of the strip of the scalp from the patient’s head, the follicular unit grafts, the natural groupings of hair follicles in the scalp, are removed from the strip of scalp by technicians using microscopes and scalpel blades. Following the removal of the individual hair follicles, technicians implant the individual hair follicles into hundreds to thousands of incisions in the patient’s scalp prepared by the physician. 
 Strip surgery results in a linear scar which may enlarge over time creating a poor aesthetic outcome in the donor area. As a result, strip surgery patients are generally unable to wear their hair short without revealing the scar. Furthermore, multiple strip surgeries can cause a significant stretching of the scalp which can exacerbate the appearance of this scar. There can also be complications from strip surgery, such as ongoing pain at the scar site, numbness, and potential nerve damage.
 Follicular Unit Extraction Using Hand-Held Devices 
 In part as a solution to the significant scarring and other drawbacks of strip surgery, the follicular unit extraction, or FUE, procedure was developed in the early 2000s. In an FUE procedure, rather than surgically removing a portion of the patient’s scalp, each hair graft is individually dissected from the scalp for transplantation. Because a strip of the patient’s scalp is not removed, a FUE procedure avoids a long linear scar and reduces the post-operative pain and numbness associated with strip surgery. Following the dissection of the individual hair follicles, the physician uses a hand-held device to remove the hair follicles. After harvesting, the individual hair follicles are implanted in the same way as in a strip surgery procedure. 
 Drawbacks of Strip Surgery and FUE Surgery Using Hand-Held Devices 
 While strip surgery and FUE surgery using a hand-held device, or manual FUE, can provide significant, long-term results in restoring hair, there are several limitations associated with these procedures. 
  
• | Technician training. Strip surgery and manual FUE procedures require dexterity, demanding hand-eye coordination, and attention to detail by all members of the transplant team. Technicians must handle the delicate grafts carefully and place them into site incisions during implantation without damaging the grafts. For strip surgeries in particular, a technician must undergo significant training to dissect grafts under a microscope and it can take a significant period of time for a technician to become proficient.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Labor intensive. Both strip surgery and manual FUE procedures require a large team of technicians to perform the procedure, generally requiring between four and eight technicians. The labor intensiveness and time consuming nature of these techniques limits the number of procedures physicians are able to perform.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Long learning curve. Both strip surgery and manual FUE procedures require a major investment of time on the part of physicians and technicians to learn the technique. A physician must commit a substantial amount of time to learn the manual FUE harvesting technique and they often report that the technique is technically and ergonomically challenging. Initially, a physician may only be able to harvest a limited number of grafts per hour, which may ultimately affect the size of the hair transplant procedure the physician is able to perform. In addition, the follicles harvested by a physician using the FUE technique may not be of a high quality. Even physicians and technicians who are highly experienced may have results with high transection rates while performing a manual FUE procedure. For strip surgeries, there is a significant time investment made to train each technician to dissect grafts under a microscope, handle the delicate grafts with instrumentation and to place the grafts into the site incisions during implantation.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Surgical planning and recipient site making. In making the recipient sites into which hair follicles are transplanted, the ability of the physician and the technician to visualize and avoid injuring existing hair is limited to what they can achieve with magnified lenses. As a result, this limited visualization may compromise the aesthetic outcome. Additionally, manual site making can present additional issues and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
5


 
complications, including cutting into and damaging existing healthy hair, difficulty in matching existing hair angles, successfully creating a random distribution pattern for implantation in order to create a more natural look, and creating sites with a consistent and optimal depth.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Lack of high quality visualization tools for the patient. Generally, hair restoration physicians utilize before and after pictures of previous patients and grease pens to delineate the transplant area. These are typically the only available tools to assist the patient in understanding the aesthetic effect of the procedure and do not provide information to visualize the expected outcome illustrated on the actual patient.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Inconsistency in performance. Both strip surgery and manual FUE procedures require either physicians or technicians to perform the repetitive and tedious tasks of dissecting grafts over a long period of time. In a strip surgery, the technicians are required to dissect the individual follicles from the harvested strip of the patient’s scalp, whereas in a manual FUE procedure the physician and technicians are required to harvest each individual follicle directly from the patient’s scalp. As a result of this lengthy and tedious process, the physician or technician may begin to fatigue and his or her ability to maintain the concentration necessary to consistently extract high-quality grafts without causing follicle damage may diminish. In addition, graft dissection productivity may decline during the long procedure due to fatigue.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The ARTAS Solution
 We believe the ARTAS System addresses many of the shortcomings of other hair restoration procedures. The ARTAS System is capable of robotically assisting a physician through many of the most challenging steps of the hair restoration process, including the dissection of hair follicles, site
 planning and recipient site making. We believe, with this assistance, the ARTAS System can help shorten the often long learning curve for both physicians and technicians to become proficient in performing hair restoration procedures. In addition, we believe that by assisting the physician and technicians with many of the repetitive and tedious tasks associated with the hair restoration procedure, the ARTAS System can make hair restoration procedures less labor intensive and can reduce inconsistent results. Further, we believe the ARTAS System’s Site Making functionality, which includes an enhanced imaging system and sophisticated algorithms, helps physicians avoid damaging existing follicles and enables them to create a more natural, aesthetically pleasing outcome for the patient.  In addition, we have a robotic implantation functionality that is currently in clinical development which, if cleared for marketing, will enable the ARTAS System to implant harvested hair follicles. We recently submitted a 510(K) application for the implantation functionality in 2018. Our platform includes the ARTAS Hair Studio application which can simulate pre-procedure and post-procedure outcomes and can be utilized during the patient consultation and education process.
 The ARTAS procedure provides patients with a minimally invasive, less painful alternative to strip surgery. The ARTAS System has a faster recovery time and avoids the long linear scar at the back of the patient’s head. The ARTAS Hair Studio application allows patients to visualize the expected post-procedure outcome through a three-dimensional model. We believe this patient-physician interaction can provide patients more confidence and make the patient more comfortable in undergoing the procedure. Due to these advantages, we believe the ARTAS System and the ARTAS Hair Studio application are appealing to potential patients considering a hair transplant or those that are using less effective treatments, such as prescription therapeutics or other non-surgical products. 
 In addition to the advantages afforded to patients, we believe the ARTAS System and the ARTAS Hair Studio application provide compelling benefits for physicians. The ARTAS System’s image-guided robotic capabilities allow physicians to perform procedures with fewer staff than what might be required for a traditional strip surgery or a FUE procedure using hand-held devices. With the robotic assistance provided by the ARTAS System, we believe physicians and technicians will be able to perform the complicated, repetitive and tedious task of dissecting hair grafts with less fatigue and greater productivity than would be possible in a manual FUE procedure. In addition, we believe the ARTAS System, through its ergonomic and easy-to-use platform, in tandem with th
e high quality training we provide, can significantly shorten the learning curve for physicians and technicians. 
 We strategically market the ARTAS System to hair restoration surgeons, dermatologists, plastic surgeons and aesthetic physicians. We believe we are able to reach our target physician customers effectively through focused marketing efforts. These efforts include participation in trade shows, scientific meetings, educational symposiums, webinars, online advertising and other activities. For physicians who purchase the ARTAS System, we provide comprehensive clinical training, practice-based marketing support, as well as patient leads. For example, we believe we help our physician customers increase the number of procedures performed by assigning a practice success 
 
6


manager, or PSM, to provide assistance in building the physician-customer’s hair restoration practice. Support from a PSM includes the deployment of patient marketing materials, assisting with social media and digital marketing strategies, and other marketing and sales support.

Advantages of the ARTAS Procedure
 Patient Value. We believe the ARTAS System and the ARTAS Hair Studio application significantly improve the patient experience and outcome in hair transplantation procedures in the following ways:

• | Through the ARTAS System, the dissection of grafts is performed in a manner that leaves only small pinpoint scars that heal faster and are less detectable than the larger post-operative linear scar that would be produced from strip surgery. As a result, an ARTAS procedure can, in many cases, offer a shorter recovery time and can enable patients to resume their daily lifestyle faster than with strip surgery. In addition, the ARTAS procedure allows patients to wear their hair short without a noticeable scar.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The ARTAS Hair Studio application enables patients to interact with their physician to make educated decisions on graft numbers and implant placements to achieve their desired aesthetic outcome and to view a simulation of their potential result. We believe this process and interaction give patients more confidence in undergoing a procedure since they have direct input into their treatment and can preview the expected outcome.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The ARTAS Site Making functionality translates the physician-patient site design onto the patient’s recipient area. The ARTAS System’s enhanced imaging system and sophisticated algorithms enable the ARTAS System to rapidly create recipient sites at precise depths, replicate pre-existing hair angles, avoid damaging the healthy pre-existing hair and adjust the distribution of the recipient sites to optimally fill in the transplantation area. We believe these elements can contribute to a superior aesthetic outcome.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Physician Value. We believe the ARTAS System provides physicians compelling economic benefits and enables physicians to achieve consistent reproducible results. As a result, we believe the ARTAS procedure also offers an attractive addition to existing dermatology, plastic surgery or aesthetics practices whether they do or do not provide hair restoration procedures.
  
• | Hair restoration procedures are generally paid for by the patient and do not involve the complexity of securing reimbursement from third-party payors.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | We believe the ARTAS System’s image-guided robotic capabilities allow physicians to perform hair restoration procedures with fewer staff required than a traditional strip surgery or a manual FUE procedure - procedures can also be performed with less physician and technician fatigue.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Because we provide high quality training for physicians and their clinical teams on the use of the ARTAS System and because the robotic system and its intelligent algorithms assist these teams in performing hair restoration procedures, we believe we can significantly shorten the learning curve necessary for hair transplantation procedures using the ARTAS System. This shorter learning curve can reduce barriers to entry for a new hair restoration practice. It can also ease the adoption of a new technology into existing practices.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Clinically-Established Results. Four peer-reviewed clinical publications have demonstrated the quality and consistency of grafts produced by the ARTAS System. One published study indicated average damage rates for the hair follicles, or transection rates, with the ARTAS System were as low as 6.6%, with a second study documenting average transection rates as low as 4.9% in a Korean population of patients. The third study documented that the ARTAS System can be programmed by the physician to select follicular units with larger groupings of hairs while skipping single hair grafts, which allows physicians to choose particular follicular units depending on the hair density they are trying to achieve, providing a clinical benefit as measured by the increase in hairs per harvest of 17% and as measured by the increase in hairs per graft of 11.4%. Results were statistically significant with a p-value less than 0.01.  This study also demonstrates the ability of robotic follicular unit graft selection to increase the amount of hairs a physician can extract for each incision made in the donor area. The fourth study demonstrated that FUE cases larger than 2,500 grafts, or mega-sessions, are possible using the ARTAS System. These peer-reviewed publications demonstrate the reproducibility and consistency of dissection results from the ARTAS System in a diverse group of patients, even as the system is used by different clinicians. To our knowledge, there are no other peer-reviewed clinical publications that demonstrate the reproducibility of results utilizing other products in FUE or strip surgery procedures. We intend to encourage scientific research in the study of hair restoration to improve our technology, solutions, enhance understanding of our industry and educate physicians on the capabilities of the ARTAS System.

The ARTAS System and Procedure 
 We believe the ARTAS System with the ARTAS Hair Studio application have improved multiple phases of the hair transplantation procedure, which include patient consultation, harvesting, recipient site making and implantation.  
 
Patient Consultation 
 During the initial consultation process, potential patients want to understand their hair restoration procedure and visualize its aesthetic outcome. Traditionally, physicians have used pre-procedure and post-procedure pictures of previous patients to illustrate how a new patient’s results might look, requiring a patient to use their imagination to visualize the potential results. Physicians may also use a grease pen to draw the areas directly on the patient’s head to show where grafts could be implanted. 
 We introduced the ARTAS Hair Studio application in 2014 to make the consultation more informative, interactive and easy for physicians to utilize. The ARTAS Hair Studio application produces a three-dimensional rendering of the recipient area viewable on a tablet device. The physician can draw on the tablet to simulate alternative cosmetic outcomes. A patient can, in real-time, visualize the simulation and look at various outcomes based on the number of grafts to be implanted and placements of the graphs. Since hair transplantation prices charged by physicians often vary based on the number of grafts, this aids both the physician and patient in arriving at a site plan that balances outcome expectations and patient price sensitivities.

The following is an example of a ARTAS Hair Studio pre-procedure and post-procedure simulation: 

Harvesting 
 During the harvesting phase of the hair restoration procedure, the robotic arm and integrated vision system work in tandem to identify the optimal hair follicles to be used in the procedure. The ARTAS vision system uses proprietary algorithms to identify individual hair follicles, growth angle, density, thickness, length and follicle grouping and to determine which grafts to dissect and the optimal order in which they should be dissected. The algorithms recalculate 60 times per second, accommodating patient movement, to provide the physician with accurate up-to-date information during the course of the procedure. We believe these assessments directly correlate to the quality of the outcome and the state of the donor area. This is important as we believe it affects how the donor area will appear following the procedure, and the potential viability for subsequent harvesting for future transplantation procedures. The ARTAS System harvesting user interface provides the physician with enhanced control during the procedure. An example of the harvesting user interface appears as follows:
Following the vision system’s identification of the optimal hair follicles for transplant, the ARTAS System dissects these follicles using a sharp needle to score the epidermis and a punch, coaxial with the needle, to separate the graft 
 
10


from the surrounding tissue. In the final step of the harvesting phase, the grafts are removed manually with forceps by the physician or the technician. The grafts are then cleaned, inspected and prepared for implantation.
During the procedure, the physician has the ability
 to customize the dissection incisions by choosing a needle and punch that will produce 0.8mm, 0.9mm or 1.0mm incisions. The image below illustrates a typical ARTAS System punch and needle: 

The needle travels at approximately 2,500 mm to 3,000 mm per second when it contacts the skin. This provides targeted precision and a cleanly scored incision. The punch then spins at 3,000 rpm and loosens the grafts from the surrounding tissue. In a clinical setting, we have observed that the dissection cycle takes between one to two seconds per graft, depending on the length of the graft. In a clinical setting, the ARTAS System has been shown to move from graft to graft at a rate of approximately one to three seconds, thereby enabling the ARTAS System to dissect a graft every two to five seconds, or approximately 720 to over 1,800 grafts per hour. The ARTAS System enables the physicians to adjust dissection parameters to accommodate for different types of skin, and manipulate graft selection algorithms based on patient needs. The ARTAS System can be programmed to dissect as many grafts as appropriate thus maximizing the use of the donor area. It can also be programmed to dissect grafts with more than two hairs each, thereby increasing the hair yield or the number of hairs per graft. 
 During the harvesting phase of the hair transplantation procedure, the patient may be lightly sedated and the integrated vision system can track patient movement and pause if excessive movement is detected. 
 Recipient Site Making 
 Sites, or incisions, are created to receive the harvested grafts. This task is generally performed by the physician. Prior to the ARTAS System, site making was performed manually using a hand-held tool or needle to create hundreds to thousands of tiny incisions in the scalp. This is a critical step as it creates the hair pattern in which the harvested grafts will grow. From communications with physicians we have found that, typically, a physician can manually create approximately 1,500 sites per hour. Precision and consistency, however, can be affected by experience, hand-eye coordination and fatigue. 
 The ARTAS System Site Making functionality incorporates artificial intelligence and robotics precision to strategically make surgical incision sites for implanting hair follicles, while also identifying and avoiding injuring healthy follicles in proximity of the implantation sites. This allows the patient’s hair to look more natural and prevents damaging existing healthy hair in the transplant area which we believe would result in patients with more hair than if the sites were made manually. 
 Robotic recipient Site Making, introduced in 2015, is performed by the physician, who develops the ARTAS System treatment plan, or map, identifying where to make the incisions on the patient. The treatment plan is prepared using three-dimension modeling software that takes one picture of the patient’s recipient area and generates a three-dimensional map that is utilized by the ARTAS System. With entry angle accuracy, consistency and precise depth control, the ARTAS System creates the recipient sites using a small solid core needle or a blade at a rate of approximately 2,500 to 3,000 sites per hour, which is significantly faster than the approximately 1,500 sites per hour achieved manually. 
 
11


Implantation 
 Following the site making phase of the hair transplantation procedure, the physician and/or technicians manually implant the grafts in the robotically created sites made by the ARTAS System. To help facilitate implantation, we are developing a robotic implantation functionality. We believe this robotic implantation functionality, if approved, will help further shorten the learning curve, improve the consistency and reproducibility of results by protecting permanent hair and reducing inconsistencies associated with manual implantation, and could potentially reduce the amount of time each graft spends outside of the scalp and decrease the overall time required for implantation. During the clinical development of the robotic implantation functionality, we have explored several options for delivering this new functionality to existing ARTAS customers. While we have not determined how this functionality will be incorporated into our current ARTAS System, we are committed to providing our current customers a means to access the implantation functionality if and when it is approved. 
 This robotic implantation functionality is currently in clinical development and is not approved for commercial use. Our ongoing clinical trial for the implantation functionality is a multi-center, double arm, blinded control study comparing the safety and efficacy of the ARTAS System and manual implantation. The primary endpoint for the clinical trial is determining that the robotic implantation is not inferior to the
 manual implantation as determined by hair follicle growth at six months and nine months. As of December 31, 2017, a total of 32 patients have been enrolled in the trial. We expect to report the results of our clinical trial in the coming months. In additi
on, we recently submitted a 510(K) application for the implantation functionality and if approved, we expect to be able to commence commercial marketing of the implantation functionality in 2018

. 
 ARTAS Kits for Harvesting and Site Making 
 The ARTAS System utilizes a set of disposable and reusable kits for our Harvesting and Site Making functionality. Each system comes with a set of reusable items. The disposable kits are included with the purchase of procedures. 
 Our Growth Strategy
 Our goal is to expand the commercialization of the ARTAS System so that it becomes the standard of care for hair transplantation. The key elements of our strategy to achieve this goal are to:

• | Broaden Our Physician Customer Base. In addition to continuing to market the ARTAS System to traditional hair restoration practices, we continue to expand our direct sales efforts to include other physician specialties, such as dermatology and plastic surgery. In both the traditional hair restoration practices and other customer bases, we will be selective in identifying those practitioners who have a track record of successful integration of new technologies and a strong desire to build a hair restoration practice around the ARTAS System.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Expand Our International Business. According to ISHRS, the size of the international hair restoration market is larger than the U.S. market and in certain markets FUE is already believed to be the preferred method for hair restoration surgery. We are focused on increasing our market penetration overseas and building global brand recognition. In 2017, approximately 58% of our revenue was generated outside of the US. We intend to continue to bolster our international business by adding distributors and sales support staff, which we believe will help to increase sales and strengthen physician relationships in our international markets.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Continue to Innovate. Since the introduction of the ARTAS System in 2011, we have regularly introduced new innovations and updates to the ARTAS System, and we intend to continue this innovation going forward. For example, we are developing a robotic implantation functionality to the ARTAS System which is in clinical development. We also intend to continue to refine our harvesting technology and user interface, while making ongoing investments in research and development driven by customer feedback and market demands. Furthermore, we may pursue expanding the cleared indications of use beyond men with a specific hair type so that the ARTAS System can be more broadly utilized.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Drive Increased Utilization. In addition to revenue from system sales and servicing, we also generate revenue from procedure based fees. We will continue to work collaboratively with our physician customers to increase utilization by introducing new functionalities, technology and innovations. In addition, we believe we can increase procedure revenue by helping physicians build their practice through our marketing and training support. To achieve all of these goals, we intend to utilize our teams
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

of clinical training managers, or CTMs, PSMs and field service engineers to work with and to support our physician customers in developing profitable ARTAS practices.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Research and Development
 Since we started selling the ARTAS System in 2011, we have introduced a number of new functionalities and enhancements designed to make the use of the ARTAS System more intuitive for clinicians and more comfortable for patients with the ultimate goal of improving clinical outcomes.
 Our research and development efforts are focused on improvements which continue to refine our Harvesting and Site Making functions. We are also developing a robotic implantation functionality for the ARTAS System which is in clinical development. We also intend to continue to improve our user interface, while making ongoing investments in research and development driven by customer feedback and market demands. For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, we incurred research and development expenses of $7.1 million, $7.5 million and $7.4 million, respectively.
 Intellectual Property
 Patents and Proprietary Technology
 We rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws, and confidentiality and invention assignment agreements to protect our intellectual property rights. As of December 31, 2017, we had 81 issued U.S. patents, primarily covering the ARTAS System and methods of use, the earliest of which expire in 2021, 20 pending U.S. patent applications, 110 issued foreign patents, some of which preserve an opportunity to pursue patent rights in multiple countries, and 38 pending foreign patent applications.
 Our patents cover the ARTAS Hair Studio and ARTAS System’s robotic mechanism, vision system, methods and algorithms of harvesting and making recipient sites, industrial designs and hardware. Our pending patent applications may not result in issued patents, and we cannot provide assurance that any current or subsequently issued patents will protect our intellectual property rights. Third parties may challenge certain patents issued to us as invalid, may independently develop similar or competing technologies or may design around any of our patents. We cannot be certain that any of the steps we have taken will prevent the misappropriation of our intellectual property, particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights in these countries as fully as in the U.S.
 There is no active patent litigation involving us and we have not received any notices of patent infringement.
 License Agreement with HSC Development LLC and James A. Harris, MD
 In July 2006, we entered into a license agreement, or the HSC license agreement, with HSC Development LLC, or HSC, and James A. Harris, M.D., as amended, pursuant to which we received an exclusive, worldwide license to develop, manufacture and commercialize products covered by any of the licensed patent rights or that incorporate the licensed technology in the field of performance of hair removal and implantation, including transplantation, procedures using a computer controlled system in which a needle or other device carried on a mechanized arm is oriented to a follicular unit for extraction of same, or to an implant site for implantation of a follicular unit, or some combination thereof. Under the HSC license agreement, we are developing the ARTAS System to be utilized as a robotic system to assist a physician in performing hair restoration procedures. In consideration for the license, we issued to HSC 25,000 shares of our common stock and paid HSC a one-time payment of $25,000. The license grant is perpetual, and the license agreement does not provide a right for HSC or Dr. Harris to terminate the HSC license agreement. The licensed patents cover, in general, a method and device for the extraction of follicular units from a donor area on a patient. The method includes scoring the outer skin layers with a sharp punch, and then inserting a blunt punch into the incision to separate the hair follicle from the surrounding tissue and fatty layer. The method and device significantly decrease the amount of follicular transection and increase the rate at which follicular units can be extracted. There are other embodiments not herein disclosed. The licensed patents will expire from 2025 through 2030.
 Sales and Marketing 
 We generate revenue from the sale and service of ARTAS Systems and procedure based fees. Generally, our physician customers either purchase their procedures online or through distributors. In the U.S., customers pay in advance generally on a per hair follicle basis for the hair follicles to be harvested, and on a per procedure basis for 
 
13


Site Making. Outside of the US, physician customers pay in advance, generally on a per procedure basis for both hair follicle Harvesting and Site Making. Customers generally either purchase their ARTAS System directly or finance their purchase through third parties. We do not provide financing to our customers. 
 We sell the ARTAS System, provide service and generate procedure based fees. In the U.S. we generate revenue through our direct sales force. Outside of the U.S. we utilize our direct sales force as well as third-party distributors. As of December 31, 2017, we have sold the ARTAS System in 37 countries.
 U.S. Sales 
 We sell the ARTAS System, provide service and generate procedure based revenue by helping our physician customers build their hair restoration practice, through a direct sales force in the U.S. which, as of December 31, 2017, included four regional sales managers, or RSMs, six CTMs and five PSMs. 
 Regional Sales Managers 
 Our RSMs are responsible for coordinating and executing the direct sales of the ARTAS Systems. We target potential customers through marketing events and programs, and we leverage longstanding RSM relationships with dermatologists, plastic surgeons and cosmetic aesthetic surgeons. 
Clinical Training Managers 
 Our CTMs provide high quality, comprehensive training and education to physicians on the use of the ARTAS System and on how to build their hair restoration practices. As of December 31, 2017, our CTM team is comprised of six highly-skilled professionals with an average of over 10 years of experience in training physician practices in hair restoration or other aesthetics procedures and surgery. We provide this initial training to assist physicians and their staffs in performing the ARTAS procedure in accordance with the product’s cleared instructions for use. Prior to the installation of the ARTAS System, the CTMs meet with the physician and their technicians to assess the level of training that will be required. 
 Our CTM training programs involve product and procedure training. During this initial training, we typically have one to three CTMs on site. We have found that a key to adoption and utilization of the ARTAS System is clinical confidence in the ARTAS System technology and procedure. We often conduct onsite physician training when we introduce innovations, such as the ARTAS Hair Studio application and our Site Making functionality. 
 Practice Success Managers 
 Our PSMs are responsible for helping our physician customers build awareness and market the ARTAS procedure and increase ARTAS brand-awareness. Our PSMs average over five years of experience in developing hair restoration practices and aesthetics practices. They form strong relationships with our customers and consult on how to integrate the ARTAS System into their practices, while raising awareness of the procedure among potential patients. This process often begins before the ARTAS System is installed at the customer site. Our PSMs work closely with the team that will manage the ARTAS business at the practice level to establish goals and develop detailed strategies to achieve these goals. This includes extensive training and coaching with respect to the patient consultation process. We provide easily implemented marketing tools allowing practices to create individually tailored website content, direct mail advertisements, print ads for magazines and newspapers and brochures. In addition, PSMs consult on methods
 to raise awareness of the ARTAS procedure through practice events, public relations, television, and radio advertising and other channels. 
 International Sales 
 We are developing selected markets outside the U.S. through a combination of direct selling and a network of distribution partners. As of December, 31 2017, we have three regional directors overseeing Asia, Europe, the Middle East, Africa and Latin America. These regional directors are responsible for coordinating direct sales, as well as the management of our distribution partners within these regions. There are four sales personnel directly selling in nine countries, as well as an international sales team of 15 employees supporting 20 independent distributors who market the ARTAS System in 27 countries. We require our distributors to provide technical service, clinical education, training and practice development. 
 In international markets, we utilize a variety of tools to market to physicians. We have two employees supporting marketing-related activities dedicated to international regions. We provide market support for our existing 
 
14


international ARTAS System owners that is substantially similar to the support we provide to owners in the U.S., either directly or indirectly through our distributors. We also market at major medical and scientific meetings, as well as tradeshows. Furthermore, we sponsor the ARTAS Symposia where physicians can view live ARTAS procedures and attend physician lectures and panel discussions led by key opinion leaders to learn how to develop successful ARTAS practices.
 Competition
 We compete directly in the surgical hair restoration market. We consider our direct competition to be strip surgeries and FUE procedures using hand-held devices. Among FUE procedures, we face specific competition from the manufacturers of hand-held devices, such as NeoGraft, which is a 510(k) exempt Class I device for use in hair transplantation procedures. We believe there are less than a dozen manufacturers of hand-held devices for FUE procedures. NeoGraft, similar to certain other hand-held FUE devices, consists of a hand-held sharp punch that is motorized to dissect and to use suction to remove grafts from the scalp.
 We believe that the primary competitive factors in this market are:
  
• | company and product brand recognition;
--+---------------------------------------


• | effective marketing and education;
--+-----------------------------------


• | sales force experience and access;
--+-----------------------------------


• | product support and service;
--+-----------------------------


• | technological innovation, product enhancements and speed of innovation;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | pricing and revenue strategies;
--+--------------------------------


• | product reliability, safety and durability;
--+--------------------------------------------


• | ease of use;
--+-------------


• | consistency, predictability and durability of aesthetic results;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------


• | procedure costs to patients; and
--+---------------------------------


• | dedicated practice development teams; and dedicated clinical training teams.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Many of our surgical device and equipment competitors have greater capital resources, sales and marketing operations and service infrastructures than we do, as well as longer commercial histories and more extensive relationships with physicians.
 Strip surgery and some manual FUE procedures have a greater penetration into the hair restoration market. We face resistance from some established hair restoration practices in converting to ARTAS procedures due to workflow and staffing changes required, even though we believe that staffing requirements are reduced with the adoption of ARTAS procedures.
 We face competition to recruit and retain qualified sales, training and other personnel.
 We face competition for attention from our distributors as they may also sell other non-competing products.
 Our indirect competition includes non-surgical treatments for hair loss, such as prescription therapeutics, including Propecia, and non-prescription remedies, such as wigs, hair pieces and spray-on applications. We also face competition from other aesthetic devices that physicians may consider adding to their practice in lieu of building a hair restoration practice.
 Manufacturing
 The ARTAS System, reusable and disposable kits and upgrade kits are assembled exclusively for us by Evolve Manufacturing Technologies, Inc., or Evolve, a contract manufacturer based in Fremont, California. We have two master agreements and a component pricing agreement with Evolve for the supply of the ARTAS System, and consumable products, including reusable and disposable procedure kits and upgrade kits used with the ARTAS System, pursuant to both of which we make purchases on a purchase order basis. The terms of these master agreements are substantially similar. The master agreement for the sale of ARTAS Systems was effective beginning 
 
15


on April 1, 2016 and the master agreement for the sale of kits used with the ARTAS System was effective beginning on March 1, 2016. Both agreements are effective for an initial term of two years and will continue to automatically renew for additional twelve month periods, subject to either party’s right to terminate the agreement upon 180 days advance notice during the initial term if our quarterly forecasted demand falls below 75% of our historical forecasted demand for the same period in the previous year or upon 120 days’ advance notice after the initial term. Our agreement with Evolve for the pricing of certain components at certain quantities was effective on August 1, 2016 and expires on August 1, 2018. Otherwise, Evolve is not required, and may not be able or willing, to meet our future requirements at current prices, or at all.
 The components that make up the ARTAS System are manufactured by many different providers, including major components manufactured by sole source suppliers, such as the robotic arm, which is manufactured by Stäubli Corporation, the cameras, which are manufactured by FLIR Integrated Imaging Solutions Inc. and the product casing, which is manufactured by Preproduction Plastics Inc. Each of the ARTAS Systems undergoes testing at multiple interim stages during the manufacturing process, and is tested during one last time prior to delivery.
 Given that we utilize one partner to assemble the ARTAS System and the reusable and disposable kits, and source manufacturing of its component parts, we do not believe we could replace Evolve without incurring any material delay or other significant effects on production. We may also have difficulty maintaining sufficient production requirements in the event that Evolve’s relationship with any of Evolve’s sole source suppliers or manufacturers terminates in the future. Where practicable, we are seeking, or intending to seek second-source manufacturers for certain of our components. We believe that existing third-party facilities will be adequate to meet our current and anticipated manufacturing needs. In the last three years, we have not experienced any material delays in obtaining any of our products, nor has the ready supply of finished product to our customers been adversely affected.
 In the U.S., we and Evolve are required to manufacture our products in compliance with the FDA’s Quality System Regulation, or QSR. The QSR covers the methods and documentation used in, and the facilities used for the design, testing, control, manufacturing, labeling, quality assurance, packaging, storage and shipping of our products. In international markets, we also maintain various quality assurance and quality management certifications. We have obtained the following certifications that enable us to market our products in the European Union member states: Quality Management System ISO 13485 certificate, EC certificate #3806999CE01. We have additionally obtained and maintain our product registration in a number of other foreign markets such as Canada and China.
 Services and Support 
 We provide a warranty that typically has a term of one year and covers all the components of the system. Once the warranty expires, customers have the option of purchasing a service contract, which is typically for a term of one or two years. The service contracts that we offer cover preventative and corrective maintenance visits for all components of the system as well as system updates. 
 For both warranties and service contracts, the customer’s typical first point of contact for system failures or other technical issues is our customer support line. If the problem cannot be resolved over the phone or by directly connecting to the customer’s system electronically, a field service engineer will be dispatched to the customer site. We generally have a 24-hour response time or less for service calls. Our goal is to minimize the disruption caused by a service event. 
 We strive to provide highly responsive service and support for the ARTAS System. Our disposable and reusable kits are shipped from Legacy Transportation Services Inc. All kits are identified with lot numbers and date codes that indicate the expiration date
 of the product and are fully warranted until the date of expiration. We maintain a staff of customer service personnel in our San Jose, California facility that is available by phone to answer questions regarding the use of the ARTAS System. In addition, in the U.S. and certain international territories, our direct service organization provides on-site support and training to our customers in the use of the ARTAS System. 
 In the U.S. and certain international territories, the ARTAS System is shipped to a customer’s site for installation by one of our Field Service Engineers and training by one of our CTM’s. Our Field Service Engineers, CTMs and PSMs provide post-installation support and service. 
 In markets where we utilize distributors, the ARTAS System is serviced and supported through our independent distributors. We typically provide distributors with a warranty for each ARTAS System during the warranty period. Once the warranty period ends, the distributors have the option to continue providing support to the end-user customer by purchasing parts through our Parts and Services program or on an as-needed basis.

Government Regulation
 Our products and our operations are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA and other federal and state authorities in the U.S., as well as comparable authorities in foreign jurisdictions. Our products are subject to regulation as medical devices in the U.S. under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, as implemented and enforced by the FDA. The FDA regulates the development, design, non-clinical and clinical research, manufacturing, safety, efficacy, labeling, packaging, storage, installation, servicing, recordkeeping, premarket clearance or approval, import, export, adverse event reporting, advertising, promotion, marketing and distribution, and import and export of medical devices to ensure that medical devices distributed domestically are safe and effective for their intended uses and otherwise meet the requirements of the FDCA.
FDA Premarket Clearance and Approval Requirements
 Unless an exemption applies, each medical device commercially distributed in the U.S. requires either FDA clearance of a 510(k) premarket notification, or approval of a premarket approval application, or PMA. Under the FDCA, medical devices are classified into one of three classes—Class I, Class II or Class III—depending on the degree of risk associated with each medical device and the extent of manufacturer and regulatory control needed to ensure its safety and effectiveness. Class I includes devices with the lowest risk to the patient, and Class I devices are those for which safety and effectiveness can be assured by adherence to the FDA’s General Controls for medical devices, which include compliance with the applicable portions of the Quality System Regulation, or QSR, facility registration and product listing, reporting of adverse medical events, and truthful and non-misleading labeling, advertising, and promotional materials. Class II devices are subject to the FDA’s General Controls, and special controls as deemed necessary by the FDA to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device. These special controls can include performance standards, post market surveillance, patient registries and FDA guidance documents. While most Class I devices are exempt from the 510(k) premarket notification requirement, manufacturers of most Class II devices are required to submit to the FDA a premarket notification under Section 510(k) of the FDCA requesting permission to commercially distribute the device. The FDA’s permission to commercially distribute a device subject to a 510(k) premarket notification is generally known as 510(k) clearance. Devices deemed by the FDA to pose the greatest risks, such as life-sustaining, life-supporting or some implantable devices, or devices that have a new intended use, or use advanced technology that is not substantially equivalent to that of a legally marketed device, are placed in Class III, requiring approval of a PMA. Some pre-amendment devices are unclassified, but are subject to the FDA’s premarket notification and clearance process in order to be commercially distributed. To date, our products have been subject to the 510(k) clearance process.
 510(k) Marketing Clearance Pathway
 To obtain 510(k) clearance, we must submit to the FDA a premarket notification submission demonstrating that the proposed device is ‘‘substantially equivalent’’ to a predicate device already on the market. A predicate device is a legally marketed device that is not subject to premarket approval, i.e., a device that was legally marketed prior to May 28, 1976 (pre-amendments device) and for which a PMA is not required, a device that has been reclassified from Class III to Class II or I, or a device that was found substantially equivalent through the 510(k) process. The FDA’s 510(k) clearance process usually takes from nine to twelve months, but may take significantly longer. The FDA may require additional information, including clinical data, to make a determination regarding substantial equivalence.
 If the FDA agrees that the device is substantially equivalent to a predicate device on the market, it will grant 510(k) clearance to commercially market the device. If the FDA determines that the device is “not substantially equivalent” to a previously cleared device, the device is automatically designated as a Class III device. The device sponsor must then fulfill more rigorous PMA requirements, or can request a risk-based classification determination for the device in accordance with the “de novo” process, which is a route to market for novel medical devices that are low to moderate risk and are not substantially equivalent to a predicate device.
 After a device receives 510(k) marketing clearance, any modification that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a major change or modification in its intended use, will require a new 510(k) marketing clearance or, depending on the modification, a de novo classification or PMA approval. The FDA requires each manufacturer to determine whether the proposed change requires submission of a 510(k) or a PMA in the first instance, but the FDA can review any such decision and disagree with a manufacturer’s determination. Many minor modifications today are accomplished by a letter-to-file in which the manufacture documents the change in an internal letter-to-file. The letter-to-file is in lieu of submitting a new 510(k) to obtain clearance for 
 
17


every change. The FDA may review these letters-to-file during an inspection. If the FDA disagrees with a manufacturer’s determination that no 510(k) was required for the change, the FDA can require the manufacturer to cease marketing and/or request the recall of the modified device until 510(k) marketing clearance or PMA approval is obtained. Also, in these circumstances, we may be subject to significant regulatory fines or penalties. The FDA has issued guidance, originally in 1997, to assist device manufacturers in making the determination as to whether a modification to a device requires a new 510(k).
 PMA Approval Pathway
 Class III devices require PMA approval before they can be marketed although some pre-amendment Class III devices for which the FDA has not yet required a PMA are cleared through the 510(k) process. The PMA process is more demanding than the 510(k) premarket notification process. In a PMA, the manufacturer must demonstrate that the device is safe and effective, and the PMA must be supported by extensive data, including data from preclinical studies and human clinical trials. The PMA must also contain a full description of the device and its components, a full description of the methods, facilities and controls used for manufacturing, and proposed labeling. Following receipt of a PMA, the FDA determines whether the application is sufficiently complete to permit a substantive review. If the FDA accepts the application for review, it has 180 days under the FDCA to complete its review of a PMA, although in practice, the FDA’s review often takes significantly longer, and can take up to several years. An advisory panel of experts from outside the FDA may be convened to review and evaluate the application and provide recommendations to the FDA as to the approvability of the device. The FDA may or may not accept the panel’s recommendation. In addition, the FDA will generally conduct a pre-approval inspection of the applicant or its third-party manufacturers’ or suppliers’ manufacturing facility or facilities to ensure compliance with the Quality System Regulation, or QSR.
 The FDA will approve the new device for commercial distribution if it determines that the data and information in the PMA constitute valid scientific evidence and that there is reasonable assurance that the device is safe and effective for its intended use(s). The FDA may approve a PMA with post-approval conditions intended to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device, including, among other things, restrictions on labeling, promotion, sale and distribution, and collection of long-term follow-up data from patients in the clinical study that supported PMA approval or requirements to conduct additional clinical studies post-approval. The FDA may condition PMA approval on some form of post-market surveillance when deemed necessary to protect the public health or to provide additional safety and efficacy data for the device in a larger population or for a longer period of use. In such cases, the manufacturer might be required to follow certain patient groups for a number of years and to make periodic reports to the FDA on the clinical status of those patients. Failure to comply with the conditions of approval can result in material adverse enforcement action, including withdrawal of the approval.
 Certain changes to an approved device, such as changes in manufacturing facilities, methods, or quality control procedures, or changes in the design performance specifications, which affect the safety or effectiveness of the device, require submission of a PMA supplement. PMA supplements often require submission of the same type of information as a PMA, except that the supplement is limited to information needed to support any changes from the device covered by the original PMA and may not require as extensive clinical data or the convening of an advisory panel. Certain other changes to an approved device require the submission of a new PMA, such as when the design change causes a different intended use, mode of operation, and technical basis of operation, or when the design change is so significant that a new generation of the device will be developed, and the data that were submitted with the original PMA are not applicable for the change in demonstrating a reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness.
 Clinical Trials
 Clinical trials are almost always required to support a PMA and are sometimes required to support a 510(k) submission. All clinical investigations of investigational devices to determine safety and effectiveness must be conducted in accordance with the FDA’s investigational device exemption, or IDE, regulations which govern investigational device labeling, prohibit promotion of the investigational device, and specify an array of recordkeeping, reporting and monitoring responsibilities of study sponsors and study investigators. If the device presents a “significant risk” to human health, as defined by the FDA, the FDA requires the device sponsor to submit an IDE application to the FDA, which must become effective prior to commencing human clinical trials. A significant risk device is one that presents a potential for serious risk to the health, safety or welfare of a patient and either is implanted, used in supporting or sustaining human life, substantially important in diagnosing, curing,

18


mitigating or treating disease or otherwise preventing impairment of human health, or otherwise presents a potential for serious risk to a subject. An IDE application must be supported by appropriate data, such as animal and laboratory test results, showing that it is safe to test the device in humans and that the testing protocol is scientifically sound. The IDE will automatically become effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA unless the FDA notifies the company that the investigation may not begin. If the FDA determines that there are deficiencies or other concerns with an IDE for which it requires modification, the FDA may permit a clinical trial to proceed under a conditional approval.
 In addition, the study must be approved by, and conducted under the oversight of, an Institutional Review Board, or IRB, for each clinical site. The IRB is responsible for the initial and continuing review of the IDE, and may pose additional requirements for the conduct of the study. If an IDE application is approved by the FDA and one or more IRBs, human clinical trials may begin at a specific number of investigational sites with a specific number of patients, as approved by the FDA. If the device presents a non-significant risk to the patient, a sponsor may begin the clinical trial after obtaining approval for the trial by one or more IRBs without separate approval from the FDA, but must still follow abbreviated IDE requirements, such as monitoring the investigation, ensuring that the investigators obtain informed consent, and labeling and record-keeping requirements. Acceptance of an IDE application for review does not guarantee that the FDA will allow the IDE to become effective and, if it does become effective, the FDA may or may not determine that the data derived from the trials support the safety and effectiveness of the device or warrant the continuation of clinical trials. An IDE supplement must be submitted to, and approved by, the FDA before a sponsor or investigator may make a change to the investigational plan that may affect its scientific soundness, study plan or the rights, safety or welfare of human subjects.
 During a study, the sponsor is required to comply with the applicable FDA requirements, including, for example, trial monitoring, selecting clinical investigators and providing them with the investigational plan, ensuring IRB review, adverse event reporting, record keeping and prohibitions on the promotion of investigational devices or on making safety or effectiveness claims for them. The clinical investigators in the clinical study are also subject to FDA regulations and must obtain patient informed consent, rigorously follow the investigational plan and study protocol, control the disposition of the investigational device, and comply with all reporting and recordkeeping requirements. Additionally, after a trial begins, we, the FDA or the IRB could suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time for various reasons, including a belief that the risks to study subjects outweigh the anticipated benefits.
 Post-market Regulation
 After a device is cleared or approved for marketing, numerous and pervasive regulatory requirements continue to apply. These include:
  
• | establishment registration and device listing with the FDA;
--+------------------------------------------------------------


• | QSR requirements, which require manufacturers, including third-party manufacturers, to follow stringent design, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures during all aspects of the design and manufacturing process;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | labeling and marketing regulations, which require that promotion is truthful, not misleading, fairly balanced and provide adequate directions for use and that all claims are substantiated, and also prohibit the promotion of products for unapproved or “off-label” uses and impose other restrictions on labeling;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | clearance or approval of product modifications to 510(k)-cleared devices that could significantly affect safety or effectiveness or that would constitute a major change in intended use of one of our cleared devices;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | medical device reporting regulations, which require that a manufacturer report to the FDA if a device it markets may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury, or has malfunctioned and the device or a similar device that it markets would be likely to cause or contribute to a death or serious injury, if the malfunction were to recur;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | correction, removal and recall reporting regulations, which require that manufacturers report to the FDA field corrections and product recalls or removals if undertaken to reduce a risk to health posed by the device or to remedy a violation of the FDCA that may present a risk to health;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
19


 
• | complying with the federal law and regulations requiring Unique Device Identifiers (UDI) on devices and also requiring the submission of certain information about each device to the FDA’s Global Unique Device Identification Database, or GUDID;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the FDA’s recall authority, whereby the agency can order device manufacturers to recall from the market a product that is in violation of governing laws and regulations; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | post-market surveillance activities and regulations, which apply when deemed by the FDA to be necessary to protect the public health or to provide additional safety and effectiveness data for the device.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We may be subject to similar foreign laws that may include applicable post-marketing requirements such as safety surveillance. Our manufacturing processes are required to comply with the applicable portions of the QSR, which cover the methods and the facilities and controls for the design, manufacture, testing, production, processes, controls, quality assurance, labeling, packaging, distribution, installation and servicing of finished devices intended for human use. The QSR also requires, among other things, maintenance of a device master file, device history file, and complaint files. As a manufacturer, we are subject to periodic scheduled or unscheduled inspections by the FDA. A failure to maintain compliance with the QSR requirements could result in the shut-down of, or restrictions on, manufacturing operations and the recall or seizure of products. The FDA has broad regulatory compliance and enforcement powers. If the FDA determines that we failed to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, it can take a variety of compliance or enforcement actions, which may result in any of the following sanctions:
  
• | warning letters, untitled letters, fines, injunctions, consent decrees and civil penalties;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | recalls, withdrawals, or administrative detention or seizure of our products;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | operating restrictions or partial suspension or total shutdown of production;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | refusing or delaying requests for 510(k) marketing clearance or PMA approvals of new products or modified products;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | withdrawing 510(k) clearances or PMA approvals that have already been granted;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | refusal to grant export or import approvals for our products; or
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------


• | criminal prosecution.
--+----------------------

Other Health Care Laws
 In addition to FDA restrictions on the marketing and promotion of medical devices, other federal and state healthcare laws and regulations could restrict our business practices. Although none of the procedures using our products are covered by any federal or state government healthcare program or any other third-party payor, applicable agencies and regulators may nonetheless interpret that we are subject to numerous federal healthcare anti-fraud laws, which include the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, False Claims Act and physician payment transparency laws that are intended to reduce waste, fraud and abuse in the healthcare industry, and analogous state laws that may apply to healthcare items and services paid for by any payors, including private insurers. In addition, we are subject to certain state reporting requirements in states with physician payment transparency laws that apply regardless of payor. Violations of any of these health regulatory laws may result in potentially significant penalties, including criminal and civil and administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, imprisonment, exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs, contractual damages, reputational harm, administrative burdens, diminished profits and future earnings, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations. To the extent that any of our products are sold in a foreign country, we may be subject to similar foreign laws, which may include, for instance, applicable post-marketing requirements, including safety surveillance, anti-fraud and abuse laws and implementation of corporate compliance programs and reporting of payments or transfers of value to healthcare professionals.
 Healthcare Reform
 The U.S. and some foreign jurisdictions are considering or have enacted a number of legislative and regulatory proposals to change the healthcare system in ways that could affect our ability to sell our products profitably. For example, the implementation of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Healthcare and Education Reconciliation Act, or the Affordable Care Act, has changed healthcare financing and delivery by both governmental and private insurers substantially and has affected medical device manufacturers significantly. The 
 
20


Affordable Care Act imposed, among other things, a new federal excise tax on the sale of certain medical devices, which is suspended but, absent further legislative action, will be reinstated starting January 1, 2020. In addition, the Affordable Care Act provided incentives to programs that increase the federal government’s comparative effectiveness research, and implemented payment system reforms including a national pilot program on payment bundling to encourage hospitals, physicians and other providers to improve the coordination, quality and efficiency of certain healthcare services through bundled payment models. Since its enactment, there have been judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the Affordable Care Act, and we expect there will be additional challenges and amendments to the Affordable Care Act in the future. The current Presidential Administration and U.S. Congress will likely continue to seek to modify, repeal, or otherwise invalidate all, or certain provisions of, the Affordable Care Act. It is uncertain the extent to which any such changes may impact our business or financial condition. We expect additional state and federal healthcare reform measures to be adopted in the future, any of which could result in reduced demand for our products or additional pricing pressure.
 Employees
 As of December 31, 2017, we had 87 employees, with 35 employees in sales and marketing, 15 employees in customer support, 21 employees in research and development, including clinical, regulatory and certain quality control functions, four employees in manufacturing operations and 12 employees in general management and administration. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good.
