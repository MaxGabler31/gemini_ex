Item 1. Business.

We are in the business of innovating fundamental wireless technologies and products. We have designed and developed proprietary radio frequency (“RF”) technologies and integrated circuits for use in wireless communication products. 

We have expended significant financial and other resources to research and develop our RF technologies and to obtain patent protection for those technologies in the United States of America (“U.S.”) and certain foreign jurisdictions. We believe certain patents protecting our proprietary technologies have been broadly infringed by others and therefore the primary focus of our business plan is the enforcement of our intellectual property rights through patent infringement litigation and licensing efforts. 

We currently have patent enforcement actions ongoing in various U.S. district courts against mobile handset providers and providers of smart televisions and other WiFi products and, in certain cases, their chip suppliers for the infringement of several of our RF patents. We have made significant investments in developing and protecting our technologies, the returns on which are dependent upon the generation of future revenues for realization.

We spent the majority of 2021 supporting our current patent enforcement actions. We have two patent enforcement cases pending against Qualcomm in the Middle District of Florida. Both cases experienced trial delays in 2020 and 2021 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. We are currently awaiting a trial 

 

date in the first of these cases, which is expected to be scheduled in 2022 pending the court’s rulings on a few outstanding pre-trial motions. The second case which is pending against Qualcomm and Apple has been stayed pending the outcome of the first case. 

In 2021, we entered into two patent settlement and licensing agreements as a result of patent enforcement actions initiated in the Western District of Texas in 2020. We have additional enforcement actions ongoing in Texas including against Intel Corporation (“Intel”) which is scheduled for trial in 2022. See “Legal Proceedings” in Note 12 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 for a detailed description of our various patent enforcement actions. 

A significant portion of our litigation costs have been funded under a secured contingent payment arrangement with Brickell Key Investments, LP (“Brickell”), contingent arrangements with legal counsel, and various debt and equity financings. See “Liquidity and Capital Resources” included in Item 7 for a full discussion of our litigation funding arrangements and our equity and debt financings. 

Products and Licenses

During 2021, we did not offer any products for sale, but rather focused exclusively on our patent enforcement and licensing efforts. This resulted in two licensees of our technologies in 2021 including Buffalo, Inc. (“Buffalo”) and Zyxel Communications Corporation (“Zyxel”). Each of these licenses resulted from a settlement and patent license agreement following initiation of patent enforcement actions by us. See “Revenue” in Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 for additional details.

RF Technologies

Our RF technologies enable highly accurate transmission and reception of RF carriers at low power, thereby enabling extended battery life, and certain size, cost, performance, and packaging advantages. 
We believe the most significant hurdle to the licensing and/or sale of our technologies and related products is the widespread use of certain of our technologies in infringing products produced by companies with significantly greater financial, technical, sales, and marketing resources. We believe we can secure licensing agreements with unauthorized current users of one or more of our technologies, and therefore compete, based on a solid and defensible patent portfolio and the advantages enabled by our unique patent-protected technologies. 

Patents and Trademarks 

We consider our intellectual property, including patents, patent applications, trademarks, and trade secrets to be significant to our business plan. We have a program to file applications for and obtain patents, copyrights, and trademarks in the U.S. and in selected foreign countries where we believe filing for such protection is appropriate to establish and maintain our proprietary rights in our technology and products. As of December 31, 2021, we had approximately 81 active U.S. and foreign patents related to our RF technologies. In addition, we have a number of recently expired patents that we believe continue to have significant economic value as a result of our ability to assert past damages in our patent enforcement actions. We estimate the economic lives of our patents to be the shorter of fifteen years from issuance or twenty years from the earliest application date. Our current portfolio of issued patents have expirations ranging from 2022 to 2036. 
Employees

As of December 31, 2021, we had seven full-time employees and one part-time employee. We also outsource certain specialty services, such as information technology, and utilize contract staff and third-party consultants from time to time to supplement our workforce. Our employees are not represented by any collective bargaining agreements and we consider our employee relations to be satisfactory.

We have taken measures to protect our workforce in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, including optional remote worksites for all of our employees beginning in April 2020. Our management, with the oversight of our board of directors, monitors the hiring, retention and management of our employees.
