Products and Services
We are a provider of compression services and equipment for natural gas and oil production, gathering, transmission, processing, and storage. Natural gas compression is a mechanical process in which the pressure of a given volume of natural gas is increased to a higher pressure. It is essential to the production and movement of natural gas. Compression is typically required numerous times in the natural gas production and sales cycle, including (i) at the wellhead, (ii) throughout gathering and distribution systems, (iii) into and out of processing and storage facilities and (iv) in natural gas pipelines. Compression is also utilized for gas lift, an artificial lift technique for producing oil that has insufficient reservoir pressure. We fabricate and sell standard compressor packages and custom designed compressor packages. We also provide aftermarket compression services and sell compressor package parts and components manufactured by third-party suppliers.
Compression Services
We utilize our fleet of compressor packages to provide a variety of compression services to our customers to meet their specific requirements. Our fleet includes approximately 5,700 compressor packages that provide approximately 1.1 million in aggregate horsepower, employing a wide spectrum of low-, medium-, and high-horsepower engines. We fabricate our compressor packages primarily at our fabrication facility in Midland, Texas. The horsepower of our natural gas compressor package fleet as of December 31, 2018 is summarized in the following table:

Range of Horsepower Per Package | Number of Packages | Aggregate Horsepower | | % of Aggregate Horsepower
Low horsepower (0-100) | 3,752 | | 175,951 | | 15.5 | %
Medium-horsepower (101-1,000) | 1,587 | | 443,901 | | 39.1 | %
High-horsepower (1,001 and over) | 380 | | 515,625 | | 45.4 | %
Total | 5,719 | | 1,135,477 | | 100.0 | %

Low-Horsepower (0-100 Horsepower) Compression Services. Our natural gas-powered, low-horsepower compressor packages include our GasJack® compressor packages that are relatively compact and easy to transport to our customer’s well site. We utilize our electric powered, low-horsepower VJack™ compressor packages to provide production enhancement services on wells where electric power is available. Our low-horsepower packages allow us to perform wellhead compression, fluids separation, and optional gas metering services all from one skid, thereby providing services that otherwise would generally require the use of multiple, more costly pieces of equipment. We utilize our low-horsepower compressor packages to provide production enhancement for dry gas wells and liquid-loaded gas wells and backside auto injection systems (“BAIS”). BAIS monitors tubing pressure to redirect gas flow into the casing annulus as needed to help gas wells unload liquids that hinder production. We also utilize our low-horsepower compressor packages to collect hydrocarbon vapors that are a by-product of oil production and storage (“vapor recovery”) and to reduce casing pressure of pumping oil wells to enhance oil production (“casing gas systems”).

Medium-horsepower (101-1,000 Horsepower) Compression Services. Our medium-horsepower compressor packages are primarily utilized to move natural gas from the wellhead through the field gathering system by boosting the pressure of the natural gas flowing through the system. Additionally, these compressor packages are used to reinject natural gas into producing vertical and horizontal oil wells that have insufficient reservoir pressure, to help lift liquids to the surface ("gas lift operations"). Typically, these applications require medium-horsepower compressor packages located at or near the wellhead. These compressor packages are also used to increase the efficiency of low-capacity natural gas fields by providing a central compression point from which the natural gas can be further processed and transported. These compressor packages feature primarily two- and three-stage compressors powered by natural gas engines ranging from 101 to 1,000 horsepower and equipped with interstage cooling.
High-Horsepower (Over 1,000 Horsepower) Compression Services. Our high-horsepower compressor packages are primarily utilized in midstream applications including natural gas gathering and centralized compression facilities. They move natural gas from individual wells or a group of wells to boost the pressure while being moved into a gathering pipeline that leads to various types of processing facilities. A significant number of these compressor packages in midstream applications also serve the dual purpose of gas lift operations by injecting a percentage of the compressed natural gas into producing oil wells. Our high-horsepower compressor packages are also used in connection with the movement of natural gas from gathering systems to storage facilities or the end user. These compressor packages feature primarily two- and three-stage compressors powered by natural gas engines over 1,000 horsepower and equipped with interstage cooling.
Other Related Services.    In certain Latin America markets, we provide well monitoring and sand separation services in connection with our primary low-horsepower compression services. Well monitoring services include a variety of services that monitor and optimize production from oil and gas wells. We utilize automated sand separators, which are high-pressure vessels with automated valve operation functions, at the well to remove solids that would otherwise cause abrasive wear damage to compression and other equipment that is installed downstream and inhibit production from the well.
Compression Services Contract Terms. Our compression services are primarily performed under service contracts using our low-, medium-, and high-horsepower compressor packages. A significant portion of these compression services are provided under services contracts that our legal counsel has concluded will generate qualifying income that is not subject to U.S. federal income taxes. Under these services contracts, we are responsible for providing our services in accordance with the particular specifications of a job. As owner and operator, we are responsible for operating and maintaining the equipment we utilize to provide our services. Our low horsepower compression service contracts typically have an initial term of one month and, unless terminated by us or our customers with 30-days' notice, continue on a month-to-month basis thereafter. Our medium and high horsepower compression service contracts typically have an initial term of twelve months but can also range from six months to twenty-four month initial terms as well. After the initial terms on our medium- and high-horsepower compression service contracts, typically customers will continue on a month-to-month basis or renew for additional extensions. We charge our customers a fixed monthly fee for the services provided under the services contracts. If the level of services we provide falls below certain contractually specified percentages, other than as a result of factors beyond our control, our customers are generally entitled to request limited credits against our service fees. To date, these credits have been insignificant as a percentage of revenue. 

We generally own the equipment we use to provide services to our customers, and we bear the risk of loss to this equipment to the extent not caused by (i) a breach of certain obligations of the customer, primarily involving 
3

the service site and the fuel gas being supplied to us, or (ii) an uncontrolled well condition. Utilizing our proprietary, satellite telemetry-based reporting system, which is included on most of our equipment, we remotely monitor, in real time, whether our services are being continuously provided at our domestic customer well sites.
As owner of the equipment, we are obligated to pay ad valorem taxes levied on the equipment and related insurance expenses, and we do not seek reimbursement for such taxes and expenses from our service agreement customers.
Equipment and Parts Sales

We fabricate and sell natural gas compressor packages for various applications, including: gas gathering, gas lift, carbon dioxide injection, wellhead compression, gas storage, refrigeration plant compression, gas processing, pressure maintenance, pipeline transmission, vapor recovery, pipeline station optimization, gas transmission, fuel gas boosters, and coal bed methane systems.
 Aftermarket Business
Through our aftermarket operations, we provide a wide range of services to support the needs of customers who own compression equipment. The services provided are primarily operation, maintenance, overhaul and reconfiguration services, which may be provided under turnkey engineering, procurement and construction contracts. We also sell engine parts, compressor package parts and other parts manufactured by third parties that are utilized in natural gas compressor packages. We have factory- and internally trained technicians in most of the major oil and natural gas producing basins in the United States to perform these services.
Compressor Package Fabrication Facilities and Sources of Raw Materials

At our fabrication facility in Midland, Texas, we design and fabricate natural gas reciprocating and rotary compressor packages up to 8,000 horsepower, including both standard field compression equipment meeting industry standards and specially engineered compression equipment designed for unique customer specifications. We internally fabricate skids, pressure vessels built to American Society of Mechanical Engineers code, and piping systems and integrate them with engines, compressors and other components obtained from third-party suppliers. The compressor packages are used in our services business and they are sold to major and independent oil and natural gas exploration and production companies as well as midstream processing and transmission companies. We design, engineer, fabricate and market high-quality gas compressor packages that have a superior reputation in the industry as evidenced by occasional sales to competitive fleets and to end users who have their own compressor package fabrication capabilities.
A majority of the components we use to fabricate compressor packages are obtained from third-party suppliers. These components represent a significant portion of the cost of the compressor packages. Some of the components used in the assembly of our compressor packages are obtained from a single supplier or a limited group of suppliers. Typical contracts with these suppliers are for a period of twelve months. Should we experience a lack of availability of the components we use to fabricate our packages and systems, we believe that there are adequate, alternative suppliers and that any impact would not be severe, although short-term disruptions could be material. We occasionally experience long lead times for components from suppliers and, therefore, at times make purchases in anticipation of future orders.
Market Overview and Competition

Our operations are significantly dependent upon the demand for, and production of, oil and natural gas in the various domestic and international markets in which we operate. Beginning in 2014 and continuing throughout most of 2016, reduced prices of oil and natural gas led to declines in our customers' capital expenditure levels in the domestic and international markets in which we operate. The decline in activity in the oil and natural gas exploration and production industry resulted in reduced demand for our products and services compared to early 2014 levels. Despite recent volatility in oil and gas prices, we are seeing strong indicators of continued improving demand for our products and services.

Customers

We provide services to a broad base of natural gas and oil exploration and production, midstream, pipeline transmission, and storage companies operating throughout many of the onshore producing regions of the United States. We also have operations in Latin America and certain other foreign regions. While most of our domestic services are performed throughout Texas, the San Juan Basin, the Rocky Mountain region, and the Mid-Continent region of the United States, we also have a presence in other U.S. producing regions. We continue to seek opportunities to further expand our operations into other regions in the U.S. and elsewhere in the world.
 Our service contracts are generally terminable upon thirty days’ notice after the primary term has expired. Although we enter into short-term contracts, many of our largest customers have been with us for over five years. Our most significant customer for the year ended December 31, 2018 was Targa Resources, which accounted for approximately 15% of our consolidated revenues for the year. Other significant customers include various major integrated oil companies, public and private independent exploration and production companies and midstream companies, none of which individually accounted for more than 10% of our consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2018. The loss of any of our major customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and our ability to make cash distributions to our unitholders.
Competition

The natural gas compression services and compressor package fabrication and sale businesses are highly competitive. We experience competition from companies that may be able to more quickly adapt to changes within our industry and changes in economic conditions as a whole, more readily take advantage of available opportunities, and adopt more aggressive pricing policies. Primary competition for our low-horsepower compression services business comes from smaller local and regional companies that utilize packages consisting of a screw or reciprocating compressor with a separate engine driver. These local and regional competitors tend to compete with us on the basis of price, as opposed to our focus on providing production enhancement value to the customer. Competition for our medium- and high-horsepower compression services business comes primarily from large companies that may have greater financial resources than ours. Such competitors include ArchRock, Kodiak Gas Services, and USA Compression. Our competition in the standard compressor package fabrication and sale markets includes several large companies and a large number of small, regional fabricators, including some of those with whom we also compete for compression services, including Enerflex, Exterran and others. Our competition in the custom-designed market usually consists of larger companies with the ability to provide integrated projects and product support after the sale, including some of the competitors noted above. The ability to fabricate these large custom-designed packages at our facilities near the point of end-use of many customers is often a competitive advantage.

Many of our compression services competitors compete on the basis of price. We believe our pricing has proven to be competitive because of the significant increases in the value that results from use of our services, our customer service, trained field personnel, and the quality of the compressor packages we use to provide our services.
Other Business Matters

Marketing

We utilize various marketing strategies to promote our services and compressor package products. Our account managers attempt to build close working relationships with our existing and potential customers to educate them about our services and products by scheduling personal visits, hosting and attending workshops, tradeshows and conferences, and participating in industry organizations. We sponsor and make presentations at industry events that are targeted to production managers, compression specialists and other decision makers. Our marketing representatives also use these marketing opportunities to promote our value-added service initiatives, such as the use of our proprietary satellite telemetry-based system, our wellsite optimization program and our call center.

Backlog

Our equipment and parts sales business consists of the fabrication and sale of standard compressor packages and custom-designed compressor packages. Our custom-designed packages are typically greater in size and complexity than standard fabrication packages, requiring more labor, materials, and overhead resources. This business requires diligent planning of those resources and project and backlog management in order to meet the customer's desired delivery dates and performance criteria, and achieve fabrication efficiencies. As of December 31, 2018, our equipment sales backlog was $105.2 million, compared to $47.5 million as of December 31, 2017, all of which is expected to be recognized in the year ended December 31, 2019. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we received cumulative orders of $188.2 million for new compressor packages. We also reached our highest backlog since 2014 and received the largest single order of new compressor equipment in our history, for approximately $67.0 million. Our new equipment sales backlog consists of firm customer orders for which a purchase or work order has been received, satisfactory credit or financing arrangements exist, and delivery has been scheduled. Our new equipment sales backlog is a measure of marketing effectiveness that allows us to plan future labor and raw material needs and measure our success in winning bids from our customers.
Employees

As of December 31, 2018, our general partner and certain of our subsidiaries had approximately 750 full-time employees who provide services to conduct our operations. Our general partner’s U.S. employees and our employees in Canada are not subject to collective bargaining agreements. Under our Omnibus Agreement with TETRA, certain employees of TETRA and its affiliates also provide services to our general partner, us and our subsidiaries, and we reimburse TETRA for these services. Our employees in Argentina and Mexico are subject to a collective bargaining agreement. The employees of TETRA who provide services to us in Argentina and Mexico are subject to numerous collective labor agreements. We believe that the various employers of these employees have good relations with these employees and we have not experienced work stoppages in the past.
Proprietary Technology and Trademarks

It is our practice to enter into confidentiality agreements with employees, consultants, and third parties to whom we disclose our confidential and proprietary information. There can be no assurance, however, that these measures will prevent the unauthorized disclosure or use of our trade secrets and expertise or that others may not independently develop similar trade secrets or expertise. Our management believes, however, that it would require a substantial period of time and substantial resources to independently develop similar know-how or technology.

We sell various services and products under a variety of trademarks and service marks, some of which are registered in the United States.

Health, Safety, and Environmental Affairs Regulations
We believe that our service and sales operations and fabricating plants are in substantial compliance with all applicable U.S. and foreign health, safety, and environmental laws and regulations. We are committed to conducting all of our operations under the highest standards of safety and respect for the environment. However, risks of substantial costs and liabilities are inherent in certain of our operations and in the development and handling of certain products and equipment produced or used at our plants, well locations, and worksites. Because of these risks, there can be no assurance that significant costs and liabilities will not be incurred in the future. Changes in environmental and health and safety regulations could subject us to more rigorous standards. We cannot predict the extent to which our operations may be affected by future regulatory and enforcement policies.
We are subject to numerous federal, state, and local laws and regulations governing the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to protection of human health and the environment. The primary environmental laws that impact our operations in the United States include:

• | the Clean Air Act ("CAA") and comparable state laws, and regulations thereunder, which regulate air emissions;

6


• | the Federal Water Pollution Control Act of 1972 (the "Clean Water Act") and comparable state laws, and regulations thereunder, which regulate the discharge of pollutants into regulated waters, including industrial wastewater discharges and storm water runoff;


• | the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, or (“RCRA”), and comparable state laws, and regulations, thereunder, which regulate the management and disposal of solid and hazardous waste; and


• | the federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, or (“CERCLA”), and comparable state laws, and regulations thereunder, known more commonly as “Superfund,” which impose liability for the cleanup of releases of hazardous substances in the environment.

Our operations in the United States are also subject to regulation under the Occupational Safety and Health Act ("OSHA") and comparable state laws, and regulations thereunder, which regulate the protection of the health and safety of workers.
The CAA and implementing regulations and comparable state laws and regulations regulate emissions of air pollutants from various industrial sources and also impose various monitoring and reporting requirements, including requirements related to emissions from certain stationary engines. These laws and regulations impose limits on the levels of various substances that may be emitted into the atmosphere from our compressor packages and require us to meet more stringent air emission standards and install new emission control equipment on all of our engines built after July 1, 2008. In addition, the Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA") issued regulations in April 2012 that require the reduction of emissions of volatile organic compounds, air toxins, and methane, a greenhouse gas, at certain oil and gas operations. We are not currently aware of material impacts to our operations associated with these rules.
The EPA has determined that greenhouse gases ("GHGs") present an endangerment to public health and the environment because, according to the EPA, they contribute to global warming and climate change. As a result, the EPA has begun to regulate certain sources of GHGs, including air emissions associated with oil and gas production particularly as they relate to the hydraulic fracturing of natural gas wells. In addition, the EPA has issued regulations requiring the reporting of GHG emissions from certain sources including onshore and offshore oil and natural gas production facilities and onshore oil and gas processing, transmission, storage, and distribution facilities. Reporting of GHG emissions from such facilities is required on an annual basis. The EPA’s rules relating to emissions of GHGs from large stationary sources of emissions are currently subject to a number of legal challenges, but the federal courts have thus far declined to issue any injunctions to prevent the EPA or state environmental agencies from implementing the rules. Further, Congress has considered, and almost one-half of the states have adopted, legislation that seeks to control or reduce emissions of GHGs from a wide range of sources.
The Clean Water Act and implementing regulations and comparable state laws and regulations prohibit the discharge of pollutants into regulated waters without a permit and establish limits on the levels of pollutants contained in these discharges. In addition, the Clean Water Act and other comparable laws and regulations regulate storm water discharges associated with industrial activities depending on a facility’s primary standard industrial classification. Our facilities are in compliance with these requirements, as applicable.

RCRA and implementing regulations and state laws and regulations address the management and disposal of solid and hazardous waste. These laws and regulations govern the generation, storage, treatment, transfer, and disposal of wastes including, but not limited to, used oil, antifreeze, filters, sludges, paint, solvents and sandblast materials. The EPA and various state agencies have limited the approved methods of disposal for these types of wastes. We believe we are in substantial compliance with all applicable requirements.

CERCLA and comparable state laws and regulations impose strict, joint, and several liabilities without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct on certain classes of persons that contributed to the release of a hazardous substance into the environment. These persons include the owner or operator of a disposal site where a hazardous substance release occurred and any company that transported, disposed of, or arranged for the transport or disposal of such hazardous substances released at a site. Under CERCLA, such persons may be liable for the costs of remediating the hazardous substances that have been released into the environment, for damages to natural resources and for the costs of certain health studies.

We believe that we have properly disposed of all historical waste streams and we have no outstanding liability regarding any past waste handling or spill activities; however, there is always the possibility that future spills 
7

and releases of petroleum hydrocarbons, wastes, or other regulated substances into the environment could cause us to become subject to remediation costs and liabilities under CERCLA, RCRA, or other environmental laws. The costs and liabilities associated with the future imposition of remedial obligations could have the potential for a material adverse effect on our operations or financial position.
We are subject to the requirements of OSHA and comparable state statutes. These laws and regulations strictly govern the protection of the health and safety of employees. The OSHA hazard communication standard, the EPA community right-to-know regulations under Title III of CERCLA, and similar state statutes require that we maintain and/or disclose information about hazardous materials used or produced in our operations. We believe that we are in substantial compliance with these requirements and other applicable similar laws.
Our compressor packages may be subject to additional regulatory requirements under the CAA. For example, regulations under the National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (“NESHAPS”) provisions of the CAA require control of hazardous air pollutants from new and existing stationary reciprocal internal combustion engines. Our equipment is also subject to additional prescribed maintenance practices and catalyst installation may also be required. More recently, the EPA finalized rules that establish new air emission controls under the EPA's New Source Performance Standards ("NSPS") and NESHAPS for natural gas and natural gas liquids production, processing and transportation activities. These rules establish specific requirements associated with emissions from compressors and controllers at natural gas gathering and boosting stations.
We design and fabricate our compressor packages to meet applicable customer and government regulatory health, safety, and environmental requirements. Our operations outside the United States are subject to foreign governmental laws and regulations relating to the environment, health and safety, and other regulated activities. We believe that our operations are in substantial compliance with existing foreign governmental laws and regulations.
