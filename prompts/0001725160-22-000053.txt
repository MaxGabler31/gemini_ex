Overview
We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on discovering and developing small molecule therapeutics targeting fundamental biological pathways of cancers. We use our highly efficient drug discovery engine, which we refer to as our Integrated Discovery Engine, to identify targets and develop small molecule new chemical entities, or NCEs, with properties that we believe could result in potentially differentiated product profiles. Our discovery engine combines our extensive experience and capabilities across cancer biology and medicinal chemistry. We believe our product candidates are differentiated from current programs targeting similar pathways and, if approved, have the potential to significantly impact clinical outcomes of patients with cancer.

We are developing a broad pipeline of product candidates with an initial focus on validated oncology targets with the potential to address large patient populations. We currently have two lead product candidates: ZN-c3, an inhibitor of Wee1, a protein tyrosine kinase, and ZN-c5, an oral selective estrogen receptor degrader, or SERD. Our other clinical product candidates include ZN-d5, a selective inhibitor of B-cell lymphoma 2, or BCL-2, and ZN-e4, an irreversible inhibitor of mutant epidermal growth factor receptor, or EGFR. 
ZN-c3 is currently being evaluated in multiple Phase 1/2 clinical trials for the treatment of advanced solid tumors including uterine serous carcinoma, or USC, as a monotherapy and in combination with chemotherapies in patients with advanced ovarian cancer and osteosarcoma, and in combination with PARP inhibitor in ovarian cancer. ZN-c5 is currently in Phase 1/2 clinical trials for the treatment of estrogen receptor-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative, or ER+/HER2-, advanced or metastatic breast cancer. ZN-d5 is currently in a Phase 1 clinical trial for the treatment of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, or NHL, and acute myelogenous leukemia, or AML, and ZN-e4 is currently in a Phase 1/2 clinical trial for the treatment of advanced non-small cell lung cancer, or NSCLC. 
We plan to initiate combination trials of product candidates across our pipeline in 2022, including a Phase 1/2 combination trial of ZN-d5 and ZN-c3 in acute myeloid leukemia, or AML, and a Phase 1b combination trial of ZN-c5 and ZN-c3 for the treatment of CDK4/6i resistant breast cancer. 
We currently own worldwide development and commercialization rights to each of our product candidates, other than in select Asian countries (including China) for each of ZN-c3, ZN-c5 and ZN-d5, for which we have out-licensed these rights to our joint venture, Zentera Therapeutics (Cayman), Ltd., or Zentera, and for ZN-e4, for which we have out-licensed these rights to SciClone Pharmaceuticals International (Cayman) Development Ltd., or SciClone. As of December 31, 2021, we hold a 40.3% equity interest in Zentera. 
The following table summarizes our product candidate pipeline.
(1) We are currently evaluating ZN-c5 in combination with palbociclib (Ibrance®), as part of a clinical research collaboration with Pfizer, and are evaluating ZN-c5 in combination with abemaciclib (Verzenio®), as part of clinical research collaboration with Lilly. We are evaluating ZN-c3 in combination with niraparib (ZEJULA®), as part of a clinical research collaboration with GlaxoSmithKline. We maintain full ownership of ZN-c5 and ZN-c3 in each such collaboration. SciClone has development and commercial rights to ZN-e4 in Greater China (including Macau and Hong Kong), South Korea, Taiwan and Vietnam. Our joint venture Zentera has development and commercial rights to ZN-c3, ZN-c5 and ZN-d5 in China, Macau, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Zentera received CTA acceptances in China for ZN-c3, ZN-c3 in combination, ZN-c5 and ZN-d5, and four clinical trials are ongoing. As of December 31, 2021, we hold a 40.3% equity interest in Zentera.
ZN-c3 (Wee1 Inhibitor)
ZN-c3 is currently being evaluated in multiple ongoing clinical trials, including a Phase 2 monotherapy clinical trial for the treatment of women with recurrent or persistent uterine serous carcinoma, or USC. The study was initiated following an end-of-Phase 1 meeting with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, which concurred in principle with the proposal that ZN-c3 has the potential for an accelerated approval pathway based on the proposed global study design. The FDA granted Fast Track designation in November 2021 to ZN-c3 for the treatment of patients with advanced metastatic uterine serous carcinoma who have received at least one prior platinum--based chemotherapy regimen.
In addition, ZN-c3 in combination with chemotherapy has received orphan drug designation and rare pediatric disease designation from the FDA for osteosarcoma. We initiated a Phase 1/2 clinical trial of ZN-c3 in combination with chemotherapy in pediatric and adult patients with osteosarcoma during the third quarter of 2021. We expect to report initial results from this trial in the second half of 2022. If ZN-c3 were to obtain approval for the designated indication, we believe it may be eligible for a rare pediatric disease priority voucher upon approval.
ZN-c3 is also being evaluated in an ongoing Phase 1/2 clinical trial for the treatment of advanced solid tumors as a monotherapy and in an ongoing Phase 1b clinical trial in combination with chemotherapy in patients with platinum resistant ovarian cancer.
In the fourth quarter of 2021, we initiated a Phase 2 monotherapy trial for a tumor agnostic, predictive biomarker, subject to FDA feedback. We also initiated a Phase 1/2 clinical trial evaluating ZN-c3 in combination with GlaxoSmithKline’s PARP inhibitor niraparib (ZEJULA®), as part of a clinical research collaboration in ovarian cancer. We also announced plans to initiate a Phase 1/2 combination trial of ZN-d5 + ZN-c3 in AML and a Phase 1b combination trial of ZN-c5 and ZN-c3 in CDK4/6i resistant breast cancer in 2022.
We have agreed to support two planned additional investigator-initiated trials of ZN-c3 that we expect to initiate in 2022: a trial with the Ivy Brain Center in glioblastoma multiforme and a trial in combination with immunotherapy with Dana Farber in triple negative breast cancer.
ZN-c5 (Oral SERD)
In the ongoing Phase 1/2 clinical trial evaluating ZN-c5 in combination with Pfizer’s CDK4/6 palbociclib, and the
Phase 1b clinical trial evaluating ZN-c5 in combination with Lilly’s CDK4/6 abemaciclib, the safety and tolerability data suggested ZN-c5 has the potential to be a promising candidate for further evaluation in combinations. We continue to enroll patients in the two separate combination trials and expect to report initial results in the first half of 2022. In the fourth quarter of 2021, we announced our plans to initiate a Phase 1b combination of ZN-c5 and ZN-c3 in CDK4/6i resistant breast cancer in 2022.
ZN-d5 (BCL-2 Inhibitor)
The ongoing Phase 1 monotherapy dose escalation trial for ZN-d5 is enrolling patients with relapsed/refractory Non-Hodgkin’s Lymphoma and additionally began enrolling patients with AML in the third quarter of 2021. We reported initial results from this Phase 1 trial in the fourth quarter of 2021. We also announced plans to initiate a Phase 1/2 combination trial of ZN-d5 and ZN-c3 in AML in 2022.
ZN-e4 (EGFR Inhibitor)
The ongoing Phase 1/2 dose escalation trial for ZN-e4 in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is enrolling both osimertinib-naïve and experienced patients. We plan to report results from the Phase 1/2 trial in 2022.
BCL-xL Heterobifunctional Degrader
We are developing BCL-xL heterobifunctional degraders based on E3 ligases not expressed in platelets, allowing for the avoidance of dose-limiting thrombocytopenia associated with BCL-xL inhibitors. We believe that our Discovery efforts to select a BCL-xL degrader will lead to an attractive candidate for evaluation as monotherapy and in combination with other therapies, such as ZN-d5 and ZN-c3, for the treatment of hematological and solid malignancies.
Integrated Discovery Engine
We are also currently advancing multiple small molecule programs in preclinical development for other cancer indications, including select solid tumors and hematological malignancies.
Our Integrated Discovery Engine has enabled us to take each of our clinical-stage product candidates from initial discovery to IND submission in less than three years in a capital efficient manner. We begin our process of drug discovery by identifying fundamental biological pathways of cancers based upon a number of factors, including validation of the pathway through prior clinical outcomes and ability to impact large patient populations. We then analyze existing marketed products and compounds in development that target these cancer pathways and assess their limitations, efficacy, safety, tolerability, PK, patient convenience and potential to be used in combination with other therapies. Next, we use our medicinal chemistry expertise and extensive understanding of target-drug structure activity to design proprietary NCEs with properties that we believe can address observed limitations and suboptimal drug characteristics of marketed products or other compounds in development, including potency, solubility, route of administration and PK properties. 
We believe overcoming these limitations may also allow us to develop these product candidates for use in combination with other therapies, including with our internally-developed product candidates, if approved. Finally, we strive to generate preclinical data to support that such candidates could have a differentiated product profile in our expected lead indications before advancing a compound into clinical development. We have used our Integrated Discovery Engine to generate a pipeline of four product candidates targeting solid tumors and hematological malignancies. Longer term, we believe our discovery engine has the potential to generate product candidates addressing a wide range of additional therapeutic areas.
Pursuant to a collaboration and license agreement entered into in May 2020, we collaborate with our joint venture Zentera on the development and commercialization of ZN-c3, ZN-c5 and ZN-d5 in China, Macau, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Zentera received clinical trial application, or CTA, acceptances in China for ZN-c3, ZN-c3 in combination, ZN-c5 and ZN-d5, and four clinical trials are ongoing. 
Strategy
Our goal is to become a leading oncology-focused biopharmaceutical company. Our strategy includes the following key components:

•Discover and develop differentiated small molecule NCEs that address large patient populations with cancer. 
•Rapidly advance the development of our lead product candidates, ZN-c3 (Wee1 Inhibitor) and ZN-c5 (oral SERD), toward regulatory approval. 
•Advance our additional product candidates, ZN-d5 (BCL-2 Inhibitor) and ZN-e4 (EGFR Inhibitor), across multiple cancer indications. 
•Continue to evaluate our product candidate pipeline in combination with internally discovered and third-party compounds. 
•Deploy our highly efficient Integrated Discovery Engine to further expand our product candidate pipeline. 
•Evaluate strategic opportunities to accelerate development timelines and maximize the value of our product candidate pipeline. 
Our Zentalis Approach
We have leveraged our extensive industry experience and know-how, and the guidance of our scientific advisory board, to build our Integrated Discovery Engine that integrates our extensive capabilities across cancer biology and medicinal chemistry. This engine enables us to identify targets for which small molecule NCEs with high potency, high exposure and other optimized drug properties could yield potentially differentiated product profiles. Our approach centers on utilizing our Integrated Discovery Engine with functional screens, preclinical models, machine learning and chemistry, to identify such targets and subsequently develop product candidates with translational science to support ongoing clinical programs that address targets with large cancer patient populations. 
Our Integrated Discovery Engine is executed through the following process:

•First, identify fundamental biological pathways of cancers, considering a number of factors, including prior clinical outcomes, input from our scientific and business advisory boards, large unmet medical need and market opportunity.
•Second, identify and analyze key products or compounds targeting these cancer pathways and assess their limitations, including with respect to efficacy, safety, tolerability, PK, patient convenience and their potential to be used in combination.
•Third, use our medicinal chemistry expertise and deep understanding of target-drug structure activity relationships to create proprietary NCEs that are designed to improve upon and address observed limitations of existing products or compounds.
•Fourth, generate strong preclinical data to support our view that such candidates could have potentially differentiated product profiles in our expected lead indications, if approved, before moving a compound into clinical development.
We have initially chosen to focus on targets that have been validated clinically and, in most cases, commercially. This provides us with a clear understanding of the indications we will target and endpoints that have been required for regulatory approval of products for these indications in the past, as well as the potential for clinical adoption and commercial success. This strategy has enabled us to begin our drug discovery and development process at an advanced state relative to where the process would otherwise begin in focusing on uncharacterized targets. We believe this ability provides us with an efficient path to identifying novel drug compounds and advancing them into clinical development in a capital efficient manner.
Our Product Candidates 
ZN-c3, an Inhibitor of Wee1 for the Treatment of Solid Tumors and Other Cancers 
Overview 
We are developing ZN-c3, an oral, small molecule DNA damage response product candidate, targeting Wee1 in cancer. The inhibition of Wee1, a protein tyrosine kinase, aims to generate sufficient DNA damage in cancer cells to undergo apoptosis, thereby preventing tumor growth and potentially causing tumor regression. There is currently no FDA-approved Wee1 inhibitor, and AstraZeneca’s adavosertib (AZD1775) is currently one of few other Wee1 inhibitors in clinical development of which we are aware. Despite the observed efficacy of adavosertib in clinical trials, we believe its narrow therapeutic window is a potential limitation affecting its dosing in monotherapy and in combination. We have applied our expertise to design ZN-c3 to have such solubility, selectivity and PK properties that we believe may provide a broad therapeutic window and which, if ZN-c3 is approved, may constitute a differentiated product profile. We believe ZN-c3, if approved, may have broad applicability in a wide range of cancers both as monotherapy and in combination, including with chemotherapy agents, PARP inhibitors and other targeted therapies. 
ZN-c3 is currently being evaluated in multiple ongoing clinical trials, including a Phase 2 monotherapy clinical trial for the treatment of women with recurrent or persistent uterine serous carcinoma, or USC. The study was initiated following an end-of-Phase 1 meeting with the FDA, which concurred in principle with the proposal that ZN-c3 has the potential for an accelerated approval pathway based on the proposed global study design. The FDA granted Fast Track designation in November 2021 to ZN-c3 for the treatment of recurrent or persistent USC in adult women. We expect to report an initial enrollment/safety update from this trial in the second half of 2022.
In addition, ZN-c3 in combination with chemotherapy has received orphan drug designation and rare pediatric disease designation from the FDA for pediatric osteosarcoma. We initiated a Phase 1/2 clinical trial of ZN-c3 in combination with chemotherapy in pediatric and adult patients with osteosarcoma during the third quarter of 2021. We expect to report initial results from this trial in the second half of 2022. If ZN-c3 were to obtain approval for the designated indication, we believe it may be eligible for a Rare Pediatric Disease Priority Review Voucher from the FDA upon approval. 
 ZN-c3 is also being evaluated in an ongoing Phase 1/2 clinical trial for the treatment of advanced solid tumors as a monotherapy and in an ongoing Phase 1b clinical trial in combination with chemotherapy in patients with platinum resistant ovarian cancer. 
In the fourth quarter of 2021, we initiated a Phase 2 monotherapy trial for a tumor agnostic, predictive biomarker, subject to FDA feedback. This Phase 2 tumor agnostic trial planned with registrational intent is investigating ZN-c3 in patients with solid tumors that express the identified predictive biomarker. We also initiated a Phase 1/2 clinical trial evaluating ZN-c3 in combination with GlaxoSmithKline’s PARP inhibitor niraparib (ZEJULA®), as part of a clinical research collaboration in ovarian cancer. We also announced plans to initiate a Phase 1/2 combination trial of ZN-d5 and ZN-c3 in AML and a Phase 1b combination trial of ZN-c5 and ZN-c3 in CDK4/6i resistant breast cancer in 2022.
ZN-c3 Clinical Program Summary 
Background on DNA Damage Repair and Wee1 Inhibitors 
The underlying principle behind a number of cancer therapies is to generate sufficient DNA damage in cancer cells, many of which already have deficiencies in DNA damage response, to cause them to undergo apoptosis. Examples of these therapies include alkylating agents, DNA-binding drugs and the use of radiation. However, cancer cells have developed multiple mechanisms of resistance to these therapies, thereby potentially limiting their therapeutic efficacy. 
The regulation of DNA damage response mechanisms in cancer cells may therefore play a crucial role in the induction of apoptosis and the ultimate efficacy of DNA damaging cancer therapies. This is particularly true in cancers with specific 
mutations in DNA repair proteins that prevent efficient DNA damage response and repair, rendering them particularly vulnerable to any agent that further inhibits the ability of cells to repair DNA damage. 
Examples of such cancers are those with mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2. Inhibitors of PARP, an independent DNA repair protein, work to prevent DNA damage repair, and are FDA approved for the treatment of multiple cancers, such as breast and ovarian cancers associated with BRCA1 and BCRA2 mutations. Sales of FDA-approved PARP inhibitors were approximately $1.6 billion in 2019 and are expected to grow to $6.9 billion in 2026. 
Similar to PARP, Wee1 plays a role in cellular regulation and repair, allowing cells with DNA damage to repair and survive. Wee1 is a protein tyrosine kinase that mediates cell cycle arrest by regulating the phosphorylation of cyclin-dependent kinase 1, or CDK1. Inhibition of Wee1 causes dysregulation of DNA replication and inability of DNA response processes to act, leading to an increase in double-strand DNA breaks and subsequently inducing apoptosis. Based on these similar mechanisms of action, we believe the use of Wee1 and PARP, both DNA damage response agents, in combination can have a synergistic effect. In third-party preclinical studies, the combination of PARP and Wee1 has been observed to result in improved anti-tumor activity as compared to the use of each as monotherapy. However, both of these compounds have been associated with bone marrow toxicity, which may limit their concomitant administration. 
Wee1 Inhibitor in Clinical Development and Limitations 
One of few other Wee1 inhibitors currently in clinical development of which we are aware is adavosertib. Adavosertib has been the subject of many publications in the scientific literature and has been explored in numerous clinical trials across multiple tumor types. Adavosertib is currently being evaluated by third parties in Phase 1 and 2 clinical trials in ovarian cancer and a variety of other solid tumors, both as monotherapy and in combination with other cancer therapies. In earlier third-party clinical trials, multiple patients with advanced or metastatic tumors for whom no standard therapy was available achieved partial responses when dosed with adavosertib in combination with chemotherapy agents. For example, in a Phase 2 clinical trial in 24 patients (21 of such patients were evaluable for efficacy) with relapsed ovarian cancer, the combination of adavosertib and carboplatin, an FDA-approved chemotherapy, demonstrated an overall response rate, or ORR, of 43% and one patient exhibited a complete response, or CR, lasting over 42 months. 
In addition, in a recent Phase 2 clinical trial in patients with recurrent USC, an aggressive subtype of endometrial carcinoma characterized by TP53 mutations, adavosertib administered as monotherapy demonstrated an ORR of 30%. 
Further, in a recent Phase 1 clinical trial in patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer, adavosertib in combination with gemcitabine, an FDA-approved chemotherapy, and radiation resulted in a median overall survival of 21.7 months. This overall survival was substantially longer than the 11.9 to 13.6 months observed in a prior clinical trial with a similar population of patients combining gemcitabine with or without erlotinib with radiation. 
Although adavosertib has demonstrated promising efficacy in clinical trials, we believe adavosertib has a narrow therapeutic window, a potential limitation affecting its dosing as monotherapy and in combination. Furthermore, the use of adavosertib in combination with PARP inhibitors in preclinical studies has demonstrated increased bone marrow toxicities, thereby potentially limiting its use in continuous dosing. We believe adavosertib has a number of characteristics that could be improved upon, including selectivity, solubility, PK properties and tumor concentration. 
Our Wee1 Solution: ZN-c3 
ZN-c3 is our oral Wee1 inhibitor product candidate that we are currently evaluating for the treatment of advanced solid tumors in an ongoing Phase 1/2 clinical trial. We believe ZN-c3 has the potential to provide a wide therapeutic window due to the following observed clinical and preclinical results: 
•Potency, selectivity and solubility. In our preclinical studies, ZN-c3 produced favorable absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion, or ADME, results. In our in vitro preclinical studies, we observed ZN-c3’s potency in inhibiting tumor growth and inducing apoptosis through DNA damage, and ZN-c3 has shown high selectivity for Wee1. In addition, in a series of repeat preclinical studies assessing the solubility of ZN-c3 and adavosertib utilizing a standard in vitro assay and uniform controls, ZN-c3 demonstrated solubility of 2,132,000 nM, approximately 35 times greater than that of adavosertib, which we believe could reduce inter-patient drug exposure variability and limit the toxicity observed in clinical trials of adavosertib. 
•Preclinical anti-tumor activity. In head-to-head preclinical studies, ZN-c3 showed anti-tumor activity across a number of cell lines, as well as superior tumor growth inhibition, DNA damage and apoptosis when compared to adavosertib. 
Anti-tumor activity was observed in both continuous and intermittent dosing, as well as in the shorter of the dosing periods evaluated. 
•PK properties. In our preclinical studies, ZN-c3 showed PK properties that resulted in high drug exposure in animal models. We believe this level of drug exposure may contribute to the observed sustained and lengthy tumor growth inhibition, which may necessitate lower dose intensity thereby potentially affording a wide therapeutic window. In addition, we observed that ZN-c3 had favorable drug accumulation in tumors. 
•Well tolerated in preclinical studies and clinical trials. In preclinical studies and clinical trials to date, ZN-c3 was observed to be well tolerated across varying dosage levels. 
In addition to having a potentially wide therapeutic window, we believe the characteristics of ZN-c3 may allow patients with aggressive solid tumors to be treated with sequential therapy using mechanism of action synergistic multiple agents, including PARP inhibitors. In a third-party preclinical combination study with PARP inhibitors, sequential dosing resulted in favorable tolerability as compared to continuous dosing, while maintaining strong anti-tumor activity. 

Preclinical Results
Potency Across Variety of Solid Tumor Cell Lines 
We assessed the potency of ZN-c3 and adavosertib (AZD1775) in repeat in vitro preclinical studies across a variety of solid tumor cell lines, as shown in the table below. We observed ZN-c3’s potency in inhibiting tumor growth and inducing DNA damage and apoptosis in each of the solid tumor cell lines studied.

Selectivity of ZN-c3 in Kinase Screening Panel 
In our head-to-head in vitro preclinical studies, we assessed the selectivity of ZN-c3, alongside adavosertib. The selectivity profile of each of ZN-c3 (right) and adavosertib (left) was characterized against a broad kinase panel for Wee1 consisting of 485 mammalian serine/threonine and tyrosine, as depicted by the respective kinase dendograms below. ZN-c3 and adavosertib were tested at a single concentration to determine the percentage inhibition at 1 μM. ZN-c3 was observed to have higher selectivity relative to that of adavosertib as depicted by the overall fewer kinases being affected in the ZN-c3 dendogram.

Solubility of ZN-c3 
We assessed the relative ADME properties and solubility of ZN-c3 and a proxy chemical compound of adavosertib in a series of repeat preclinical studies. ZN-c3 showed targeted ADME properties, and demonstrated solubility of 2,132 µM, approximately 35 times greater than the 60 µM observed with adavosertib in repeat preclinical studies. We believe greater solubility may reduce interpatient variability, and in turn limit toxicities for ZN-c3. 
Anti-Tumor Activity in Human Lung Cancer Model 
In a preclinical study, we assessed the anti-tumor potential of ZN-c3 alongside adavosertib, each as a monotherapy, in a lung cancer model using human A-427 cells that contained a KRAS mutation. In this model, doses of 40 mg/kg or 80 mg/kg of ZN-c3 demonstrated tumor shrinkage that was evident at the first post-treatment observation at four days and continued through the end of the experiment. Across dose levels there was no statistical difference between ZN-c3 and adavosertib and each compound produced tumor regression. ZN-c3 was observed to be well tolerated across all doses.

Anti-Tumor Activity in Lung Cancer Model Across Varying Dosage Levels and Intermittent Dosing Regimen 
We have explored various dosing regimens of ZN-c3 in preclinical studies. A loading dose of 120 mg/kg daily for seven days followed by once-daily dosing of 100 mg/kg resulted in ten out of ten treated mice being tumor free after five weeks. We also explored the potential of shorter dosing periods or intermittent dosing of ZN-c3 in preclinical studies. A loading dose of 120 mg/kg for five days followed by two days off drug followed by five weeks of 100 mg/kg given five days on, two days off resulted in seven out of ten mice being tumor free as shown in the graph below. A loading dose of 120 mg/kg for seven days followed by seven days off drug followed by two cycles of seven days on 100 mg/kg drug and seven days off drug resulted in five out of ten mice being tumor free as shown in the graph below. 
We also assessed the potential of utilizing an intermittent dosing regimen with ZN-c3 alongside that of adavosertib in a preclinical study. Dosing of ZN-c3 by using a loading dose of 120 mg/kg for four days followed by three days off drug followed by five weeks of 100 mg/kg given four days on, three days off resulted in more prolonged tumor growth delay than that observed with adavosertib at the same dosing regimen. 
PK Data Comparison in Animal Models
We assessed the PK properties of ZN-c3 and adavosertib in repeat preclinical animal models, as shown in the table below. For each of the preclinical studies, we observed the respective Cmax, Tmax, AUC and tumor concentration of each compound at doses of 20, 40 and 80 mg/kg/day. Administration of ZN-c3 was observed to result in high drug exposure in animal models and the selective accumulation of ZN-c3 to high levels in tumors. We believe this increased drug exposure may cause the inhibition of Wee1 at low doses, potentially affording a wide therapeutic window.

The anti-tumor activity of ZN-c3 alone and in combination with the KRASG12C inhibitor sotorasib was assessed in the preclinical colon cancer SW837 model. The SW837 model contains a KRASG12C mutation. ZN-c3 was dosed at 60 mg/kg QD, po; Sotorasib was dosed at 30 mg/kg, QD, po and the combination of ZN-c3 and sotorasib was dosed following the same dosing schedule for each single agent, respectively. The combination treatment resulted in better anti-tumor effect than each monotherapy treatment (ZN-c3 and KRASG12C) alone.
Toxicology Results
ZN-c3 was evaluated in 28-day repeat dose toxicology studies. Results of these studies showed many of the toxicities associated with other Wee1 inhibitors in development, including those reported for adavosertib.
ZN-c3 Interim Clinical Results
On June 28, 2021, we announced clinical and regulatory updates across our pipeline of product candidates, including new interim clinical data from the Phase 1 clinical trial of ZN-c3. Interim data results from the Phase 1 monotherapy trial of ZN-c3 as of a data cut-off date of May 15, 2021 are as follows:
Two unconfirmed Partial Responses, or PRs, previously reported at AACR were confirmed, bringing the total number of confirmed PRs from the ongoing Phase 1 monotherapy trial from three to five. Since reporting initial clinical data at AACR, an additional unconfirmed PR was reported in a patient with USC, resulting in three out of seven USC patients evaluable having responded to treatment. Overall, the objective response rate, or ORR, increased from 40% to 43% based on RECIST criteria. Clinical results were seen across four different tumor types, signaling potential for broad oncology application.
Within the exceptional responder population of the ongoing Phase 1 monotherapy trial, in a patient with an ongoing treatment duration of more than eight months, the Company observed a deepening response of 65% to 69% tumor size decrease based on RECIST criteria. In addition, as of a data cut-off date of May 14, 2021, ZN-c3 was observed to be well-tolerated, with a lower overall rate of severe hematological adverse events relative to the rate previously reported at AACR with respect to the previous data cut-off date of February 12, 2021. The rate of treatment related white blood cell count decrease, or neutropenia, decreased to 2.2% as of the May 14, 2021 data cut-off date from 3.6% as of the February 12, 2021 data cut-off date.

Safety Results
As of the May 14, 2021 database cutoff, in the ongoing ZN-c3 Phase 1/2 trial in advanced solid tumors, a total of 66 patients were enrolled and had data available in the electronic data capture system. Patients were treated at the following dose levels: 21 at ≤ 200 mg/day, 18 at 300 mg/day and 27 at ≥ 350 mg/day. Enrollment in the Phase 1, monotherapy, dose-escalation portion of this trial was concluded; the maximum tolerated dose, or MTD, was determined to be 350 mg once daily, or QD, and the Recommended Phase 2 dose, or RP2D, was determined to be 300 mg QD. The dose expansion portion of this trial is ongoing.
As of the May 14, 2021, database cutoff in the ongoing Phase 1/2 trial in advanced solid tumors we reported on June 28, 2021, Treatment-emergent adverse events, or TEAEs, and Investigator assessed treatment-related adverse events, or TRAEs, in 65 of 66 and 58 out of 66 patients, respectively, at dose levels from 25mg qd to 450mg qd. Most AEs were of grade 1 and 2, and grade 3 and grade 4 events were of single digit percentage points.
ZN-c3 Pharmacokinetics Results
Following oral administration to cancer patients on the empty stomach, ZN-c3 was absorbed with a median Tmax of 1-4 hours. The peak plasma concentration, or Cmax, and daily exposure, or AUC0-24h, were highly variable and generally increased with escalating doses up to 300 mg. Cmax and AUC appear to reach plateau at daily doses above 300 mg. Based on available data at the RP2D 300 mg QD, the mean ZN-c3 steady-state AUC0-24h was 11,000 ng*h/mL with CV of 52%.
Pharmacodynamic data will be collected in subsequent patients and will be reported in the future.
ZN-c5, an Oral SERD for the Treatment of ER+/HER2- Breast Cancer
Overview 
We are developing ZN-c5, an oral, small molecule product candidate targeting the estrogen receptor, or ER, a key driver of tumor growth and survival in ER+/HER2- breast cancer. These tumors are currently treated by a number of hormonal therapies; however, in contrast to most ER binders that simply block or modulate ER activity, ZN-c5 is also designed to cause degradation of the ER. As such, ZN-c5 is known as a selective ER degrader, or SERD. Fulvestrant, marketed as Faslodex® by AstraZeneca, is currently the only FDA-approved SERD. While effective, fulvestrant is limited to its FDA-approved dosing regimen of two painful 5 mL concomitant monthly intramuscular injections, thus restricting the level of ER degradation that can be induced in patients, which we believe limits its efficacy. We have applied our expertise to design ZN-c5 as an oral potent SERD with characteristics which we believe may result in a differentiated product profile. We believe ZN-c5, if approved, has the potential to be used as monotherapy and in combinations and could become the standard of care for hormonal therapy in the treatment of all lines of ER+/HER2- breast cancer.
We are currently conducting a Phase 1/2 clinical trial of ZN-c5 in patients with ER+/HER2- advanced or metastatic breast cancer. ER+/HER2- breast cancer affects approximately 70% of all breast cancer patients in the United States. We continue to enroll patients and collect data for ZN-c5 administered as monotherapy and in combination with palbociclib as part of a clinical research collaboration with Pfizer. Palbociclib, marketed as Ibrance®, is a CDK4/6 inhibitor that is FDA approved for the treatment of ER+/HER2- advanced or metastatic breast cancer in combination with hormonal therapies, such as fulvestrant. In addition, in November 2020, we initiated a Phase 1b open label, multi-center trial evaluating ZN-c5 in combination with abemaciclib in patients with ER+/HER2- advanced or metastatic breast cancer as part of a clinical research collaboration with Lilly. Abemaciclib, marketed as Verzenio®, is a CDK4/6 inhibitor that is FDA approved for the treatment of HR+/HER2- advanced or metastatic breast cancer in combination with fulvestrant, aromatase inhibitors or as a single agent in certain patients with disease progression following treatment with prior endocrine therapy or chemotherapy regimens. We maintain full ownership of ZN-c5 in each collaboration. 
We intend to initiate a Phase 1b combination trial of ZN-c5 and ZN-c3 in CDK4/6i resistant breast cancer in 2022. 
Background on Breast Cancer and Current Treatments 
Breast cancer is the most prevalent cancer in women, accounting for 30% of all female cancers and 13% of cancer-related deaths in the United States. The National Cancer Institute estimated that approximately 275,000 new cases of breast cancer would be diagnosed in the United States in 2020, and approximately 42,000 breast cancer patients would die of the disease.
Most breast cancer tumor growth is dependent on two main protein receptors: estrogen receptor and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2. Approximately 70% of breast cancers in the United States are ER+/HER2-, meaning that they express ER and not HER2, and therefore depend on estrogen signaling for tumor growth and survival. These ER+ tumors are sometimes referred to as hormone receptor positive, or HR+ tumors, and are currently treated using several approaches:
•by blocking receptor function with selective ER modulators, or SERMs;
•by blocking the synthesis of hormones, such as estrogen, with aromatase inhibitors, or AIs; or
•by degrading, and thus potentially eliminating ER receptors with a drug in the SERD class.
AIs have demonstrated superior clinical benefit to SERMs, including tamoxifen, and SERDs have demonstrated superior clinical benefit to AIs.
FDA-Approved SERD, Fulvestrant and its Limitations
Currently, fulvestrant is the only FDA-approved SERD. Fulvestrant, marketed as Faslodex® by AstraZeneca, is FDA-approved for first and second-line treatment for women with HR+/HER2- advanced breast cancer both as monotherapy and as combination therapy with a number of other drug classes. Fulvestrant has demonstrated improved efficacy relative to AIs. In a randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in treatment of naïve advanced and metastatic breast cancer patients, treatment with 500 mg of fulvestrant resulted in median progression free survival, or PFS, of 16.6 months versus 13.8 months for anastrozole, an FDA-approved oral AI marketed as Arimidex® by ANI Pharmaceuticals. However, fulvestrant has a number of pharmacological characteristics that require it to be delivered via two painful 5 mL concomitant monthly intramuscular injections, which we believe may limit its efficacy and tolerability. Despite these limitations, AstraZeneca reported worldwide sales of Faslodex® of over $1.0 billion in 2018, the last year prior to generic competition.
Our SERD Solution: ZN-c5
We believe a conveniently administered oral SERD with superior efficacy could be indicated for monotherapy or in combinations and could become the standard of care for hormonal therapy in the treatment of all lines of ER+/HER2- breast cancer.
ZN-c5 is our oral SERD product candidate, which we believe has the potential to overcome limitations of existing hormonal therapies in the treatment of ER+/HER2- breast cancer due to the following observed preclinical and clinical results:
•Potency and Selectivity. In our in vitro preclinical studies, we observed the potency of ZN-c5 as measured by proliferation inhibition and degradation of ERα, and that the combination of ZN-c5 and palbociclib was associated with meaningful shrinkage in MCF-7 tumors. In addition, ZN-c5 has exhibited no agonist effect on uterus in animal models which, if present, may compromise its anti-tumor activity. 
•Preclinical anti-tumor activity. In preclinical studies, ZN-c5 demonstrated anti-tumor activity in multiple breast cancer xenograft models in mice, both as monotherapy and in combination with CDK4/6 inhibitors and PI3Ka inhibitors, as well as superior tumor growth inhibition when compared to fulvestrant. In addition, in preclinical studies ZN-c5 administered in combination with BCL-2 inhibitors, including our BCL-2 inhibitor product candidate, ZN-d5, demonstrated increased anti-tumor activity as compared to ZN-c5 as monotherapy.
•Preliminary Clinical Activity. As of the database cutoff date of September 15, 2021, two patients in the Phase 1, monotherapy dose expansion portion of the Phase 1/2 trial, one each at the 150 mg/day and 300 mg/day dose levels, had met the definition of a confirmed partial response, or PR, per RECISTv1.1 criteria. In addition, as of such date, the clinical benefit rate (CBR = PR + SD ≥ 24 weeks) was 38%.
•PK characteristics. In preclinical and clinical studies to date, oral dosing of ZN-c5 has shown high exposure levels.
•Tolerability profile. In preclinical studies, ZN-c5 was well tolerated in one-month repeat dose toxicology studies. In addition, based on results from our Phase 1/2 clinical trial as of the database cutoff date of September 15, 2021, no dose-limiting toxicities have been reported.
•Safety profile. In clinical studies to date, ZN-c5 has demonstrated a favorable tolerability profile, which we believe may be an important differentiating factor for patients who require longer term dosing, particularly patients with earlier stage disease. 
•Convenience of administration. ZN-c5 was designed to be a once-daily oral drug. If approved, we believe this would provide patient convenience and the potential for an all oral dosing regimen as monotherapy and in combination with CDK4/6 inhibitors and other oral targeted therapies.
In our Phase 1/2 clinical trial, we are evaluating the potential of ZN-c5 as monotherapy and in combination with palbociclib, a CDK4/6 inhibitor, as part of a clinical development collaboration with Pfizer. In addition, we initiated a Phase 1b clinical trial evaluating ZN-c5 in combination with abemaciclib as part of a clinical collaboration with Lilly in November 2020, and we plan to initiate a Phase 1b clinical trial evaluating ZN-c5 in combination with ZN-c3 in CDK4/6i resistant breast cancer patients in 2022.
Preclinical Results
Rationale for Combining ZN-c5 with our Wee1 Inhibitor and Anti-tumor Activity in an ER+/HER2- Breast Cancer Model
Current treatment options for ER+/HER2- breast cancer include treatment with CDK4/6 inhibitors, or CDK4/6i, as a single agent and in combination with anti-estrogen treatments, including fulvestrant. However, resistance to CDK4/6i’s frequently develops over time through a variety of proposed mechanisms, including but not limited to CDK2 activation due to CCNE1 and/or CDK2 overexpression, loss of RB1, MDM2 overexpression, and WEE1 overexpression. Many of these resistance mechanisms lead to abrogation of the G1/S cell cycle checkpoint, and thus counter the effect of CDK4/6i, i.e., cell cycle blockade at the G1/S checkpoint. Because of this, cancer cells become more reliant on the G2/M checkpoint of the cell cycle to allow for repair of any possible DNA damage before cell division. Wee1 is a tyrosine kinase that controls the G2/M checkpoint, and its inhibition by ZN-c3, our Wee1 inhibitor, leads to abrogation of the G2/M checkpoint, leading to DNA damage due to unchecked replication and apoptosis in cancer cells, thereby preventing tumor growth and potentially causing tumor regression. Interestingly, CRISPR-mediated knockout of CDK2 in cancer cells suggests that expression of CDK2 is associated with increased sensitivity to Wee1 inhibition by ZN-c3. As an example, the figure below shows that 3 different A427 lung cancer cell clones with loss of CDK2 expression, known as CDK2-sg1, 3, and 4, have reduced sensitivity to ZN-c3 in a cell proliferation assay as compared with the original cell line that expresses CDK2, or pT-01.
Taken together, these observations led us to investigate the potential for combining ZN-c5 with our Wee1 inhibitor, ZN-c3. In a preclinical study, we assessed the anti-tumor activity of ZN-c5, both as monotherapy and in combination with ZN-c3, in the ER+/HER2- T47D breast cancer xenograft model. As shown in the graph below, the combination of ZN-c5 dosed daily at 20 mg/kg plus ZN-c3 dosed daily at 80 mg/kg had greater anti-tumor activity than ZN-c5 as monotherapy. 
 ZN-c5 has bone protective effects in a mouse osteoporosis model
Loss of estrogen is associated with osteoporosis in post-menopausal women, and therefore, treatment of female breast cancer patients with a SERD may have similar effects or further aggravate this condition. In addition, patients with advanced breast cancer often suffer from osteolytic bone metastasis. For this reason, we tested our SERD, ZN-c5, in a mouse model of osteoporosis using ovariectomized mice. The schematic of the study is shown in the figure below. In brief, ovariectomized mice were treated with 10 and 20 mg/kg ZN-c5 daily for 12 weeks. Bone mineral density, BMD was measured weekly starting at week 7, and at the end of the study, femurs and tibiae were analyzed using micro computed tomography scans, or micro-CT. As shown in the figure below (bottom, left), ovariectomy, or OVX, led to a reduction in BMD. Interestingly, this loss in BMD was negated by ZN-c5 treatment, and in fact, we observed a significant increase in BMD in mice treated with ZN-c5 as compared to non-ovariectomized mice (Sham-vehicle). Micro-CT scans of the isolated bones (bottom, right figure) showed a significant loss of trabecular bone in OVX control mice (OVX-vehicle). Treatment with ZN-c5 resulted in a dose-dependent reversal of this trabecular bone loss. Taken together, this surprising result suggests that ZN-c5 has bone protective effects.
Clinical Results
As of September 15, 2021, we had enrolled 56 patients in the Phase 1, monotherapy portion of this trial, at the following dose levels: 50 mg QD (N=16), 75 mg QD (N=3), 100 mg QD (N=3), 75 mg BID (N=6), 150 mg QD (N=15), 150 mg BID (N=3) and 300 mg QD (N=10). All patients were female, with a median age of 58.5 years (ranging from 38 to 89 years) and an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group, or ECOG, performance status, a measurement of a patient's level of functioning in terms of their ability to care for themself, daily activity, and physical ability, of 0 (n = 30) or 1 (n = 25) and not known (n=1). 
The median number of prior therapies for advanced disease was two (ranging from zero to nine). 26 of the 56 patients, or 46%, received prior treatment with fulvestrant, and 39, or 70%, received prior therapy with a CDK 4/6 inhibitor. Enrollment in the Phase 1 monotherapy dose escalation portion of this trial has been completed.
As of September 15, 2021, we had enrolled 50 patients in the Phase 1, combination dose escalation portion of this trial, ten patients at the ZN-c5 dose level of 25 mg QD, five at 25 mg BID, 18 at 50 mg QD, two at 50 mg BID, twelve at 100 mg QD, and three at 150 mg QD. 49 patients were female, and one was male, with a median age of 63 years (ranging from 35 to 79 years) and an ECOG performance status of zero (n = 20), one (n = 29) or two (n = 1). The median number of prior therapies for advanced disease was one, with a range from zero to six. 19 of the 50 patients received prior treatments with fulvestrant. Of these 50 patients, 19 are still on treatment and 31 discontinued due to disease progression (n = 24), patient discretion (n=4), investigator discretion (n = 2), and due to intercurrent illness (n=1). Enrollment in the Phase 1, combination dose escalation portion of this trial is ongoing, and a total of up to 62 patients may be enrolled.
Safety Results
Phase 1, Monotherapy Dose Escalation and Monotherapy Dose Expansion
Based on the results as of the database cutoff date of September 15, 2021 for the Phase 1, monotherapy dose escalation and monotherapy dose expansion portions of this trial, ZN-c5 has been observed to be well tolerated with no dose-limiting toxicities reported.
In the Phase 1 monotherapy portion of this trial, a total of 56 patients were enrolled and dosed, with data available in the electronic data capture system as of the September 15, 2021 database cutoff. TEAEs occurred in 54 of the 56 patients, or 96%. Nausea was observed in 17 patients, or 30%; fatigue in 15 patients, or 27%; and hot flush in eight patients, or 15%. Grade 3 TEAEs occurring in ≥ 2 subjects included abdominal pain, hypertension, hyponatremia, pain in extremity (n = 2 each), and gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) increase (n = 3). Of these, only 1 TEAE each of abdominal pain and GGT increase were deemed related to ZN-c5. Grade 4 events were not reported.
33 of 56 subjects, or 59%, experienced at least one ZN-c5 TRAE, mainly of Grade 1 or 2 in severity. Grade 3 TRAEs were hypersensitivity, abdominal pain, GGT increase, and dyspnea (n = 1 each). Grade 1 or 2 TRAEs included diarrhea (4%) and nausea (14%). Only one subject had a ZN-c5 dose reduction, due to GGT increase. There were no deaths reported. 
Overall, in the Phase 1, monotherapy dose escalation and monotherapy dose expansion portions of the trial, there was no observed increase in severity of adverse events with increasing dosing levels.
Phase 1, Combination Dose Escalation
As of the May 11, 2021 database cutoff date, ZN-c5 in combination with palbociclib was observed to be well tolerated with no dose-limiting toxicities reported. Based on these safety results, we are continuing to enroll patients in ZN-c5 in combination with palbociclib.
Investigator assessed TRAEs to ZN-c5 occurred in 20 of the 41 patients dosed and were all at most, grade 2 in severity. TRAEs with incidence >10% included: hot flush (n = 6), and arthralgia (n = 4).
Investigator assessed TRAEs to palbociclib occurred in 40 of the 41 patients dosed. Adverse events with incidence >10% included: neutrophil count decreased (n = 28), white blood cell count decreased (n = 27), anemia (n = 14), lymphocyte count decreased (n = 12), fatigue (n = 10), platelet count decreased (n = 9), nausea (n = 5), hot flush (n = 4), and arthralgia (n = 4). TRAEs of grade 3 events included: neutrophil count decreased (n = 12), white blood cell count decreased (n = 6), and lymphocyte count decreased (n = 3); there was only one grade 4 lymphocyte count decreased event.
Efficacy Results
Clinical activity in the Phase 1 trial is determined by the CBR, which is the total number or percentage of patients who achieved a CR, PR, or stable disease, or SD, for 24 weeks or longer per RECIST v1.1 criteria.
ZN-c5 achieved a best response of confirmed PR (as per RECIST) in two of 41 subjects, or 5%, with measurable disease. The clinical benefit rate (CBR = PR + SD ≥ 24 weeks) was 38%. In addition, the median progression-free survival (PFS) was 3.8 months (95% CI,3.5-5.4).

ZN-c5 Pharmacokinetics Results
PK analyses were conducted for 54 of 56 subjects, or 96%, in fasted conditions during Cycle 1 of the Phase 1 monotherapy dose escalation and expansion. (Table 4)
The preliminary PK was characterized by fast absorption with median Tmax values of 1 to 2 hrs. The exposures were approximately dose-proportional at the dose levels of 50 to 100 mg and less than dose-proportional between 100 and 300 mg. No accumulation of ZN-c5 was observed after 15 days of QD dosing. 
Preliminary Pharmacokinetic Data for ZN-c5 Monotherapy 
ZN-c5 monotherapy was administered at doses 50–300 mg QD or 75–150 mg BID. ZN-c5 is absorbed with median Tmax of 2–4 hours, independent of dose level. Exposure and Cmax on Day 1 and Day 15 were less than dose proportional. No significant accumulation in exposure was observed for doses up to 100 mg.

ZN-c5 human drug exposure at all dose levels, ranging from 50 mg to 300 mg, exceeds the ZN-c5 effective concentration, 100%, or EC100, observed in our preclinical mouse studies at 10 mg/kg/day, the dose level associated with a 100% tumor growth inhibition in an MCF-7 mouse model. Based on the activity observed in mouse models, the exposures observed in human patients may translate into once daily, oral dosing.
Phase 1b Trial of ZN-c5 in combination with abemaciclib
In November 2020, we dosed the first patient in our Phase 1b open label, multi-center trial of ZN-c5 in combination with abemaciclib in patients with ER+/HER2- advanced or metastatic breast cancer, which we refer to as our ZN-c5-003 Trial. This trial aims to assess the safety, tolerability, PK, pharmacodynamics, and anti-tumor activity of ZN-c5 in combination with abemaciclib. The ZN-c5-003 Trial will be conducted at several sites in the United States and Europe. We plan to enroll approximately 18 patients in this trial. 
Phase 1b Trial of ZN-c5 in combination with ZN-c3
In December 2021 at our R&D Day, we announced our intent to initiate a Phase 1b combination trial of ZN-c5 with ZN-c3 in CDK4/6i resistant breast cancer in 2022. This trial aims to assess the safety, tolerability, PK, pharmacodynamics, and anti-tumor activity of ZN-c5 in combination with ZN-c3. This trial will be conducted at several sites in the United States and Europe. We plan to enroll approximately 18 patients in this trial. 
ZN-d5, an Inhibitor of BCL-2 for the Treatment of Hematologic Cancers 
Overview 
We are developing ZN-d5, an oral selective inhibitor of BCL-2, an intracellular protein that suppresses apoptosis for the treatment of cancers, with an initial focus on hematologic malignancies. We have applied our expertise to design ZN-d5 as an oral BCL-2 inhibitor and to have optimized potency, selectivity and PK. 
We began enrolling subjects in a Phase 1 clinical trial evaluating ZN-d5 in patients with relapsed or refractory NHL and AML, in October 2020. This trial initially enrolled subjects with NHL and enrollment of subjects with AML began in the third quarter of 2021. This dose-escalation study is designed to assess the safety, efficacy and PK of ZN-d5, and to determine the MTD and RP2D in NHL and AML. Based on the unmet medical need, we will initiate a Phase 1 monotherapy clinical trial to evaluate ZN-d5 in patients with relapsed or refractory amyloidosis, in the first quarter of 2022. In 2022, we also intend to initiate a Phase 1/2 clinical trial evaluating ZN-d5 in combination with ZN-c3, our Wee1 inhibitor product candidate, in patients with AML. 
Role of BCL-2 in Hematological Cancers
The BCL-2 family of protein is most notable for its critical role in the regulation of apoptosis at the mitochondrion. Based upon their functions, BCL-2 family proteins are classified into pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic members. The anti-apoptotic BCL-2 proteins include BCL-2, B-cell lymphoma extra-large, or BCL-xL, myeloid cell leukemia-1, or MCL-1, and BCL-2 related protein Al. 
The overexpression of BCL-2 and/or BCL-xL proteins is frequently detected in many different types of cancers, including chronic lymphatic leukemia, or CLL, SLL, AML, NHL (including follicular lymphoma, or FL, mantle-cell lymphoma, or MCL, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, or DLBCL),Waldenström’s macroglobulinemia, multiple myeloma, or MM, and small cell lung cancer, or SCLC. These overexpressed proteins prevent apoptosis of cancer cells. We believe the use of small molecule inhibitors to block the protein-protein interactions of BCL-2 and/or BCL-xL with their pro-apoptotic partners will restore the normal apoptosis process in cancer cells. This new cancer therapeutic strategy has been validated through the recent approval of venetoclax. 
There have been many attempts to develop a new class of anticancer therapies that target BCL-2 and/or BCL-xL proteins. The intracellular localization of the BCL-2 family proteins on the mitochondrial membrane prevents the use of antibodies and other large molecules to target these anti-apoptotic BCL-2 family proteins. The large surface area involved in BCL-2 PPIs also makes BCL-2 family proteins difficult targets for small molecule drugs. Currently, venetoclax is the only FDA-approved BCL-2 inhibitor and, to our knowledge, there are only a small number of additional agents in active clinical development. 
Our BCL-2 Inhibitor: ZN-d5
We have designed ZN-d5 to have the following characteristics:
•Potency. In our preclinical studies, ZN-d5 was observed to be potent in cell lines and xenograft models across a variety of hematological malignancies.
•Selectivity. In our in vitro studies, ZN-d5 showed more than 600 times greater selectivity for BCL-2 than BCL-xL. The inhibition of BCL-xL is a known cause of thrombocytopenia, a commonly reported toxicity in patients treated with 
venetoclax. We believe ZN-d5's greater selectivity for BCL-2 over BCL-xL observed in preclinical studies may support the use of ZN-d5 in combination with other drugs that are associated with a high rate of thrombocytopenia..
•Tolerability profile. In our animal toxicity studies, ZN-d5 was observed to be well tolerated across various dosage levels.
We believe the observed properties of ZN-d5 make it an attractive candidate for evaluation as monotherapy and in combination with other therapies, initially for the treatment of hematological malignancies. As noted above, ZN-d5 is in an ongoing Phase 1 dose escalation study in relapsed and refractory NHL and AML patients. Our plans for 2022 for ZN-d5 include opening enrollment in a Phase 1 study to patients with relapsed or refractory amyloidosis in the first quarter and launching a Phase 1/2 trial in combination with ZN-c3, our Wee1 inhibitor product candidate, in relapsed or refractory AML in the first half of the year. 
Preclinical Results 
Potency and Selectivity Across Hematological Malignancies 
In an in vitro preclinical study, we assessed the selectivity and potency of ZN-d5 alongside venetoclax. As shown in the table below, we assessed the affinity of each agent as measured in nM in a biochemical assay. Based on these measurements, ZN-d5 showed 600 times greater selectivity for BCL-2 than BCL-xL, and we believe such selectivity may limit the incidence of thrombocytopenia observed in third-party clinical trials as a result of BCL-xL inhibition. We also observed that ZN-d5 was potent across hematological malignancy cell lines as measured by CellTiter-Glo, or CTG, a cell viability assay, shown in the table below. 

 | CTG IC50 (nM)
 | AFFINITY (nM) | ALL | MCL | DLBCL | | AML 
COMPOUND | BCL-2Kd | BCL-XLKd | RS4;11 | GRANTA-519 | | DOHH-2 | | TOLEDO | | HL-60 | | MOLM-13 | | MV4-11
Venetoclax(1) | 0.41 | 28 | 2.9 | | 161 | | 43 | | 191 | | 26 | | 18 | | 3.8
ZN-d5 | 0.29 | 190 | 5.1 | | 89 | | 50 | | 92 | | 21 | | 39 | | 5.1

In a preclinical study, we also assessed the platelet toxicity of ZN-d5 against venetoclax, as measured by mM in a platelet viability assay. In each assay, ZN-d5 was observed to be less toxic to platelets than venetoclax, which we believe may limit the incidence of thrombocytopenia.

Potency for BCL-2 Mutations 
We believe genetic mutations in the BCL-2 gene may be responsible for a developed resistance to venetoclax observed in some CLL patients. In a third-party clinical trial, 16 of 29 patients acquired mutations in members of the BCL-2 family of proteins, 14 of which were a mutation in BCL-2. In nine of those 14 patients, the BCL-2 mutation was detected after 24 months on venetoclax. In an in vitro preclinical study, we assessed the affinity of ZN-d5 alongside venetoclax, to bind to such BCL-2 mutations, as measured in nM. In each assay, ZN-d5 was observed to bind with higher affinity to such BCL-2 mutants as compared to venetoclax. 

 | IC50 (nM)BCL-2 Type
COMPOUND | WT | G101V | F104L | D103Y
Venetoclax(1) | 1.3 | 7.3 | 8.4 | 18.3 
ZN-d5 | 1.4 | 3.7 | 1.4 | 5.0

Anti-Tumor Activity of ZN-d5 in Xenograft Leukemia Model
In a preclinical study, we assessed the anti-tumor activity of ZN-d5, alongside venetoclax. In a RS4;11 xenograft leukemia mouse model, ZN-d5, dosed at 50 mg/kg daily for a period of 11 days, showed potent anti-tumor activity with tumors shrinking upon treatment and yielding durable complete responses after cessation of dosing to the end of the study, as shown in the graphic below. We observed similar results with venetoclax in this model.
The Combination of BCL-2 and Wee1 Inhibitors in Several Tumor Models Including AML Model
In a preclinical study, we assessed the anti-tumor activity of a low dose of ZN-d5 alone and in combination with ZN-c3 in the HL-60 xenograft leukemia mouse model. ZN-d5 was dosed at 50 mg/kg QD, p. o., and ZN-c3 was dosed at 60 mg/kg QD, p. o. The combination treatment resulted in better and synergistic anti-tumor effect (94% tumor regression) than each monotherapy treatment. 
In a preclinical study, we assessed the anti-tumor activity of ZN-d5 alone and in combination with ZN-c3 in a patient derived model, or PDX, of AML. In this model, human AML cells are injected into mice that had been previously sub-lethally irradiated to allow for the engraftment of the bone marrow by the human cells. ZN-d5 was dosed at 200 mg/kg QD, p. o., and ZN-c3 was dosed at 80 mg/kg QD, p. o. The combination treatment resulted in better anti-tumor effect than each monotherapy treatment as measured by the presence of human CD45+ cells in the mouse bone marrow.
The anti-tumor activity of ZN-d5 combined with ZN-c3 at different doses was tested in vitro in samples from patients who had progressed on a venetoclax-based therapy. The combination of ZN-d5 and ZN-c3 was highly active.
Clinical Studies Update
Phase 1 dose escalation study of ZN-d5 in NHL and AML
Our first-in-human Phase 1 dose escalation study of ZN-d5, opened to relapsed or refractory NHL subjects in October 2020 and to relapsed or refractory AML subjects in the third quarter of 2021. As of the database cutoff date of November 3, 2021, 27 subjects had been treated with ZN-d5, including 23 subjects with NHL and 4 with AML. 
Preliminary Safety and Clinical Activity Observations
At our R&D Day in December 2021, we reported preliminary interim data from the NHL subjects in this study. As of the November 3, 2021 database cutoff date, ZN-d5 has been well-tolerated, with 74% of the NHL subjects having experienced AEs. Anemia (22%), diarrhea (13%), and nausea and vomiting (9% each) comprise the most commonly experienced AEs. Investigator-reported responses among eleven response-evaluable subjects with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, according to the Lugano 2014 classification, have included a complete response, a partial response, and two subjects with SD, as of the database cutoff date of November 3, 2021.
Phase 1/2 study of ZN-d5 in AL amyloidosis 
In the first quarter of 2022, we will initiate our Phase 1/2 study of ZN-d5 in subjects with relapsed or refractory AL amyloidosis. AL amyloidosis is a plasma cell disorder in which a non-malignant clonal population of plasma cells secrete high levels of a misfolding immunoglobulin light chain can become deposited in tissues, causing widespread organ damage. Though not a malignancy, AL amyloidosis is a difficult and progressive disease that is treated with agents active against multiple myeloma, a malignancy of plasma cells, which can include stem cell transplant and, more commonly, combinations of chemotherapy, proteosome inhibitors, immunomodulating agents, dexamethasone, and monoclonal antibodies that target plasma cells.  AL amyloidosis is a rare disease that is often progressive despite multiple lines of therapy, and we believe represents an unmet medical need.
This Phase 1/2 study in amyloidosis consists of a dose-escalation phase to establish the RP2D, and an expansion phase to assess the safety and efficacy of ZN-d5 in this population. The study is expected to enroll up to approximately 140 subjects. 
Phase 1/2 study of ZN-d5 and ZN-c3 in AML 
In 2022, we plan to initiate a Phase 1/2 combination trial of ZN-d5 with ZN‑c3 in AML, based on the mechanism of action for both compounds and strong preclinical proof-of-concept data that suggest the combination may have potent activity in AML. The Phase 1 portion of this trial will escalate the doses of both drugs to identify the RP2D for the combination, which will be subsequently assessed in several phase 2 expansion cohorts comprising specific AML populations. This study is expected to enroll up to approximately 100 subjects.
ZN-e4, an Inhibitor of EGFR for the Treatment of NSCLC 
Overview 
We are developing ZN-e4, an irreversible inhibitor of EGFR, a driver of tumorigenesis in lung cancer. We have designed ZN-e4 to be highly selective against mutant EGFR while lacking metabolites that bind potently to the wild-type EGFR, potentially leading to fewer toxicities, including skin rash, compared to drugs that have metabolites that actively bind the wild-type receptor. We believe that eliminating the formation of such a metabolite will allow for a wide therapeutic window. In addition, we believe a more tolerable EGFR inhibitor would, if approved, allow for use in combination with other therapeutics while limiting the toxicity associated with use in combination. 
Role of EGFR Inhibition in NSCLC 
Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death for both men and women, accounting for approximately 18% of all cancer deaths globally in 2020, according to the World Health Organization. There are an estimated 228,000 new cases of lung cancer diagnosed and 143,000 deaths in the United States annually. More than half of the people with lung cancer die within one year of being diagnosed. Non-small cell lung cancer, or NSCLC, accounts for approximately 80-85% of lung cancer cases. EGFR mutations are detected in approximately 10% to 15% and 30% to 40% of Caucasian and Asian patients, respectively, with NSCLC. 
EGFR mutations lead to activation of EGFR signaling and oncogenic transformation both in vitro and in vivo. Cancers with EGFR mutations depend on EGFR signaling for growth and survival and are often sensitive to treatment with EGFR inhibitors. Two inhibitors of EGFR were approved in the early 2000s to treat patients with advanced NSCLC based on anti-tumor responses in a subset of patients. These first-generation drugs, erlotinib and gefitinib, were reversible EGFR inhibitors. Although most NSCLC patients with EGFR mutations displayed an initial pronounced response to these first-generation EGFR inhibitors, they acquired resistance to the drugs after approximately nine to 14 months of treatment. The T790M mutation of EGFR was the most common mechanism of such an acquired resistance, having been detected in over 50% of patients treated with EGFR inhibitors. 
A second-generation of EGFR inhibitors was developed to address this treatment resistance and to improve upon the efficacy of the first-generation therapies. The second-generation of EGFR inhibitors, including afatinib, marketed as Gilotrif® by Boehringer Ingelheim, and dacomitib, marketed as Vizimpro® by Pfizer, are irreversible inhibitors which covalently bind to EGFR. As such, they are more potent, but are associated with increased toxicity. Further, T790M-mediated acquired resistance occurred at a similar frequency in patients receiving a second-generation therapy as those receiving first generation therapy. Third-generation therapies, such as osimertinib, specifically targeting the T790M mutation have been clinically shown to be a useful strategy in the treatment of NSCLC. 
FDA-Approved Third-Generation EGFR Inhibitor, Osimertinib 
Osimertinib, which represents the third-generation of EGFR inhibitors, targets EGFR mutations and acquired resistance EGFR mutations such as T790M in order to improve upon the efficacy of previous generations of EGFR inhibitors. In a randomized Phase 3 clinical trial in patients with EGFR-mutated metastatic NSCLC, osimertinib demonstrated a median PFS period of 18.9 months versus 10.2 months for the control arm in which patients received gefitinib or erlotinib. Based on these results, osimertinib was approved by the FDA in November 2015. AstraZeneca reported sales of Tagrisso® of $4.3 billion in 2020, an increase of 36% from 2019 and are expected to grow to $9.5 billion in 2026. 
Osimertinib was also designed to have reduced potency against non-mutated, or wild-type, EGFR found in healthy cells, thereby minimizing the toxicities associated with first and second-generation EGFR inhibitors. Despite its observed success in addressing the T790M-mediated acquired resistance and improved efficacy, osimertinib has a similar adverse event profile to first and second-generation EGFR inhibitors. As demonstrated by third-party clinical data, approximately 60% of patients dosed with osimertinib reported rashes compared to 80% of those dosed with gefitinib or erlotinib and a range of 70% to 90% for the second-generation EGFR inhibitor, afatinib. In addition, similar levels of gastrointestinal disorders such as diarrhea were observed in each of the patient populations. Osimertinib also has warnings and precautions regarding interstitial lung disease, QT prolongation, a surrogate marker for the risk of developing tachycardias, cardiomyopathy, keratitis and Stevens-Johnson Syndrome. 
We believe one of the major metabolites of osimertinib, AZ5104, which accounts for approximately 9% to 10% of the total drug concentration at clinical doses, may be contributing to these toxicities. In addition, the off-target toxicities are exacerbated by the long half-life of osimertinib. 

Our EGFR Solution: ZN-e4 
ZN-e4 is our irreversible EGFR inhibitor product candidate which we have designed to potently inhibit mutant EGFR, including the T790M resistance mutation. We have designed ZN-e4 to be highly selective against mutant EGFR and have observed in preclinical studies that the administration of ZN-e4 does not produce a metabolite potent for wild-type EGFR. We have also designed ZN-e4 with improved physical-chemical characteristics, including improved solubility. In a head-to-head preclinical study, ZN-e4 showed greater than 450-fold solubility within 48 hours when compared to osimertinib. 
We are conducting a Phase 1/2 clinical trial of ZN-e4 in patients with advanced NSCLC with activating EGFR mutations. Preliminary results from the Phase 1 portion of this trial were presented in December 2021 at our R&D Day.
Preclinical Results
Selectivity Across EGFR Cell Lines
In a preclinical study, we evaluated the potency of ZN-e4 alongside osimertinib against three types of EGFR cell lines –double mutant (DM cell), single mutant (AM cell) and wild-type (WT cell). As shown in the table below, we observed similar potency in the DM and AM cell lines and three times greater selectivity than osimertinib based on the wild-type binding. In addition, we also observed that the administration of ZN-e4 did not produce a metabolite potent for wild type EGFR.

 | DOUBLE MUTANT CELLIC50 (nM) | SINGLE MUTANT CELLIC50 (nM) | | WILD-TYPE CELLIC50 (nM)
Osimertinib(1): Core Drug | 15 | | 29 | | 294
ZN-e4: Core Drug | 20 | | 38 | | 839

Anti-tumor Activity, Tolerability and Solubility of ZN-e4
In a preclinical study, we evaluated the anti-tumor activity of ZN-e4 alongside that of osimertinib. In a NCI-H1975 NSCLC tumor model in which there is a double mutation in EGFR, T790M and L858R, oral dosing of ZN-e4 for 14 days at the dose tested, 10 mg/kg, induced complete tumor regression, as did 10 mg/kg osimertinib dosed orally. In addition, ZN-e4 at this dose was well tolerated in these models with no apparent loss in body weight throughout the study. In contrast, the 10 mg/kg dose of osimertinib led to a loss of greater than 8% of total body weight. We observed a similar loss of body weight with ZN-e4 when we increased the dose to 50 mg/kg, roughly five times the dose we found to reduce tumor volumes.
We also assessed the relative solubility of ZN-e4, alongside a proxy chemical compound of osimertinib, using a standard in vitro assay. The solubility of ZN-e4 was observed to be 1,614,000 nM, greater than 450 fold the solubility that of osimertinib which was observed at 3,500 nM. In addition, we did not observe confirmed cardiac toxicity as measured by the standard electrophysiological hERG safety assay.
Clinical Results
In January 2022, enrollment in ZN-e4-001 was closed after achieving enrollment in the Phase 1 dose-escalation portion of the study sufficient to determine the recommended phase 2 dose. As of January 18, 2022, we treated a total of 34 subjects with daily doses of ZN-e4 ranging from 20 mg to 480 mg, and five subjects remained on treatment. The majority of discontinuations were for disease progression. 
The interim and preliminary data described herein are subject to change as more data on these subjects and additional patients become available and are subject to authorization and verification procedures that could result in material changes in the final data.
Interim Preliminary Safety Results
An updated safety analysis was performed with a database cutoff date of January 18, 2022. ZN-e4 has continued to be generally well tolerated. TEAEs occurred in 29 of 34 subjects (85%), and a total of eleven SAEs have been reported in five subjects. There has been no change in the safety profile of ZN-e4 since the last reported study update.
Interim Preliminary Efficacy Results
28 subjects are included in the efficacy analysis as of the November 1, 2021 database cutoff date. The ORR was 14%, with four subjects demonstrating a PR. In addition, seven subjects had SD. Among subjects previously treated with osimertinib, ORR was 36%. The waterfall plot below presents the best percent change in target lesion size for individual subjects and the response to treatment, as assessed by the investigators according to RECIST criteria, as of the November 1, 2021 cutoff date. 
BCL-xL Heterobifunctional Degrader
BCL-xL is a member of the anti-apoptotic BCL-2 protein family and participates in the regulation of the intrinsic apoptosis pathway. BCL-xL is often upregulated in hematological and solid malignancies. It is involved in tumor survival and resistance to chemotherapy and venetoclax.
Navitoclax, a dual BCL-2/BCL-xL inhibitor, has shown clinical activity in hematopoietic malignancies but was found to be dose-limited because of thrombocytopenia driven by BCL-xL inhibition.
We are developing BCL-xL heterobifunctional degraders based on E3 ligases not expressed in platelets, allowing for the avoidance of dose-limiting thrombocytopenia associated with BCL-xL inhibitors.
•Potency. In our preclinical studies, the degradation of BCL-xL in tumor cells with our heterobifunctional degraders is associated to a decrease in cell viability.
•Tolerability. Contrary to navitoclax, our BCL-xL heterobifunctional degraders are not significantly affecting the viability of human platelets in in vitro studies.
We believe that our Discovery efforts to select a BCL-xL degrader will lead to an attractive candidate for evaluation as monotherapy and in combination with other therapies, such as ZN-d5 and ZN-c3, for the treatment of hematological and solid malignancies.
Preclinical Results 
Potency in Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia (ALL) – in vitro studies
In an in vitro preclinical study, we assessed the potency of our BCL-xL heterobifunctional degraders alongside navitoclax. As shown in the table below, we assessed the effect of each molecule on the viability of the ALL cell line model, MOLT4, by CellTiter Glo, and on the degradation of BCL-xL protein by ELISA. IC50 and DC50 are reported in nM for MOLT4 viability and BCL-xL degradation, respectively. Ymax and Dmax indicate the maximum percentage of reduction in viability and BCL-xL degradation, respectively. While navitoclax doesn’t decrease the levels of BCL-xL protein, our degraders cause a significant reduction of BCL-xL protein associated with a reduction in viability of tumor cells.

Compound | MOLT-4 Viability | BCL-xL Degradation

Assessment of BCL-xL degrader toxicity in platelets in in vitro studies
35


In a preclinical study, we assessed the platelet toxicity of our degraders against navitoclax by assessing their effect on the viability of human platelets using CellTiter Glo. IC50 values are reported in nM for platelet viability and Ymax represents the maximum percentage of reduction in viability. While navitoclax has an IC50 of 372 nM and kills 95% of platelets, our degraders are sparing the viability of platelets.

Anti-Tumor Activity of BCL-xL degrader in a xenograft ALL Model
In an in vivo study, we assessed the anti-tumor activity of our BCL-xL degraders, alongside navitoclax. In a MOLT4 xenograft ALL mouse model, our BCL-xL heterobifunctional degrader ZN degrader 1, dosed weekly at 20 mg/kg for 3 weeks, shows comparable efficacy to navitoclax, dosed daily at 100 mg/kg for 3 weeks. BCL-xL protein was assessed by semi-quantitative western blot in the tumors after 3 days of treatment and demonstrates ZN degrader 1 induces a >50% decrease in protein levels, while navitoclax induces an increase in BCL-xL protein.

Manufacturing
We currently do not own or operate any manufacturing facilities. We rely, and expect to continue to rely for the foreseeable future, on third-party contract manufacturing organizations, or CMOs, to produce our product candidates for preclinical and clinical testing, as well as for commercial manufacture if our product candidates receive marketing approval. We require that our CMOs produce bulk drug substances and finished drug products in accordance with current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMPs, and all other applicable laws and regulations. We maintain agreements with our manufacturers that include confidentiality and intellectual property provisions to protect our proprietary rights related to our product candidates. 
We have engaged CMOs to manufacture and package ZN-c3, ZN-c5, ZN-d5 and ZN-e4 for preclinical and clinical use. Additional CMOs are used to label and distribute ZN-c3, ZN-c5, ZN-d5 and ZN-e4 for clinical use. We obtain our supplies from these CMOs on a purchase order basis and do not have long-term supply arrangements in place. Although we do not currently have contractual arrangements in place for redundant supply for all of these product candidates, it is our goal to identify and contract with at least two manufacturers for active pharmaceutical ingredient and two manufacturers for drug product. More broadly, for each of our product candidates, we intend to identify and qualify additional manufacturers to provide the active pharmaceutical ingredient and fill-and-finish services prior to seeking regulatory approval. 
Competition 
The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by rapid technological advancement, significant competition and an emphasis on intellectual property. We face potential competition from many different sources, including major and specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic research institutions, governmental agencies and 
public and private research institutions. Any product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with current therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future. 
Many of the companies against which we may compete have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing approved products than we do. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical, biotechnology and diagnostic industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel and establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs. 
Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize medicines that are safer, more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient or less expensive than any medicines we may develop. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their product candidates more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours, which could result in competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market. We believe that the key competitive factors affecting the success of any of our product candidates, if approved, will include efficacy, combinability, safety profile, convenience, cost, level of promotional activity devoted to them and intellectual property protection. 
If the product candidates for our priority programs are approved for the indications we are currently targeting, they will compete with the drugs discussed below. Furthermore, it is possible that other companies are also engaged in discovery or preclinical development of drug candidates for the same indications. These competitors, if successful in clinical development, may achieve regulatory approval and market adoption in advance of our product candidates, constraining our ability to gain significant market share for such product candidates. In addition, our product candidates, if approved, will complete with multiple approved drugs or drugs that may be approved for future indications for which we develop such product candidate. 
Intellectual Property
We strive to protect the proprietary technology, inventions and improvements that are commercially important to our business, including seeking, maintaining, and defending patent rights, whether developed internally or licensed from third parties. We also rely on know-how relating to our proprietary technology and product candidates and continuing innovation to develop, strengthen and maintain our proprietary position. We also plan to rely on data exclusivity, market exclusivity and patent term extensions when available. Our commercial success will depend in part on our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other proprietary protection for our technology, inventions and improvements; to defend and enforce our proprietary rights, including any patents that we may own in the future; and to operate without infringing the valid and enforceable patents and other proprietary rights of third parties. Intellectual property rights may not address all potential threats to our competitive advantage. 
With respect to our product candidates and processes we intend to develop and commercialize in the normal course of business, we intend, or understand that our licensors intend, to pursue patent protection covering, when possible, compositions, methods of use, dosing and formulations. We or our licensors also may pursue patent protection with respect to manufacturing and drug development processes and technologies. Obtaining and maintaining patent protection depends on compliance with various procedural, document submission, fee payment, and other requirements imposed by governmental patent agencies. We or our licensors may not be able to obtain patent protections for our compositions, methods of use, dosing and formulations, manufacturing and drug development processes and technologies throughout the world. Issued patents can provide protection for varying periods of time, depending upon the date of filing of the patent application, the date of patent issuance and the legal term of patents in the countries in which they are obtained. In general, patents issued for applications filed in the United States can provide exclusionary rights for 20 years from the earliest effective filing date. In addition, in certain instances, the term of an issued U.S. patent that is directed to or claims an FDA-approved product can be extended to recapture a portion of the term effectively lost as a result of the FDA regulatory review period, which is called “patent term extension.” The restoration period cannot be longer than five years and the total patent term, including the restoration period, must not exceed 14 years following FDA approval. The term of patents outside of the United States varies in accordance with the laws of the foreign jurisdiction, but typically is also 20 years from the earliest effective filing date. However, the actual protection afforded by a patent varies on a product-by-product basis, from country-to-country, and depends upon many factors, including the type of patent, the scope of its coverage, the availability of regulatory-related extensions, the availability of legal remedies in a particular country, and the validity and enforceability of the patent. Patent term may be inadequate to protect our competitive position on our products for an adequate amount of time. 
The patent positions of companies like ours are generally uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions. No consistent policy regarding the scope of claims allowable in patents in the field of biopharmaceuticals has emerged in the United States. The relevant patent laws and their interpretation outside of the United States is also uncertain. Changes in either the patent laws or their interpretation in the United States and other countries may diminish our ability to protect our technology or product candidates and could affect the value of such intellectual property. In particular, our ability to stop third parties from making, using, selling, offering to sell or importing products that infringe our intellectual property will depend in part on our success in obtaining and enforcing patent claims that cover our technology, inventions and improvements. We cannot guarantee that patents will be granted with respect to any of our pending patent applications or with respect to any patent applications we may file in the future, nor can we be sure that any patents that may be granted to us in the future will be commercially useful in protecting our products, the methods of use or manufacture of those products. Moreover, even our issued patents do not guarantee us the right to practice our technology in relation to the commercialization of our products. Patent and other intellectual property rights in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology space are evolving and involve many risks and uncertainties. For example, third parties may have blocking patents that could be used to prevent us from commercializing our product candidates and practicing our proprietary technology, and our issued patents may be challenged, invalidated, deemed unenforceable or circumvented, which could limit our ability to stop competitors from marketing-related products or could limit the term of patent protection that otherwise may exist for our product candidates. In addition, the scope of the rights granted under any issued patents may not provide us with protection or competitive advantages against competitors with similar technology. Furthermore, our competitors may independently develop similar technologies that are outside the scope of the rights granted under any issued patents. For these reasons, we may face competition with respect to our product candidates. Moreover, because of the extensive time required for development, testing and regulatory review of a potential product, it is possible that, before any particular product candidate can be commercialized, any patent directed to such product may expire or remain in force for only a short period following commercialization, thereby reducing the commercial advantage the patent provides.

The 72 families include 55 U.S. applications (including pending U.S. provisional patent applications and pending U.S. non-provisional patent applications), 30 PCT applications and more than 300 international applications in approximately 18 countries, including major markets in North America, South America, Europe and Asia, each having a nominal expiration date ranging from 2034 to 2041. The nominal expiration of our patents and patent applications does not account for any applicable patent term adjustments or extensions. 
U.S. Patent No. 10,513,509, or the ‘509 Patent, includes claims directed to composition of matter, including ZN-e4, a pharmaceutical composition, a method for inhibiting replication of a malignant growth or a tumor, a method for ameliorating or treating a cancer and a method for inhibiting the activity of EGFR. The ‘509 Patent has an expected expiration date in May 2037. However, we believe the ‘509 Patent may be eligible for a patent term extension under the Hatch-Waxman Act. 
U.S. Patent No.11,065,233, or the ‘233 Patent, includes claims directed to composition of matter, including ZN-c5, a pharmaceutical composition and a method of making ZN-c5. U.S. Patent No. 11,065,234, or the ‘234 Patent, includes claims directed to a method for treating breast cancer with ZN-c5. The ‘233 Patent and the ‘234 Patent each have an expected expiration date in March 2037. However, we believe the ‘233 Patent and/or the ‘234 Patent may be eligible for a patent term extension under the Hatch-Waxman Act. 
One of the aforementioned pending U.S. and PCT patent applications includes claims directed to ZN-c3 or ZN-d5, and has an expected expiration in 2039. However, there can be no assurance that any of our pending in-licensed patent applications will issue. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that we will benefit from any patent term extension or favorable adjustments to the term of any of our in-licensed issued patents or patents that are issued in the future. The applicable authorities, including the FDA in the United States, may not agree with our assessment of whether such patent term extensions should be granted, and, if granted, they may grant more limited extensions than we request. 
Trademarks
As of February 4, 2022, our trademark portfolio contains the following trademarks applications or registrations. U.S. trademark applications are pending for each of the marks ZENTALIS and the stylized “Z” mark. Applications to register each of the marks ZENTALIS and the stylized “Z” have been filed internationally. The portfolio has an International Madrid Trademark Application designating Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Europe, the United Kingdom, Israel, India, Japan, Korea, Mexico, New Zealand, the Russian Federation and Singapore for each of the marks ZENTALIS and the stylized “Z”. The portfolio also has pending applications for registration and/or a registration has issued in Argentina, Hong Kong, and Taiwan for each of the marks ZENTALIS and stylized “Z”. 
Furthermore, we rely upon know-how, continuing technological innovation and potential in-licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our competitive position. We seek to protect our proprietary information, in part, using confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our commercial partners, collaborators, employees, and consultants. These agreements are designed to protect our proprietary information and, in the case of the invention assignment agreements, to grant us ownership of technologies that are developed through a relationship with an employee or a third party. These agreements may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any such breach. To the extent that our commercial partners, collaborators, employees and consultants use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions.

Government Regulation and Product Approval
Government authorities in the United States, at the federal, state and local level, and other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, labeling, packaging, storage, record-keeping, promotion, advertising, distribution, marketing and export and import of products such as those we are developing. A new drug must be approved by the FDA through the NDA process before it may be legally marketed in the United States.
U.S. Drug Development Process
In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or the FDCA, and its implementing regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. 
The process required by the FDA before a drug may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:
•completion of preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies in accordance with FDA’s good laboratory practice requirements and other applicable regulations;
•submission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;
•approval by an independent IRB or ethics committee at each clinical site before each trial may be initiated;
•performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with GCP requirements to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug for its intended use;
•submission to the FDA of an NDA after completion of all pivotal trials;
•satisfactory completion of an FDA advisory committee review, if applicable;
•satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the drug is produced to assess compliance with cGMP requirements to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the drug’s identity, strength, quality and purity, and of selected clinical investigation sites to assess compliance with GCPs; and
•FDA review and approval of the NDA to permit commercial marketing of the product for particular indications for use in the United States.
Prior to beginning the first clinical trial with a product candidate in the United States, a sponsor must submit an IND to the FDA. An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational new drug product to humans. The central focus of an IND submission is on the general investigational plan and the protocol(s) for clinical studies. The IND also includes results of animal and in vitro studies assessing the toxicology, pharmacokinetics, pharmacology, and 
pharmacodynamic characteristics of the product; chemistry, manufacturing, and controls information; and any available human data or literature to support the use of the investigational product. An IND must become effective before human clinical trials may begin. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30- day time period, raises safety concerns or questions about the proposed clinical trial. In such a case, the IND may be placed on clinical hold and the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns or questions before the clinical trial can begin. Submission of an IND therefore may or may not result in FDA authorization to begin a clinical trial.
Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational product to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with GCPs, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent for their participation in any clinical study. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the study, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. A separate submission to the existing IND must be made for each successive clinical trial conducted during product development and for any subsequent protocol amendments. Furthermore, an independent IRB for each site proposing to conduct the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial and its informed consent form before the clinical trial begins at that site and must monitor the study until completed. Regulatory authorities, the IRB or the sponsor may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk or that the trial is unlikely to meet its stated objectives. Some studies also include oversight by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical study sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board, which provides authorization for whether or not a study may move forward at designated check points based on access to certain data from the study and may halt the clinical trial if it determines that there is an unacceptable safety risk for subjects or other grounds, such as no demonstration of efficacy. There are also requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical studies and clinical study results to public registries.
Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined:
•Phase 1: The product candidate is initially introduced into healthy human subjects or patients with the target disease or condition. These studies are designed to test the safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism and distribution of the investigational product in humans, the side effects associated with increasing doses, and, if possible, to gain early evidence on effectiveness. In the case of some products for severe or life-threatening diseases, such as cancer, especially when the product may be too inherently toxic to ethically administer to healthy volunteers, the initial human testing is often conducted in patients.
•Phase 2: The product candidate is administered to a limited patient population with a specified disease or condition to evaluate the preliminary efficacy, optimal dosages and dosing schedule and to identify possible adverse side effects and safety risks. Multiple Phase 2 clinical trials may be conducted to obtain information prior to beginning larger and more expensive Phase 3 clinical trials.
•Phase 3: The product candidate is administered to an expanded patient population to further evaluate dosage, to provide statistically significant evidence of clinical efficacy and to further test for safety, generally at multiple geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. These clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit ratio of the investigational product and to provide an adequate basis for product approval.
Post-approval trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 studies, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These trials are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication. In certain instances, the FDA may mandate the performance of Phase 4 clinical trials as a condition of approval of an NDA.
Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug and finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, the manufacturer must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final drug. In addition, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested, and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
During the development of a new drug, sponsors are given opportunities to meet with the FDA at certain points. These points may be prior to submission of an IND, at the end of Phase 2, and before an NDA is submitted. Meetings at other times may be requested. These meetings can provide an opportunity for the sponsor to share information about the data gathered to date, for the FDA to provide advice, and for the sponsor and the FDA to reach agreement on the next phase of development. 
Sponsors typically use the meetings at the end of the Phase 2 trial to discuss Phase 2 clinical results and present plans for the pivotal Phase 3 clinical trials that they believe will support approval of the new drug.
While the IND is active, progress reports summarizing the results of the clinical trials and nonclinical studies performed since the last progress report, among other information, must be submitted at least annually to the FDA, and written IND safety reports must be submitted to the FDA and investigators for serious and unexpected suspected adverse events, findings from other studies suggesting a significant risk to humans exposed to the same or similar drugs, findings from animal or in vitro testing suggesting a significant risk to humans, and any clinically important increased incidence of a serious suspected adverse reaction compared to that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure.
U.S. Review and Approval Process
Assuming successful completion of all required testing in accordance with all applicable regulatory requirements, the results of product development, preclinical and other non-clinical studies and clinical trials, along with descriptions of the manufacturing process, analytical tests conducted on the chemistry of the drug, proposed labeling and other relevant information are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA requesting approval to market the product. The submission of an NDA is subject to the payment of substantial user fees; a waiver of such fees may be obtained under certain limited circumstances. Additionally, no user fees are assessed on NDAs for products designated as orphan drugs, unless the product also includes a non-orphan indication.
The FDA conducts a preliminary review of all NDAs within the first 60 days after submission, before accepting them for filing, to determine whether they are sufficiently complete to permit substantive review The FDA may request additional information rather than accept an NDA for filing. In this event, the NDA must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application also is subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once filed, the FDA reviews an NDA to determine, among other things, whether a product is safe and effective for its intended use and whether its manufacturing is cGMP-compliant to assure and preserve the product’s identity, strength, quality and purity. Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, guidelines that are currently in effect, the FDA has a goal of ten months from the date of “filing” of a standard NDA for a new molecular entity to review and act on the submission. This review typically takes twelve months from the date the NDA is submitted to FDA because the FDA has approximately two (2) months to make a “filing” decision after it the application is submitted. 
The FDA may refer an application for a novel drug to an advisory committee. An advisory committee is a panel of independent experts, including clinicians and other scientific experts, that reviews, evaluates and provides a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions.
Before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving a NDA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCPs. 
After the FDA evaluates an NDA, it will issue an approval letter or a Complete Response Letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with prescribing information for specific indications. A Complete Response Letter indicates that the review cycle of the application is complete, and the application will not be approved in its present form. A Complete Response Letter usually describes the specific deficiencies in the NDA identified by the FDA and may require additional clinical data, such as an additional clinical trial or other significant and time-consuming requirements related to clinical trials, nonclinical studies or manufacturing. If a Complete Response Letter is issued, the sponsor must resubmit the NDA or, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, or withdraw the application. Even if such data and information are submitted, the FDA may decide that the NDA does not satisfy the criteria for approval.
If regulatory approval of a product is granted, such approval will be granted for particular indications and may entail limitations on the indicated uses for which such product may be marketed. For example, the FDA may approve the NDA with a REMS to ensure the benefits of the product outweigh its risks. A REMS is a safety strategy to manage a known or potential serious risk associated with a medicine and to enable patients to have continued access to such medicines by managing their safe use, and could include medication guides, physician communication plans, or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries, and other risk minimization tools. The FDA also may condition approval on, among other things, changes to proposed labeling or the development of adequate controls and specifications. Once approved, the FDA may withdraw the product approval if compliance with pre- and post-marketing requirements is not maintained or if problems 
occur after the product reaches the marketplace. The FDA may also require one or more Phase 4 post-market studies and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product’s safety and effectiveness after commercialization, and may limit further marketing of the product based on the results of these post-marketing studies.

In addition, the Pediatric Research Equity Act, or PREA, requires a sponsor to conduct pediatric clinical trials for most drugs, for a new active ingredient, new indication, new dosage form, new dosing regimen or new route of administration. Under PREA, original NDAs and supplements must contain a pediatric assessment unless the sponsor has received a deferral or waiver. The required assessment must evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The sponsor or FDA may request a deferral of pediatric clinical trials for some or all of the pediatric subpopulations. A deferral may be granted for several reasons, including a finding that the drug is ready for approval for use in adults before pediatric clinical trials are complete or that additional safety or effectiveness data needs to be collected before the pediatric clinical trials begin. The FDA must send a non-compliance letter to any sponsor that fails to submit the required assessment, keep a deferral current or fails to submit a request for approval of a pediatric formulation.
Expedited Development and Review Programs
The FDA offers a number of expedited development and review programs for qualifying product candidates. For example, the FDA has a fast track designation program that is intended to expedite or facilitate the process for reviewing new drug products that meet certain criteria. Specifically, product candidates are eligible for fast track designation if they are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the disease or condition. Fast track designation applies to the combination of the product candidate and the specific indication for which it is being studied. The sponsor of a fast track product candidate has opportunities for more frequent interactions with the applicable FDA review team during product development. With regard to a fast track product, the FDA may consider for review sections of the NDA on a rolling basis before the complete application is submitted, if the sponsor provides a schedule for the submission of the sections of the NDA, the FDA agrees to accept sections of the NDA and determines that the schedule is acceptable, and the sponsor pays any required user fees upon submission of the first section of the NDA.
A product candidate intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition may also be eligible for Breakthrough Therapy designation to expedite its development and review. A product candidate can receive Breakthrough Therapy designation if preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product candidate, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs or biologics, may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. The designation includes all of the fast track program features, as well as more intensive FDA interaction and guidance beginning as early as Phase 1 and an organizational commitment to expedite the development and review of the product candidate, including involvement of senior managers. 
Any product candidate submitted to the FDA for approval, including a product candidate with a fast track designation, may also be eligible for other types of FDA programs intended to expedite development and review, such as priority review and accelerated approval. An NDA is eligible for priority review if the product candidate has the potential to provide a significant improvement in the treatment, diagnosis or prevention of a disease compared to marketed products. The FDA will attempt to direct additional resources to the evaluation of an application for a new drug designated for priority review in an effort to facilitate the review. The FDA endeavors to review applications with priority review designations within six (6) months of the filing date as compared to ten months for review of new molecular entity NDAs under its current PDUFA review goals.
In addition, a product candidate may be eligible for accelerated approval. Drug products intended to treat serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions may be eligible for accelerated approval upon a determination that the product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require that a sponsor of a drug receiving accelerated approval perform adequate and well-controlled post-marketing clinical trials to verify and describe the anticipated effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit. Products receiving accelerated approval may be subject to expedited withdrawal procedures if the sponsor fails to conduct the required post-marketing studies or if such studies fail to verify the predicted clinical benefit. In addition, the FDA currently requires pre-approval of promotional materials as a condition for accelerated approval, which could adversely impact the timing of the commercial launch of the product.
Fast track designation, breakthrough therapy designation, priority review, and accelerated approval do not change the standards for approval, but may expedite the development or approval process. Even if a product candidate qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the product candidate no longer meets the conditions for qualification or decide that the time period for FDA review or approval will not be shortened. 
Post-approval Requirements
Any products manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to record-keeping, reporting of adverse experiences, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, and advertising and promotion of the product. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims, are subject to prior FDA review and approval. There also are continuing, annual program fees for any marketed products. Drug manufacturers and their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP, which impose certain procedural and documentation requirements upon us and our third-party manufacturers. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated, and, depending on the significance of the change, may require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting requirements upon us and any third-party manufacturers that we may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMP and other aspects of regulatory compliance.
The FDA may withdraw approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical studies to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution restrictions or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things:
•restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;
•fines, warning letters, or untitled letters;
•clinical holds on clinical studies;
•refusal of the FDA to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications, or suspension or revocation of product license approvals;
•product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products;
•consent decrees, corporate integrity agreements, debarment or exclusion from federal healthcare programs;
•mandated modification of promotional materials and labeling and the issuance of corrective information;
•the issuance of safety alerts, Dear Healthcare Provider letters, press releases and other communications containing warnings or other safety information about the product; or
•injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
The FDA closely regulates the marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of drug products. A company can make only those claims relating to safety and efficacy, purity and potency that are approved by the FDA and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses. Failure to comply with these requirements can result in, among other things, adverse publicity, warning letters, corrective advertising and potential civil and criminal penalties. Physicians may prescribe, in their independent professional medical judgment, legally available products for uses that are not described in the product’s labeling and that differ from those tested by us and approved by the FDA. Physicians may believe that such off-label uses are the best treatment for many patients in varied circumstances. The FDA does not regulate the behavior of physicians in their choice of treatments. The FDA does, however, restrict manufacturer’s communications on the subject of off-label use of their products. The federal government has levied large civil and criminal fines against companies for alleged improper promotion of off-label use and has enjoined companies from engaging in off-label promotion. The FDA and other regulatory agencies have also required that companies enter into consent decrees or permanent injunctions under which specified promotional conduct is changed or curtailed. However, companies may share truthful and not misleading information that is otherwise consistent with a product’s FDA-approved labelling.
Marketing Exclusivity
Market exclusivity provisions authorized under the FDCA can delay the submission or the approval of certain marketing applications. The FDCA provides a five-year period of non-patent marketing exclusivity within the United States to the first applicant to obtain approval of an NDA for a new chemical entity. A drug is a new chemical entity if the FDA has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the action of the drug substance. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not approve or even accept for review an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA, or an NDA submitted under Section 505(b)(2), or 505(b)(2) NDA, submitted by another company for another drug based on the same active moiety, regardless of whether the drug is intended for the same indication as the original innovative drug or for another indication, where the applicant does not own or have a legal right of reference to all the data required for approval. However, an application may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement to one of the patents listed with the FDA by the innovator NDA holder.
The FDCA alternatively provides three years of marketing exclusivity for an NDA, or supplement to an existing NDA if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application, for example new indications, dosages or strengths of an existing drug. This three-year exclusivity covers only the modification for which the drug received approval on the basis of the new clinical investigations and does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs or 505(b)(2) NDAs for drugs containing the active agent for the original indication or condition of use. Five-year and three-year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a full NDA. However, an applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to any preclinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness.
Pediatric exclusivity is another type of marketing exclusivity available in the United States. Pediatric exclusivity provides for an additional six months of marketing exclusivity attached to another period of exclusivity if a sponsor conducts clinical trials in children in response to a written request from the FDA. The issuance of a written request does not require the sponsor to undertake the described clinical trials. In addition, orphan drug exclusivity, as described above, may offer a seven-year period of marketing exclusivity, except in certain circumstances.
Foreign Government Regulation
 In addition to regulations in the United States, we are subject to a variety of regulations in other jurisdictions governing, among other things, clinical trials. 
 Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product candidate, we must obtain the requisite approvals from regulatory authorities in foreign countries prior to the commencement of clinical trials or marketing of the product candidates in those countries. The requirements and process governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. Failure to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, may be subject to, among other things, fines or operating restrictions.
Other Healthcare Laws
Pharmaceutical and medical device manufacturers are subject to additional healthcare regulation and enforcement by the federal government and by authorities in the states and foreign jurisdictions in which they conduct their business. Such laws include, without limitation, U.S. federal anti-kickback, fraud and abuse, false claims, consumer fraud, pricing reporting, and transparency laws and regulations as well as similar state and foreign laws in the jurisdictions outside the U.S. Violation of any of such laws or any other governmental regulations that apply may result in penalties, including, without limitation, significant administrative, civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, additional reporting obligations and oversight if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or other agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws, the curtailment or restructuring of operations, exclusion from participation in governmental healthcare programs and imprisonment.
Coverage and Reimbursement
Sales of any pharmaceutical product depend, in part, on the extent to which such product will be covered by third-party payors, such as federal, state and foreign government healthcare programs, commercial insurance and managed healthcare organizations, and the level of reimbursement for such product by third-party payors. Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any newly approved product. Decisions regarding the extent of coverage and amount of reimbursement to be provided are made on a plan-by-plan basis. One third-party payor’s decision to cover a particular product does not ensure that other payors will also provide coverage for the product. As a result, the coverage determination process can 
require manufactures to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of a product to each payor separately and can be a time-consuming process, with no assurance that coverage and adequate reimbursement will be applied consistently or obtained in the first instance. For products administered under the supervision of a physician, obtaining coverage and adequate reimbursement may be particularly difficult because of the higher prices often associated with such drugs. Additionally, separate reimbursement for the product itself or the treatment or procedure in which the product is used may not be available, which may impact physician utilization. In addition, companion diagnostic tests require coverage and reimbursement separate and apart from the coverage and reimbursement for their companion pharmaceutical or biological products. Similar challenges to obtaining coverage and reimbursement, applicable to pharmaceutical or biological products, will apply to companion diagnostics.
In addition, third-party payors are increasingly reducing reimbursements for pharmaceutical products and services. The U.S. government and state legislatures have continued implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on coverage and reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. Third-party payors are more and more challenging the prices charged, examining the medical necessity and reviewing the cost effectiveness of pharmaceutical products, in addition to questioning their safety and efficacy. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit sales of any product. Decreases in third-party reimbursement for any product or a decision by a third-party payor not to cover a product could reduce physician usage and patient demand for the product.
In international markets, reimbursement and healthcare payment systems vary significantly by country, and many countries have instituted price ceilings on specific products and therapies. For example, the European Union provides options for its member states to restrict the range of medicinal products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. A member state may approve a specific price for the medicinal product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the medicinal product on the market. Pharmaceutical products may face competition from lower-priced products in foreign countries that have placed price controls on pharmaceutical products and may also compete with imported foreign products. Furthermore, there is no assurance that a product will be considered medically reasonable and necessary for a specific indication, will be considered cost-effective by third-party payors, that an adequate level of reimbursement will be established even if coverage is available or that the third-party payors’ reimbursement policies will not adversely affect the ability for manufacturers to sell products profitably.
Healthcare Reform
In the United States and certain foreign jurisdictions, there have been, and we expect there will continue to be, a number of legislative and regulatory changes to the healthcare system. In March 2010, the ACA was signed into law, which substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers in the United States. By way of example, the ACA increased the minimum level of Medicaid rebates payable by manufacturers of brand name drugs from 15.1% to 23.1%; required collection of rebates for drugs paid by Medicaid managed care organizations; imposed a non-deductible annual fee on pharmaceutical manufacturers or importers who sell certain “branded prescription drugs” to specified federal government programs, implemented a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted, or injected; expanded eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs; created a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research; and established a Center for Medicare Innovation at CMS to test innovative payment and service delivery models to lower Medicare and Medicaid spending, potentially including prescription drug spending.
Since its enactment, there have been judicial, executive and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the ACA. On June 17, 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court dismissed the most recent judicial challenge to the ACA brought by several states without specifically ruling on the constitutionality of the ACA. Prior to the Supreme Court’s decision, President Biden issued an executive order initiating a special enrollment period from February 15, 2021 through August 15, 2021 for purposes of obtaining health insurance coverage through the ACA marketplace. The executive order also instructed certain governmental agencies to review and reconsider their existing policies and rules that limit access to healthcare.
Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the ACA was enacted, including aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year and reduced payments to several types of Medicare providers, which will remain in effect through 2030, with the exception of a temporary suspension from May 1, 2020 through March 31, 2022, absent additional congressional action. Moreover, there has recently been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which has resulted in several Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted legislation designed, among other things, to bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship 
between pricing and manufacturer patient programs and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for pharmaceutical products. In addition, individual states in the United States have also become increasingly active in implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures and, in some cases, mechanisms to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. Furthermore, there has been increased interest by third party payors and governmental authorities in reference pricing systems and publication of discounts and list prices.
Data Privacy and Security Laws
Numerous state, federal and foreign laws, regulations and standards govern the collection, use, access to, confidentiality and security of health-related and other personal information, and could apply now or in the future to our operations or the operations of our partners. In the United States, numerous federal and state laws and regulations, including data breach notification laws, health information privacy and security laws and consumer protection laws and regulations govern the collection, use, disclosure, and protection of health-related and other personal information. In addition, certain foreign laws govern the privacy and security of personal data, including health-related data. For example, the European Union General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR imposes strict requirements for processing the personal data of individuals within the European Economic Area, or EEA, which consists of the 27 EU member states plus Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway. Companies that must comply with the GDPR face increased compliance obligations and risk, including more robust regulatory enforcement of data protection requirements and potential fines for noncompliance of up to €20 million or 4% of the annual global revenues of the noncompliant company, whichever is greater. Further, from January 1, 2021, companies have had to comply with the GDPR and also the United Kingdom GDPR, or UK GDPR, which, together with the amended UK Data Protection Act 2018, retains the GDPR in UK national law. The UK GDPR mirrors the fines under the GDPR, i.e., fines up to the greater of €20 million (£17.5 million) or 4% of global turnover. Privacy and security laws, regulations, and other obligations are constantly evolving, may conflict with each other to complicate compliance efforts, and can result in investigations, proceedings, or actions that lead to significant civil and/or criminal penalties and restrictions on data processing.
FDA Approval and Regulation of Companion Diagnostics
If safe and effective use of a therapeutic depends on an in vitro diagnostic, then the FDA generally will require approval or clearance of that diagnostic, known as a companion diagnostic, at the same time that the FDA approves the therapeutic product. In August 2014, the FDA issued final guidance clarifying the requirements that will apply to approval of therapeutic products and in vitro companion diagnostics. According to the guidance, if FDA determines that a companion diagnostic device is essential to the safe and effective use of a novel therapeutic product or indication, FDA generally will not approve the therapeutic product or new therapeutic product indication if the companion diagnostic device is not approved or cleared for that indication. Approval or clearance of the companion diagnostic device will ensure that the device has been adequately evaluated and has adequate performance characteristics in the intended population. The review of in vitro companion diagnostics in conjunction with the review of our therapeutic treatments for cancer will, therefore, likely involve coordination of review by the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research and the FDA’s Center for Devices and Radiological Health Office of In Vitro Diagnostics and Radiological Health.
Under the FDCA, in vitro diagnostics, including companion diagnostics, are regulated as medical devices. In the United States, the FDCA and its implementing regulations, and other federal and state statutes and regulations govern, among other things, medical device design and development, preclinical and clinical testing, premarket clearance or approval, registration and listing, manufacturing, labeling, storage, advertising and promotion, sales and distribution, export and import, and post-market surveillance. Unless an exemption applies, diagnostic tests require marketing clearance or approval from the FDA prior to commercial distribution. The two primary types of FDA marketing authorization applicable to a medical device are premarket notification, also called 510(k) clearance, and premarket approval, or PMA approval.
The PMA process, including the gathering of clinical and preclinical data and the submission to and review by the FDA, can take several years or longer. It involves a rigorous premarket review during which the applicant must prepare and provide the FDA with reasonable assurance of the device’s safety and effectiveness and information about the device and its components regarding, among other things, device design, manufacturing and labeling. PMA applications are subject to an application fee. In addition, PMAs for certain devices must generally include the results from extensive preclinical and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to establish the safety and effectiveness of the device for each indication for which FDA approval is sought. In particular, for a diagnostic, a PMA application typically requires data regarding analytical and clinical validation studies. As part of the PMA review, the FDA will typically inspect the manufacturer’s facilities for compliance with 
the Quality System Regulation, or QSR, which imposes elaborate testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance requirements.
PMA approval is not guaranteed, and the FDA may ultimately respond to a PMA submission with a not approvable determination based on deficiencies in the application and require additional clinical trial or other data that may be expensive and time-consuming to generate and that can substantially delay approval. If the FDA’s evaluation of the PMA application is favorable, the FDA typically issues an approvable letter requiring the applicant’s agreement to specific conditions, such as changes in labeling, or specific additional information, such as submission of final labeling, in order to secure final approval of the PMA. If the FDA’s evaluation of the PMA or manufacturing facilities is not favorable, the FDA will deny approval of the PMA or issue a not approvable letter. A not approvable letter will outline the deficiencies in the application and, where practical, will identify what is necessary to make the PMA approvable. The FDA may also determine that additional clinical trials are necessary, in which case the PMA approval may be delayed for several months or years while the trials are conducted and then the data submitted in an amendment to the PMA. If the FDA concludes that the applicable criteria have been met, the FDA will issue a PMA for the approved indications, which can be more limited than those originally sought by the applicant. The PMA can include post-approval conditions that the FDA believes necessary to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device, including, among other things, restrictions on labeling, promotion, sale and distribution. Once granted, PMA approval may be withdrawn by the FDA if compliance with post approval requirements, conditions of approval or other regulatory standards are not maintained or problems are identified following initial marketing.
After a device is placed on the market, it remains subject to significant regulatory requirements. Medical devices may be marketed only for the uses and indications for which they are cleared or approved. Device manufacturers must also establish registration and device listings with the FDA. A medical device manufacturer’s manufacturing processes and those of its suppliers are required to comply with the applicable portions of the QSR, which cover the methods and documentation of the design, testing, production, processes, controls, quality assurance, labeling, packaging and shipping of medical devices. Domestic facility records and manufacturing processes are subject to periodic unscheduled inspections by the FDA. The FDA also may inspect foreign facilities that export products to the United States.
