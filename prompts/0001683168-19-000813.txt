ITEM 1. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS.
OVERVIEW
 
We are a Hong Kong based specialty commercial logistic company and an online to offline membership loyalty program marketer and operator. Our specialty commercial logistic company operates through Lee Tat Transportation Int’l Limited, our wholly owned Hong Kong subsidiary (“Lee Tat”), and provide timely and reliable logistics and delivery services to commercial clients located in Hong Kong. We offer service to the cable supply industry in Hong Kong, and expect to provide small parcel delivery service in cities near Shanghai in the near future. Lee Tat was organized as a private limited liability company on August 11, 2014, in Hong Kong. We acquired Lee Tat on May 12, 2017.
 
We previously offered an online to offline (O2O) vehicle purchasing platform solution through COSG Car International Limited, a Hong Kong private limited company (“Car International”) and Foshan Cosmos Xi Yue Car Rental Co. Ltd a wholly foreign owned entity (“WFOE”), whereby we marketed and sold an online to offline loyalty membership program that allowed members to purchase competitively priced goods and services, with the intent of developing an ecosystem that would provide our members with discounted products and services relating to vehicle purchasing, leasing, and maintenance and other services. Concurrently, we also intended to build a business ecosystem from the big data obtained from our members and other participants of our O2O platform. With the dismissal of Ms. Peng, the termination of the Car Rental Collaboration Agreement on July 15, 2018, and the subsequent sale of the WFOE on September 30, 2018, we terminated our future car purchasing and investment vehicle leasing services business.

Our corporate organization chart is below.
 


We reported a net income of $5,800 and a net loss of $127,642 for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. We had current assets of $66,245 and $370,248 as of December 31, 2018 and 2017. Our auditors have prepared our financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 assuming that we will continue as a going concern. Our continuation as a going concern is dependent upon improving our profitability and the continuing financial support from our stockholders. Our sources of capital in the past have included advances from directors and related parties as well as the sale of equity securities, which include common stock sold in private transactions and short-term and long-term debts.
 
We are organized under the laws of the State of Nevada as a holding company that conducts its business through subsidiaries organized under the laws of foreign jurisdictions such as Hong Kong. This may have an adverse impact on the ability of U.S. investors to enforce a judgment obtained in U.S. Courts against these entities, or to effect service of process on the officers and directors managing the foreign subsidiaries.
 
History
 
We were incorporated in the state of Nevada on August 14, 1987, under the name Shur De Cor, Inc. and engaged in developing certain mining claims. In April 1999, Shur De Cor merged with Interactive Marketing Technology, a New Jersey corporation that was engaged in the business of developing and direct marketing of consumer products. As the surviving company, Shur De Cor changed its name to Interactive Marketing Techology, Inc. Shur De Cor's then management resigned and the management of Interactive New Jersey became the Company’s management. The prior management of Shur De Cor retained Shur De Cor’s business and assets. After that acquisition, the Company, through a wholly owned subsidiary, IMT's Plumber, Inc., produced, marketed, and sold a licensed product called the Plumber's Secret, which was discontinued in fiscal 2001. In May 2002, the Company ceased to actively pursue its product development and marketing business and actively sought to either acquire a third party, merge with a third party or pursue a joint venture with a third party in order to re-enter its former business of development and direct marketing of proprietary consumer products in the United States and worldwide.

On November 17, 2004, the Company acquired MPL, a company organized under the laws of the British Virgin Islands, and its subsidiaries in accordance with the terms of a Share Exchange Agreement executed by the parties (the “2004 Agreement”). In connection with the acquisition, the Company issued an aggregate of 109,623,006 shares of its common stock to Imperial International Limited, a company incorporated under the laws of the British Virgin Islands (“Imperial”), the sole shareholder of MPL, in exchange for 100% of the issued and outstanding shares of MPL capital stock (the "2004 Share Exchange"). Upon completion of the share exchange, MPL became the Company's wholly owned subsidiary and the Company’s former owner transferred control of the Company to Imperial. The Company relied on Rule 506 of Regulation D of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Act"), in regard to the shares that we issued pursuant to the 2004 Share Exchange. The Company treated this transaction as a qualified "business combination" as defined by Rule 501(d). The Company relied on the exemption from registration pursuant to Section 4(2) of, and or Regulation D promulgated under, the Act in issuing the Company’s securities.
 
In connection with the 2004 Share Exchange, the Company: (i) changed its name from Interactive Marketing Technology, Inc. to China Artists Agency, Inc. ("China Artists"); (ii) obtained a new stock symbol, "CAAY", and CUSIP Number, effective on December 21, 2004; (iii) increased its authorized common stock to 200,000,000 shares; (iv) effectuated a 1 for 1.69 reverse stock split; and (v) spun off the Company’s existing business into a separate public company, All Star Marketing, Inc., a Nevada corporation ("All Star"). All Star was formed as a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. The Spin-off was satisfied by means of a pro-rata share dividend to the Company's shareholders of record as of December 10, 2004. The purpose of the Spin-Off was to allow the subsidiary to operate as a separate public company and raise working capital through the sale of its own equity. This allowed the Company’s management to focus on its business, while at the same time, allowing the spun-off company to have greater exposure by trading as an independent public company. Additionally, the shareholders and the market would then more easily identify the results and performance of the Company as a separate entity from that of All Star. In August 2005, the Company changed its name to China Entertainment Group, Inc. and, effective August 9, 2005, obtained a new stock symbol "CGRP", and CUSIP Number.
 
Because the Company failed to generate revenues in its new business, prior management commenced litigation in the Superior Court for Los Angeles County California which action was removed to the United States District Court for the Central District of California Case No. CV07-1068 GHK. On January 30, 2008, the parties entered into a Settlement Agreement and Conditional Release (the “Settlement Agreement”), pursuant to which, among other things, the Company’s former management reacquired control of the Company and all assets related to the Chinese entertainment business were transferred out of the Company. The Company, under its former management, once again entered the business of locating products to develop and mass market. These efforts did not prove fruitful and the Company, while continuing its product development business, also began to seek another business to acquire.
 
Effective July 22, 2010, the Company merged with Safe and Secure TV Channel, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (the “Merger”). In connection with the Merger, the management of the Company resigned and was replaced by the management and principals of Safe and Secure TV Channel, LLC. The holders of interests in Safe and Secure TV Channel, LLC exchanged their interests for approximately 50.2% of the issued and outstanding stock of the Company. In September 2010, the Company effectuated a 9.85 for one stock split to shareholders of record as of August 23, 2010. After the Merger, the Company became a television network and multimedia information and distribution company focused on serving the homeland security and emergency preparedness industry.
 
On February 15, 2016, the Company sold to Asia Cosmos Group Limited, a private limited liability company incorporated under the laws of British Virgin Islands (“ACOSG”), 10,000,000 shares of its common stock at a per share price of $0.027. ACOSG’s sole shareholder is Miky Wan. The Company relied on the exemption from registration pursuant to Section 4(2) of, and Regulation D and/or Regulation S promulgated under the Act in selling the Company’s securities to ACOSG.
 
In connection with the private placement to ACOSG, a change of control occurred and Bryan Glass resigned from his position as President, Secretary, Treasurer and Chairman of the Company. Miky Wan was appointed to serve as Chief Executive Officer, Chief Operating Officer, President and Director, effective February 19, 2016. Peter Tong, our Chief Financial Officer, Secretary and director continued in his positions with the Company. Calvin K.W. Lai, Anthony H.H. Chan, Jenher Jeng, Alice K.M. Tang, Connie Y.M. Kwok were appointed to serve on our Board of Directors effective February 19, 2016. Effective February 26, 2016, the Company changed its name to Cosmos Group Holdings Inc. and filed a Certificate of Amendment to such effect with the Nevada Secretary of State. The name change and the related stock symbol change to “COSG” were approved by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority on March 31, 2016. The Company also increased the number of its authorized common stock, par value $0.001, from 90,000,0000 shares to 500,000,000 and its preferred stock, par value $0.001, from 10,000,000 to 30,000,000 shares. After the private placement, the Company shifted its business plan to focus on acquiring undervalued companies including those in the Greater China region.

On September 27, 2016, Peter Tong and Calvin Lai resigned from all of their positions with the Company. Connie Y.M. Kwok was appointed to serve as the Secretary and Miky Wan, our Chief Executive Officer, was appointed to serve as the interim Chief Financial Officer.
 
On January 13, 2017, the Company sold 200,000,000 shares of its common stock to ACOSG at a per share price of $0.001 per share for aggregate consideration of US $200,000. The Company relied on the exemption from registration pursuant to Section 4(2) of, and Regulation D and/or Regulation S promulgated under the Act in selling the Company’s securities to ACOSG.
 
Acquisition of Lee Tat, Our Logistics Business
 
On May 12, 2017, we acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of Lee Tat from Mr. Koon Wing CHEUNG, Lee Tat’s sole shareholder, in exchange for 219,222,938 shares of our issued and outstanding common stock. In connection with the Lee Tat acquisition, Miky Wan resigned from her positions as Chief Executive Officer and Chief Operating Officer and Koon Wing CHEUNG and Yongwei HU were appointed to serve as our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Operating Officer, respectively, and also as our directors. In addition, Anthony H.H. CHAN and Alice K. M. TANG resigned from their positions as directors, and Zhigang LIAO and Weiming CHEN were appointed to fill the vacancies created by their resignations. The Company relied on the exemption from registration pursuant to Section 4(2) of, and Regulation D and/or Regulation S promulgated under the Act in selling the Company’s securities to the shareholders of Lee Tat.
Termination of Our Vehicle Sales and Leasing Business
 
Our original business plan was to develop an ecosystem to address the entire vehicle purchasing, leasing and maintenance process. Our former cooperation partner, Foshan YY Car Rental Limited (“YY”), was an integral part of our ability to offer future car purchasing services and investment vehicle leasing services. Effective July 15, 2018, our Board of Directors dismissed Huan-Ting Peng, our Chief Operating Officer and the statutory representative of our WFOE, from all of her positions with the company and its subsidiaries and affiliated entities. Miky Wan, our President, interim Chief Financial Officer and Director, was concurrently appointed to fill the vacancies created by Ms. Peng’s removal and to serve as our Chief Operating Officer and statutory representative of WFOE. Concurrently with the dismissal of Ms. Peng, our Board of Directors also terminated the Car Rental Collaboration Agreement with YY. Ms. Peng owns approximately 51%of YY and is an officer and executive director of YY.
 
On September 30, 2018, we sold all of our interests in COSG International to Lilun Gan, an unaffiliated third party, for cash consideration of Ten Thousand Dollars (US$10,000), which is the stated value of COSG International. COSG International was our wholly owned subsidiary and investment holding company that held all of the issued and outstanding securities of WFOE. We operated our future car purchasing and investment vehicle leasing services and memberships through WFOE. The sale of our interests in COSG International represented the cessation of our future car purchasing and investment vehicle leasing services business.
 
Current Plan
 
We intend to continue operating and marketing our membership program, which we intend to broaden beyond vehicle related services. The termination of our former core product and services may materially and adversely our ability to explore or retain memberships and or develop an ecosystem that will provide our members with discounted products and services. Management is reassessing its ability to proceed with its business and is in active discussions to explore another operating company to expand the diversity of business operations.
Reverse Stock Split
 
Effective February 6, 2018, we engaged in a 1:20 reverse split of our common stock so that each twenty shares of issued and outstanding common stock were exchanged for one share.

Market Overview 
 
The Logistics Market 
 
According to the Research by HKTDC published in Aug 2018, the logistic market of Hong Kong and China will be benefited by the below factors:
 
Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macau Bay Area Development
 
The Greater Bay Area development allows integration of transport networks in the region, including air cargo, ground transportation and warehousing services. Not only Hong Kong, but the four neighboring airports in the mainland have seen rapid growth in terms of air cargo logistics. Service providers can now work together more closely to seize opportunities and build a strategic co-operation platform for air transport. The Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge (HKZMB), a large-scale cross-border infrastructure linking the three places, is expected to improve connections between cities and make journeys between them quicker. We expect cargo movement between Hong Kong and western PRD to be further enhanced.
E-commerce Opportunities
 
E-commerce represents a competitive pressure to traditional brick and mortar retailers, but it has also created enormous opportunities for air cargo. Consumers demand for speed and reliability and air cargo services would have a significant advantage. According to Airports Council International, the 8% expansion in total cargo handled at all airports worldwide and the 10% growth in international freight in 2017 were mainly driven by e-commerce. However, online retail accounts for less than 10% of total retail sales worldwide, which indicates that there is still huge potential for e-commerce as a future growth driver for the air cargo industry. Air cargo is also likely to be bolstered by the improvement in Asia’s overall manufacturing capability and the continuing shift to Asia of the production of high-value goods. Goods such as telecom equipment and electronic devices and parts are always transported by air, as product life cycles shorten.
Technology Trends
 
New technologies play an increasingly important role for the logistics industry to improve its operational efficiency. The adoption of automatic identification and data capture (AIDC) technology, which enables users to gain automatic access to information, as well as identify, collect and store data directly to a computer system, is expected to become more prevalent as radio frequency identification (RFID) sensors and Bluetooth technology are implemented throughout the industry. Robotics will also be an important logistics technology trend in the near future. Amazon acquired Kiva Systems back in 2012 and it’s now known as Amazon Robotics. This will result in increased usage of robots in logistics and warehouse operations such as parking and picking. The rising of the Internet of Things (IoT) will also encourage the adoption of mobile apps among logistics service providers which can be used for tracking and customer service interactions.
Membership Business
 
According to 2017 Report on Consumption of Fee-Paying Members in China’s Retail Industry, at present, the stores that are operated as member stores, such as METRO and Yonghui Membership Experience Stores, have not charged membership fees. As the consumers’ demand for services and quality grows, we believe the acceptability of fee-paying membership will increase and market conditions gradually become mature. In recent years, some e-commerce platforms have begun to try fee-paying membership with an annual fee ranging from 100 and 400 yuan. The main benefits that these platforms provide for their members are discounts and shipping deductions / coupons, etc. Some platforms also attract members by offering better services such as exclusive customer service and free e-books.

Our Business
 
Logistics Business
 
Lee Tat Transportation Int’l Limited was originally formed as a sole proprietorship in August 11, 1995, and was incorporated on August 11, 2014. Prior to our acquisition, Lee Tat was wholly owned by Koon Wing CHEUNG, its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer. Lee Tat initially provided express delivery for commercial clients, delivering small goods to factories and offices in Hong Kong. In 2016, Lee Tat’s conducted its business solely in Hong Kong.
 
In 2005 in response to the relocation of many local factories to mainland China, we began to focus on providing express delivery and logistic services to local cable and data equipment suppliers, delivering goods to their customers such as construction companies. Hong Kong is a well-developed city with respect to wireless and telecom communication. Because the useful life of cable is 5-10 years and data equipment is 3 years, there is a high demand for equipment replacement. As most of the repairing work happens in night-time, many small and medium cable suppliers outsource to logistic companies to deliver their products to their customers. We currently serve up to 70% of cable suppliers and cable trading companies in Hong Kong and deliver cable wire material to different contracting sites.
 
We provide our delivery services through direct delivery (Direct Model) and through our network of subcontractors (Network Model) as well as other custom value-added logistics services. In Hong Kong, we direct deliver small goods and primarily work with six network business sub-contractors to find the most competitive partner to deliver our client’s cable products. The lifecycle of a typical delivery is briefly described below.
 
Work flow of a typical delivery
 
Step 1: Parcel Pickup.
 
Our courier team collects the parcel from the sender once it receives a delivery order. Unless the sender chooses pay-at-arrival service, our pickup team collects the delivery service fee from the sender at the time of pickup. The pickup team collects and sends the parcels to our centralized control sorting hub in Zuzhau twice per day. Typically, parcels that are picked up before 9 a.m. will be shipped to the hub on the same day. Through each waybill, we assign a unique tracking number and corresponding barcode to each parcel. The waybills, coupled with our automated systems, allow us to track the status of each individual parcel throughout the entire pickup, sorting and delivery process.
Step 2: Parcel Sorting and Transportation.
 
Upon receipt of parcels shipped from various pickup outlets within its coverage area, the sorting hub sorts, further packs and dispatches the parcels to the destination by the courier team. Barcodes on each waybill attached to the parcels are scanned as they go through each sorting and transportation gateway allowing us to track the progress of each parcel.
Step 3: Parcel Delivery.
 
Parcels are then delivered to the recipients by our network delivery team. Once the recipient signs on the waybill to confirm receipt, a full service cycle is completed and the settlement of delivery service fee promptly ensues on our network payment settlement system.
 
Pricing determination 
 
Pricing of our services is based on our operating costs, service requested, fees assessed by our network partners, market conditions and competition. We participate in a fee sharing arrangement in which the pickup and delivery outlets share the delivery service fees of each delivery order. When we deliver through our network partners, we allocate a portion of the services fees, or network transit fees, to our network partners for express delivery services. The fee typically consists of a fixed amount for a waybill attached to each parcel and a variable per parcel amount based on parcel weight and route. Historically, delivery service fees charged by our network partners have experienced declines due in part to market competition. Based on the market conditions and our cost base, we may evaluate and adjust our service pricing from time to time. The average revenue of a typical parcel delivery is US$102.

We leverage our subcontractor network to reduce costs and generate fees. Before initiating deliveries through our network partners, we are able to search through our system to compare and find the most competitive pricing for pick up and last mile deliveries. This arrangement allows us to control our per parcel costs. Because our network is transparent, our delivery subcontractors are able to directly connect with other member logistic service suppliers. When these third parties directly connect, we benefit through fee rebates provided by our network partner, Suzhou Hexie Yuantong Logistic Company Limited. We facilitate these connections by providing information and guidance on valuation of the transferred business with participation by both sides.
 
In light of the competitive nature of our market, we believe that our success will depend upon the reliability and quality of services provided and cost management. As a general matter, we strive to maintain high quality services and meet customer satisfaction. We believe that we have established systems and procedures to achieve service standardization and quality control over the services provided by us and our network partners. We constantly monitor and seek to improve on a series of key service quality indicators such as delivery delay rate, complaint rate and damaged parcel rate. Further, we believe that our focus on the cable and data equipment industry provides a competitive advantage that has enabled us to provide valued added services to better able to meet the specific needs of our customers.
 
Challenges From Our China Expansion 
 
Effective May 1, 2017, and expiring April 30, 2022, we agreed to provide certain logistics and delivery services to Shanghai Yunda Cargo Company Limited (“Yunda”), in accordance with the terms of that certain Lee Tat Transportation Service Contract, of the Transportation Service Contract. Pursuant to the agreement, Yunda agrees to provide to us not less than RMB 12 million (US $1.76 million) of revenue from cargo business per year. We expect to provide cross-border delivery and logistics services in Shanghai and nearby cities pursuant to the terms of the Transportation Service Contract. The foregoing description of the Transportation Service Contract is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Transportation Service Contract, which is filed as Exhibit 10.1 to this Registration Statement and incorporated herein by reference.
 
We began operations in China in or around June 2017. Our business model in China was premised upon the growth in parcel deliveries arising from the expected growth of the e-commerce business in China. We expected to service this growth by: (i) providing door-to-door cross-border and domestic logistics service for small goods deliveries; and (ii) relying on network partners to reach and serve fragmented and geographically dispersed merchants and consumers to support the expected growth of e-commerce businesses in China. We hoped to compete based upon operational efficiency and cost management. Within our network of subcontractors, we expected be able to compare and select the most competitive price for pickup and last-mile delivery services. This would allow us to lower our cost per parcel. Furthermore, relying on subcontractors would allow us to minimize fixed costs and capital requirements, consequently driving higher return on invested capital and equity.
 
Despite our business development efforts, we have not achieved the expected volume of business from Shanghai or the growth in our China operations. As a result, we expect to consolidate our operations in Hong Kong in the foreseeable future as we continue to assess our performance in China.
 
During the course of our business, we have collected data relating to consumer behavior. We hope to develop a proprietary database and provide data analytics regarding consumer behavior in the commercial logistics and vehicle sales and leasing industries. We believe that we can leverage this database and accompanying analytics to refine our product and services offerings as well as provide relevant industry knowledge.
 
Sales and Marketing.
 
Logistics Segment
 
We expect to continue to focus on providing express delivery and logistic services to cable and data equipment suppliers in Hong Kong and may be seeking other opportunities in China. We anticipate focusing on business to business marketing, cold callings or attending local chamber of commerce events to obtain customers. In the near future, we expect to focus on consolidating our Hong Kong operations. We do not have any current intention to further develop our logistics business segment at this time.

O2O Membership Business; Challenges
 
We attract customers for our O2O Membership business from internal marketing efforts, business relationships of our executive management team, and through cooperation partners. Due to the termination of our future car purchasing and investment vehicle leasing services business and the sale of WFOE, we are no longer a party to the cooperation agreements with Foshan Shen Fan Technology, an O2O servicing company. In light of these challenges, we are assessing the viability of our O2O business plan and our ability to manage, operate and develop our remaining membership business.
Major Customers.
 
All of our major customers are located in Hong Kong. During the year ended December 31, 2018, and 2017, the following customers accounted for 10% or more of our total net revenues:

 | Year ended December 31, 2018 | | December 31, 2018 
-----------------------------------+------------------------------+---------+------------------------
 | Revenues | | Percentage of revenues | | Accounts receivable 
Hip Tung Cables Company Limited | $ | 352,628 | | 48% | | $ | 25,776
Peaceman Cable Engineering Limited | | 258,689 | | 35% | | | 17,151
TOTAL | | 611,317 | | 83% | | | 42,927


 | Year ended December 31, 2017 | | December 31, 2017 
-----------------------------------+------------------------------+---------+------------------------
 | Revenues | | Percentage of revenues | | Accounts receivable 
Peaceman Cable Engineering Limited | $ | 295,534 | | 38% | | $ | –
Hip Tung Cables Company Limited | | 183,390 | | 24% | | | –
TOTAL | | 478,924 | | 62% | | | –

 
We have a delivery operations team in Hong Kong consisting of two trucks, two drivers, and three network partners that pick up stocks for us and complete the delivery process. Generally, we are not a party to any long-term agreements with our customers. From time to time, we may enter into long term contracts similar to the Transportation Service with major customers and subcontract the performance of the performance of the contract to corresponding network partner according to the price and area.
  
Major Network Partners.
 
All of our major vendors are located in Hong Kong. For the year ended December 31, 2018, one vendor, Po Won Transportation Company Limited, represented more than 10% of the Company’s operating cost. This vendor accounted for 12% of the Company’s operating cost amounting to $72,211 with $5,230 of accounts payable.
 
Effective July 15, 2018, our Board of Directors dismissed Huan-Ting Peng, our Chief Operating Officer and the statutory representative of our WFOE, from all of her positions with the company and its subsidiaries and affiliated entities. Concurrently with the dismissal of Ms. Peng, our Board of Directors also terminated the Car Rental Collaboration Agreement with YY, a key network partner for our vehicle sales and leasing business. Ms. Peng owns approximately 51% of YY and is an officer and executive director of YY. As a result of this termination, we ceased our future car purchasing and investment vehicle leasing services business.

On September 17, 2018, we entered into the Agreement for Sale and Purchase of Shares in COSG International Holdings Limited, a British Virgin Islands limited liability company, pursuant to which we agreed to sell all of our interests in COSG International to Lilun Gan, an unaffiliated third party, for cash consideration of Ten Thousand Dollars (US$10,000), which is the stated value of COSG International. The sale consummated on September 30, 2018.
 
COSG International was our wholly owned subsidiary and investment holding company that held all of the issued and outstanding securities of WFOE. We operated our future car purchasing and investment vehicle leasing services and memberships through WFOE. The sale of our interests in COSG International represents the cessation of our future car purchasing and investment vehicle leasing services business.
 
Seasonality. 
 
Our logistics business is highly dependent upon the e-commerce industry in Hong Kong and China. In Hong Kong and China, we experience peak demand for our services during the double eleven festival and the Chinese New Year celebrations.
Insurance.
 
We maintain certain insurance in accordance customary industry practices in Hong Kong. Under Hong Kong law it is a requirement that all employers in the city must purchase Employee's Compensation Insurance to cover their liability in the event that their staff suffers an injury or illness during the normal course of their work. Lee Tat maintains Employee’s Compensation Insurance, vehicle insurance and third party risks insurance for the business purposes.
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND PATENTS
 
We expect to rely on, trade secrets, copyrights, know-how, trademarks, license agreements and contractual provisions to establish our intellectual property rights and protect our brand and services. These legal means, however, afford only limited protection and may not adequately protect our rights. Litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights, protect our trade secrets or determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others. Litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and management attention.
 
In addition, the laws of Hong Kong and the PRC may not protect our brand and services and intellectual property to the same extent as U.S. laws, if at all. We may be unable to fully protect our intellectual property rights in these countries.
 
We intend to seek the widest possible protection for significant product and process developments in our major markets through a combination of trade secrets, trademarks, copyrights and patents, if applicable. We anticipate that the form of protection will vary depending upon the level of protection afforded by the particular jurisdiction. We expect that our revenue will be derived principally from our operations in Hong Kong and China where intellectual property protection may be limited and difficult to enforce. In such instances, we may seek protection of our intellectual property through measures taken to increase the confidentiality of our findings.
 
We intend to register trademarks as a means of protecting the brand names of our companies and products. We intend protect our trademarks against infringement and also seek to register design protection where appropriate.
 
We rely on trade secrets and unpatentable know-how that we seek to protect, in part, by confidentiality agreements. We expect that, where applicable, we will require our employees to execute confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of employment with us. We expect these agreements to provide that all confidential information developed or made known to the individual during the course of the individual's relationship with us is to be kept confidential and not disclosed to third parties except in specific limited circumstances. The agreements will also provide that all inventions conceived by the individual while rendering services to us shall be assigned to us as the exclusive property of our company. There can be no assurance, however, that all persons who we desire to sign such agreements will sign, or if they do, that these agreements will not be breached, that we would have adequate remedies for any breach, or that our trade secrets or unpatentable know-how will not otherwise become known or be independently developed by competitors.

COMPETITION
 
We operate in a highly competitive and fragmented industry that is sensitive to price and service. We compete with leading domestic express delivery companies including SF Express, STO Express, YTO Express, Yunda Express and EMS. We also compete with international logistics companies such as federal express and DHL. We may in the future compete against major e-commerce platforms, such as Alibaba and JD.com, if they elect to build or further develop in-house delivery capabilities to serve their logistics needs. On the other hand, for the membership platform we held. We expect to compete against some existing program like Amazon Prime and Alibaba 88VIP. Some of our current and prospective competitors have greater financial resources, broader product and service offerings, longer operating histories, larger customer base and greater brand recognition, or they are controlled or subsidized by foreign governments, which enable them to raise capital and enter into strategic relationships more easily. We seek to compete on the basis of a number of factors, including business model, operational capabilities, pricing and service quality.
EMPLOYEE
 
We employ four persons, including our Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Cheung, one driver and two full time administrative staff members in Hong Kong as set forth below:

Marketing operator | 1
---------------------+--
Logistic team | 2
Administration Staff | 1
Total | 4

 
We are required to contribute to the MPF for all eligible employees in Hong Kong between the ages of eighteen and sixty five. We are required to contribute a specified percentage of the participant’s income based on their ages and wage level. For the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, the MPF contributions by us were $4,567 and $7,701, respectively. We have not experienced any significant labor disputes or any difficulties in recruiting staff for our operations.
 
GOVERNMENT AND INDUSTRY REGULATIONS

Employment Contracts
 
The Employment Contract Law was promulgated by the National People’s Congress’ Standing Committee on June 29, 2007 and took effect on January 1, 2008. The Employment Contract Law governs labor relations and employment contracts (including the entry into, performance, amendment, termination and determination of employment contracts) between domestic enterprises (including foreign-invested companies), individual economic organizations and private non-enterprise units (collectively referred to as the “employers”) and their employees.
 
a.       Execution of employment contracts
 
Under the Employment Contract Law, an employer is required to execute written employment contracts with its employees within one month from the commencement of employment. In the event of contravention, an employee is entitled to receive double salary for the period during which the employer fails to execute an employment contract. If an employer fails to execute an employment contract for more than 12 months from the commencement of the employee’s employment, an employment contract would be deemed to have been entered into between the employer and employee for a non-fixed term.
 
b.       Right to non-fixed term contracts
 
Under the Employment Contract Law, an employee may request for a non-fixed term contract without an employer’s consent to renew. In addition, an employee is also entitled to a non-fixed term contract with an employer if he has completed two fixed term employment contracts with such employer; however, such employee must not have committed any breach or have been subject to any disciplinary actions during his employment. Unless the employee requests to enter into a fixed term contract, an employer who fails to enter into a non-fixed term contract pursuant to the Employment Contract Law is liable to pay the employee double salary from the date the employment contract is renewed.
 
c.       Compensation for termination or expiry of employment contracts
 
Under the Employment Contract Law, employees are entitled to compensation upon the termination or expiry of an employment contract. Employees are entitled to compensation even in the event the employer (i) has been declared bankrupt; (ii) has its business license revoked; (iii) has been ordered to cease or withdraw its business; or (iv) has been voluntarily liquidated. Where an employee has been employed for more than one year, the employee will be entitled to such compensation equivalent to one month’s salary for every completed year of service. Where an employee has employed for less than one year, such employee will be deemed to have completed one full year of service.
 
d.       Trade union and collective employment contracts
 
Under the Employment Contract Law, a trade union may seek arbitration and litigation to resolve any dispute arising from a collective employment contract; provided that such dispute failed to be settled through negotiations. The Employment Contract Law also permits a trade union to enter into a collective employee contract with an employer on behalf of all the employees.
 
Where a trade union has not been formed, a representative appointed under the recommendation of a high-level trade union may execute the collective employment contract. Within districts below county level, collective employment contracts for industries such as those engaged in construction, mining, food and beverage and those from the service sector, etc., may be executed on behalf of employees by the representatives from the trade union of each respective industry. Alternatively, a district-based collective employment contract may be entered into.

Foreign Exchange Control and Administration
 
Foreign exchange in China is primarily regulated by:
 

• | The Foreign Currency Administration Rules (1996), as amended; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The Administration Rules of the Settlement, Sale and Payment of Foreign Exchange (1996), or the Administration Rules.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Under the Foreign Currency Administration Rules, if documents certifying the purposes of the conversion of RMB into foreign currency are submitted to the relevant foreign exchange conversion bank, the RMB will be convertible for current account items, including the distribution of dividends, interest and royalties payments, and trade and service-related foreign exchange transactions. Conversion of RMB for capital account items, such as direct investment, loans, securities investment and repatriation of investment, however, is subject to the approval of SAFE or its local counterpart.
 
Under the Administration Rules for the Settlement, Sale and Payment of Foreign Exchange, foreign-invested enterprises may only buy, sell and/or remit foreign currencies at banks authorized to conduct foreign exchange business after providing valid commercial documents and, in the case of capital account item transactions, obtaining approval from SAFE or its local counterpart.
 
As an offshore holding company with a PRC subsidiary, we may (i) make additional capital contributions to our PRC subsidiaries, (ii) establish new PRC subsidiaries and make capital contributions to these new PRC subsidiaries, (iii) make loans to our PRC subsidiaries or consolidated affiliated entities, or (iv) acquire offshore entities with business operations in China in offshore transactions. However, most of these uses are subject to PRC regulations and approvals. For example:
 

• | capital contributions to our PRC subsidiaries, whether existing or newly established ones, must be approved by the Ministry of Commerce or its local counterparts;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | loans by us to our PRC subsidiaries, each of which is a foreign-invested enterprise, to finance their activities cannot exceed statutory limits and must be registered with SAFE or its local branches; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | loans by us to our consolidated affiliated entities, which are domestic PRC entities, must be approved by the National Development and Reform Commission and must also be registered with SAFE or its local branches.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
On August 29, 2008, SAFE issued the Circular on the Relevant Operating Issues Concerning the Improvement of the Administration of the Payment and Settlement of Foreign Currency Capital of Foreign-Invested Enterprises, or SAFE Circular 142. Pursuant to SAFE Circular 142, RMB resulting from the settlement of foreign currency capital of a foreign-invested enterprise must be used within the business scope as approved by the applicable government authority and cannot be used for domestic equity investment, unless it is otherwise approved. Documents certifying the purposes of the settlement of foreign currency capital into RMB, including a business contract, must also be submitted for the settlement of the foreign currency. In addition, SAFE strengthened its oversight of the flow and use of RMB capital converted from foreign currency registered capital of a foreign-invested company. The use of such RMB capital may not be altered without SAFE’s approval, and such RMB capital may not be used to repay RMB loans if such loans have not been used. Violations of SAFE Circular 142 could result in severe monetary fines or penalties. We expect that our use of RMB funds have been, and will be, within the approved business scope of our PRC subsidiary. We believe that our PRC subsidiary is permitted to conduct its castor seeds distribution operations and provide consulting services to castor farmers. However, we may not be able to use such RMB funds to make equity investments in the PRC through our PRC subsidiaries. There are no costs associated with applying for registration or approval of loans or capital contributions with or from relevant PRC governmental authorities, other than nominal processing charges. Under PRC laws and regulations, the PRC governmental authorities are required to process such approvals or registrations or deny our application within a prescribed time period, which is usually less than 90 days. The actual time taken, however, may be longer due to administrative delays. We cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain these government registrations or approvals on a timely basis, if at all, with respect to our operations in China. If we fail to receive such registrations or approvals, our ability to use the proceeds from our funds to capitalize our PRC operations may be negatively affected, which could materially and adversely affect our liquidity and ability to fund and expand our business.

The value of the Renminbi against the US dollar and other currencies may fluctuate and is affected by, among other things, changes in China’s political and economic conditions. Historically, the conversion of Renminbi into foreign currencies, including US dollars, has been based on rates set by the People’s Bank of China. On July 21, 2005, the PRC government changed its policy of pegging the value of the Renminbi to the US dollar. Under the new policy, the Renminbi will be permitted to fluctuate within a band against a basket of certain foreign currencies. There remains significant international pressure on the PRC government to adopt a substantial liberalization of its currency policy, which could result in a further and more significant appreciation in the value of the Renminbi against the US dollar.
 
The fluctuation of the Renminbi against the US dollar and other currencies may have an impact on our figures in our consolidated financial information presented elsewhere in this prospectus.
 
Dividend Distributions
 
The principal regulations governing dividend distributions of wholly foreign-owned enterprises include:
 

• | the Companies Law (2005);
--+--------------------------


• | the Wholly Foreign-Owned Enterprise Law (2000); and
--+----------------------------------------------------


• | the Wholly Foreign-Owned Enterprise Law Implementing Rules (2001).
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Under these regulations, wholly foreign-owned enterprises in the PRC may pay dividends only out of their accumulated profits as determined in accordance with PRC accounting standards and regulations. In addition, these wholly foreign-owned enterprises are required to set aside at least 10% of their respective accumulated profits each year, if any, to fund certain reserve funds, until the aggregate amount of such fund reaches 50% of its registered capital. At the discretion of these wholly foreign-owned enterprises, they may allocate a portion of their after-tax profits based on PRC accounting standards to staff welfare and bonus funds. These reserve funds and staff welfare and bonus funds are not distributable as cash dividends.
 
Any wholly foreign owned enterprise of COSG will be regulated by the laws governing foreign-invested enterprises in the PRC. Accordingly, it will be required to allocate 10% of its after-tax profits based on PRC accounting standards each year to their general reserves until the accumulated amount of such reserves has exceeded 50% of its registered capital, after which no further allocation is required to be made. These reserve funds, however, may not be distributed to equity owners except in accordance with PRC laws and regulations. In addition, due to the failure of these laws and regulations to define or interpret the terms “non-profit,” “for-profit” or “for the purpose of making a profit” as they relate to our business, we cannot assure you that the PRC government authorities will not request our subsidiary to use its after-tax profits for its own development and restrict our subsidiary’s ability to distribute their after-tax profits to us as dividends.
 
On March 16, 2007, the National People’s Congress approved and promulgated the PRC Enterprise Income Tax Law, or “EIT Law,” which took effect on January 1, 2008. Pursuant to the new EIT law and its implementing regulations, dividends payable by a foreign-invested enterprise to its foreign enterprise (but not individual) investors will be subject to a 10% withholding tax if the foreign investors are considered as non-resident enterprises without any establishment or place of business within China or if the dividends payable have no connection with the establishment or place of business of the foreign investors within China, to the extent that the dividends are deemed China sourced income, unless any such foreign investor’s jurisdiction of incorporation has a tax treaty with China that provides for a different withholding arrangement. Hong Kong, where Lee Tat is incorporated, has such a tax treaty with China.
 
In addition, as clarified by a notice jointly promulgated by the Ministry of Finance and the State Administration of Taxation of the PRC on February 22, 2008, distribution of accumulated profits of foreign-invested enterprises will be subject to withholding tax.
