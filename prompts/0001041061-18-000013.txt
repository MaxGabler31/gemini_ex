Item 1. | Business.

YUM! Brands, Inc. (referred to herein as “YUM”, the “Registrant” or the “Company”), was incorporated under the laws of the state of North Carolina in 1997.  The principal executive offices of YUM are located at 1441 Gardiner Lane, Louisville, Kentucky 40213, and the telephone number at that location is (502) 874-8300. Our website address is http://yum.com.
YUM, together with its subsidiaries, is referred to in this Form 10-K annual report (“Form 10-K”) as the Company.  The terms “we,” “us” and “our” are also used in the Form 10-K to refer to the Company.  Throughout this Form 10-K, the terms “restaurants,” “stores” and “units” are used interchangeably. While YUM! Brands, Inc., referred to as the Company, does not directly own or operate any restaurants, throughout this document we may refer to restaurants that are owned or operated by our subsidiaries as being Company-owned.
Financial Information about Operating Segments and General Development of the Business 
As of December 31, 2017, YUM consists of three operating segments:  

• | The KFC Division which includes the worldwide operations of the KFC concept


• | The Pizza Hut Division which includes the worldwide operations of the Pizza Hut concept


• | The Taco Bell Division which includes the worldwide operations of the Taco Bell concept

On October 31, 2016 (the “Distribution Date”), we completed the spin-off of our China business (the "Separation") into an independent, publicly-traded company under the name of Yum China Holdings, Inc. (“Yum China”). On the Distribution Date, we distributed to each of our shareholders of record as of the close of business on October 19, 2016 (the “Record Date”) one share of Yum China common stock for each share of our Common Stock held as of the Record Date. The distribution was structured to be a tax free distribution to our U.S. shareholders for federal income tax purposes in the United States. Yum China’s common stock trades on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol “YUMC.” After the distribution, we do not beneficially own any shares of Yum China common stock.
Concurrent with the Separation, a subsidiary of the Company entered into a Master License Agreement with a subsidiary of Yum China for the exclusive right to use and sublicense the use of intellectual property owned by YUM and its affiliates for the development and operation of KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell restaurants in China. Prior to the Separation, our operations in mainland China were reported in our former China Division segment results. As a result of the Separation, the results of operations and cash flows of the separated business are presented as discontinued operations in our Consolidated Statements of Income and Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for periods presented prior to the Separation. See additional information related to the impact of the Separation in Item 8, Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 
Operating segment information for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 for the Company is included in Part II, Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ("MD&A") and in the related Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8.
Narrative Description of Business
General
YUM has over 45,000 restaurants in more than 135 countries and territories.  The Company's three concepts of KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell (the “Concepts”), develop, operate or franchise a worldwide system of restaurants which prepare, package and sell a menu of competitively priced food items.  Units are operated by the Concepts or by independent franchisees or licensees under the terms of franchise or license agreements, which typically require an initial non-refundable fee upon an individual store opening and the payment of sales-based fees for use of our Concepts' brands.  The terms "franchise" or "franchisee" within this Form 10-K are meant to describe third parties that operate units under either franchise or license agreements. Franchisees can range in size from individuals owning just one restaurant to large publicly-traded companies.  
Restaurant Concepts
Most restaurants in each Concept offer consumers the ability to dine in and/or carry out food.  In addition, Taco Bell and KFC offer a drive-thru option in many stores.  Pizza Hut offers a drive-thru option on a much more limited basis.  Pizza Hut typically offers delivery service, while, on a more limited but expanding basis, KFC and Taco Bell allow for consumers to have the Concepts' food delivered either through store-level or third-party delivery services. In February 2018, we entered into an agreement with GrubHub, Inc., ("Grubhub") the leading online and mobile take out food-ordering company in the U.S. Under the agreement, Grubhub will provide support in the U.S. for the KFC and Taco Bell branded online delivery channels, along with access to Grubhub's online ordering platform, logistics and last-mile support for delivery orders, and point-of-sale integration to streamline operations.
Each Concept has proprietary menu items and emphasizes the preparation of food with high quality ingredients, as well as unique recipes and special seasonings to provide appealing, tasty and convenient food at competitive prices.
The franchise programs of the Company are designed to promote consistency and quality, and the Company is selective in granting franchises.  The Company utilizes both store-level franchise and master franchise programs to grow its businesses. Under store-level franchise agreements, franchisees supply capital – initially by paying a franchise fee to YUM, by purchasing or leasing the land, building, equipment, signs, seating, inventories and supplies and, over the longer term, by reinvesting in the business.  In certain refranchising transactions the Company may retain ownership of land and building and lease them to the franchisee. Franchisees contribute to the Company’s revenues by paying non-refundable upfront fees at inception of the franchise agreement and on an ongoing basis through the payment of royalties based on a percentage of sales (usually 4% - 6%). Under master franchise arrangements, the Company enters into agreements that allow master franchisees to operate restaurants as well as sub-franchise within certain geographic territories. Master franchisees are responsible for overseeing development within their territories and collect initial fees and royalties from sub-franchisees. Master franchisees generally pay upfront fees and ongoing royalties at a reduced rate to the Company. Our largest master franchisee, Yum China, pays a 3% license fee on system sales of our Concepts in mainland China to the Company.
The Company believes that it is important to maintain strong and open relationships with its franchisees and their representatives.  To this end, the Company invests a significant amount of time working with the franchisee community and their representative organizations on key aspects of the business, including products, equipment, operational improvements and standards and management techniques.
Following is a brief description of each Concept:
KFC

• | KFC was founded in Corbin, Kentucky by Colonel Harland D. Sanders, an early developer of the quick service food business and a pioneer of the restaurant franchise concept. The Colonel perfected his secret blend of 11 herbs and spices for Kentucky Fried Chicken in 1939 and signed up his first franchisee in 1952. 


• | KFC operates in 131 countries and territories throughout the world. As of year end 2017, KFC had 21,487 units, 97 percent of which are franchised. 


• | KFC restaurants across the world offer fried and non-fried chicken products such as sandwiches, chicken strips, chicken-on-the-bone and other chicken products marketed under a variety of names. KFC restaurants also offer a variety of entrees and side items suited to local preferences and tastes. Restaurant decor throughout the world is characterized by the image of the Colonel. 

Pizza Hut

• | The first Pizza Hut restaurant was opened in 1958 in Wichita, Kansas, and within a year, the first franchise unit was opened. Today, Pizza Hut is the largest restaurant chain in the world specializing in the sale of ready-to-eat pizza products. 


• | Pizza Hut operates in 106 countries and territories throughout the world. As of year end 2017, Pizza Hut had 16,748 units, 99 percent of which are franchised. 


• | Pizza Hut operates in the delivery, carryout and casual dining segments around the world. Outside of the U.S., Pizza Hut often uses unique branding to differentiate these segments. Additionally, a growing percentage of Pizza Hut's customer orders are being generated digitally. 


• | Pizza Hut features a variety of pizzas which are marketed under varying names. Each of these pizzas is offered with a variety of different toppings suited to local preferences and tastes. Many Pizza Huts also offer pasta and chicken wings, including approximately 5,900 stores offering wings under the WingStreet brand in the U.S. Outside the U.S., Pizza Hut casual dining restaurants offer a variety of core menu products other than pizza, which are typically suited to local preferences and tastes. Pizza Hut units feature a distinctive red roof logo on their signage. 

Taco Bell

• | The first Taco Bell restaurant was opened in 1962 by Glen Bell in Downey, California, and in 1964, the first Taco Bell franchise was sold.


• | Taco Bell operates in 27 countries and territories throughout the world. As of year end 2017, there were 6,849 Taco Bell units, primarily in the U.S., 90 percent of which are franchised. 


• | Taco Bell specializes in Mexican-style food products, including various types of tacos, burritos, quesadillas, salads, nachos and other related items. Taco Bell offers breakfast items in its U.S. stores. Taco Bell units feature a distinctive bell logo on their signage. 

Restaurant Operations
Through its Concepts, YUM develops, operates and franchises a worldwide system of both traditional and non-traditional Quick Service Restaurants ("QSR").  Traditional units can feature dine-in, carryout, drive-thru and delivery services.  Non-traditional units include express units and kiosks which have a more limited menu, usually generate lower sales volumes and operate in non-traditional locations like malls, airports, gasoline service stations, train stations, subways, convenience stores, stadiums, amusement parks and colleges, where a full-scale traditional outlet would not be practical or efficient.
Restaurant management structure varies by Concept and unit size.  Generally, each restaurant is led by a restaurant general manager (“RGM”), together with one or more assistant managers, depending on the operating complexity and sales volume of the restaurant.  Each Concept issues detailed manuals, which may then be customized to meet local regulations and customs. These manuals set forth standards and requirements for all aspects of restaurant operations, including food safety and quality, food handling and product preparation procedures, equipment maintenance, facility standards and accounting control procedures.  The restaurant management teams are responsible for the day-to-day operation of each unit and for ensuring compliance with operating standards. CHAMPS – which stands for Cleanliness, Hospitality, Accuracy, Maintenance, Product Quality and Speed of Service – is our proprietary systemwide program for training, measuring and rewarding employee performance against key customer measures.  CHAMPS is intended to align the operating processes of our entire system around one core set of standards. RGMs’ efforts, including CHAMPS performance measures, are monitored by Area Coaches, where sufficient scale allows.  Area Coaches typically work with approximately six to twelve restaurants.  
Supply and Distribution
The Company and franchisees of the Concepts are substantial purchasers of a number of food and paper products, equipment and other restaurant supplies. The principal items purchased include chicken, cheese, beef and pork products, paper and packaging materials. The Company has not experienced any significant continuous shortages of supplies, and alternative sources for most of these products are generally available.  Prices paid for these supplies fluctuate.  When prices increase, the Concepts may attempt to pass on such increases to their customers, although there is no assurance that this can be done practically.
In the U.S., the Company, along with the representatives of the Company’s KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell franchisee groups, are members of Restaurant Supply Chain Solutions, LLC (“RSCS"), which is responsible for purchasing certain restaurant products and equipment.  The core mission of RSCS is to provide the lowest possible sustainable store-delivered prices for restaurant products and equipment.  This arrangement combines the purchasing power of the Company-owned and franchisee restaurants, which the Company believes leverages the system’s scale to drive cost savings and effectiveness in the purchasing function.  The Company also believes that RSCS fosters closer alignment of interests and a stronger relationship with its franchisee community.
Most food products, paper and packaging supplies, and equipment used in restaurant operations are distributed to individual restaurant units by third-party distribution companies.  In the U.S., McLane Foodservice, Inc. is the exclusive distributor for the majority of items used in Company-owned restaurants and for a substantial number of franchisee stores.  
Outside the U.S., we and our Concepts' franchisees primarily use decentralized sourcing and distribution systems involving many different global, regional and local suppliers and distributors. We and our franchisees have approximately 6,400 food and paper suppliers, including U.S.-based suppliers that export to many countries.
Trademarks and Patents
The Company and its Concepts own numerous registered trademarks and service marks.  The Company believes that many of these marks, including its Kentucky Fried Chicken®, KFC®, Pizza Hut® and Taco Bell® marks, have significant value and are materially important to its business.  The Company’s policy is to pursue registration of its important marks whenever feasible and to oppose vigorously any infringement of its marks.  
The use of certain of these marks by franchisees has been authorized in our franchise agreements.  Under current law and with proper use, the Company’s rights in its marks can generally last indefinitely.  The Company also has certain patents on restaurant equipment which, while valuable, are not material to its business.
Working Capital
Information about the Company’s working capital is included in MD&A in Part II, Item 7 and the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows in Part II, Item 8.
Seasonal Operations
The Company does not consider its operations to be seasonal to any material degree.
Competition
The retail food industry, in which our Concepts compete, is made up of supermarkets, supercenters, warehouse stores, convenience stores, coffee shops, snack bars, delicatessens and restaurants (including the QSR segment), and is intensely competitive with respect to price and quality of food products, new product development, digital engagement, advertising levels and promotional initiatives, customer service reputation, restaurant location and attractiveness and maintenance of properties. Competition from delivery aggregators and other food delivery services has also increased in recent years, particularly in urbanized areas. The industry is often affected by changes in consumer tastes; national, regional or local economic conditions; currency fluctuations; demographic trends; traffic patterns; the type, number and location of competing food retailers and products; and disposable purchasing power.  Each of the Concepts competes with international, national and regional restaurant chains as well as locally-owned restaurants, not only for customers, but also for management and hourly personnel, suitable real estate sites and qualified franchisees.  Given the various types and vast number of competitors, our Concepts do not constitute a significant portion of the retail food industry in terms of number of system units or system sales, either on a worldwide or individual country basis.
Research and Development (“R&D”)
The Company operates R&D facilities in Plano, Texas (KFC and Pizza Hut Divisions); Irvine, California (Taco Bell Division); Louisville, Kentucky (KFC U.S.) and several other locations outside the U.S.  In addition to Company R&D, we regularly also engage independent suppliers to conduct research and development activities for the benefit of the YUM system. The Company expensed $22 million, $24 million and $25 million in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, for R&D activities.  
Environmental Matters
The Company is not aware of any federal, state or local environmental laws or regulations that will materially affect its earnings or competitive position, or result in material capital expenditures.  However, the Company cannot predict the effect on its operations of possible future environmental legislation or regulations.  During 2017, there were no material capital expenditures for environmental control facilities and no such material expenditures are anticipated.
Government Regulation
U.S. Operations.  The Company and its U.S. operations, as well as our franchisees, are subject to various federal, state and local laws affecting its business, including laws and regulations concerning information security, labor and employment, health, marketing, food labeling, sanitation and safety.  Each of our and our Concepts’ franchisees' restaurants in the U.S. must comply with licensing and regulation by a number of governmental authorities, which include health, sanitation, safety, fire and zoning agencies in the state and/or municipality in which the restaurant is located.  In addition, each Concept must comply with various 
state and federal laws that regulate the franchisor/franchisee relationship.  To date, the Company has not been materially adversely affected by such licensing and regulation or by any difficulty, delay or failure to obtain required licenses or approvals.
International Operations.  Our and our Concepts' franchisees' restaurants outside the U.S. are subject to national and local laws and regulations which are similar to those affecting U.S. restaurants.  The restaurants outside the U.S. are also subject to tariffs and regulations on imported commodities and equipment and laws regulating foreign investment, as well as anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws.  
See Item 1A "Risk Factors" for a discussion of risks relating to federal, state, local and international regulation of our business.
Employees
As of year end 2017, the Company and its subsidiaries employed approximately 60,000 persons. The Company believes that it provides working conditions and compensation that compare favorably with those of its principal competitors.  The majority of employees are paid on an hourly basis.  Some employees are subject to labor council relationships that vary due to the diverse cultures in which the Company operates.  The Company and its Concepts consider their employee relations to be good.
