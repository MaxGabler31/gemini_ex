ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

Lee Enterprises, Incorporated ("Company", "we" or "our") is a leading provider of high quality, trusted, local news and information, and a major platform for advertising in the markets we serve. We operate 49 principally mid-sized local media operations (including TNI Partners ("TNI") and Madison Newspapers, Inc. ("MNI")) across 20 states. 
Our products include daily newspapers, websites and mobile applications, mobile news and advertising, video products, a digital marketing agency, digital services including web hosting and content management, niche publications and community newspapers. Our local media operations range from large daily newspapers and the associated digital products, such as the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, to non-daily newspapers with news websites and digital platforms serving smaller communities. 
Our mission is to be the leading provider of local news, information and to be a major source of advertising in our local media operations. We aim to grow our business through three main categories; consumers, local retail accounts and digital services.

• | We are committed to a business strategy that drives audience growth and engagement by delivering valuable, intensely local, original news and information to consumers.


• | Local, controllable retail accounts - those in which our local sales teams have direct contact with the advertising decision makers - are the core of our business. This segment represents nearly 50% of advertising revenue and our historical financial results for this revenue category are better than our overall results.


• | TownNews represents a powerful opportunity for us to drive additional digital revenue by providing state-of-the-art web hosting and content management services to 1,700 other media organizations including broadcast.

Our local media operations generate revenue primarily through print and digital advertising, subscriptions to our publications and digital services, primarily through TownNews. Our operations also provide commercial printing, distribution of third party publications and marketing services. 
Advertising and marketing services - Approximately 56% of our 2018 revenue was derived from advertising and marketing services. We provide advertising and marketing solutions using a multi-platform sales approach that maximizes audience reach for our customers by tailoring our print and digital advertising platforms to the individual needs of our advertisers, from small, medium sized businesses ("SMBs") to large complex businesses. The following broadly define major categories of advertising and marketing services revenue: 

Retail advertising is revenue earned from sales of display advertising in the publication, or from preprinted advertising inserted in the publication, from local, regional and national businesses with local retail operations. 
Classified advertising is revenue from the sale of advertising space, or from separate publications, consisting primarily of advertising categories, such as employment, automotive, real estate, legal notices, obituaries and other merchandise. Classified publications offer advertisers a cost-effective, local advertising vehicle and can be particularly effective in larger markets with higher media fragmentation. 

National advertising is revenue earned from the sale of print or digital display advertising space, or from preprinted advertising inserted in the publication, from national accounts that do not have a local retailer representing the account in the market. 

Digital advertising consists of display, banner, behavioral targeting, search, rich media, directories, classified or other advertising on websites or mobile applications that are integrated with our print publications, or on third party websites accessed through the extended audience network. Digital advertising is reported in combination with print advertising in the retail, classified and national categories.
1

Niche publications are specialty publications, such as lifestyle, business, health or home improvement publications that contain advertising.

Marketing services is comprised of a suite of custom digital marketing services that include: Search Engine Optimization, Search Engine Marketing ("SEM"), web and mobile production, social media services and reputation monitoring and management. Our marketing services also include media buying in audience extension networks outside of those owned and operated by the Company, such as Centro DSP and TradeDesk.
Our advertising revenues are subject to seasonality due primarily to fluctuations in advertising volumes. Our advertising revenues for publishing are typically highest in our first quarter due to holiday and seasonal advertising and lowest in the second quarter following the holiday season. The volume of advertising sales in any period is also impacted by other external factors such as competitors' pricing, advertisers' decisions to increase or decrease their advertising expenditures in response to anticipated consumer demand, and general economic conditions.
Subscription - Approximately 36% of our 2018 revenue was derived from subscriptions to our printed and digital products. Subscription revenue is earned primarily from our full access subscription model and digital only subscriptions. Full access subscribers receive print and digital access to our leading local news, information and advertising content. 
We reach 79% of all adults in our larger markets through a combination of our print and digital content offerings. 

• | Our web and mobile sites are the number one digital source of local news in most of our markets, reaching more than 27 million unique visitors each month with a monthly average of 267.1 million page views. Page views per session, one metric we use to monitor engagement, increased 5.6% in 2018.


• | Our printed newspapers reach more than 700,000 households daily and more than 1.1 million on Sunday, with estimated readership totaling three million.

While our print audience tends to skew to an older demographic, our digital audience skews younger, as evidenced by third party research that suggests the print and digital reach among the younger demographic (ages 18-29) totals 77%, with a 43% digital reach. Consistent within the publishing industry, print circulation volumes declined in 2018. Growing our digital only subscribers and subscription revenue is a priority.
Other Revenue - Other revenue is comprised mainly of digital services, commercial printing and delivery of third party products and represents 8.3% of our business. Digital services revenue, which is mostly TownNews, is the largest component of Other Revenue. 
TownNews, operated through our 82.5% owned subsidiary INN Partners, L.C., is a leading provider of integrated digital publishing and content management solutions, and offers a state-of-the-art platform for creating, distributing and monetizing multimedia content. 

• | TownNews services nearly 1,700 daily and weekly newspapers as well as universities, television stations, niche publications, and Lee Enterprises properties.


• | Including revenue generated from Lee Enterprises, total revenue at TownNews grew 16% in 2018.

With strong product offerings, investments in video and over the top ("OTT") technology and a diversifying customer base into broadcast, we believe TownNews is positioned to continue to be a key component to our growth strategy.
Our operating costs are primarily compensation, newsprint and delivery. Over the past several years we have adjusted our business model to create operational efficiencies and significantly reduce our cost structure. 
We have centralized, or regionalized, most back office functions including the design of our newspapers. The regional design centers ("RDCs") have enabled us to more cost effectively design and layout the newspaper. The RDCs - combined with a common content management system across all of our daily newspaper markets - have created additional operating efficiencies and cost savings. We have templated designs for our printed and digital editions, and we have created a national news desk that shares high quality content across all of our markets, including national news, regional news and other special sections content. The national news desk allows our newsrooms to focus on 
2

high quality local content. We believe we will continue to create additional operational efficiencies and continue to transform our business model.
Several of our businesses operate in geographic groups of publications, or “clusters,” which provide operational efficiencies, extend sales penetration and provide broader audiences for advertisers. A table under the caption “Daily Newspapers and Markets” in Item 1, included herein, identifies those groups of our newspapers operating in clusters. 
Our local media operations compete with other media and digital companies for advertising and marketing spend as well as other news and information outlets for subscription spend. While very few of our local media operations have similar daily print competitors that are published in the same city, our local media operations compete with the following types of businesses:


• | Newspapers having national, regional and smaller suburban area newspapers and free or paid publications; and


• | Other media including magazines, radio, television, outdoor/billboard advertising, other classified and specialty publications, direct mail, directories, and national, regional and local advertising websites and content providers.

The number of competitors in any given market varies, however all of the forms of competition noted above exist to some degree in all of our markets. 
Lee Enterprises, Incorporated was founded in 1890, incorporated in 1950, and listed on the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE") in 1978. 
We experienced significant net losses in 2008, 2009, 2011, 2012 and 2013 primarily due to non-cash charges for impairment of intangible and other assets and reorganization costs, and as a result, we have negative equity of $36.3 million as of September 30, 2018. Our ability to operate as a going concern is dependent on our ability to repay, refinance or amend our debt agreements as they become due, and remain in compliance with debt covenants. We are in compliance with our debt covenants as of September 30, 2018. The information included herein should be evaluated in that context. See Item 1A, “Risk Factors”, and Notes 3 and 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included herein, for additional information. 
STRATEGIC INITIATIVES
Key elements of our strategy are as follows:
Comprehensive Local News That Drives Frequency And Engagement
We drive frequency and engagement with our products by delivering valuable, intensely local, original news and information that we believe in many cases our audiences cannot otherwise readily obtain. Our large and talented news and editorial staff provide constant, real-time local news with significant breadth, depth and reliability. Our full access platform provides our subscribers with breaking news throughout the day on our digital platforms as well as in depth daily print and digital news and information.
We believe the strength of our local brands is the result of the quality and size of our news gathering staff. This allows us to provide the most comprehensive coverage of local news in our markets. In most of our markets, we are the leading source of print and digital news and information. As the consumption of news on digital devices has expanded, we have moved quickly to develop applications that address audience and digital advertising demands for mobile and tablet content advertising platforms. As new digital technologies emerge, we expect to move rapidly to make our content available through them and monetize the audience accessing our content. 
We are focused on continually improving the functionality and design of all our news platforms, allowing us to provide greater depth of coverage and increasing reader engagement. We are providing our journalists with tools to give them real-time information about audience engagement on our digital platforms. This helps inform their decisions on both presentation and coverage. 
We believe our journalists are at the forefront of gathering and producing news and information about their local community. We seek to grow our digital audience by engaging our readers with news and information that we believe stirs public awareness, advances ideas, inspires vision, creates debate and provokes action. Through our news 
3

leadership we strive to contribute to community betterment, promote education, foster commerce and help improve the quality of life in our markets. 
Become Predominately Digital Revenue Driven
Our digital businesses have experienced rapid growth since 2010. Total digital revenue, including digital advertising revenue and digital services revenue, grew 6.3% in 2018 and totaled $112,825,000. Digital advertising revenue totaled 31.8% of total advertising and marketing services revenue for the 53 weeks ended September 30, 2018. Digital national revenue grew 13.1% in 2018, driven by our sweeps program and improved inventory management and pricing. Mobile advertising increased 3.8%, and digital retail advertising, which represents more than 62% of total digital advertising, increased 7.7% in 2018. Digital services revenue grew 16.6% in 2018 due to revenue growth at TownNews.
We are growing digital revenue by offering an expansive array of digital products including: video, behavioral targeting, audience retargeting, banner ads, social networking, and digital couponing. We provide digital marketing services to SMBs, including SEM, social media, audience extension, business profiles, and website hosting and design. 
We believe that these innovative solutions will continue to drive meaningful new opportunities for us to grow our digital marketing revenue. We also continue to expand our array of digital products to address advertisers' evolving needs, react to competition while seeking to increase our share of advertising and marketing services spending from existing customers. In 2017, we introduced Digital Connect, a digital services package aimed at growing digital revenue from local businesses. Digital Connect provides local businesses a turn-key package for expanding their digital presence through enhanced search engine management. Digital Connect was a significant contributor to digital advertising revenue growth in 2018.
In 2019, we expect to continue to expand our digital marketing footprint with programs aimed at SMB's and our top local accounts, including:

• | Consumer and local merchant intelligence solutions that enable marketers to more easily analyze their customers spending habits;


• | SMB customer loyalty programs using email and text platforms that drive loyalty and frequency; and


• | Sales channel development by expanding dedicated digital sales resources.

One key tactic to becoming predominately digital revenue driven is to acquire and retain top digital talent. As of September 30, 2018, we have 40 digital elite specialists that reside in our larger markets. The role of the digital elite specialists is to educate the local media operation's sales team on current digital product offerings, purse new and sizable digital opportunities and serve as a company resource for anticipating future advertising needs and requirements. We expect to grow the number of digital elite specialists in 2019. 
Growing digital subscribers is another key to becoming predominately digital revenue driven. As of September 30, 2018, we have 57% of all full access subscriptions digitally activated. In addition to the full access subscriptions, all of our markets offer digital only subscription packages and growing our digital only subscriber base remains a key priority. While the number of digital only subscribers is small, we grew our base by over 70% in 2018. Our primary digital subscription acquisition tactics include on-site and off-site promotion, email marketing, social media, event marketing, and direct mail.
We believe TownNews represents a powerful opportunity for us to drive additional digital revenue. In 2018, digital services revenue, which is primarily TownNews, totaled more than $16,000,000, and since 2011 the compounded annual growth rate of TownNews revenue has been 9.7%. In 2018, TownNews expanded its broadcast and video capabilities by acquiring an acclaimed video management and streaming solution for media operations. The acquisition allows TownNews customers to have broadcast quality video available for desktop, mobile and OTT applications. The investment also allows TownNews to diversify its customer base by offering state-of-the-art product offerings to broadcast television stations. 
Accelerate Local Retail Performance
Local, controllable retail accounts - those in which our local sales teams have direct contact with the advertising decision makers - are the core of our business. This revenue category represents nearly 50% of advertising revenue and is 
4

comprised of SMBs and our top local accounts. Our historical financial results for this revenue category are better than our overall results and we believe we can accelerate financial performance in this revenue category.

• | Our local sales forces are larger than any local competitor, and we believe they are the most highly trained and proficient sales force in our markets.


• | We have strong relationships with businesses in our markets and offer a wide array of products to deliver our advertisers' message.


• | Our sales executives pitch the power of our audiences directly to local decision makers.

To address the evolving needs of local advertisers we changed the way we sell local advertising to maximize our opportunities with SMBs by developing the Edison Project, which is directly aimed at these local advertisers. With Edison, we completely restructured our local sales teams and simplified advertising packages, providing advertisers with an expanded robust digital presence, increased frequency in print products, and longer advertising commitments.
Our Big Pitch initiative targets larger, local accounts such as a large local hardware store or regional hospital group. We pair creative advertising campaigns with our broad suite of products, including both digital and print. Because of the success of this program we've added creative resources and accelerated the number of pitches developed and made, providing greater creativity, faster speed to market, and more pitches closed.
Transforming Our Business And Managing Our Costs
We are transforming our business model and reducing our costs to maintain our margins and cash flows. We have consolidated or regionalized many common functions; consolidated or selectively outsourced printing and ad production; discontinued unprofitable publications; significantly reduced newsprint volume; and continually seek to improve the efficiencies and reduce costs of our operations. We have reduced personnel while protecting our strengths in news, sales and digital products. In 2018, on a same property basis we reduced cash costs(1) 6.1%. We continue to implement cost efficiencies while investing in revenue drivers. 
Generate Strong Adjusted EBITDA(1) With A Commitment To Reduce Our Debt
Throughout the last economic downturn and ongoing recovery - at a time of unprecedented transition for our industry - we have posted strong adjusted EBITDA and consistent margins. We anticipate modest capital expenditures and pension contributions, and we expect to continue to significantly reduce our debt each year. 
The principal amount of debt was reduced by $63.5 million in 2018 and totaled $484.9 million as of September 30, 2018. Since 2005, we have reduced debt by more than $1 billion and we expect to continue to significantly reduce our debt in 2019. As a result of our debt reductions, interest expense was reduced by $4.7 million in 2018 compared to 2017, providing additional free cash flow for debt service and other corporate uses.
(1) See "Non-GAAP Financial Measures: in Item 7, included herein, for additional information.

PULITZER 

In 2005, we acquired Pulitzer Inc. (“Pulitzer”). We currently publish 9 daily newspapers that were acquired from Pulitzer and more than 60 weekly newspapers and specialty publications. Pulitzer also includes our 50% interest in TNI, as discussed more fully below. 
Pulitzer newspapers largest operations include Bloomington, Illinois and St. Louis, Missouri, where its subsidiary, St. Louis Post-Dispatch LLC (“PD LLC”), publishes the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, our only major daily newspaper, which serves the greater St. Louis metropolitan area. St. Louis newspaper operations also include a variety of specialty publications, and supports its related digital products as well as the Suburban Journals of Greater St. Louis, a group of weekly newspapers and niche publications that focus on separate communities within the metropolitan area. 

The 2005 acquisition was financed primarily with debt. The second lien term loan lenders have a first lien on Pulitzer assets. Excess cash flow from Pulitzer, as defined in the Second Lien Loan Agreement, and cash flow from Pulitzer asset sales are used to pay down the second lien term loan at par. On August 28, 2016 we sold substantially all of the 
5

assets of our Provo, Utah newspaper operations, a former Pulitzer newspaper, and proceeds from the sale were used to pay down the second lien term loan. 
TNI Partners 

In conjunction with the Pulitzer acquisition we obtained a 50% interest in TNI, the Tucson, Arizona newspaper partnership. TNI, acting as agent for our subsidiary, Star Publishing Company (“Star Publishing”) and Citizen Publishing Company (“Citizen”), the owner of the remaining 50%, a subsidiary of Gannett Co., Inc., (“Gannett”). TNI was responsible for printing, delivery, advertising and subscription activities of the Arizona Daily Star and the Tucson Citizen. In May 2009, Citizen discontinued print publication of the Tucson Citizen and in 2014 stopped publishing its digital product. 
TNI collects all receipts and income and pays substantially all operating expenses incident to the partnership's operations and publication of the newspaper and other media. Under the amended and restated operating agreement between Star Publishing and Citizen, the Arizona Daily Star remains the separate property of Star Publishing. Results of TNI are accounted for using the equity method. Income or loss of TNI (before income taxes) is allocated equally to Star Publishing and Citizen. TNI makes weekly distributions to Star Publishing and Citizen of all available cash.

The TNI agency agreement (“Agency Agreement”), has governed the operation since 1940. The Agency Agreement expires in 2040, but contains an option, which may be exercised by either party, to renew the agreement for successive periods of 25 years each. Star Publishing and Citizen also have a reciprocal right of first refusal to acquire the 50% interest in TNI owned by Citizen and Star Publishing, respectively, under certain circumstances. Both the Company and Citizen incur certain administrative costs and capital expenditures that are reported by their individual companies. 

MADISON NEWSPAPERS 

We own 50% of the capital stock of MNI and 8.7% of the common stock of The Capital Times Company (“TCT”). TCT owns 50% of the capital stock of MNI. MNI publishes daily and Sunday newspapers, and other publications in Madison, Wisconsin, and other Wisconsin locations, and supports their related digital products. MNI conducts business under the trade name Capital Newspapers. We have a contract to furnish the editorial and news content for the Wisconsin State Journal, which is published by MNI, and periodically provide other services to MNI for a fee. Results of MNI are accounted for using the equity method. Net income or loss of MNI (after income taxes) is allocated equally to the Company and TCT. MNI makes quarterly dividend payments to the Company and TCT.

NEWSPRINT 

The raw material of newspapers, and our other print publications, is newsprint. We purchase newsprint from U.S. and Canadian producers. We believe we will continue to receive a supply of newsprint adequate for our needs and consider our relationships with newsprint producers to be good. Newsprint purchase prices can be volatile and fluctuate based upon factors that include foreign currency exchange rates, tariffs and both foreign and domestic production capacity and consumption. Price fluctuations can effect our results of operations. We have not entered into derivative contracts for newsprint. For the quantitative impacts of these fluctuations, see Item 7A, “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk”, included herein.
