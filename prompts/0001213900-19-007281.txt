Corporate Overview
 
We were incorporated in Nevada on June 23, 2011, to originally engage in the business of real estate investment consulting with respect to properties located in Panama.
 
On November 5, 2012, we filed Articles of Merger with the Nevada Secretary of State to change our name from “Panama Dreaming Inc.” to “Asia Pacific Boiler Corporation”, to be effected by way of a merger with our wholly-owned subsidiary Asia Pacific Boiler Corporation, which was created solely for the name change.
 
Also on November 5, 2012, we filed a Certificate of Change with the Nevada Secretary of State to give effect to a forward split of our authorized, issued and outstanding shares of common stock on a 4 new for 1 old basis and, consequently, our authorized common stock increased from 100,000,000 to 400,000,000 shares, and our then issued and outstanding common shares increased from 7,950,000 to 31,800,000, all with a par value of $0.00001. Our preferred stock remained unchanged with 100,000,000 preferred shares authorized, par value $0.00001, and no preferred shares. The forward split and name change became effective with the Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board at the opening of trading on November 9, 2012. Our CUSIP number is 04521K 107.
 
On August 5, 2014, we entered into and closed a share exchange agreement with Million Place Investments Ltd, a British Virgin Islands company (“Million Place”) and the shareholders of Million Place to acquire all the ordinary shares of Million Place. Consequently, Million Place became our wholly-owned subsidiary. Million Place is a 49% equity stakeholder in a People’s Republic of China (“PRC”) Co-operative Joint Venture (“CJV”), Inner Mongolia Yulong Pump Production Company Limited (“Yulong Pump”). Yulong Pump was involved in the provision of consultancy services for the design of boiler systems, the manufacture of industrial water pumps and accessories, and the acquisition and development of real estate. Yulong Pump ceased its water pump manufacturing activities in 2008 due to a decrease in demand for its products and increasing obsolescence of its manufacturing infrastructure.
 
On November 6, 2014, we changed our fiscal year end to December 31 from June 30. On July 12, 2018, we filed a certificate of amendment to our articles of incorporation with the Nevada Secretary of State to change our name to “Wunong Asia Pacific Company Limited” and our trading symbol was changed to “AITA” with effect from September 7, 2018.
 
We are a company with no operations and accordingly, no revenue. As of the date hereof, we have not been successful in our real estate investment consulting operations with respect to properties located in Panama nor have we been successful in resuscitating Yulong Pump’s business. Historically, we have been able to raise a limited amount of capital through private placements of our equity stock, but we are uncertain about our continued ability to raise funds privately.
 
Our statutory registered agent in Nevada is National Registered Agents Inc. of Nevada located at 1000 East William Street, Suite 204, Carson City, Nevada 89701. Our business address is 3 KeZhen Industrial Street, Wuchun District, Hohhot, People’s Republic of China.

Corporate History
 
Previously we intended to offer real estate consulting services through our website to persons located in North America and around the world, who were interested in investing in real estate located in Panama. We intended to cater to the newly located or inexperienced real estate investors who did not have a preexisting relationship with a real estate agent in Panama. Our plan was to assist the investor by locating qualified local real estate agents in Panama who would assist with the issues relating to the purchase of real property in Panama. For providing such service, we were to be paid a fee by our customer once the purchase was made.
 
In a Letter of Intent dated February 1, 2014 entered into between us, Million Place, Yulong Pump and Hohhot Devotion Boiler General Company Private Limited (“Devotion Boiler”), the parties contemplated, amongst other things, (i) the acquisition of Million Place by us, (ii) the acquisition by Million Place of an option to acquire not less than 51% of the equity interests of Yulong Pump and (iii) the acquisition of all the equity interests in Devotion Boiler. The objectives in the Letter of Intent were subject to satisfactory due diligence, completion of audits and financial statements and definitive agreements.
 
Pursuant to the Letter of Intent, on April 25, 2014, Million Place, which already owned 49% equity interests in Yulong Pump, entered into a share sale and purchase agreement with Xiushan Qin, a former officer and director of us, whereby Mr. Qin, who is the beneficial owner of a 51% interest in Yulong Pump, granted Million Place the option to purchase an additional 2% equity interest in Yulong Pump for a purchase price of approximately $96,278, thus potentially increasing its equity stake in Yulong Pump to 51%. The option is perpetual and without provision for termination.
 
On May 22, 2014, Million Place entered into a new joint venture contract with Xiushan Qin pursuant to which we, through Yulong Pump, would jointly engage in the manufacture of industrial boilers, the provision of consultancy services for the design of boiler systems, the manufacture of industrial water pumps and accessories, and the acquisition and development of real estate. Pursuant to the joint venture contract, Million Place will be solely responsible for all operations and management of the joint venture and shall have exclusive authority to enter into agreements on behalf of the joint venture. We will, in turn, receive compensation for services we provide to the joint venture and shall be entitled to a 49% share of profit generated by the joint venture.
 
On August 5, 2014, we entered into and closed a share exchange agreement with Million Place and the shareholders of Million Place. Pursuant to the terms of the share exchange agreement, we acquired all 10,000 of the issued and outstanding ordinary shares of Million Place in exchange for 7,500,000 newly-issued shares of our common stock to the shareholders of Million Place. As a result, Million Place became our wholly-owned subsidiary.
 
On August 25, 2011, Yulong Pump entered into a reorganization agreement (the “Reorganization Agreement”) with Devotion Boiler. Pursuant to the Reorganization Agreement, Yulong Pump agreed to acquire all the equity interests of Devotion Boiler outstanding as of December 31, 2009 on a 1-for-1 basis. In addition, Yulong Pump agreed to pay off all of the unpaid social security fees owed by Devotion Boiler as of the end of 2009. Yulong Pump also agreed to pay off all of the unpaid salaries and other payables owed by Devotion Boiler to its employees, all of its debts owed to Changcheng Capital Limited Company, and all of overdue taxes owed to the local and national tax bureaus. In general, Yulong Pump agreed to assume all of Devotion Boiler’s rights as a creditor and obligations as a debtor.
 
Despite numerous extensions of the Letter of Intent, the last through December 31, 2015, the last objective in the Letter of Intent, i.e. the acquisition of Devotion Boiler has yet to be completed.

--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Million Place Investments Ltd (“Million Place”)
 
Million Place was incorporated on April 30, 2012 under the laws of the British Virgin Island (“BVI”) to engage in any lawful corporate undertaking, including but not limited to mergers and acquisitions.
 
Pursuant to a share transfer agreement dated December 3, 2012, Million Place acquired from John Gong, our director and officer, a 49% equity interest in Yulong Pump. Million Place has never had any operations and its primary undertaking is to be a holding company for its equity interests in Yulong Pump.
 
Throughout the years ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2018, Million Place had no operations.
 
Inner Mongolia Yulong Pump Production Company Limited (“Yulong Pump”)
 
Yulong Pump was incorporated on October 6, 1998 under the laws of the PRC to engage in any lawful corporate undertaking, including, but not limited to, selected mergers and acquisitions. In 2008, Yulong Pump transformed itself from a local resident China company to a foreign joint venture company with a registered capital of RMB30 million (approximately $4,839,181). In 2013, Yulong Pump applied to the Foreign Investment Committee of Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region to raise its registered capital from RMB30 million to RMB600 million (approximately $96,783,624). This was approved in November 2013. In 2013, Yulong Pump raised RMB 188,355,325 ($31,114,083) from a capital contribution from its president and chief executive officer, Xiushan Qin.
 
In 1998, Yulong Pump paid a total of RMB 799,000 or $131,985 to acquire land use rights in Wuchuan, Inner Mongolia, for the purposes of establishing a manufacturing facility. From 1998 until 2008, Yulong Pump was engaged in the manufacture of industrial water pumps for a variety of applications in Wuchuan, Inner Mongolia. In 2008, Yulong Pump ceased its water pump manufacturing activities due to a decrease in demand for its products and increasing obsolescence of its manufacturing infrastructure. The land use rights for the Wuchuan property expire in 2046 and are eligible for renewal subject to additional costs. The Wuchuan property is located in the city center of Wuchuan, a suburb of Hohhot and Yulong Pump intends to explore the potential for commercial development of this land. Preliminary verbal discussions with the local Wuchuan land bureau indicate the possibility for land conversion from industrial to commercial and residential.
 
On August 5, 2013, Yulong Pump entered into real estate sales contracts with Wulanteqianqi Hua Yuan Real Estate Limited Company pursuant to which Yulong Pump acquired the land use rights to the third, fourth and fifth floors of a 6-story commercial building under development and located in Wulanteqianqi, Mongolia, China. The leasehold area of the property is approximately 143,106 square feet. Yulong Pump paid RMB 188,355,325 (approximately $31,114,083) in consideration of the land use rights. Yulong Pump plans to raise another RMB30 million to renovate this property in order to lease it. 
 
Since the termination of its water pump manufacturing operations, Yulong Pump’s focus is now to raise significant capital to develop and manage its real estate assets.
 
Throughout the year ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2018, Yulong Pump had no operations.

Business
 
Through our wholly-owned subsidiary, Million Place, we are presently engaged in the development and management of commercial real estate assets in cooperation with our joint venture partner, Xiushan Qin in Yulong Pump.
 
Our current business activities are governed by a joint venture contract dated May 22, 2014 between Million Place and Xiushan Qin pursuant to which states that we intend to jointly engage in the manufacture of industrial boilers, the provision of consultancy services for the design of boiler systems, the manufacture of industrial water pumps and accessories, and the acquisition and development of real estate. Pursuant to the joint venture contract, Million Place is solely responsible for all operations and management of the joint venture and has the exclusive authority to enter into agreements on behalf of the joint venture. Million Place will in turn receive compensation for services it provides to the joint venture and shall be entitled to a 49% share of profit generated by the joint venture.
 
In the meantime, our management has been analyzing the various alternatives available to ensure our survival and to preserve our shareholder’s investment in our common shares. This analysis has included sourcing additional forms of financing to continue our business objective of developing and managing Yulong Pump’s Wuchuan and Wulanteqianqi properties, or mergers and/or acquisitions. At this stage in our operations, we believe either course is acceptable, as our operations have not been profitable and our future prospects for our business are not good without further financing.
 
In regards to mergers and/or acquisitions, our preliminary merger/acquisition activities are focused on potential business opportunities with established business entities for the merger of a target business with our company. In certain instances, a target business may wish to become a subsidiary of our company or may wish to contribute assets to our company rather than merge. We anticipate that any new acquisition or business opportunities by our company will require additional financing. There can be no assurance, however, that we will be able to acquire the financing necessary to enable us to pursue our plan of operation. If our company requires additional financing and we are unable to acquire such funds, our business may fail.
 
In implementing a structure for a particular business acquisition or opportunity, we may become a party to a merger, consolidation, reorganization, joint venture, or licensing agreement with another corporation or entity. We may also acquire stock or assets of an existing business. Upon the consummation of a transaction, it is likely that our present management will no longer be in control of our company and our existing business will close down. In addition, it is likely that our officers and directors will, as part of the terms of the acquisition transaction, resign and be replaced by one or more new officers and directors.
 
We anticipate that the selection of a business opportunity in which to participate will be complex and without certainty of success. Management believes that there are numerous firms in various industries seeking the perceived benefits of being a publicly registered corporation. Business opportunities may be available in many different industries and at various stages of development, all of which will make the task of comparative investigation and analysis of such business opportunities extremely difficult and complex.
 
We may seek a business opportunity with entities who have recently commenced operations, or entities who wish to utilize the public marketplace in order to raise additional capital in order to expand business development activities, to develop a new product or service, or for other corporate purposes. We may acquire assets and establish wholly-owned subsidiaries in various businesses or acquire existing businesses as subsidiaries.
 
At this stage, we can provide no assurance that we will be able to locate compatible business opportunities, what additional financing we will require to complete a combination or merger with another business opportunity or whether the opportunity’s operations will be profitable.
 
If we are unable to secure adequate capital to continue our business of developing and managing Yulong Pump’s commercial real estate assets or alternatively, complete a merger or acquisition, our shareholders will lose some or all of their investment and our business will likely fail.

Emerging Growth Company and Smaller Reporting Company Status
 
The Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act, establishes a class of company called an “emerging growth company,” which generally is a company whose initial public offering was completed after December 8, 2011 and had total annual gross revenues of less than $1 billion during its most recently completed fiscal year. Additionally, Section 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, establishes a class of company called a “smaller reporting company,” which generally is a company with a public float of less than $75 million as of the last business day of its most recently completed second fiscal quarter or, if such public float is $0, had annual revenues of less than $50 million during the most recently completed fiscal year for which audited financial statements are available. For the year ended December 31, 2018, we qualify as both an emerging growth company and a smaller reporting company.
 
As an emerging growth company and a smaller reporting company, we are eligible to take advantage of certain extended accounting standards and exemptions from various reporting requirements that are not available to public reporting companies that do not qualify for those classifications, including without limitation the following:
 

● | An emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act, for complying with new or revised accounting standards.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
This allows an emerging growth company to delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have elected to avail ourselves of this extended transition period and, as a result, we will not be required to adopt new or revised accounting standards on the dates on which adoption of such standards is required for other public reporting companies.
 

● | An emerging growth company is exempt from any requirement that may be adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor’s report providing additional information about the audit and financial statements, commonly known as an “auditor discussion and analysis.”
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | An emerging growth company is not required to hold nonbinding advisory stockholder votes on executive compensation or any “golden parachute” payments not previously approved by stockholders.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Neither an emerging growth company nor a smaller reporting company is required to comply with the requirement of auditor attestation of internal controls over financial reporting, which is required for other public reporting companies by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | A company that is either an emerging growth company or a smaller reporting company is eligible for reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in its periodic and annual reports, including without limitation exemption from the requirement to provide a compensation discussion and analysis describing compensation practices and procedures.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | A company that is either an emerging growth company or a smaller reporting company is eligible for reduced financial statement disclosure in its registration statements, which must include two years of audited financial statements rather than the three years of audited financial statements that are required for other public reporting companies. Smaller reporting companies are also eligible to provide such reduced financial statement disclosure in annual reports on Form 10-K.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
For as long as we continue to be an emerging growth company and/or a smaller reporting company, we expect that we will take advantage of the reduced disclosure obligations available to us as a result of those respective classifications. We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (i) the last day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the date of the first sale of our common stock pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act; (ii) the last day of the fiscal year in which we have total annual gross revenues of $1 billion or more; (iii) the date on which we have issued more than $1 billion in nonconvertible debt during the previous three years; or (iv) the date on which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer under applicable SEC rules. We expect that we will remain an emerging growth company for the foreseeable future. We will also remain a smaller reporting company until we have a public float of $75 million or more as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter, and we could retain our smaller reporting company status indefinitely depending on the size of our public float.

Markets
 
Recent data shows that the Inner Mongolia property market is on a continued uptrend. Recent prices are supported by strong economic fundamentals, and a relatively inexpensive property market, compared to major first tier cities like Beijing, Shanghai, and Shenzhen where property values are almost four times the value in Hohhot city (Source: https://www.ceicdata.com/en/china/nbs-property-price-monthly/property-price-ytd-avg-house-in-advance-inner-mongolia). Additionally, the overall economic fundamentals for the province appears to be good with Gross Domestic Product growth by 5% in 2017 (Source: http://china-trade-research.hktdc.com/business-news/article/Facts-and-Figures/Inner-Mongolia-Market-Profile/ff/en/1/1X000000/1X07T7RO.htm).
 
Competition
 
Many of our competitors in the Inner Mongolia real estate development and management industry have longer operating histories, better brand recognition and greater financial resources than we do. In order for us to successfully compete in our industry we will need to:

● | offer a product or service that is competitive with our competitors;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------
● | develop a comprehensive marketing system; and 
● | increase our financial resources. 

 
However, there can be no assurance that even if we do these things we will be able to compete effectively. As we are a newly-established company, we face the same problems as other new companies starting up in an industry, such as lack of available funds. Our competitors may be substantially larger and better funded than us, and have significantly longer histories of operation and development than us. In addition, they may be able to provide more competitive products than we can and generally be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging trends and changes in legislation and regulations relating to the industry. Additionally, our competitors may devote greater resources to the development, promotion and sale of their products or services than we do. Increased competition could also result in loss of key personnel, reduced margins or loss of market share, any of which could harm our business.
 
Intellectual Property
 
We do not hold any intellectual property.
 
Government Regulation
 
The national, provincial and local governments in the China are highly bureaucratized. The day-to-day operations of our business require us to interact frequently with representatives of Chinese government institutions. The effort to obtain the registrations, licenses and permits necessary to carry out our business activities can be daunting. Significant delays can result from the need to obtain governmental approvals, which may have an adverse effect on the profitability of our operations. In addition, compliance with regulatory requirements applicable to the handling and processing of waste materials may increase the cost of our operations, which could adversely affect our profitability.
Chinese Law, Generally
 
China’s legislative bodies have enacted a tremendous volume of statutes, regulations, policies, directives and other forms of legislation in the past several decades. Despite this abundance of legislation, the state of the law on any given point is sometimes difficult to determine with certainty. It is not uncommon, for example, to encounter vague, ambiguous or contradicting legal provisions, or to discover areas with respect to which the law is silent. Where legal uncertainty is encountered in the United States, legal and business professionals look to the courts and quasi-judicial bodies (tribunals and commissions, for example), to provide an authoritative and binding interpretation upon which they can structure their affairs. In China, however, the body of published case law is sparse, and is generally not binding on other courts and quasi-judicial bodies. This serves to empower China’s administrative authorities, which often have significant discretion in the manner in which they choose to interpret and apply the law. Administrative policy can vary, frequently from case to case and over time, and can be rigid, formalistic and bureaucratic. This often requires foreign businesses and investors to be flexible in their approach to achieving their objectives.

Environment
 
The Ministry of Environmental Protection of the People’s Republic of China is responsible for uniform supervision and control of environmental protection in China. It formulates national environmental quality and discharge standards and monitors China’s environmental system. Environmental protection bureaus at the county level or above are responsible for environmental protection within their respective jurisdictions.
 
Environmental regulations require companies to file an environmental impact report with the relevant environmental bureau for approval before undertaking the construction of a new production facility or any major expansion or renovation of an existing production facility. New facilities built pursuant to this approval are not permitted to operate until the relevant environmental bureau has performed an inspection and is satisfied that the facilities are in compliance with environmental standards.
 
The environmental protection law requires facilities that produce pollutants or other hazards to incorporate environmental protection measures in their operations and establish an environmental protection responsibility system. Such a system includes adoption of effective measures to control and properly dispose of waste gases, water and residue, dust or other waste materials. Any entity that discharges pollution must register with the relevant environmental protection authority.
 
Penalties for breaching the Environmental Protection Law include a warning, payment of damages, and imposition of a fine. Any entity undertaking a construction project that fails to install pollution prevention and control facilities in compliance with environmental standards for a construction project may be ordered to suspend production or operation and fined. Criminal liability may be imposed for a material violation of environmental laws and regulations that causes loss of property or personal casualty.
 
Effect of Environmental Regulations
 
As we develop Yulong Pump’s real estate assets, we are subject to the requirements of Chinese environmental laws and regulations on air emission, waste water discharge, solid waste and noise. We will aim to comply with those environmental laws and regulations. We are not subject to any admonitions, penalties, investigations or inquiries imposed by the environmental regulators, nor are we subject to any claims or legal proceedings to which we are named as defendant for violation of any environmental law or regulation. We do not have any reasonable basis to believe that there is any threatened claim, action or legal proceedings against us that would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
 
We expect to comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations relating to our business, and at this time, we do not anticipate incurring any material capital expenditures to comply with any environmental regulations or other requirements.
 
While our intended projects and business activities do not currently violate any laws, any regulatory changes that impose additional restrictions or requirements on us or on our potential customers could adversely affect us by increasing our operating costs or decreasing demand for our products or services, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.
 
Employees
 
As of December 31, 2018, we only had three employees, namely our Chief Executive Officer, Mr. John Gong Chin Ong, our Chief Financial Officer, Mr. Chin Leong Yang and our secretary, Philip Kwan Swee Seng. Each of our officers provides his services without remuneration on an as-needed basis. We intend to hire additional employees on an as needed basis.
