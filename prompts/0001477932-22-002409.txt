Business

Bloomios manufactures, markets and distributes U.S. hemp-derived supplements and cosmetic products through wholesale distribution channels in the United States of America, through its wholly-owned subsidiary Bloomios Private Label (“BPL”). BPL provides innovative and quality manufacturing, processing, sourcing and distribution of cannabidiol products to wholesalers and retailers. BPL provides support at each step from custom formulation, order fulfillment, and brand development. We offer our private-label and white-label customers large collections of customizable hemp products that includes over 80 products across 7 categories in addition to custom formulation and manufacturing services. Our product categories include edibles, tinctures, oils, salves, capsules, balms, lotions, creams, beverages and pet treats.

Our company manufactures hemp infused products ranging from human edibles, pet edibles, liquid consumables such as tinctures and shots, topicals, and smokable hemp. Each of these products are infused with hemp extract. Our human edibles are either tumbled with hemp extracts that stick to the surface of the edibles, or made from scratch with hemp extract being cooked into gelatin or pectin bases and extruded into molds to shape them. Our Liquid consumables are infused by mixing food grade bases (Such as hemp seed, MCT oil, or water) with food grade flavoring and hemp extract. Our topicals are infused by mixing topical cream bases with hemp extract. Our smokable hemp contains no more than 0.3% of Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) by dry weight basis and is rolled into hemp paper with a filter. We test all of our products in-house utilizing High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (“HPLC”) to ensure that no final product contains more than 0.3% of total THC. All products are marketed as products infused with hemp extract with no more than 0.3% of THC on a dry weight basis.

The products are not currently marketed to consumers and are currently only sold to wholesalers. The Company attends trade shows for manufacturers and wholesalers to market our products. All products are labeled in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. Further, the Company maintains its own in-house testing lab in which it tracks and tests all batches of products, which it provides to its clients. The Company believes that its testing process meets or exceeds industry standards. 

Bloomios is headquartered in Santa Barbara, California with its operations in Daytona Beach, Florida. Bloomios intends to grow by increasing production capacity and by an acquisition strategy that is currently in development. Currently, Bloomios is principally a business-to-business operation.

History

Bloomios (“we,” “us,” the “Company” or like terms) was incorporated in the State of Nevada on February 2, 2001, under the name Relay Mines Limited in order to pursue the exploration and development of mining claims located in British Columbia, Canada.

During the quarter ended March 31, 2002, the Company conducted a registered public offering under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 in which it raised $11,000 from the sale of 110,000 shares of common stock at a public offering price of $0.10 per share.

On September 13, 2004, the Company merged with TSI Medical Corp., which was developing a cancer treatment technology in a joint venture with Exelar Corporation, at which time we abandoned our mining operations. As of September 2, 2005, Exelar Medical Corporation, the joint venture company in which we were a partner (“EMC”), defaulted on its obligations under a Technology Transfer Agreement with the inventor of the technology being developed by EMC and the inventor repossessed the technology from EMC.

Commencing with the quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the period ended October 31, 2005, the Company began filing periodic reports under the Exchange Act as a “shell” company.

On November 30, 2006, the Company filed a Certificate of Change with the Nevada Secretary of State providing for the reduction in the number of authorized shares of common stock from 100,000,000 shares to 2,000,000 shares and a corresponding reverse split of outstanding shares of common stock so that every fifty shares of common stock outstanding were exchanged for one share of common stock.

In February 2009, the Company filed a Form 15 with the SEC terminating the registration of its class of common stock under Section 12(g) of the Exchange Act and its duty to file periodic and other reports with the SEC.

On March 27, 2013, the Company filed an amendment to its Articles of Incorporation with the Nevada Secretary of State to increase the number of shares of common stock it is authorized to issue from 2,000,000 shares to 950,000,000 shares.

On November 29, 2018, the Eight Judicial District Court of Nevada entered an order appointing Bryan Glass as custodian of the Company, authorizing and directing him to, among other things, take any action reasonable, prudent and for the benefit of the Company, including reinstating the Company under Nevada law, appointing officers and convening an annual meeting of stockholders (the “Order”).

On November 30, 2018, Bryan Glass, as custodian, appointed himself to serve as an interim director of the Company until the next meeting of stockholders, as permitted by the Order. Also, on November 30, 2018, the board of directors and the custodian appointed Bryan Glass as our President, Secretary and Treasurer and authorized the issuance of 12,000,000 shares of stock to Mr. Glass for an aggregate price of $120.

On December 6, 2018, the Company filed a Certificate of Reinstatement with the state of Nevada to reestablish the Company’s existence.

On January 16, 2019, the Company held a stockholder’s meeting at which Mr. Bryan Glass was elected as the sole director of the Company.

On November 30, 2020, Mr. Bryan Glass, the President and a sole director of the Company, resigned from both positions as part of his departure from the Company. Mr. Glass served as the President, Secretary and Treasurer and a member of our Board since November 30, 2018. This resignation is not the result of any disagreement with the Company on any matter related to the Company’s operations, policies, or practices.

On November 30, 2020, the board of directors appointed Mr. Michael Hill, as the sole director of the Company, and as interim Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer of the Company. The board of directors has agreed to compensate Mr. Hill at a rate of $25,000 per month during his interim service to the Company.

On February 11, 2021, the Company entered into a non-binding Letter of (the “LOI”) with CBD Brand Partners, LLC., a Wyoming limited liability company (“CBDBP”). Under the terms of the LOI, the Company agreed to acquire CBDBP as its wholly owned subsidiary by merging CBDBP with the Company (the “Merger”), such that the Company would acquire all of the outstanding membership interests of CBDBP and the holders of the membership interests of CBDBP, immediately prior to the Merger, would receive 10,000 shares of Series A Preferred Stock, 800 shares of Series B Preferred Stock and 1,200,000 shares of Series C Preferred Stock.

On April 12, 2021, the Company completed the acquisition CBDBP. Under the terms of the agreement, the Company issued 10,000 shares of its Series A Preferred Stock at $.00001 per share (the par value) and 800 shares of its Series B Preferred Stock at $.00001 per share (the par value), and no shares of the Series C Preferred Stock, to the owners of CBDBP as the purchase price.

The acquisition of CBD Brand Partners, LLC, by Bloomios, Inc. (formerly XLR Medical Corp) was treated as a capital transaction because Bloomios was a non-operating public shell company. Pursuant to ASC 805, the transaction does not meet the definition of a business. Therefore, we accounted for the transaction as a capital transaction and the shares issued for the transactions were valued at Par ($.00001) and recorded to additional paid in capital, since the net assets of Bloomios, Inc. were negative (~$30,000).

The financial statements have been prepared on a consolidated basis with CBDBP as a wholly owned subsidiary. The consolidated financial statements and related notes have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“US GAAP”) and include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All material intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The financial statements and notes are representations of the Company’s management, who is responsible for their integrity and objectivity.

On June 16, 2021, the Company appointed Mr. Barrett Evans as Chief Strategy Officer, President and Director, and Mr. John Bennett as Chief Financial Officer and Director, as previously reported on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on June 21, 2021.

Current Operations and Strategy

As previously reported, the Company acquired CBDBP on April 12, 2021. The Company manufactures, markets and distributes hemp-derived supplements and cosmetic products through wholesale distribution channels and its wholly owned subsidiary, Bloomios Private Label. The Company provides custom formulation, brand development, manufacturing and order fulfillment to a wide variety of customers, including small and major brands, chain stores, vape shops and distributors. Offering private-label and white-label customers a wide selection of more than 80 customizable hemp products across 7 categories. The Company has its headquarters in Santa Barbara, California and has operations in Daytona Beach, Florida. The Company intends to grow by way of an acquisition strategy that is currently in development. Currently, the Company is principally a business-to-business operation with plans to sell directly to consumers in the future.
Ramifications of Our Shell Company Status

Historically, the Company had no revenue, no assets and no specific business plan or purpose. However, as a result of the Merger that closed on April 12, 2021, the Company is no longer a Shell Company and is now a development stage company with revenue, employees, assets, and liabilities Our previous status as a shell company will impact the Company and its shareholders in a number of ways, some of which are described below.
Shell Company Status

We were historically classified as a shell company as defined in Rule 405 promulgated by the SEC under the Securities Act. A shell company is one that has no or nominal operations and either: (i) no or nominal assets; or (ii) assets consisting primarily of cash or cash equivalents. As a former shell company, we are subject to various laws, regulations and restrictions, including that we will be subject to restrictions on our use of Form S-8 to register stock that we may issue to our employees and consultants and you will be subject to restrictions from relying on Rule 144 for the resale of your common stock, as described below.

Shell companies are prohibited from using Form S-8 to register securities under the Securities Act. If a company ceases to be a shell company, it may use Form S-8 sixty calendar days after the date on which it makes required filings with the SEC disclosing the cessation of its status as shell company, provided it has filed all reports and other materials required to be filed under the Exchange Act during the preceding 12 months (or for such shorter period that it has been required to file such reports and materials after the company files “Form 10 information,” which is information that a company would be required to file in a registration statement on Form 10 if it were registering a class of securities under Section 12 of the Exchange Act. This information would normally be reported on a current report on Form 8-K reporting the completion of a transaction that caused the company to cease being a Shell Company and the Company made such a filing on Form 8-K on April 20, 2021. Therefore, the Company is eligible to utilize Form S-8 as of June 20, 2021.

Rule 144 under the Act provides an exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act and allows the holders of restricted securities to sell their securities utilizing one of the provisions of this Rule. However, Rule 144 specifically precludes reliance by holders of securities of shell companies such as ours has been historically classified or any issuer that has been at any time previously a shell company, except if the following conditions are met:


· | The issuer of the securities that was formerly a shell company has ceased to be a shell company; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | The issuer of the securities is subject to the reporting requirements of Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act; 
· | The issuer of the securities has filed all Exchange Act reports and material required to be filed, as applicable, during and materials), other than current reports on Form 8-K; and
· | At least one year has elapsed from the time that the issuer filed current comprehensive disclosure with the SEC reflecting its status as an entity that is not a shell company. 


As a result of our classification as a shell company, our investors are not permitted to rely on the “safe harbor” provisions of Rule 144, promulgated pursuant to the Securities Act, so as not to be considered underwriters in connection with the sale of our securities until one year from the date that we cease to be a shell company. This will likely make it more difficult for us to attract additional capital through subsequent unregistered offerings because purchasers of securities in such unregistered offerings will not be able to resell their securities in reliance on Rule 144, a safe harbor on which holders of restricted securities usually rely to resell securities, until 12 months from the filing of that Form 8-K.

Application of Penny Stock Rules

Our common stock is a “penny stock,” as defined in Rule 3a51-1 promulgated by the SEC under the Exchange Act. The penny stock rules require a broker-dealer, among other things, prior to a transaction in penny stock not otherwise exempt from the rules, to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document that provides information about penny stocks and the nature and level of risks in the penny stock market. A broker-dealer also must provide the customer with current bid and offer quotations for the penny stock, the compensation of the broker-dealer and its salesperson in the transaction, and monthly account statements showing the market value of each penny stock held in the customer’s account. In addition, the penny stock rules require that the broker-dealer, not otherwise exempt from such rules, must make a special written determination that the penny stock is suitable for the purchaser and receive the purchaser’s written agreement to the transaction. These disclosure rules have the effect of reducing the level of trading activity in the secondary market for a stock that becomes subject to the penny stock rules. So long as our common stock is subject to the penny stock rules, it may be more difficult for us and you to sell your common stock.
Emerging Growth Company and Smaller Reporting Company Status

Emerging Growth Company

We are an “emerging growth company” as defined in Section 2(a)(19) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), as modified by the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the “JOBS Act”). As such, we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not “emerging growth companies” including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the “Sarbanes- Oxley Act”), reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. We intend to take advantage of all of these exemptions.

In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an “emerging growth company” can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards, and delay compliance with new or revised accounting standards until those standards are applicable to private companies. We have elected to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period.

We could be an emerging growth company until the last day of the first fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of our first common equity offering, although circumstances could cause us to lose that status earlier if our annual revenues exceed $1.0 billion, if we issue more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt in any three-year period or if we become a “large accelerated filer” as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act.

Smaller Reporting Company

We also qualify as a “smaller reporting company” under Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act, which is defined as a company with a public equity float of less than $250 million or it has less than $100 million in annual revenues and no public float or public float of less than $700 million. To the extent that were main a smaller reporting company, we will have reduced disclosure requirements for our public filings, including: (1) less extensive narrative disclosure than required of other reporting companies, particularly in the description of executive compensation and (2) the requirement to provide only two years of audited financial statements, instead of three years. In addition, until such time as the public float of our common stock exceeds $75 million, we will be a non-accelerated filer and will not be required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes Oxley Act.
