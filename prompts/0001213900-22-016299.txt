General 



Applied Energetics, Inc. is a corporation organized and existing under the laws of the State of Delaware. Our headquarters are located at 9070 S. Rita Road, Suite 1500, Tucson, Arizona, 85747 and our telephone number is (520) 628-7415.



Applied Energetics specializes in the development and manufacture of advanced high-performance lasers, advanced optical systems, and integrated guided energy systems for defense, aerospace, national security, industrial, biomedical, and scientific markets worldwide.



Technology, Capabilities and Patents



Applied Energetics, Inc. is recognized as a global leader in developing the next generation optical sources exhibiting ever-increasing output energy, peak power and frequency agility while also providing decreased size, weight, and cost of these systems for customers. Applied Energetics utilizes patented, dual-use technologies to advance critical industries. Leveraging our proprietary fiber-based architecture and wavelength-and pulse-agility capability, our Ultrashort Pulse (“USP™”) technology can enable users to achieve specific effects across different use cases with an unmatched blend of size, weight and power attributes. While initially designed to meet the emerging needs and priorities for the national security community, our directed energy technology also has commercial applications in both the biomedical and advanced manufacturing industries.

The AERG scientific team is continuously innovating and expanding our patent portfolio to cover these technological breakthroughs and further enhance our suite of solutions for threat disruption for the Department of Defense, the intelligence community, and for commercial, medical and space applications with optical sources operating from the deep ultraviolet to the far infrared portions of the electromagnetic spectrum.



AERG has developed, successfully demonstrated and holds all crucial intellectual property rights to a dynamic directed energy technology called Laser Guided Energy (“LGE®”) and Laser Induced Plasma Channel (“LIPC®”). LGE and LIPC are technologies that can be used in a new generation of high-tech directed energy systems. The Department of Defense (DOD) previously recognized only two key types of Directed Energy Weapon (“DEW”) technologies, High Energy Lasers (“HEL”), and High-Power Microwave (“HPM”). Neither the HEL nor the HPM intellectual property portfolio is owned by a single entity. The DOD then designated a third DEW technology, LGE. Applied Energetics’ LGE and LIPC technologies are wholly owned by Applied Energetics and patent protected with 26 current patents and an additional 11 Government Sensitive Patent Applications (“GSPA”). These GSPA’s are held under secrecy orders of the US government and allow the company greatly extended protection rights. The company also has seven provisional patents, and we continue to file patent applications as we deem appropriate.



Applied Energetics technology is vastly different from conventional directed energy systems, i.e. HEL, and HPM. LGE uses Ultrashort Pulse (USP™) laser technology to combine the speed and precision of lasers with the overwhelming impact on targeted threats with high-voltage electricity. Applied Energetics’ proprietary fiber-based architecture is a key differentiator for our technology. Compared with traditional continuous wave technology with larger footprints, AE’s architecture enables orders of magnitude size-weight-power reductions on all deliverables, creating powerful, dual-use and agile systems that can fit a host of platforms while delivering very high intensity, ultrashort pulses of light to the required target. This unique directed energy solution allows extremely high peak power and energy, with target and effects tenability, and is effective against a wide variety of potential targets. A key element of LGE is its novel ability to offer selectable and tunable properties that can help protect non-combatants and combat zone infrastructure.



Applied Energetics’ unique optical fiber-based laser architectures enable unmatched wavelength agility as well as pulse duration agility. Using innovative and highly specialized frequency shifting techniques, wavelengths can be custom tuned from the deep ultraviolet to the far Infrared. In addition, temporal outputs can be adjusted from continuous wave to sub-picoseconds. The technology enables the customer to adjust the lasers’ operating parameters, ultimately creating more flexibility to change wavelength and pulse width. This feature allows for optimization of laser performance for defense or commercial applications.



Our proprietary USP laser technology provides a significantly more compact solution than current continuous wave laser platforms while still delivering high peak power. Continuous wave laser systems are typically used to heat a target and, during continuous illumination, this heat transfer leads to melting or charring of the material. Using continuous wave output powers that now exceed 100 kilowatts (1kW = 1000 watts), it can take anywhere from seconds to minutes to impact a target. By contrast, our team has delivered USP lasers to national security customers that exceed five terawatts (1 TW = 1 trillion watts) in peak power, with the difference being that this peak power from a USP laser is delivered in a pulse that is less than a trillionth of a second. During this short pulse duration, and having such a high peak intensity, near-instantaneous ablation of the surface of the threat takes place. The net result of our innovative USP approaches are highly effective lasers with mountable footprints that require only a fraction of the size and weight of other directed energy technologies.



As Applied Energetics looks toward the future, our corporate strategic roadmap builds upon the significant value of the company’s USP capabilities and key intellectual property, including LGE and LIPC, to offer our prospective partners, co-developers and system integrators a variety of next-generation Ultrashort Pulse and frequency-agile optical sources, from the ultraviolet to the far infrared portion of the electromagnetic spectrum, to address numerous challenges within the military, medical device, and advanced manufacturing market sectors.

Business Development



We submitted multiple proposals to various government agencies in 2020 and 2021. Due to the closures of multiple agencies and work-from-home orders across various regions of the United States, reviews and funding decisions on these proposals were delayed longer than anticipated as resources were focused on other matters within the government. AERG has received multiple notices from government agencies stating that “the vast number of proposals received, and the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, have impacted the government’s evaluation timelines.” Several of the government agencies that have received and are reviewing our proposals started to open their facilities to limited off-site briefings starting on June 1, 2021. Since that date, AERG’s team has been invited to, and completed, multiple briefings focused on our capabilities and submissions. Effective August 2, 2021, the DOD reinstated a maximum telework position for their employees and contractors and reduced the on-site occupancy to less than 50% of the normal occupancy. As the Delta variant increased, the DOD maintained the maximum telework policy, and on September 9, 2021, reduced the maximum on-site occupancy to less than 40% of normal occupancy. Further restrictions were announced on January 6, 2022, due to the onslaught of the Omicron variant, with maximum occupancy of facilities dropping to 25%, and a majority of workers teleworking. These recent changes further hampered our ability to schedule on-site briefings for our proposals undergoing review. Beginning March 2022, the DOD has announced a loosening of these restrictions in certain circumstances. In any event, we intend to continue developing and submitting proposals and to be available to attend on-site briefings to the extent possible.



In addition to these review-based delays, the US federal budget for 2022 was not approved by Congress by the October 1, 2021, start of the U.S. federal government fiscal year. On September 21, 2021, the U.S. House of Representatives passed H.R. 5305, and on September 30, 2021, the U.S. Senate passed the same bill, a continuing resolution (CR) to extend federal government funding through December 3, 2021, and the President signed it into law (Public Law 117-43) on September 30, 2021, to avoid a government shutdown at the end of the fiscal year 2021. A second CR was signed into law on December 2, 2021, extending funded operations through February 18, 2022. And most recently, a third CR was signed on February 17, 2022, extending funding through March 11, 2022. The final appropriations bill was signed into law by President Biden on the night of March 11, 2022 and includes increases in areas of particular interest to the company.

Recent Developments



Upon the successful examination, and with no opposition, the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) officially entered the marks LGE® (Reg. No. 6,289,892) and LIPC® (Reg. No. 6,316,069) on March 9, 2021, and April 6, 2021, respectively, in the principal register. AERG has applications pending before the USPTO for USP, USPL, AERG and AE and anticipates allowance and/or registration within the next 12 months. The company also has seven provisional patents, and we continue to file patent applications as we deem appropriate.



The team at Applied Energetics continued to expand during the third and fourth quarters of 2021 and early 2022, with the addition of two new full-time employees (one, a laser technician and the other a junior scientist) and in-house counsel as well as retention of world-class contractors to strengthen our human resources, compliance, public relations, IT, and technical staff supporting the research and development in the laboratory. On February 22, 2022, we hired an Executive Administrative Assistant to assist the CEO and CLO with organizational administration.



Christopher Donaghey serves on Applied Energetics’ Board of Advisors, on which he has input into the strategic direction of the company and provides assistance in building lasting relationships in our defense markets. Effective January 3, 2022, we agreed with Mr. Donaghey to further extended the term of his service for an additional five years, adding an exclusivity requirement which prohibits Mr. Donaghey from providing the same advisory services to other companies in the directed energy space. The company issued Mr. Donaghey options to purchase up to 750,000 shares of its common stock on exchange for his agreement to extend his term and such exclusivity. The options are exercisable at a price of $2.40 per share and are subject to vesting at a rate of 20% per year beginning on May 12, 2024.

Chris Donaghey currently serves as the senior vice president and head of corporate development for Science Applications International Corporation (“SAIC”), a defense and government agency technology integrator. In his role on Applied Energetics’ Board of Advisors, Mr. Donaghey provides input into the strategic direction of the Company and assistance in building relationships in the defense markets. Mr. Donaghey was originally appointed to the Board of Advisors, effective April 30, 2019, and effective May 12, 2021, we had agreed to extend the term of his service for an additional one-year term plus a one-year automatic renewal in exchange for 70,000 shares of AERG’s common stock, and options to purchase an additional 200,000 shares at an exercise price of $0.61 per share, for each year of service. The shares and options are also subject to vesting over the term of his service.



Effective January 1, 2022, the board of directors of Applied Energetics appointed Mary P. O’Hara to serve as its General Counsel and Chief Legal Officer. The company and Ms. O’Hara entered into an Executive Employment Agreement, pursuant to which she is to serve for an initial term of three years, with automatic renewal for additional one-year periods thereafter unless either party terminates the agreement. The agreement calls for salary of $250,000 per year, plus standard benefits and eligibility for a bonus at the discretion of the board. The company has also granted Ms. O’Hara additional options to purchase up to 640,000 shares of its common stock under its 2018 Incentive Stock Plan, which vest over four years, at an exercise price of $2.40 per share. Ms. O’Hara has been in private law practice for twenty-nine years and has broad experience in all facets of securities, corporate and commercial law. Ms. O’Hara has represented the company for several years and is a member of its board of directors.



In May 2021, we moved into our new headquarters consisting of approximately 13,000 rentable square feet of office, laboratory and production space located at the University of Arizona Tech Park, a research and technology park owned and operated by the University of Arizona. This has enabled us to consolidate our offices and expand our R&D capacity with a Class 1000 (ISO Class 6) “clean room” and other turnkey laboratory and conference features. We have consolidated from our two previous locations and now have our management and scientific teams under one roof. We also held our 2021 Annual Meeting of Stockholders in the large University of Arizona Tech Park Conference Center, which provided the necessary equipment and refreshments. Attendees at the meeting received tours of the tech park grounds.



We entered into the Lease Agreement for the space, effective March 15, 2021, with Campus Research Corporation. The lease term began May 1, 2021, and ends on April 30, 2026. The base rent is $6.7626 per rentable square foot for year one, and escalates to $9.2009 in year two, $11.4806 in year three, $13.1740 in year four and $14.9306 in year five, plus certain operating expenses and taxes. 



The space was previously occupied by a global provider of lasers and laser-based technology which vacated prior to the end of its lease term. Thus, we are benefiting from millions of dollars of capital investment made to the facilities by the vacating tenant, and the vacating tenant continues to pay a portion of the full market rent, with the company paying the balance in the amounts set forth above. This location, as an International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) and laser safety compliant facility totaling approximately 13,000 square feet, with its approximately 4,800 square-foot Class 1000 (ISO 6) cleanroom, provides us the needed capacity for research, product development and production activities.



We followed the guidelines set forth by the Small Business Administration on the Paycheck Protection Program loan, in the amount of $132,760 which we took out in 2020, partially using the proceeds for designated qualifying expenses, in particular, retaining employees. This qualified AERG for a waiver of a portion of the loan. Accordingly, on July 2, 2021, we received a letter from our bank, via the SBA, approving conversion of $80,593.55 of the loan to a grant. Since then, we have been repaying the balance of the loan in monthly installments at the 1% annual interest rate. As of December 31, 2021, $22,804 in principal and $1,385 in interest remained outstanding, and we expect to repay the remaining balance in April 2022.



Path Forward



Our goal with the AERG Strategic Plan is to increase the energy, peak power and frequency agility of fiber-based USP optical sources while decreasing the size, weight, power-consumption and cost of these systems. We are in the process of developing this breadth of very high peak power USP lasers and additional optical sources that have a very broad range of applicability for threat disruption for the Department of Defense, the intelligence community, and for commercial, biomedical, and space applications. Although the historical market for AERG’s USP technology is the U.S. Government, derivatives of these USP technologies could provide future platforms for commercial additive and subtractive manufacturing and medical device and optical imaging markets, creating larger dual-use market for our products to address once testing, evaluation and integration have been completed in partnerships with the user community. During 2020, the AERG team was able to develop partnership and teaming arrangements with the three leading laser and optics institutes in the United States, namely, the University of Arizona, the University of Central Florida, and the University of Rochester Laboratory for Laser Energetics. Our desire is to work on programs jointly where the strengths of each organization can assist in escalating knowledge and delivery of systems to the government sponsors, and to train the next generation of scientists and engineers to work in the Directed Energy fields.

The ongoing Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic does present unique risks and uncertainties that may alter or otherwise affect our path forward. On January 8, 2022, the Pentagon decided to extend its max telework policy to occupancies of less than 25%, and officials increased the region’s Health Protection Condition (HPCON) to threat level Charlie. The increase marked the highest health alert at the Pentagon since the end of 2020. In early March 2022, the Pentagon released these protections somewhat to threat level Bravo, returning to 50% occupancy in most workspaces and circumstances. Our management continues to monitor the possible effects of the COVID-19 on the execution of our plan of operations, our prospective contracts, and the availability of financing to fund our strategic and operational plans going forward. Despite these challenges, we have continued to execute our business development plans. During the past two fiscal years, we submitted multiple proposals and have been engaged in meetings on a daily and weekly basis with various agencies and departments both remotely and in person in Washington, DC and at various other government facilities. Dr. Quarles, our President and CEO, has traveled to DC on multiple occasions during the pandemic in 2020 and 2021 and remains very committed to pursuing this business even in these challenging times. The interest in our technology and applications remains high, and we continue to submit proposals for all appropriate opportunities and share our vision of the disruptive capabilities of USP™ optical sources for both near- and far-term threats and dual-use commercial applications.



Through our analysis of the market, and in discussions with potential customers, we would also conclude that customers are becoming more receptive and interested in directed energy technologies. According to the Department of Defense fiscal 2019 budget, its directed energy spending grew from approximately $500 million in 2017 to over $1 billion in 2019, an increase of 100%. The 2020 budget reflected directed energy spending of $1.2 billion, an additional increase of 20% over 2019, and from 2017 through 2020, the directed energy budget grew from approximately $500 million to approximately $1.2 billion, averaging approximately 40% per year. The government has allocated $1.4 billion for various directed energy programs in 2021, and market analysis and projections have estimated that this directed energy sector is anticipated to exceed $10.1 billion globally by 2026. The DOD budget for directed energy was essentially flat between 2021 and 2022, approaching $1.2 billion for each year. As a result, we continue to be optimistic about our future and the growing opportunities in directed energy applications. The AERG team anticipates a continuation of strong funding for the directed energy community. With our existing patent portfolio, and through further advancements of our technologies, we believe we have the substantial building blocks needed to become a significant and successful developer in our USP and LGE marketplaces.



Market for Our Technology



Directed Energy Systems



Directed energy systems involve the use of directed energy to incapacitate, damage, or destroy enemy equipment, facilities, and assets. Previous to LGE, the only two viable directed energy systems were High Energy Laser (HEL), which uses heat to burn targets and High Power Microwave (HPM) systems, that use electromagnetic energy at specific microwave and radio frequencies to disable electronic systems.



HEL and HPM directed energy technologies have been under development for decades with numerous DoD and other government contractors participating. The unique attributes of directed energy weapon systems —the ability to create precise effects against multiple targets near-instantaneously and at a very low cost per shot—have great potential to help the DoD in addressing future warfare requirements. The DoD invests research and development dollars into directed energy solutions to fill gaps identified by warfighters. For example, in future conflicts with capable enemies possessing large inventories of guided missiles, it may be operationally risky and cost-prohibitive for the U.S. military to continue to rely exclusively on a limited number of kinetic missile interceptors. Such a “missile competition” could allow an adversary to impose costs on U.S. forces by compelling them to intercept each incoming missile with far more expensive kinetic munitions. The DoD has made significant leaps in both performance and maturity as a result of many years of research with multiple threat-intercept technologies and has been directed by Congress in fiscal year 2022 to increase funding and evaluation of pulsed laser technology in future directed energy platforms.

Applied Energetics utilizes patented, dual-use technologies to advance critical industries. Leveraging our proprietary fiber-based architecture and wavelength- and pulse-agility capability, our ultrashort pulse technology enables users to achieve specific effects across different use cases with an unmatched blend of size, weight and power attributes. While initially designed to meet the emerging needs and priorities for the national security community, Applied Energetics’ directed energy technology also has commercial applications in both the biomedical and advanced manufacturing industries.




Fiber Based Laser Architecture



Applied Energetics’ proprietary fiber-based architecture is a key differentiator for our technology. Compared with traditional continuous wave technology with larger footprints, AE’s architecture enables orders of magnitude size-weight-power reductions on all deliverables, creating powerful, dual-use and agile systems that can fit a host of platforms while delivering very high intensity, ultrashort pulses of light to the required target.



Using this unique architecture as a laser source for an integrated system can enable Applied Energetics to develop, integrate and deliver a suite of technologies that best meet the needs and requirements of its customers.



Wavelength- and Pulse- Agility



Applied Energetics’ optical fiber-based laser architectures enable unmatched wavelength agility as well as pulse duration agility. Using innovative and highly specialized frequency shifting techniques, wavelengths can be custom tuned from the deep ultraviolet to the far infrared. In addition, temporal outputs can be adjusted from continuous wave to sub-picoseconds. The technology enables the customer to adjust the lasers’ operating parameters, ultimately creating more flexibility to change wavelength and pulse width. This feature allows for optimization of laser performance for defense or commercial applications.
Competition



AERG’s Ultrashort Pulse sources, including proprietary LIPC® based LGE® technology, are unique and can be integrated onto platforms being developed for use by the U.S. Government. Over the past several years, a handful of major defense contractors have received significant funding for directed energy systems development, manufacturing and integration, using continuous wave and microwave technologies. These contractors specialize in different directed energy system platforms to respond to a variety of threats. Applied Energetics believes that its pulsed laser systems can be a part of a layered defense solution alongside these other technologies. Although AERG competes against other directed energy systems for funding, the uniqueness of our technologies should continue to support their development into weapon platform programs. AERG believes that there is renewed U.S. Government interest in directed energy applications and believes that continued development of its USP capabilities and growing interest from all branches of the U.S. armed forces and other government agencies will lead to increases in government spending on directed energy in the coming years. Likewise, there are multiple new threats that must be addressed with unique and emerging technologies, and AERG is working diligently to rapidly advance development, demonstration, testing and engineering of the Advanced Ultrashort Pulse lasers throughout the spectrum from the ultraviolet to the far infrared. We believe that USP technologies can rapidly accelerate in magnitude, as a percentage of the federal budget, compared with other technologies over the next several years.



AERG’s primary direct USP optical source competition are corporations and contractors supported by foreign governments who may be attempting to develop similar technologies. AERG believes that such foreign activity will create additional U.S. Government funding for both USP sources and LGE in order to maintain our country’s lead in pulsed directed-energy systems. Other companies with directed energy capabilities, albeit in continuous wave, microwave and other areas within directed energy, are Raytheon Technologies, Lockheed Martin, Northrup Grumman, Boeing, BAE, nLight, General Atomics, Daylight Solutions and L3Harris Technologies.



Some of AERG’s biggest commercial competitors are Trumpf (German), Coherent (US), Thales (France) and IPG (US), all of which are billion-dollar market class companies that have substantially more resources than AERG.
