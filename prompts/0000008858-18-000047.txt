 Item 1. Business
 Avnet, Inc. (the “Company” or “Avnet”), is a global technology solutions company with an extensive ecosystem delivering design, product, marketing and supply chain expertise for customers at every stage of the product lifecycle. Avnet transforms ideas into intelligent solutions, reducing the time, cost and complexities of bringing products to market around the world. Founded in 1921 and incorporated in New York in 1955, the Company works with over 1,400 technology suppliers to serve 2.1 million customers in more than 140 countries.
 For nearly a century, Avnet has helped its customers and suppliers realize the transformative possibilities of technology while continuously expanding the breadth and depth of its capabilities. Today, as technologies like the Internet of Things (“IoT”) continue to increase the complexity in product development, Avnet is once again redefining itself by offering everything customers need to bring their product to life through one partner. Most recently Avnet significantly enhanced its expertise in design, supply chain and logistics by acquiring the capabilities to better serve customers in the earlier stages of product development—encompassing research, prototyping and manufacturing—through the purchase of Premier Farnell (fiscal 2017), Hackster.io (fiscal 2017) and Dragon Innovation (fiscal 2018). Avnet’s ecosystem is designed to match its customers’ needs along their entire product development journey, providing both end-to-end and à la carte support options, as well as digital tools, to meet varying needs and buying preferences.
 The Company operates in 125 locations spanning the Americas, Europe, Middle East and Africa (“EMEA”) and Asia/Pacific (“Asia”) regions. Because Avnet supports every stage of the product lifecycle, it serves a wide range of customers: from startups and mid-sized businesses to enterprise-level original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”), electronic manufacturing services (“EMS”) providers and original design manufacturers (“ODMs”). Avnet works with customers of every size, in every corner of the world, to guide today’s ideas into tomorrow’s technology.
 Organizational Structure
 Avnet has two primary operating groups — Electronic Components (“EC”) and Premier Farnell (“PF”). Both operating groups have operations in each of the three major economic regions of the world: the Americas, EMEA and Asia. Each operating group has its own management team that includes senior executives and leadership both at the global and regional levels, who manage various functions within such businesses. Each operating group also has distinct financial reporting that is evaluated at the executive level on which operating decisions and strategic planning and resource allocation for the Company as a whole are made. Divisions (“business units”) exist within each operating group that serve primarily as sales and marketing units to further streamline the sales efforts within each operating group and enhance each operating group’s ability to work with its customers and suppliers, generally along more specific product lines or geographies. However, each business unit relies heavily on the support services provided by the operating groups as well as centralized support at the corporate level. 
 A description of each operating group is presented below. Further financial information by operating group is provided in Note 17 “Segment information” to the consolidated financial statements appearing in Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
 Avnet’s foreign operations are subject to a variety of risks. These risks are discussed further under Risk Factors in Item 1A and under Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk in Item 7A of this Report. Additionally, the specific translation impacts of foreign currency fluctuations, most notably the Euro and the British Pound, on the Company’s consolidated financial statements are further discussed in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Item 7 of this Report.

electronic components and industrial automation components to both engineers and entrepreneurs. PF brings the latest products, services and development trends all together in element14, an industry-leading online community where engineers collaborate to solve one another’s design challenges. In element14, members get consolidated information on new technologies as well as access to experts and products. Members can see what other engineers are working on, learn from online training and get the help they need to optimize their own designs.
 Acquisitions
 Avnet has historically pursued business acquisitions to further its strategic objectives and support key business initiatives, completing 100 acquisitions since 1991. This acquisition program was a significant factor in Avnet becoming one of the largest value-added distributors of electronic components including integrated products and solutions. Avnet expects to continue to pursue strategic acquisitions to expand its ecosystem, market presence, increase its scale and scope, and extend its product and service offerings throughout all stages of the technology product lifecycle. Discontinued Operations
 In fiscal 2017, the Company sold the Technology Solutions (“TS”) business, which was historically a reportable operating segment. With the sale of the TS business, the Company is focused on providing design and supply chain solutions specific to the electronic components industry.
 See Note 3 to the Company’s consolidated financial statements included in Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion on the sale of the TS business.
 Major Products
 One of Avnet’s competitive strengths is the breadth and quality of the suppliers whose products it distributes. Texas Instruments products accounted for approximately 11% of the Company’s consolidated sales from continuing operations during fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016, and was the only supplier from which sales of its products exceeded 10% of consolidated sales. Listed in the table below are the major product categories and the Company’s approximate sales of each during the past three fiscal years. Fiscal 2016 contained 53 weeks compared to 52 weeks in the other fiscal years presented. 
 | Years Ended | 
 | June 30, | | July 1, | | July 2, 
 | 2018 | | 2017 | | 2016 
 | (Millions) | 
Semiconductors | $ | 14,890.9 | | $ | 13,537.9 | $ | 13,978.0
Interconnect, passive & electromechanical (IP&E) | | 3,468.4 | | | 2,909.2 | | 2,098.7 
Computers | | 461.9 | | | 504.2 | | 222.7

  Competition & Markets
 The electronic components industry continues to be extremely competitive. The Company’s major competitors include: Arrow Electronics, Inc., Future Electronics, World Peace Group, Mouser Electronics and Digi-Key Electronics. There are also certain smaller, specialized competitors who generally focus on narrower regions, markets, products or particular sectors. As a result of these factors, Avnet must remain competitive in its pricing of products.

 A key competitive factor in the electronic component distribution industry is the need to carry a sufficient amount of inventory to meet customers’ rapid delivery requirements. To minimize its exposure related to inventory on hand, the majority of the Company’s products are purchased pursuant to non-exclusive distributor agreements, which typically provide certain protections for product obsolescence and price erosion. These agreements are generally cancelable upon 30 to 180 days’ notice and, in most cases, provide for or require inventory return privileges upon cancellation. In fiscal 2017, certain suppliers terminated their distribution agreements with the Company, which did not result in any significant inventory write-downs as a result of such terminations. In addition, the Company enhances its competitive position by offering a variety of value-added services, which entail the performance of services and/or customer support tailored to individual customer specifications and business needs, such as point of use replenishment, testing, assembly, supply chain management and materials management.
 A competitive advantage is the breadth of the Company’s supplier product line card. Because of the number of Avnet’s suppliers, many customers can simplify their procurement process and make all of their required purchases from Avnet, rather than purchasing from several different distributors or other vendors.
 Seasonality
 Historically, Avnet’s business and continuing operations has not been materially impacted by seasonality, with the exception of an impact on consolidated results from shifts in regional sales trends from Asia in the first half of a fiscal year to the Americas and EMEA regions in the second half of a fiscal year.   Number of Employees
 At June 30, 2018, Avnet had approximately 15,400 employees compared to 15,700 employees at July 1, 2017, and 17,700 at July 2, 2016.
