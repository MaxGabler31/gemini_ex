Market Overview, Products, Systems and Solutions
 With more than a century of water technology innovation, Badger Meter is a global provider of industry leading water solutions encompassing flow measurement, quality and other system parameters.  These offerings provide customers with the data and analytics essential to optimize their operations and contribute to the sustainable use and protection of the world’s most precious resource.  The Company’s flow measurement products measure water and other fluids and are known for accuracy, long-lasting durability and for providing valuable and timely measurement data through various methods.  The Company’s water quality monitoring solutions include optical sensing and electrochemical instruments that provide real-time, on-demand data parameters. The Company’s product lines fall into two categories: sales of water meters, radios, software and related technologies, and water quality monitoring solutions to water utilities (utility water) and sales of meters and other sensing instruments, valves, software and other solutions for industrial applications in water, wastewater, and other industries (flow instrumentation).  The Company estimates that over 90% of its products are used in water related applications.
 Utility water, the largest sales category, is comprised of either mechanical or static (ultrasonic) water meters along with the related radio and software technologies and services used by water utilities as the basis for generating their water and wastewater revenues, enabling operating efficiencies and engaging with their end consumers.  It further comprises other sensor technology used in the water distribution system to ensure the safe and efficient delivery of clean water.  These sensors are used to detect leaks in the distribution piping system and to monitor various water quality parameters throughout the distribution system.  The largest geographic market for the Company’s utility water products is North America, primarily the United States, because most of the Company's meters are designed and manufactured to conform to standards promulgated by the American Water Works Association.  The majority of water meters sold by the Company continue to be mechanical in nature; however, static meters are an increasing percentage of the water meters sold by the Company and in the industry, due to a variety of factors, including their ability to maintain measurement accuracy over their useful life.  Providing ultrasonic water meter technology, combined with advanced radio technology, provides the Company with the opportunity to sell into other geographical markets, for example the Middle East, Europe and Southeast Asia.  
 The flow instrumentation product line primarily serves water applications throughout the broader industrial markets. This product line includes meters, valves and other sensing instruments sold worldwide to measure and control the quantity of fluids going through a pipe or pipeline including water, air, steam, and other liquids and gases.  These products are used in a variety of industries and applications, with the Company’s primary market focus being water/wastewater, heating, ventilating and air conditioning (HVAC) and corporate sustainability.  Flow instrumentation products are generally sold to original equipment manufacturers as the primary flow measurement device within a product or system, as well as through manufacturers’ representatives.
 Utility water meters (both residential and commercial) are generally classified as either manually read meters or remotely read meters via radio technology.  A manually read meter consists of a water meter and a register that provides a visual totalized meter

reading.  Meters equipped with radio technology (endpoints) receive flow measurement data from battery-powered encoder registers attached to the water meter, which is encrypted and transmitted via radio frequency to a receiver that collects and formats the data appropriately for water utility usage and billing systems.  These remotely read systems are classified as either automatic meter reading (AMR) systems, where a vehicle equipped for meter reading purposes, including a radio receiver, computer and reading software, collects the data from the utilities’ meters; or advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) systems, where data is gathered utilizing a network (either fixed or cellular) of data collectors or gateway receivers that are able to receive radio data transmission from the utilities’ meters. AMI systems eliminate the need for utility personnel to drive through service territories to collect data from the meters.  These systems provide utilities with more frequent and diverse data from their meters at specified intervals.
 The ORION® branded family of radio endpoints provides water utilities with a range of industry-leading options for meter reading.  These include ORION (ME) for migratable AMR meter reading, ORION (SE) for traditional fixed network applications, and ORION Cellular for an infrastructure-free meter reading solution.  ORION migratable makes the migration to fixed network easier for utilities that prefer to start with mobile reading and later adopt fixed network communications, allowing utilities to choose a solution for their current needs and be positioned for their future operational changes.  ORION Cellular eliminates the need for utility-owned fixed network infrastructure, allows for gradual or full deployment, and decreases ongoing maintenance.
 Information and analytics are critical to the water metering ecosystem.  The Company’s BEACON® software suite improves utility visibility to their water and water usage.  BEACON is a secure, cloud-hosted software suite that includes a customizable dashboard, and has the ability to establish alerts for specific conditions.  It also allows for consumer engagement tools that permit end water users (such as homeowners) to view and manage their water usage activity.  Benefits to the utility include improved customer service, increased visibility through faster leak detection, the ability to promote and quantify the effects of its water conservation efforts, and easier compliance reporting.
 Water meter replacement and the adoption and deployment of new technology comprise the majority of water meter product sales, including radio products.  To a much lesser extent, housing starts also contribute to the new product sales base.  There continues to be a growing trend in the conversion from manually read water meters to meters with radio technology, and for AMR systems to be upgraded to AMI.  The Company estimates that approximately 70% of water meters installed in the United States have been converted to some form of radio solution technology.
 In addition to our water utility flow measurement solutions, the Company provides various water quality monitoring solutions utilizing optical sensors and electrochemical instruments that measure a variety of parameters including turbidity, pH, chlorine, nitrates and approximately 40 others.   Utilizing these solutions, water quality can be monitored continually or periodically throughout the network from its original source to the point in which it is recycled and returned.  Real-time water quality parameters enhance the scope of actionable data for water utilities to improve operational security, awareness and efficiency.
 The Company’s net sales and corresponding net earnings depend on unit volume and product mix, with the Company generally earning higher average selling prices and margins on meters equipped with radio technology, and higher margins on ultrasonic compared to mechanical meters. The Company also sells registers and endpoints separately to customers who wish to upgrade their existing meters in the field.  
 Flow instrumentation products are used in flow measurement and control applications across a broad industrial spectrum, occasionally leveraging the same technologies used in the municipal water category.  Specialized communication protocols that control the entire flow measurement process and mandatory certifications drive these markets.  The Company provides both standard and customized flow instrumentation solutions.
 The industries served by the Company’s flow instrumentation products face accelerating demands to contain costs, reduce product variability, and meet ever-changing safety, regulatory and sustainability requirements.  To address these challenges, customers must reap more value from every component in their systems.  This system-wide scrutiny has heightened the focus on flow instrumentation in industrial process, manufacturing, commercial fluid, building automation and precision engineering applications where flow measurement and control are critical.
 A leader in both mechanical and static flow metering technologies for industrial markets, the Company offers one of the broadest flow measurement, control and communication portfolios in the market.  This portfolio carries respected brand names including Recordall®, Hedland®, Dynasonics®, Blancett®, ModMag®, and Research Control®, and includes eight of the ten major flow meter technologies.  Customers rely on the Company for application-specific solutions that deliver accurate, timely and dependable flow data and control essential for product quality, cost control, safer operations, regulatory compliance and more sustainable operations.
 In addition, the Company provides various water quality monitoring solutions utilizing optical sensors and electrochemical instruments that measure a variety of parameters providing industrial customers with both process and discharge water quality monitoring capabilities.

Company and such amounts could be material.  Expenditures for compliance control provisions and regulations during 2021, 2020 and 2019 were not material.
 
Government Regulations
 
The Company’s operations worldwide are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations. Whether at the federal, state, or local level, the intent of these laws and regulations is to protect product safety, public health and the environment. Similar laws and regulations have been adopted by government authorities in other countries in which we manufacture, distribute, and sell our products.  
 The Company believes that its operations, including its manufacturing locations, are in substantial compliance with all applicable government laws and regulations, including those related to environmental, consumer protection, international trade, labor and employment, human rights, tax, anti-bribery and competition matters. Any additional measures to maintain compliance are not expected to materially affect the Company's capital expenditures, competitive position, financial position or results of operations.
 There are currently no legislative or administrative regulations pending which we anticipate will have a substantial adverse impact on the Company's revenues, earnings or cash flows. However, if new or amended laws or regulations impose significant operational restrictions and compliance requirements upon the Company or its products, the Company's business, capital expenditures, results of operations, financial condition and competitive position could be negatively impacted.

 Risk Management

The Company’s Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) process aims to identify and address significant and material risks. The ERM process assesses, manages, and monitors risks consistent with the integrated risk framework in the Enterprise Risk Management-Integrated Framework (2017) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). We believe that risk-taking is an inherent aspect of the execution of our strategy. Our goal is to manage risks pragmatically as opposed to avoiding risks altogether. We can mitigate risks and their impact on our Company only to a limited extent.
 
A group of executives prioritizes identified risks and assigns an executive to address each major identified risk area and lead action plans to manage each risk. Our Board of Directors provides oversight of the ERM process and reviews the significant identified risks. The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors also reviews significant financial risk exposures and the steps management has taken to monitor, manage and mitigate them wherever possible. Our other Board committees also play a role in risk management, as detailed in their respective charters.
 
Our goal is to proactively manage risks using a structured approach in combination with strategic planning, with the intent to preserve and enhance shareholder value. However, the risks set forth Item 1A. Risk Factors and elsewhere in this Annual Report on 
 8
 
Form 10-K and other risks and uncertainties could unfavorably affect us and cause our results to vary materially from recent results or from our anticipated future results.
