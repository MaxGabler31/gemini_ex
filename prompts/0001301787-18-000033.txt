ITEM 1.  BUSINESS
Company Overview
We are a leading distributor of building and industrial products in the United States (“U.S.”). The Company is headquartered in Atlanta, Georgia, with executive offices located at 4300 Wildwood Parkway, Atlanta, Georgia, and we operate our distribution business through a broad network of distribution centers. We serve many major metropolitan areas in the U.S., and deliver building and industrial products to a variety of wholesale and retail customers.
Fiscal Year
Fiscal 2017, fiscal 2016, and fiscal 2015 each were comprised of 52 weeks. 
Products and Services
We distribute products in two principal categories: structural products and specialty products. Structural products, which represented approximately 46% of our fiscal 2017 gross sales, and 41% of gross sales for both fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2015, include plywood, oriented strand board (“OSB”), rebar and remesh, lumber and other wood products primarily used for structural support, walls, and flooring in construction projects. Specialty products, which represented approximately 54% of our fiscal 2017 gross sales, and 59% of gross sales for both fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2015, include roofing, insulation, specialty panels, moulding, engineered wood products, vinyl products (used primarily in siding), outdoor living, particle board, and metal products (excluding rebar and remesh). In some cases, these products are branded by us.
We also provide a wide range of value-added services and solutions to our customers and suppliers including:

• | providing “less-than-truckload” delivery services;


• | pre-negotiated program pricing plans;


• | inventory stocking;


• | automated order processing through an electronic data interchange, or “EDI”, that provides a direct link between us and our customers;


• | intermodal distribution services, including railcar unloading and cargo reloading onto customers’ trucks;


• | milling and fabrication services; and


• | backhaul services, when otherwise empty trucks are returning from customer deliveries.

Distribution Channels
We sell products through three main distribution channels: warehouse sales, reload sales, and direct sales.
Warehouse sales are delivered from our warehouses to dealers, home improvement centers, and industrial users. Warehouse sales accounted for approximately 74% of both our fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016 gross sales, and 73% of our fiscal 2015 gross sales.
Reload sales are similar to warehouse sales but are shipped from third-party warehouses where we store owned product to enhance operating efficiencies. This channel is employed primarily to service strategic customers that would be less economical to service from our warehouses, and to distribute large volumes of imported products from port facilities. Reload sales accounted for approximately 7%, 6%, and 8% of our fiscal 2017, fiscal 2016, and fiscal 2015 gross sales, respectively.
Direct sales are shipped from the manufacturer to the customer without our taking physical inventory possession. This channel requires the lowest amount of committed capital and fixed costs. Direct sales accounted for approximately 19% of our fiscal 2017 gross sales, and 20% and 19% of our fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2015 gross sales, respectively.
Competition
The U.S. building products distribution market is a highly fragmented market, served by national and multi-regional distributors, regionally focused distributors, and independent local distributors. Local and regional distributors tend to be closely held and often specialize in a limited number of segments, in which they offer a broader selection of products. Some of our national and multi-regional competitors are part of larger companies and therefore may have access to greater financial and other resources than those to which we have access. We compete on the basis of breadth of product offering, consistent availability of product, product price and quality, reputation, service, and distribution facility location.
Two of our largest competitors are Boise Cascade Company and Weyerhaeuser Company. Most major markets in which we operate are served by the distribution arm of at least one of these companies.
Seasonality
We are exposed to fluctuations in quarterly sales volumes and expenses due to seasonal factors common in the building products distribution industry. The first and fourth quarters are typically our slowest quarters due to the impact of unfavorable weather on the construction market. Our second and third quarters are typically our strongest quarters, reflecting an increase in construction due to more favorable weather conditions. Our working capital, accounts receivable, and accounts payable generally peak in the third quarter, while inventory generally peaks in the second quarter in anticipation of the summer building season.
Employees
As of December 30, 2017, we employed approximately 1,500 employees. We consider our relationship with our employees generally to be good.

Environmental and Other Governmental Regulations
The Company is subject to various federal, state, provincial and local laws, rules, and regulations. We are subject to environmental laws, rules, and regulations that limit discharges into the environment, establish standards for the handling, generation, emission, release, discharge, treatment, storage and disposal of hazardous materials, substances and wastes, and require cleanup of contaminated soil and groundwater. These laws, ordinances, and regulations are complex, change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time. Many of them provide for substantial fines and penalties, orders (including orders to cease operations), and criminal sanctions for violations. They may also impose liability for property damage and personal injury stemming from the presence of, or exposure to, hazardous substances. In addition, certain of our operations require us to obtain, maintain compliance with, and periodically renew permits.
Certain of these laws, including the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, may require the investigation and cleanup of an entity’s or its predecessor’s current or former properties, even if the associated contamination was caused by the operations of a third party. These laws also may require the investigation and cleanup of third-party sites at which an entity or its predecessor sent hazardous wastes for disposal, notwithstanding that the original disposal activity accorded with all applicable requirements. Liability under such laws may be imposed jointly and severally, and regardless of fault.
We are also subject to the requirements of the U.S. Department of Labor Occupational Safety and Health Administration (“OSHA”). In order to maintain compliance with applicable OSHA requirements, we have established uniform safety and compliance procedures for our operations, and implemented measures to prevent workplace injuries.
The U.S. Department of Transportation (“DOT”) regulates our operations in domestic interstate commerce. We are subject to safety requirements governing interstate operations prescribed by the DOT. We are also subject to the oversight of the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (“FMCSA”). Vehicle dimensions and driver hours of service also remain subject to both federal and state regulation.
We incur and will continue to incur costs to comply with the requirements of environmental, health and safety, and transportation laws, ordinances, and regulations. We anticipate that these requirements could become more stringent in the future, and we cannot assure you that compliance costs will not be material.
