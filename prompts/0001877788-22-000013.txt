Item 1. Business.
Overview
 
Boon Industries, Inc. is an innovative bioscience company that has developed chemical solutions for the agricultural, food and beverage, hospitality, and medical industries. DiOx+, our flagship product, is a disinfectant sterilizer that kills harmful pathogens without dangerous toxic exposure to the user or the environment. DiOx+ is an activated chlorine dioxide (Cl02) broad spectrum disinfectant that helps protect the environment and human health from viruses, bacteria and harmful by-products left by other cleaning sanitizers, without a harsh smell or skin irritation.
 
Our proprietary chemical formulas and processes make DiOx+ ideal for sterilizing mission critical, high value medical equipment and disinfecting air and surfaces in laboratory and hospital environments. DiOx+ helps protect agricultural crops from disease, can be used in water treatment systems, and helps reduce operational costs in warehousing, distribution centers, and ecommerce support facilities.
 
We manufacture DiOx+ in the U.S. at our production facility located in Grass Valley, California. We also manufacture customized white label products for the food and beverage industry at the facility we lease in Grants Pass, Oregon. These white label products are predominantly tinctures of liquid nutritional supplements that utilize nano-emulsification to suspend particles in a solution.
 
Boon Industries Inc also provides modified shipping containers outfitted for agricultural purposes. These units offer solutions for several different segments within the agricultural industry and can be designed to accommodate a variety of uses.
 
Holding Company Parent Subsidiary Formation
 
Boon is the successor issuer of Leaf of Faith Beverage, Inc. (LOFB), as a result of a holding company reorganization effected by a merger (the Holding Company Merger) on March 2, 2020, under which LOFB merged with and into Leaf of Faith Beverage Merger Sub, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Boon, which in turn was a wholly owned subsidiary of LOFB. The Holding Company Merger was effected pursuant Section 1080(g) of the Oklahoma General Corporation Act (the Oklahoma Act), under which wholly owned subsidiaries may merge to effect a holding company structure without requiring a stockholder vote.
Matrix of Life Trust Acquisition
 
On March 2, 2020, following the Holding Company Merger, we purchased all the assets, and assumed all of the liabilities of Matrix of Life Tech Trust, an Oregon Trust, pursuant to an Asset Purchase Agreement dated February 10, 2020 (the Matrix Acquisition). In connection with the Matrix Acquisition, Justin Gonzalez, the trustee, and sole beneficiary of Matrix of Life Tech Trust, was appointed our Chief Executive Officer and Chairman. Prior to the Matrix Acquisition, Matrix produced beverages and food products at a facility leased in Grants Pass, Oregon. As a result of the Matrix Acquisition, our business became the business previously conducted by Matrix. Following the Matrix Acquisition, we have expanded Matrixs business of manufacturing customized white label products for the food and beverage industry to focus on the distribution of our DiOx+ product.
 
Matrix of Life Tech Trust (the Trust) was established in October of 2011 by Justin Gonzalez, as trustee, for the benefit of his children to develop proprietary technologies in emulsification with applications in the beverage and nutritional supplement industries. The Trust was initially funded by cash from Mr. Gonzalez to engage in its business. Beginning in 2012 the Trust conducted water bottling operations in Grants Pass, Oregon, where it produced bottled water and a range of products for the health and wellness industry, until the sale of its assets to us in March 2020.

Our Market Opportunity
 
The market opportunity for Boon Industries DiOx+ product includes key sectors that require effective disinfecting and sterilizing of air, surfaces, and equipment. The growth in these markets has been substantial since 2020, and the outlook continues to grow following the advent of the COVID-19 pandemic. The global sterilization equipment and disinfectants market is expected to grow from $7 billion in 2019 to $9 billion in 2023, a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 8.4%. In 2020, the sterilization equipment market was valued at $8 billion, driven by increased demand for sterilization equipment, disinfectants, and critical care equipment due to COVID-19. The U.S. surface disinfectant market size was valued at $987 million in 2019 and is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 9.2% from 2020 to 2027.
 
The surface disinfectants market is projected to grow substantially due to strict regulations for the use of surface disinfectants, rising awareness among consumers regarding hygiene, and increasing cases of chronic diseases. The market is further driven by the rising incidences of disease outbreaks, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, which has created a steep rise in the demand for surface disinfectants from hospitals. Chemical disinfectants have emerged as the largest composition segment, with growing demand for disinfectants such as quaternary ammonium compounds and alcohols. Due to the rising awareness about the effects of the toxic nature of some of the chemical-based products and the many recalls that have occurred recently, our products non-toxic yet highly effective dynamic is expected to provide a critical competitive advantage for our product line, which is based on protecting the health of people and the environment with an eco-friendly chlorine dioxide solution and its oxidizing properties.
 
In addition, we anticipate that our California base will provide us with access and exposure to the nations most significant agriculture market. Protecting agriculture from disease and providing farmers with cost-effective solutions to protect, process and clean crops represents a significant opportunity for us. In California alone, crops are a $50+ billion business, including exports that topped $21 billion in 2019. Grape production generated $5.4 billion in 2019 and almond production resulted in $6.1 billion in cash receipts. California accounts for 40 percent of all organic production in the U.S. and organic sales grew to $10.4 billion in 2019. Boon is targeting farms in Californias central valley to develop pilot projects around protecting the food supply from the devasting impacts of pests, viruses and diseases. These efforts include touch points in the fields, at the processing plants and in the transportation system.

Industry Overview
 
Since the FDA approved usage of chlorine dioxide under Title 21 in 2016, there have been a handful of companies that have begun to offer chlorine dioxide products. There are three main types of chlorine dioxide available in the market, and each have their pros and cons:

● | Gaseous chlorine dioxide. 
--+------------------------------


● | Stabilized chlorine dioxide; and 
--+-------------------------------------


● | Activated chlorine dioxide (in solution), such as DiOx+. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------

Gaseous Chlorine Dioxide
 
Chlorine dioxide gas is generally created in situ using ClO2 gas electrochemical or electrolytic generators, or by mixing two incompatible chemicals that as a result produce chlorine dioxide gas. Since the gas cannot be compressed or stored, the generators are usually installed on location and used as a chlorine dioxide feed for immediate application. A wide range of companies offer equipment and/or services for on-site disinfection.
Stabilized Chlorine Dioxide
 
Stabilized chlorine dioxide can be produced by chemically mixing sodium chlorite with other compounds, such as hydrogen peroxide (H2O2); however, they are either not chlorine dioxide per se (ClO2, which is a gas), or the ingredients to create the actual gas have not been mixed and will be mixed to produce ClO2 when in contact with water.
 
Activated Chlorine Dioxide (in solution) (DiOx+)
 
Chlorine dioxide is usually produced as a gas dissolved in a water solution starting with a sodium chlorite solution and one of the following methods: reaction with chlorine gas, or reaction with sodium hypochlorite and an acid, or reaction with an acid, typically hydrochloric acid. Efficient generation of chlorine dioxide is reliant on proper precursor ratios and mixing for a given method.
 
When chlorine dioxide is generated in solution, it is a very effective liquid disinfectant at point of use. Chlorine dioxide at use concentrations (0.5–.85 ppm) overcomes some of the disadvantages of hypochlorite in that it is non tainting, noncorrosive, and nontoxic. Its sole use at present is in water disinfection. Unlike iodine, chlorine dioxide has no adverse effects on thyroid function. Chlorine dioxide is widely used by municipal water treatment facilities. The term chlorine dioxide is misleading because chlorine is not the active element. Chlorine dioxide is an oxidizing, not a chlorinating agent, and it acts by means of a reduction-oxidation (redox) electro-chemical reaction.
 
Chlorine Dioxide Market
 
The global chlorine dioxide market size was over $795 million in 2019 and is estimated to grow at over 5% CAGR between 2020 and 2026 owing to significant expansion of the industrial wastewater treatment sector. Growing regulatory restrictions on the usage of chlorine and hypochlorite in pulp bleaching should boost the adoption of chlorine dioxide.
 
The product is witnessing rising demand in several industries including the pulp and paper industry owing to the growing adoption of paper packaging products on account of the significant expansion of the retail and e-commerce sector. The growing demand for pulp from the textile industry and increasing consumer preference for personal hygiene products such as tissue papers and disposable towels should further drive the chlorine dioxide market growth. Stabilized chlorine dioxide is an ideal ingredient of the pulp bleaching process to produce pulp with higher brightness. Under FDA regulations, chlorine dioxide may legally be used as a food additive provided it is obtained by prescribed production methods such as the electrolysis of sodium chlorite, or the treatment of sodium chlorate with hydrogen peroxide (which is a stabilized form of chlorine dioxide, and not ClO2 gas, and has its issues with higher corrosiveness and residual remains). The regulation allows chlorine dioxide to be used as an antimicrobial agent in water for washing fruits and vegetables or poultry processing in a concentration not exceeding 3 parts per million.

Chlorine dioxide consumption in industrial water treatment applications is expected to surpass 125 kilotons by 2026. Growing industrialization and urbanization has contributed to water pollution thereby increasing the requirement for industrial water treatment. Industrial processes require water with specific pH levels, water hardness and total dissolved solids (TDS) as the raw water intake involves water of varying compositions such as freshwater, seawater and groundwater. Chlorine dioxide serves as an effective biocide in the treatment of process water, food processing and cooling towers (in the latter to control biofilm which leads to legionnaires disease).
 
The voluminous amount of water required in industrial processes coupled with the adverse effects of contaminated water on industrial equipment such as lodging of debris and chemical contamination, should drive product demand. Rising water shortage has increased consumer focus on water reuse, which requires appropriate water treatment. Growing technological advancement in the industrial wastewater treatment industry along with significant expansion of the electronics sector has increased the requirement for treatment solutions to remove exotic metals should boost the chlorine dioxide market growth.
 
Improving Air Quality
 
In a recent study, chlorine dioxide gas efficiently disinfected and improved air quality indoors after single (0.28L solution, 250 mg/L), double, and triple doses. All three doses reduced indoor bacteria and fungi concentrations, but the double and triple doses had significantly better antimicrobial effects.
 
In another study, a chlorine dioxide-based agent was more effective than hydrogen peroxide at killing bacteria that had enhanced resistance to chemical and radiation disinfection (B. pumilus SAFR-032 and Bacillus subtilis ATCC 6051). Chlorine dioxide can help sterilize peroxide- and UV-resistant spores in hospital environments.
 
Antiviral Activity
 
Chlorine dioxide is also antiviral. It destroys the proteins on the outside of viruses and degrades the virus. Chlorine dioxide gas has been shown to be effective against these viruses on hard, non-porous surfaces:

● | Human influenza (IFV) 
--+--------------------------


● | Measles
--+--------


● | Human herpes (HHV) 
--+-----------------------


● | Human adenovirus (HAdVs) 
--+-----------------------------


● | Influenza A (in mice) 
--+--------------------------

 
Chlorine dioxide solution also inactivated human and monkey rotaviruses (that cause diarrhea) and hepatitis A.
 
Government Regulation
 
The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) registered chlorine dioxide as a disinfectant and sanitizer in 1967. In 1983, the EPA recommended chlorine dioxide as an alternative to chlorine (which was linked to cancer causing THMs) to disinfect water. Use of chlorine dioxide as a disinfectant and sterilizer accelerated across the beverage industry, fruit and vegetable processing, and pulp and paper in 1990s. There are various forms in which chlorine dioxide can be produced, with various degrees of purity, concentration, and applicability. In the United States, chlorine dioxide is approved for use by OSHA, FDA, EPA, CDC, USDA, and DOT.

List N Designation
 
We intend to apply for List N designation of DiOx+ from the EPA List N is a publicly available list maintained by the EPA of products that the EPA expects will kill SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus that causes COVID-19, when used according to the products label directions. All products on this list meet EPAs criteria for use against SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19). Products qualify for List N if they:

● | Demonstrate efficacy against the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19). 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Demonstrate efficacy against a pathogen that is harder to kill than SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19); or 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Demonstrate efficacy against a different human coronavirus similar to SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19). 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We believe our DiOx+ meets all the foregoing criteria and have been working with independent laboratories and consultants to obtain List N designation from the EPA of our DiOx+ products. We have conducted studies with Microchem Labs in Round Rock, Texas and Q Labs in Cincinnati, Ohio that support the efficacy of our DiOx+ products and conformity to EPA requirements. We expect to obtain the List N designation from the EPA in the first half of 2022. We believe that once we have obtained List N designation, we will see greatly increased demand for DiOx+ from government purchasers, contractors, hospitals, and other consumers.
 
Sources and Availability of Raw Material
 
We purchase raw materials and components from a variety of suppliers, including Uline and Amazon. Our largest material cost is for the bottles and containers in which our products are sold. We do not consider Uline or Amazon or any particular supplier to be a principal supplier or material to our business. Although we do not have long term contracts with any of our suppliers, we believe we have good relationships with our suppliers, and if necessary, we believe we could replace one or more of our current suppliers with minimal effect on our business operations.
Competition
 
The disinfectant and chlorine dioxide industries are subject to intense competition. Many of our competitors are larger companies whose financial resources and scope of operations are substantially greater than ours. Our competitors that produce chlorine dioxide include International Dioxide, Ecolab, Grundfos, ProMinent, Evoqua, and Scotmas. Various manufacturers are engaged in consolidation through joint ventures, mergers, and acquisitions, which should boost their market share and make it more difficult to compete with them. We also face competition from companies that engage in research and development activities to develop new products that compete with our products. However, we believe our DiOx+ product offers a superior, more concentrated formulation, that will expand use applications and allow us to penetrate markets not currently occupied by our competitors. Our current competitors offer ready to use formulas or concentrates with concentrations of up to 3,000 parts per million (ppm). In contrast, our product is a 4,000 ppm solution, which allows for a greater dilution factor and potential cost savings for many applications.
Intellectual Property
 
Our success depends, at least in part, on our ability to protect our core technology and intellectual property. To accomplish this, we rely on a combination of trade secrets, including know-how, employee and third-party nondisclosure agreements, trademarks, intellectual property licenses and other contractual rights to establish and protect our proprietary rights in our technology.
 
In addition to our own proprietary formulas, we are a party to an Exclusive Technology License Agreement with Eaucentrix LLC which provides us the exclusive license for the use of proprietary formulas developed by Eaucentrix. The Exclusive Technology License Agreement has a perpetual term, subject to the right of Eaucentrix to terminate the agreement upon a material breach by us which we fail to cure following notice from Eaucentrix, or our failure to pay amounts due to Eaucentrix under the agreement for more than 60 days after such payments become due.
 
We registered DiOx+ as a trademark with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office on June 8, 2020.
 
We are currently applying for a product registration with the EPA that includes a Confidential Statement of Formula that outlines the proprietary formula.
 
We currently do not hold any patents or other registered intellectual property other than our DiOx+ trademark.
