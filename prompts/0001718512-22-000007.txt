Item 1. Business 
We are a global manufacturer of innovative, highly engineered power transmission and fluid power solutions. We offer a broad portfolio of products to diverse replacement channel customers, and to original equipment (“first-fit”) manufacturers as specified components, with the majority of our revenue coming from replacement channels. Our products are used in applications across numerous end markets, including industrial off-highway end markets such as construction and agriculture, industrial on-highway end markets such as transportation, diversified industrial, energy and resources, automotive, and mobility and recreation. Our net sales have historically been, and remain, highly correlated with industrial activity and utilization, and not with any single end market given the diversification of our business and high exposure to replacement markets. We sell our products globally under the Gates brand, which is recognized by distributors, equipment manufacturers, installers and end users as a premium brand for quality and technological innovation; this reputation has been built over 110 years since Gates’ founding in 1911. 
Within the diverse end markets we serve, our highly engineered products are often critical components in applications for which the cost of downtime is high relative to the cost of our products, resulting in the willingness of end users to pay a premium for superior performance and availability. These applications subject our products to normal wear and tear, resulting in natural, and often preventative, replacement cycles that drive high-margin, recurring revenue. Our product portfolio represents one of the broadest ranges of power transmission and fluid power products in the markets we serve, and we maintain long-standing relationships with a diversified group of blue-chip customers throughout the world. As a leading designer, manufacturer and marketer of highly engineered, mission-critical products, we have become an industry leader across most of the regions and end markets in which we operate. 
Gates’ business is well-balanced and diversified across products, channels and geographies, as highlighted in the following charts showing breakdowns of our Fiscal 2021 net sales of $3,474.4 million.
Our History and Recent Developments 
On October 1, 1911, Charles Gates, Sr. purchased the Colorado Tire and Leather Company, a manufacturer of steel-studded bands of leather that attached to tires to extend their mileage. In 1917, the Company commercialized the V-belt, which used rubber and woven threading instead of rope belts, which were more commonly used at that time. In 1963, we built the first of many international facilities in Erembodegem, Belgium, followed by Jacarei, Brazil, in 1973. In 1986, we acquired the Uniroyal Power Transmission Company, which included an interest in the Unitta joint venture that lay the groundwork for Gates’ growth in the Asia-Pacific region. We have financial and operational control over the joint venture, and as such, consolidate it in our financial statements. 
In 1996, Gates was acquired by a publicly held engineering firm based in the United Kingdom (“U.K.”), Tomkins plc, which was itself acquired by Onex Partners and the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board, who proceeded to divest certain of Tomkins plc’s businesses under a new parent entity, Pinafore Holdings B.V. Gates was acquired by Blackstone in July 2014 and in 2015 established a new executive leadership team with Ivo Jurek as Chief Executive Officer. In January 2018, Gates completed an initial public offering (“IPO”), listing on the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”).
We maintain an active acquisition pipeline. In 2018, we acquired Rapro, based in Turkey, and in 2017 we closed two transactions, Techflow Flexibles in the U.K. and Atlas Hydraulics in North America. All three of these acquisitions have been focused on expanding our presence in industrial markets with new products, capabilities, capacity and geographic reach. In addition, we continue to invest organically in new production capacity. During Fiscal 2018, we opened two new facilities located in Poland and in Mexico, and we also expanded our Changzhou facility in China.
Our Solutions 
We operate our business on a product-line basis through our two reporting segments - Power Transmission and Fluid Power. See note 4 to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for additional information. 
We sell our products under the Gates brand in all of the geographies and end markets we serve. Our power transmission segment includes elastomer drive belts and related components used to efficiently transfer motion in a broad range of applications. Power transmission products represented approximately 64% of our total net sales for Fiscal 2021. Our fluid power segment includes hoses, tubing and fittings designed to convey hydraulic fluid at high pressures in both mobile and stationary applications, and other high-pressure and fluid transfer hoses used to regulate the conveyance of various fluids. Our fluid power products represented approximately 36% of our net sales for Fiscal 2021. 
Our power transmission and fluid power products are often critical to the functioning of the equipment, process or system in which they are components, such that the cost of downtime or potential equipment damage is high relative to the cost of our products. Our products are therefore replaced not only as a result of normal wear and tear, but also preemptively as part of ongoing, normal maintenance to the broader system. 
We have a broad portfolio of both power transmission and fluid power products in the end markets we serve. We have a long history of focusing on customer engagement and training, driving product innovation and providing best-in-class order fulfillment services. 
Power Transmission. Our Power Transmission solutions enable and control motion. They are used in applications in which belts, chains, cables, geared transmissions or direct drives transfer power from an engine or motor to another part or system. Belt-based power transmission drives typically consist of either a synchronous belt or an asynchronous belt (V-belt, CVT belt or Micro-V® belt) and related components (sprockets, pulleys, water pumps, tensioners or other accessories). Within our Power Transmission segment, we offer solutions across the following key application platforms: 
•Stationary drives: fixed drive systems such as those used in a factory driving a machine or pump, on a grain elevator driving the lift auger or in a distribution center driving automated equipment such as conveyor lines or robotic picking machines;
•Mobile drives: drives on a piece of mobile machinery such as a combine harvester or a road compactor;
•Engine systems: synchronous drives and related components for cam shafts and auxiliary drives and asynchronous accessory drives for air conditioning (“A/C”) compressors, power steering, alternators and starter/generator systems;
•Personal mobility: drives on motorcycles, scooters, bicycles, both traditional and electric, as well as on snowmobiles and other power sports vehicles that are used to transfer power between the power source and the drive wheel(s) or track; and
•Vertical lift: elevators, cargo lifts and other applications in which a belt, cable, chain or other lifting mechanism is used to carry load. 
Customers choose power transmission solutions based on a number of factors, including application requirements such as load, speed, gear ratio, temperature, operating environment, ease of maintenance, noise, efficiency and reliability, as well as the support they receive from their suppliers, including application-specific engineering services. Belt-based drive systems have many advantages over other alternatives, as they are typically clean, low-maintenance, lubrication-free, quiet with low-vibration, lightweight, compact, 
energy-efficient, durable and reliable. In applications where these advantages are valued, customers frequently choose belts over other forms of power transmission solutions. 
Our belts are classified by their general design into asynchronous and synchronous belts; in addition, we also manufacture metal drive components and assemble certain product kits for the automotive replacement channel. 
Asynchronous Belts. Asynchronous belts are our highest-volume products and are used in a broad range of applications. Asynchronous belts are made of proprietary rubber formulations, textiles and embedded cords for reinforcement. We were a pioneer in the design and manufacturing of V-belts, which draw their name from the shape of their profile. We also manufacture “ribbed” V-belts, which are belts with lengthwise V-shaped grooves, which we market under the Micro-V® name. This design results in a thinner belt for the same drive surface, making it more flexible and offering improved efficiency through lower friction losses.
In industrial end markets, asynchronous belts have a wide variety of applications, including use in pump drives, manufacturing lines, HVAC systems, industrial, truck, bus and marine engines, forestry and mining equipment and many other applications. Continuously-variable transmission (“CVT”) systems often found in scooters, power sports vehicles and other applications use a specialized V-belt known as a CVT belt. In automotive applications, our asynchronous belts perform functions that include transferring power from the crankshaft to accessory drive components such as the alternator, A/C compressor, power steering system, water pump and, in some vehicles, a belt/starter generator system used in start/stop accessory drive systems to improve fuel economy. 
During Fiscal 2018, Gates introduced a new Micro-V® platform for engine accessory drive systems. The combination of newly developed material compounds and product design reduces belt weight and results in lower bending stiffness. These improvements enable tighter pulley configurations and reduced drive bending losses as compared to existing belt technologies; lower losses result in reduced energy consumption, CO2 emissions and heat generation.
Synchronous Belts. Synchronous belts, also known as timing belts, are non-slipping mechanical drive belts. They have teeth molded onto the inner surface and run over matching toothed pulleys or sprockets. Synchronous belts experience no slippage and are often used to transfer motion for indexing or timing purposes, as well as for linear positioning and positive drive conveying. They are typically used instead of chains or gears and we believe have a number of advantages over these alternatives, including less noise, no need for lubrication, improved durability and performance and a more compact design. Our synchronous belts are made of a flexible polymer over fabric reinforcement, which often consists of Kevlar, aramid or carbon fibers. 
Examples of industrial applications include use in HVAC systems, food processing and bottling plants, mining and agricultural equipment, automated warehouse systems and robotics. Our synchronous belts are also utilized in personal mobility equipment, including both traditional and electric motorcycles, bicycles and scooters, applications in which clean, quiet performance is often valued. In automotive applications, our synchronous belts are used to synchronize the rotation of the engine crankshaft with the camshaft due to engine combustion in a valve train system, as well as in electric power steering and parking brake systems which are present in internal-combustion, hybrid and electric vehicles. 
During Fiscal 2019, Gates launched a new high-torque synchronous belt for industrial applications, the PowerGrip® GT®4. This new belt leverages Gates’ materials science and process engineering capabilities, utilizing a belt construction that replaces chloroprene with an advanced ethylene elastomer formulation that is more environmentally friendly. It has the highest power-carrying capacity in its segment, a wider operating temperature range and increased chemical resistance, allowing for narrower drives and a broad range of applications to be served with both first-fit and replacement channel customers.
Metal Drive Components. We manufacture and sell the tensioners and idlers used in belt drive systems. These products are designed and engineered to work efficiently with our belts. Tensioners are devices that maintain a constant tension in the belt drive system, thereby ensuring proper function and preventing loss of power or system failure. Tensioners typically employ a spring that places pressure along the belt for an intricate hold, while still allowing enough movement for vibration and preventing stretching. Idlers, which sometimes also perform as tensioners, are used to take up extra belt length. 
Kits. Our kits for the automotive replacement channel include all of the parts needed by an automotive service shop to perform a replacement of one of our products. Kits are created for specific vehicle makes and models and typically include belts, tensioners and idlers, and will sometimes also include water pumps, which are often replaced simultaneously with a timing belt due to the relatively high labor component in the total cost of a typical replacement. Our kits are convenient for service technicians as they eliminate the need for more complicated product sourcing. On a comparable quantity basis, kits typically sell at a premium to a loose belt and the individual related components. 
Our power transmission products are used in a broad range of applications in end markets including off-highway end markets such as construction and agriculture, on-highway end markets such as transportation, diversified industrial, energy, automotive and consumer products. The majority of our Fiscal 2021 net sales came from replacement channels, which provide high-margin, recurring revenue streams and are driven by attractive market trends. The bulk of our power transmission replacement business resides in developed regions, in which a large, aging installed base of equipment follows a natural maintenance cycle and is served by well-established distribution channels. For example, a combine harvester in North America can have over 25 high-performance belts that are typically replaced at regular intervals, depending on wear and tear, with end users having access to replacement parts through a large network of distributors. Similarly, in the North American automotive replacement market, maintenance intervals are well defined, and miles driven per vehicle and the average vehicle age have generally been increasing, leading to more wear and tear on vehicles. A smaller portion of our power transmission replacement business is generated in emerging markets, which generally have a smaller base of installed equipment and relatively nascent distribution channels. As they continue to develop, these replacement channels in emerging markets represent a significant long-term opportunity for growth. 
In addition to our power transmission replacement business, we also serve a wide variety of blue-chip first-fit customers across all of our end markets. The majority of our automotive first-fit revenues in power transmission tend to come from emerging markets, where we selectively participate to further strengthen our brand and reinforce the strong position from which we serve the growing base of installed equipment, as the nascent replacement channels continue to develop. These markets are generally higher-growth and result in higher-margin business compared to our developed regions. 
Fluid Power. Our Fluid Power solutions are used in applications in which hoses and rigid tubing assemblies either transfer power hydraulically or convey fluids, gases or granular materials from one location to another. Within our Fluid Power segment, we offer solutions across the following key application platforms: 
•Stationary hydraulics: applications within stationary machinery, such as an injection molding machine or a manufacturing press;
•Mobile hydraulics: applications used to power various implements in mobile equipment used in construction, agriculture, mining and other heavy industries;
•Vehicle systems: applications in thermal management, emissions reduction, turbocharger, air intake and other systems for electric, hybrid and internal combustion passenger and commercial vehicles; and
•Other industrial: applications in which hoses are used to convey fluids, gases or granular material across several industries such as food and beverage, other process industries, and oil and gas drilling and refining. 
Customers choose fluid power solutions based on a number of factors, including application-specific product performance parameters such as pressure and temperature ratings, corrosion and leak resistance, weight, flexibility, abrasion resistance and cleanliness, as well as compliance with standards and product availability. Attributes associated with the supplier, including brand, global footprint and reputation for reliability, quality and service, are also considered. 
Hydraulics. Our hydraulics product line is comprised of hoses, tubing and fittings, offered either as standalone products or completed assemblies. Our hydraulic products are key components of hydraulic systems in both stationary and mobile equipment applications. We provide a full selection of hose sizes and construction types for use in a wide variety of working requirements and conditions. Hydraulic hoses are made of synthetic rubber and reinforced with steel wire or a textile-based yarn, and typically operate at very high pressures, often in extreme environmental conditions. Hoses are designed for use in specific mechanical applications and require high levels of quality and durability. 
Our hydraulic fittings and tubing are engineered to match the product performance of our hydraulic hoses. The high-pressure nature of hydraulic systems requires these products have high levels of performance similar to those found in our hydraulic hoses. The ultimate performance of a hydraulic assembly, in which our products function as part of a hydraulic circuit, depends not only on how well the components are made, but also on how well they complement each other. In order to ensure compatibility with numerous applications, our hydraulic fittings are manufactured in a wide assortment of sizes, crimping systems and materials, and are protected by a range of patents. Our hydraulic products and assemblies are used in construction, agricultural and forestry equipment, as well as in food and other processing lines and stationary machinery. 
During Fiscal 2018, Gates introduced a new premium product family consisting of hydraulic hoses that are lighter weight and more flexible. Made with a high-performance reinforcement and robust, abrasion-resistant cover, the MXT line of hydraulic hose is comprised of universally applicable, high-performance products that meet the needs of a wide range of applications. During Fiscal 2019, we launched the MXG line of hydraulic hose, a flexible, light-weight solution with increased durability and temperature performance, designed to replace conventional spiral hoses typically used in the most demanding applications. Also in Fiscal 2019, we launched a smart e-crimper, which is a machine used to attach fittings to hydraulic hoses. In addition to convenient, web-enabled access to training content and product crimp specs, this new crimper can be used with Gates’ intuitive mobile eCrimp app, which underwent a comprehensive update in Fiscal 2020.
Thermal and Emissions Management. Our thermal and emissions management and related products perform a variety of conveyance, emissions reduction and efficiency improvement functions in electric, hybrid and internal combustion passenger and commercial vehicles. In electric applications, Gates offers hose and water pump solutions for the thermal management system regulating the battery, inverter, motor(s) and passenger compartment. In internal combustion applications, Gates primarily provides thermal management hose and water pumps for engine cooling, exhaust filtration hose to reduce harmful emissions and hoses for functions that improve air intake and engine efficiency.
Industrial Hose. Our industrial hoses are capable of transferring a wide range of substances - chemicals, food, beverages, petroleum, fuels, bulk materials, water, steam and air - to meet the requirements of a diverse range of applications, including manufacturing, mining, oil and gas drilling, marine, agriculture, industrial cleaning and construction. Our application engineering teams work with customers to assist them in selecting the appropriate hose solution to safely meet their operational needs. We leverage our materials science expertise to design hoses that perform at varying pressures and levels of resistance to chemicals, oil, abrasion, ozone, flame and both hot and cold temperatures. For performance in extreme environments, many of our industrial hoses feature both crush-resistant and flexible designs. Gates industrial hoses are highly engineered to meet or exceed a multitude of industry standards and certifications, and are offered in a range of diameters, lengths and colors to allow customers to differentiate the hoses in applications. We also offer a wide range of couplings to provide complete assembly solutions. 
Our fluid power products are used in numerous applications, including off-highway end markets such as construction and agriculture, on-highway end markets such as transportation, diversified industrial, energy, automotive and consumer products. The largest portion of our Fiscal 2021 fluid power revenue came from replacement markets. Within these replacement markets, the majority of our revenue came from industrial applications. Approximately 16% of our Fiscal 2021 fluid power revenue came from products sold into the automotive end market, almost all of which was served through the higher-margin replacement channel. 
Our Diverse Markets 
We participate in many sectors of the industrial and consumer markets. Our products play essential roles in a diverse range of applications across a wide variety of end markets ranging from harsh and hazardous off-highway applications such as agriculture and construction, and diversified industrial applications such as automated manufacturing and logistics systems, to everyday consumer applications such as printers, power washers, automatic doors and vacuum cleaners. Virtually every form of transportation, ranging from internal combustion and electric trucks, buses and automobiles, to personal mobility vehicles, including motorcycles, bicycles, and snowmobiles, uses our products. 
Our net sales have historically been, and remain, highly correlated with industrial activity and utilization, and not with any single end market given the diversification of our business and high exposure to replacement markets. Key indicators include industrial production, industrial sales and manufacturer shipments. 
Our products are sold in over 130 countries across our four commercial regions: (1) the Americas; (2) Europe, Middle East & Africa (“EMEA”); (3) Greater China; and (4) East Asia & India. We have a long-standing presence in each of these regions. 
Our commercial capabilities are complemented by our “in-region, for region” manufacturing footprint, which generally allows us to manufacture products in close proximity to our customers around the world. We have power transmission and fluid power operations in each commercial region and typically manufacture products for both first-fit customers and replacement customers in the same factory, which provides for sharing of raw material inputs, improved factory loading and demand leveling, as well as optimization of capital expenditures. 
Our Channels 
We sell our power transmission and fluid power products both as replacement components and as specified components on original equipment to customers worldwide. During Fiscal 2021, approximately 63% of our net sales were generated from replacement channels and 37% from first-fit channels globally. Our mix of replacement channel sales to first-fit sales varies by region based on our market strategy and the maturity of the equipment fleet and channel. For example, in emerging markets such as China, our business is characterized by a higher first-fit presence, given the relatively underdeveloped replacement channels. We believe that ultimately our first-fit presence in these emerging markets will allow us to better develop the replacement channels as they mature over time. By contrast, in North America and EMEA, where there are long-established replacement markets, approximately 68% and 70% of our Fiscal 2021 net sales, respectively, were derived from these higher-margin replacement channels. In the vast majority of the applications we serve, we do not need to have been the first-fit provider to serve these applications in the replacement markets. 
Replacement. The majority of our sales are generated from customers in replacement channels, who primarily serve a large base of end users with installed equipment that follows a natural maintenance cycle. Our ability to help replacement channel partners maximize revenue is an important part of our value proposition. These customers miss sales opportunities if a required product cannot be obtained quickly, either from a short-lead time order or on-hand inventory. 
In addition to our products, we offer digital tools and other content to distributors, installers and end users of equipment containing our products. We also assist with customer training on product installation and early identification of wear-and-tear on components, which helps drive sales for our channel customers while mitigating the risk of equipment failure for end users. 
First-Fit. We work closely with our first-fit customers by providing application engineering expertise to assist them with equipment design and selecting the right products to optimize performance. Close interactions between our R&D organization and customer technical teams provide input into our innovation and product development processes. We selectively participate in first-fit projects, focusing on opportunities where we are able to differentiate with technology and innovative solutions. 
Customers 
We maintain long-standing relationships with many customers, who range from local distributors with one location to large, global manufacturers of equipment. No single customer accounted for more than 10% of our Fiscal 2021 net sales. 
Sales and Marketing and Distribution Organization 
Our sales and distribution operations are structured to serve our customers efficiently across the globe. We have field representatives who possess local knowledge of customers and their product and application requirements, giving us the capability to meet our customers’ product availability needs on short lead times. Our global sales and service support team helps reinforce customer and distributor relationships by focusing on end markets and customers. 
Manufacturing 
We have a global, “in region, for region” manufacturing footprint and regional service model that enable us to operate efficiently and effectively in proximity to our customers. We operate a large number of manufacturing facilities and service centers as well as several major technical centers giving us a presence in 30 countries throughout the world. Our in-country deployment of manufacturing and technical resources gives us the capability to meet customer needs rapidly and satisfy regional variations in product preference, while our scale allows us to service global customers on a world-wide basis. 
Competition 
We operate in competitive markets and industries that are also very fragmented. We offer our products and solutions across numerous and varied end markets and geographies through over 100 locations in 30 countries. Consequently, we have many competitors across our various markets and product offerings. These competitors and the degree of competition vary by product line, geographic scope, end market and channel. Although each of our markets and product offerings has many competitors, no single competitor competes with us across all of our products, solutions, channels and end markets. Our global presence and the importance of product availability make it difficult for smaller, regional and low-cost country manufacturers to penetrate our markets. We differentiate ourselves on the basis of product performance and quality, breadth of portfolio, customer support and training, service level, fill rates and product availability. 
Research, Development and Intellectual Property 
Applied R&D is important to our businesses and integral to our leading market positions. We have engineering teams in the U.S., Canada, the U.K., Germany, Spain, Poland, Turkey, Japan, China, Brazil, India, Mexico, Korea and Thailand that focus on the introduction of new and improved products with a particular emphasis on energy efficiency, safety, the application of technology to reduce unit and operating costs and improving services to our customers. 
As of January 1, 2022, we held more than 2,500 patents and patent applications and 3,200 trademarks in various jurisdictions, and have elected to protect a variety of technologies and processes as trade secrets. While no individual patent or group of patents, taken alone, is considered critical to our business, collectively our patents and trademarks provide meaningful protection for our products and technical innovations. 
Materials and Suppliers 
We use a wide variety of materials, resulting in a highly diversified mix of inputs, which are sourced from a variety of suppliers around the world. Generally, we seek to obtain materials in the regions where our products are manufactured to minimize lead times, as well as transportation and other costs. During Fiscal 2020 and Fiscal 2021, our teams worked closely with suppliers to ensure sufficient quantities of materials were available for us to continue to serve our customers. Restrictions and added safety measures introduced in many regions created pressure on freight costs and availability, which, together with increases in certain input prices due to constrained supply, created challenges for our supply chain and procurement teams, particularly as demand has grew in the second half of Fiscal 2020 and during Fiscal 2021. Under normal circumstances, we do not typically carry significant inventories of raw materials in excess of those required to meet our production schedules.
 We continually seek to manage commodity and raw material costs using various strategies, including working with our customers and suppliers on pricing and costs, exploring material substitution opportunities, combining purchase requirements across regions and changing or qualifying new suppliers when appropriate. 
Government Regulation
Our operations, products and properties are subject to extensive U.S. and foreign federal, state, local, and provincial laws and regulations relating to health, safety and environment (“HSE”) protection, including laws and regulations governing air emissions, wastewater discharges, waste management and disposal, substances in products, trade control laws, anti-corruption laws, data protection and privacy laws, and workplace health and safety, as well as the investigation and clean-up of contaminated sites. Under certain environmental laws, the obligation to investigate and remediate contamination at a facility may be imposed on current and former owners, lessees or operators or on persons who may have sent waste to that facility for disposal. We are currently performing environmental investigations and/or remediation at a number of former and current facilities in the U.S. and Canada and are incurring costs in relation to a number of offsite waste disposal sites. For more information, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors - Risks Related to Legal and Regulatory Matters”.
Human Capital
As of January 1, 2022, we employed approximately 15,050 full time employees worldwide. Approximately 7,000 of our employees are located in North America, 4,100 in EMEA, 3,300 in Greater China and East Asia & India, and 650 in South America. Approximately 68% of our work force consists of production employees, while approximately 24% of our global workforce was female and 76% male. Of approximately 1,450 managerial employees, 21% were female.
Some of our employees are members of labor unions, and over many years we have been able to maintain successful relationships with the unions and employment organizations. To date, employee relations have been flexible and constructive as we continue to pursue lean manufacturing improvements in our plants. Gates employs agency contractors, temporary employees and contract employees as a relatively small percentage of our workforce. The number of associates in these categories typically varies with demand on our factories and distribution centers. Gates employs a small number of part-time associates across the globe.
Oversight and Governance
Our board of directors is actively engaged in the oversight of the Company’s human capital management, including reviewing the following topics: the Company’s employee health and well-being programs; the Company’s stock incentive plans; the Company’s performance relative to the acquisition and retention of talent, leadership and development programs, and other initiatives and plans to help ensure that we have talent positioned to deliver on our strategy.
Health and safety
We care about our employees and we believe that our commercial success is linked to a safe and healthy workforce. We are therefore committed to responsible business practices through the establishment, implementation, and maintenance of the Gates Global HSE Standards Manual. We strive for zero injuries and an incident-free workplace and have achieved significant progress towards this goal through targeted risk reduction activities, improved case management, increased accountability to corrective action identification and closure, and more effective safety observation programs.
Demonstrating our commitment to safety, beginning in February 2020, we mobilized a centralized crisis response team that urgently developed and implemented our countermeasure actions across the globe for the novel coronavirus (“COVID-19”) pandemic. In addition to adhering to or exceeding local government mandates and guidance provided by health authorities, we proactively implemented quarantine protocols, social distancing policies, working from home arrangements, travel suspensions, frequent and extensive disinfecting of our workspaces, provision of personal protective equipment, mandatory temperature monitoring and periodic COVID-19 testing at our facilities. During 2021, where possible, we have made COVID-19 vaccines available to our employees, holding on-site vaccination clinics at a number of facilities. We may take further actions if required or recommended by government authorities or if we determine them to be in the best interests of our employees, customers, and suppliers.
Total rewards
Our compensation philosophy is to offer a compensation program that enables us to attract, motivate, reward and retain high-caliber employees who are capable of creating and sustaining value for our shareholders over the long-term and to design compensation and benefit programs that provide a fair and competitive compensation opportunity in order to appropriately reward employees for their contributions to our success. Globally, we offer the opportunity to earn short-term and long-term incentive awards to eligible employees, including a manufacturing incentive program to many of our production employees.
Employee development and training
Gates is committed to developing and unlocking the potential of our people and we make significant investments in training and professional development. Our learning and development framework supports the development of leadership and professional skills in three ways: on-the-job, learning from others, and participating in formal training programs. Some of the specific global and regional development experiences we offer include a global mentoring program that promotes a diverse and inclusive culture and knowledge transfer opportunities between our mentors and mentees; a structured succession planning process that identifies key talent and develops our employees to continue working toward their career goals and early career programs designed to develop talent in different areas of the business; for example, engineering, commercial and human resources. For our production employees, we provide skills-based training and certification opportunities. 
Through its Compensation Committee, our board of directors also oversees the management continuity planning process, including reviewing and evaluating the succession plans relating to our chief executive officer and other executive officer positions and makes recommendations to the board with respect to the selection of individuals to occupy these positions.
Diversity, equity and inclusion
The Gates management team is committed to creating and sustaining a diverse workplace that understands and values individual differences across demographics, experiences and perspectives. We want to ensure that collaborative and respectful business practices in a performance-based, supportive environment enable every employee to realize his/her/their career ambitions. To that end, we have formed a Diversity, Equity & Inclusion (“DE&I”) Steering Committee, consisting of executive leadership, which works with our DE&I Leadership Council, consisting of representatives of relevant diversity groups across Gates’ businesses, to develop a DE&I strategy consistent with our corporate values while promoting a culture of inclusion, collaboration, tolerance and equal opportunity. 
In 2020, to further develop our policies, programs and processes, we began a partnership with Catalyst, a global non-profit organization, to assess both quantitative and qualitative data and to help us ensure success in our initiatives around DE&I. In 2021, we began the process of implementing recommendations based on our work with Catalyst and look forward to further development of programs and initiatives identified through this partnership. We believe a diverse and inclusive environment ensures access to the broadest talent pool as we strive to be an employer of choice for people from all backgrounds.
Additionally, the charter for the Nominating and Governance Committee of our board of directors requires that such committee review and make recommendations regarding the composition and size of the board in order to ensure the board has the requisite expertise and its membership consists of persons with sufficiently diverse and independent backgrounds.
