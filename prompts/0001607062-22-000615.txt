Our Products and Solutions
 The Company believes that its Mobile Banking Technology platform and its blinx On-Off™ debit card and blinxPay™ mobile wallet programs are a significant advance in mobile banking and close loop/open loop debit technology and is capable of bringing significant value to card issuing and sponsoring organizations, whether they be commercial or government.  
 (a) MTC™ Debit Card - Visa® Prepaid Card Programs 
 In fiscal year 2009, the Company announced the release of its Mobile Toggle Card (MTC™) Program on the Company’s mobile banking software platform under a sponsoring bank. Veritec’s mobile banking software platform is a debit based, pre-paid and gift card solution that is licensed by Veritec’s wholly owned subsidiary, Veritec Financial Systems, Inc., to debit card issuers and sponsoring organizations. Under the MTC™ Program, card issuers and sponsors may provide the MTC™ branded debit or gift cards to individuals with and without demand deposit accounts (e.g., the latter the “under-banked”). The MTC™ card may be part of a Visa® branded program and, as such, the cards are accepted anywhere in the world that Visa cards are accepted.
 With an MTC™ card, the cardholders are empowered to combat unpermitted and fraudulent use of their debit cards by “toggling” their cards “on” and “off” with their mobile phones. Cardholders no longer have to completely rely on their card issuers to monitor possible fraudulent activity on their accounts. Cardholders can now de-activate their cards themselves, in real-time, any time they choose to do so. In addition to this toggling feature, cardholders may apply for their cards online, arrange for direct deposits to be made to their cards, and transfer money to their card from another account. Cardholders may also elect to receive various alerts on their mobile phones about activity on their card. In the fiscal year 2010, the Company began accepting applications for the MTC™ card from individual applicants and issuing live Visa® branded debit cards under the MTC Mobile Toggle Card Program.

(b) blinx ON-OFF Debit Card - Visa® Prepaid Card Programs
 In fiscal year 2011, Veritec began marketing the blinx ON-OFF™ branded card under a bank sponsorship. The blinx ON-OFF™ card is based on the Mobile Banking Technology platform and offers the same features and functions as the MTC™ branded card but with different pricing for bank-sponsored cards.
 (c) Custom Branded Debit Card Programs
 In addition to the MTC™ and blinx ON-OFF™ branded program, the Company enables card issuers and sponsors to issue debit, pre-paid and gift cards under their own branded programs through licensed use of the mobile banking platform and the Company’s provision of related professional services.
 (d) blinxPay™ Mobile Wallet App 
 The Company released its blinxPay™ mobile wallet application during fiscal year 2016. blinxPay™ is a secure payment processing system and mobile app that enables customers to make purchases at participating merchants using funds loaded into their blinxPay™ virtual account. The blinxPay™ mobile app is available for download for free at both Google Pay and Apple iTunes stores.
 Veritec’s mobile banking solution also enables member card programs to be processed and settled member rewards to its members in either an open or closed loop processing environment. In addition to its front-end licensing and professional services, the Company also provides back-end card processing services to the card issuing institutions for all cardholder transactions on the licensed platform. The Company’s Mobile Banking Technology resides within a Payment Card Industry (PCI) compliant data processing center.

Competition
 Our Mobile Banking Technology competes with other independent sales organizations and third party services of Visa-branded card programs, including TransCash Corporation, Ready Debit Card by MetaBank, Millenium Advantage Card by New Millenium Bank, and Wired Plastic by Bancorp Bank. The Company believes, however, that there are very few companies that have the Company’s collective attributes of (1) being an independent sales organization of Visa-branded and non-branded prepaid card programs, (2) being a third party servicer (e.g., back end processor) for banks issuing Visa-branded and non-branded prepaid card programs, (3) being the developer, marketer and licensor of the mobile banking platform on which Visa-branded and non-branded card program cardholder transactions take place, and (4) having a mobile banking platform that enables real-time transaction processing and enabling cardholders to manage their accounts by enabling cardholders to toggle their cards and their website accounts on and off via their mobile phones. 
Employees
 As of June 30, 2022, the Company employed seven employees and six independent contractor consultants.
 Financial Information about Geographic Areas
 For the years ended June 30, 2022, and 2021, United States customers accounted for 100% of the Company’s total revenue.
