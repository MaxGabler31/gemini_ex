Item 1. Business.
Introduction



We are a blank check company formed as a Delaware corporation for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses (the “business combination”). While we may pursue an initial business combination target in any business or industry or geographic region, we intend to focus on opportunities in the technology sector, particularly companies pursuing a Software as a Service, or SaaS, model. We have reviewed, and continue to review, a number of opportunities to enter into a business combination, but we are not able to determine at this time whether we will complete a business combination with any of the target businesses that we have reviewed or with any other target business. We also have neither engaged in any operations nor generated any revenue to date. Based on our business activities, the Company is a “shell company” as defined under the Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”) because we have no operations and nominal assets consisting almost entirely of cash.



On December 22, 2020, we consummated our initial public offering (the “initial public offering”) of 17,250,000 units (the “units”), including the issuance of 2,250,000 units as a result of the underwriters’ exercise of their over-allotment option in full. Each unit consists of one share of Class A common stock (the “Class A common stock” or “public shares”) and one-half warrant (the “public warrants”), with each whole public warrant entitling the holder thereof to purchase one share of Class A common stock for $11.50 per share. The units were sold at a price of $10.00 per unit, generating gross proceeds of $172.5 million.



Simultaneously with the consummation of the initial public offering, we completed the private sale (the “private placement”) of an aggregate of 4,850,000 warrants (the “private placement warrants”, and together with the public warrants, the “warrants”) to Dune Acquisition Holdings LLC (the “Sponsor” or our “Sponsor”) at a purchase price of $1.00 per private placement warrant, generating gross proceeds of $4.85 million.



Prior to the consummation of the initial public offering, on July 10, 2020, we issued an aggregate of 3,737,500 shares (the “founder shares”) of our Class B common stock to the Sponsor for an aggregate purchase price of $25,000 in cash. On December 17, 2020, pursuant to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation (as amended on December 17, 2020, our “amended and restated certificate of incorporation”), each of our founder shares outstanding immediately prior to December 17, 2020 were converted into one and two-thirteenths (12/13) founder shares, resulting in the Sponsor holding 4,312,500 founder shares.



A total of $172,500,000, comprised of $169,050,000 of the proceeds from the initial public offering (which amount includes $6,037,500 of the underwriters’ deferred discount) and $3,450,000 of the proceeds of the sale of the private placement warrants, was placed in a U.S.-based trust account (the “trust account”) at J.P. Morgan Chase Bank, N.A., maintained by Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, acting as trustee.



The funds held in the trust account are invested in U.S. government securities, within the meaning set forth in Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “Investment Company Act”), with a maturity of 185 days or less or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act which invest only in direct U.S. government treasury obligations until the earlier of: (i) the consummation of an initial business combination or (ii) the distribution of the trust account.



As of December 31, 2021, there was $172,543,076 in investments and cash held in the trust account, which includes interest income available to us for franchise and income tax obligations of approximately $110,000 and cash held outside the trust account of approximately $116,000. As of December 31, 2021, we have not withdrawn any amount of interest earned from the trust account to pay taxes.



Proposed Business Combination



On October 12, 2021, we entered into an agreement and plan of merger (the “Merger Agreement”) with Dune Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and our direct wholly-owned subsidiary (“Merger Sub”), Dune Merger Sub II, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and our direct, wholly-owned subsidiary (“Merger Sub II”), and TradeZero Holding Corp., a Delaware corporation (“TradeZero”). In accordance with the terms and subject to the conditions of the Merger Agreement, at the consummation of the Proposed Transaction (as defined below) (the “Closing”), (i) each issued and outstanding share of Class A common stock of TradeZero (“TradeZero Common Stock”) will automatically be converted into a number of shares of Class A common stock of New TradeZero (as defined below) (“New TradeZero Common Stock”) equal to an exchange ratio (the “Exchange Ratio”), which will be determined by dividing (A) the quotient of (x) $500,000,000 divided by (y) the number of shares of TradeZero Common Stock immediately prior to the Closing (including the shares of TradeZero Common Stock subject to any restricted stock unit awards of TradeZero) by (B) $10.00 per share, (ii) all of the outstanding TradeZero restricted stock unit awards will be converted into New TradeZero restricted unit awards on the same terms and conditions as the existing awards (including with respect to vesting and acceleration, if any) to be governed by an equity incentive plan to be adopted in connection with the Closing (the “Incentive Plan”), and with respect to a number of shares of New TradeZero Common Stock equal to the product of (1) the number of shares of TradeZero Common Stock underlying the original award and (2) the Exchange Ratio and (iii) and all of the outstanding TradeZero stock option awards will be converted into New TradeZero stock option awards on the same terms and conditions as the existing award (including with respect to vesting and acceleration, if any) to be governed by the Incentive Plan and with respect to a number of shares of New TradeZero Common Stock equal to the product of (aa) the number of shares of TradeZero Common Stock underlying the original award and (bb) the Exchange Ratio and an exercise price per share of New TradeZero Common Stock subject to the award equal to (i) the existing exercise price of the award divided by (ii) the Exchange Ratio.

In addition, immediately prior to the Closing, holders of TradeZero Common Stock immediately prior to Closing will receive a cash disbursement from TradeZero’s cash balance at Closing equal to the lesser of (a) the difference between TradeZero’s cash balance at Closing and $10,000,000 and (b) $30,000,000. On or as soon as practicable following the Closing, New TradeZero will grant restricted stock unit awards of New TradeZero to certain TradeZero equityholders (the “RSU Earn Out Awards”), and the holders of TradeZero Common Stock immediately prior to the Closing and the holders of the RSU Earn Out Awards will have the right to receive a pro-rata share of up to 9,000,000 additional shares of New TradeZero Common Stock (the “Earn Out Shares”) upon the occurrence of certain earn-out triggering events, as follows: (i) 3,000,000 shares upon the date on which the volume weighted average closing sale price of the New TradeZero Common Stock as reported on the New York Stock Exchange (or the stock exchange on which the New TradeZero Common Stock is then listed) for a period of 20 trading days out of 30 consecutive trading days (as equitably adjusted as appropriate to reflect any stock splits, reverse stock splits, stock dividends (including any dividend or distribution of securities convertible into New TradeZero Common Stock), extraordinary cash dividend, reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, combination, exchange of shares or other like change or transaction with respect to New TradeZero Common Stock) (such price, the “Share Price”) is equal to or greater than $12.00 per share at any time during the period beginning at the Closing and ending on the three-year anniversary of the Closing date (the “Earn Out Period”); (ii) 3,000,000 shares upon the date on which the Share Price is equal to or greater than $15.00 per share during the Earn Out Period; and (iii) 3,000,000 shares upon the date on which the Share Price is equal to or greater than $18.00 per share during the Earn Out Period.



On January 26, 2022, we entered into the First Amendment to the Merger Agreement with Merger Sub, Merger Sub II and TradeZero (the “First Amendment”). Pursuant to the First Amendment, the Merger Agreement was amended to (i) clarify that, upon the occurrence of a sale during the Earn Out Period of more than 50% of the total voting power of New TradeZero or all or substantially all of the assets of New TradeZero, the dilutive effect of any of the Earn Out Shares to be issued in connection with such sale must be taken into account when calculating the Share Price to determine if any triggering events for Earn Out Shares have been achieved, (ii) provide that if any Earn Out Shares are forfeited pursuant to the terms of any applicable RSU Earn Out Awards, such Earn Out Shares shall not be redistributed to the holders of TradeZero Common Stock and (iii) clarify that each of Charter Amendment Proposal B and Charter Amendment Proposal C from the Merger Agreement are not Condition Precedent Proposals (as such term is defined in the Merger Agreement).



If the Merger Agreement and First Amendment are adopted by our stockholders and the transactions under the Merger Agreement are consummated, Merger Sub will merge with and into TradeZero with TradeZero surviving the merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company (the “Proposed Transaction”). In connection with the Closing, the Company will be renamed “TradeZero Global Inc.” and is referred to herein as “New TradeZero” as of the time following such change of name.



The consummation of the Proposed Transaction is subject to customary conditions of the respective parties, including: (i) the approval of the Merger Agreement, (ii) the filing of a proxy statement to be sent to the Company’s stockholders in advance of the special meeting to consider the condition precedent proposals to the Merger Agreement, (iii) the approval of the Proposed Transaction, (iv) the expiration or termination of the waiting period (or any extension thereof) applicable under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act and certain regulatory approvals and (v) certain other actions related thereto by our stockholders and TradeZero’s stockholders, including the availability of a minimum amount of $80,000,000 in the trust account (and/or from other specified sources, if necessary) after giving effect to redemptions by the Company’s public stockholders, if any. The Merger Agreement may also be terminated by either party under certain circumstances.



For additional information regarding the Merger Agreement, see the Company’s Current Reports on Form 8-K filed by us on October 12, 2021 and January 26, 2022 and the Company’s preliminary proxy statement (as amended), initially filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on January 26, 2022.



This Form 10-K does not assume the closing of the Proposed Transaction.

Our Business Strategy 



We plan to utilize the network and industry experience of our management team in seeking an initial business combination and employing our acquisition strategy. Over the course of their careers, the members of our management team have developed a broad network of contacts and corporate relationships that we believe will serve as a useful source of acquisition opportunities. This network has been developed through our management team’s extensive experience in both investing in and operating companies across the software and Fintech verticals. We expect these networks will provide our management team with a robust flow of acquisition opportunities. In addition, we anticipate that target business candidates will be brought to our attention from various unaffiliated sources, which may include investment market participants, private equity and venture capital groups, investment banking firms, consultants, accounting firms and large business enterprises.



Our management team possesses the following tools necessary to unlock such potential:



Expertise in growing successful software and Fintech companies: Our management team has demonstrated consistent prowess in building, investing, nurturing and leading software and Fintech companies across their corporate life cycle. We believe our management team can spot unique ideas and disruptive business models and grow them to scale by leveraging our operational expertise and networks.



Operational excellence: Our management team has significant hands-on experience helping technology companies optimize their existing and new growth initiatives by exploiting insights from rich data assets that already exist within most technology companies. Further, we intend to share best practices and key learnings, gathered from our operating and investment experience, as well as strong relationships in the technology sector, to help shape corporate strategies in an increasingly complex technology ecosystem.



Capital markets efficiency: Our management team believes that SPACs are a more streamlined and transparent path to the public market and will encourage private companies, in the technology industry in particular, to go public. This will allow the company to remain operationally focused on long-term value creation while we leverage our capital raising acumen.



Maximizing the value of becoming a publicly traded entity: As a public entity, we believe we offer a wide range of advantages to stakeholders. These include but are not limited to: working with management and stockholders who aspire to have their company become a public entity and generate substantial growth; broader access to debt and equity providers; providing liquidity for employees and investors; a new currency for potential acquisitions; and enhancing and expanding branding in the marketplace.



We intend to communicate with our management team’s network, which includes private equity firms, venture capitalists, investment bankers and entrepreneurs, to articulate the parameters for our search for a target company and a potential business combination to pursue and review potential opportunities.



Business Combination Criteria



Consistent with our business strategy, we have identified the following general criteria and guidelines that we believe are important in evaluating prospective target businesses. We will use these criteria and guidelines in evaluating initial business combination opportunities, but we may decide to enter into our initial business combination with a target business that does not meet these criteria and guidelines.

● | Target Enterprise Value: We intend to target entities whose enterprise value is between $300 million and $1 billion. These companies have a domestic and international following, which we believe offers long-term risk-adjusted return potential;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Focus: The software industry and Fintech sector are domains in which we have demonstrated accomplishments and “pattern recognition” knowledge. Our management team’s multifaceted expertise in assessing a target’s technology and their potential for disruption are key in evaluating business transaction candidates swiftly and adequately;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Total Addressable Market: We intend to focus on investments that we believe present attractive prospects for both near-term and long-term secular market expansion. Companies should either have a sizable market share in their segment or operate in a largely greenfield market in order to be able to achieve market leadership. We also intend to seek companies in industries that are benefiting from strong macro tailwinds such that the markets in which they operate are constantly growing, ultimately driving a company’s ability to sustain strong revenue growth rates for years. They should also have defensible proprietary technology and intellectual property rights;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Disciplined Organic Growth and Profitable Unit Economics: We intend to seek targets who have shown consistent organic revenue growth while also acquiring customers profitably over the long-term. We seek to find a company that has taken and will continue to take a balanced approach between growth and acquiring customers at a cost that can be recouped quickly while also driving customer lifetime value. Ability to generate continued strong organic growth as well as an ability to manage free cash flow are key characteristics of a target company;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------






3








● | Management: We intend to seek companies with proven and accomplished management teams as we recognize they are the subject matter experts and proven drivers of the target business who may also be eager to benefit from our management team’s expertise. We intend to devote significant resources to analyzing and reaching alignment among a target’s management team and its stakeholders, a paramount element to successful execution of any business plan;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Operational Maturity: We intend to select companies with IPO-ready infrastructure, including the requisite compliance, financial controls and reporting processes in place needed for the regulatory constraints of a public entity;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Benefit from Being Public: We are committed to working with management and shareholders who aspire to have their company become a public entity and generate substantial wealth creation. The benefits of transitioning from a private to a public entity may include a broader access to debt and equity providers, liquidity for employees and potential acquisitions, and expanded branding in the marketplace;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Appropriate Valuations: We are rigorous, disciplined, and valuation-centric investors, with a keen understanding of market value. We expect to enter a business combination only if it pairs significant upside potential with limited downside risks.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Stable, Recurring Revenue: We intend to target companies that operate a Software as a Service model, generating subscription revenue with annual or multi-year contracts;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Opportunity for Strategic or Operational Enhancement: We intend to leverage our team’s expertise and extensive networks in the software industry to drive ongoing value creation. We intend to seek management teams with the interest and ability to execute on accretive strategic opportunities, including acquisitions of companies that enhance shareholder value;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Strong Barriers to Entry with Defensible Market Position: We intend to select a target that has defensible proprietary technology and intellectual property rights or a first mover advantage. The target should also have embedded characteristics to support continued pricing power of its products;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | High Customer Retention Rates: We intend to acquire a target that has a stable and growing customer base with long-term subscription-based revenues, minimal churn and the ability to up-sell and cross-sell expansions with its existing customers;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Strong Gross Margin Profile and Potential for High Cash Flow Conversion: We intend to acquire a target with an efficient cost structure and strong gross margin profile representative of a product company operating with a multi-tenant architecture;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Low asset intensity: We intend to select a target with limited capital expenditure needs (including software development expenses) relative to its revenues and operating earnings;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




These criteria are not intended to be exhaustive. Any evaluation relating to the merits of a particular initial business combination may be based, to the extent relevant, on these general guidelines as well as other considerations, factors and criteria that our management team may deem relevant. In the event that we decide to enter into our initial business combination with a target business that does not meet the above criteria and guidelines, we will disclose that the target business does not meet the above criteria in our stockholder communications related to our initial business combination, which, as discussed in this prospectus, would be in the form of proxy materials or tender offer documents, as applicable, that we would file with the SEC. In evaluating a prospective target business, we expect to conduct a due diligence review which may encompass, among other things, meetings with incumbent management and employees, document reviews, interviews of customers and suppliers, inspections of facilities, as well as reviewing financial and other information which will be made available to us.



The time required to select and evaluate a target business and to structure and complete our initial business combination, and the costs associated with this process, are not currently ascertainable with any degree of certainty. Any costs incurred with respect to the identification and evaluation of, and negotiation with, a prospective target business with which our initial business combination is not ultimately completed will result in our incurring losses and will reduce the funds we can use to complete another business combination. We will not pay any consulting fees to members of our management team, or any of their respective affiliates, for services rendered to or in connection with our initial business combination.



Effecting Our Initial Business Combination



General



We are not presently engaged in, and we will not engage in, any operations for an indefinite period of time. We intend to effectuate our initial business combination using cash held in the trust account, the proceeds of the sale of our shares in connection with our initial business combination (including pursuant to forward purchase agreements or backstop agreements we may enter into), shares issued to the owners of the target, debt issued to bank or other lenders or the owners of the target, or a combination of the foregoing. We may seek to complete our initial business combination with a company or business that may be financially unstable or in its early stages of development or growth, which would subject us to the numerous risks inherent in such companies and businesses.





4







If our initial business combination is paid for using equity or debt securities, or not all of the funds released from the trust account are used for payment of the consideration in connection with our initial business combination or used for redemptions of our Class A common stock, we may apply the balance of the cash released to us from the trust account for general corporate purposes, including for maintenance or expansion of operations of the post-transaction company, the payment of principal or interest due on indebtedness incurred in completing our initial business combination, to fund the purchase of other companies or for working capital.



Selection of a Target Business and Structuring of Our Initial Business Combination



Although we may pursue an acquisition opportunity in any business or industry, we intend to focus on opportunities in the technology sector, particularly companies pursuing a Software as a Service, or SaaS, model. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation prohibits us from effectuating a business combination [solely] with another blank check company or similar company with nominal operations.



Nasdaq rules require that we must complete one or more business combinations having an aggregate fair market value of at least 80% of the value of the assets held in the trust account (excluding the deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable on the interest earned on the trust account) at the time of our signing a definitive agreement in connection with our initial business combination. Our board of directors will make the determination as to the fair market value of our initial business combination. If our board of directors is not able to independently determine the fair market value of our initial business combination, we will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm which is a member of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (“FINRA”) or a valuation or appraisal firm with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria. While we consider it unlikely that our board of directors will not be able to make an independent determination of the fair market value of our initial business combination, it may be unable to do so if it is less familiar or experienced with the business of the particular target or if there is a significant amount of uncertainty as to the value of a target’s assets or prospects.



We anticipate structuring our initial business combination so that the post-transaction company in which our public stockholders own shares will own or acquire 100% of the equity interests or assets of the target business or businesses. We may, however, structure our initial business combination such that the post-transaction company owns or acquires less than 100% of such interests or assets of the target business in order to meet certain objectives of the target management team or stockholders or for other reasons, but we will only complete such business combination if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, or the Investment Company Act. Even if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the voting securities of the target, our stockholders prior to the business combination may collectively own a minority interest in the post-transaction company, depending on valuations ascribed to the target and us in the business combination transaction. For example, we could pursue a transaction in which we issue a substantial number of new shares in exchange for all of the outstanding capital stock of a target. In this case, we would acquire a 100% controlling interest in the target. However, as a result of the issuance of a substantial number of new shares, our stockholders immediately prior to our initial business combination could own less than a majority of our outstanding shares subsequent to our initial business combination. If less than 100% of the equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses are owned or acquired by the post-transaction company, the portion of such business or businesses that is owned or acquired is what will be taken into account for purposes of the 80% of net assets test described above. If the business combination involves more than one target business, the 80% of net assets test will be based on the aggregate value of all of the target businesses.





5







In evaluating a prospective target business, we expect to conduct a due diligence review which may encompass, among other things, meetings with incumbent management and employees, document reviews, interviews of customers and suppliers, inspections of facilities, as well as reviewing financial and other information which will be made available to us.



The time required to select and evaluate a target business and to structure and complete our initial business combination, and the costs associated with this process, are not currently ascertainable with any degree of certainty. Any costs incurred with respect to the identification and evaluation of, and negotiation with, a prospective target business with which our initial business combination is not ultimately completed will result in our incurring losses and will reduce the funds we can use to complete another business combination.



We are not prohibited from pursuing an initial business combination with a company that is affiliated with the Sponsor, executive officers or directors, or completing the business combination through a joint venture or other form of shared ownership with the Sponsor, executive officers or directors. In the event we seek to complete an initial business combination with a target that is affiliated with the Sponsor, executive officers or directors, we, or a committee of independent directors, would obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm which is a member of FINRA or a valuation or appraisal firm stating that such an initial business combination is fair to our company from a financial point of view.



Redemption Rights for Public Stockholders upon Completion of our Initial Business Combination



We will provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their shares of Class A common stock upon the completion of our initial business combination at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account calculated as of two business days prior to the consummation of the initial business combination, including interest earned on the funds held in the trust account and not previously released to us to pay our taxes, divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, subject to the limitations and on the conditions described herein. The amount in the trust account is approximately $10.00 per public share as of December 31, 2021. The per share amount we will distribute to investors who properly redeem their shares will not be reduced by the deferred underwriting commissions we will pay to the underwriters. The initial stockholders, Sponsor, officers and directors have entered into a letter agreement with us, pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to any founder shares and public shares they may hold in connection with the completion of our initial business combination.
Manner of Conducting Redemptions



We will provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their public shares upon the completion of our initial business combination either (i) in connection with a stockholder meeting called to approve the initial business combination or (ii) without a stockholder vote by means of a tender offer. The decision as to whether we will seek stockholder approval of a proposed initial business combination or conduct a tender offer will be made by us, solely in our discretion, and will be based on a variety of factors such as the timing of the transaction and whether the terms of the transaction would require us to seek stockholder approval under applicable law or stock exchange listing requirements. Asset acquisitions and share purchases would not typically require stockholder approval while direct mergers with our company where we do not survive and any transactions where we issue more than 20% of our outstanding Class A common stock or seek to amend our amended and restated certificate of incorporation would require stockholder approval. So long as we obtain and maintain a listing for our securities on Nasdaq, we will be required to comply with Nasdaq’s stockholder approval rules.



The requirement that we provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem their public shares by one of the two methods listed above will be contained in provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and will apply whether or not we maintain our registration under the Exchange Act or our listing on Nasdaq. Such provisions may be amended if approved by holders of 65% of our common stock entitled to vote thereon.



If we provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem their public shares in connection with a stockholder meeting, we will (a) conduct the redemptions in conjunction with a proxy solicitation pursuant to Regulation 14A of the Exchange Act, which regulates the solicitation of proxies, and not pursuant to the tender offer rules, and (b) file proxy materials with the SEC.




6







If we seek stockholder approval, we will complete our initial business combination only if a majority of the outstanding shares of common stock voted are voted in favor of the initial business combination. A quorum for such meeting will consist of the holders present in person or by proxy of shares of outstanding capital stock of the Company representing a majority of the voting power of all outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company entitled to vote at such meeting. Our initial stockholders will count towards this quorum and, the Sponsor, officers and directors have agreed to vote any founder shares they hold and any public shares purchased during or after the initial public offering (including in open market and privately-negotiated transactions) in favor of our initial business combination. Each public stockholder may elect to redeem its public shares irrespective of whether they vote for or against the proposed transaction or whether they were a stockholder on the record date for the stockholder meeting held to approve the proposed transaction. In addition, our initial stockholders have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to their founder shares and any public shares they may hold in connection with the consummation of the initial business combination.



If we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our initial business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, the Sponsor, initial stockholders, directors, executive officers, advisors or their affiliates may purchase shares or public warrants in privately negotiated transactions or in the open market either prior to or following the completion of our initial business combination. There is no limit on the number of shares our initial stockholders, directors, officers, advisors or their affiliates may purchase in such transactions, subject to compliance with applicable law and Nasdaq rules. However, they have no current commitments, plans or intentions to engage in such transactions and have not formulated any terms or conditions for any such transactions. None of the funds held in the trust account will be used to purchase public shares or public warrants in such transactions. If they engage in such transactions, they will be restricted from making any such purchases when they are in possession of any material nonpublic information not disclosed to the seller or if such purchases are prohibited by Regulation M under the Exchange Act. We do not currently anticipate that such purchases, if any, would constitute a tender offer subject to the tender offer rules under the Exchange Act or a going-private transaction subject to the going-private rules under the Exchange Act; however, if the purchasers determine at the time of any such purchases that the purchases are subject to such rules, the purchasers will comply with such rules. We expect any such purchases will be reported pursuant to Section 13 and Section 16 of the Exchange Act to the extent such purchasers are subject to such reporting requirements.



The purpose of any such purchases of public shares could be to vote such public shares in favor of the business combination and thereby increase the likelihood of obtaining stockholder approval of the business combination or to satisfy a closing condition in an agreement with a target that requires us to have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash at the closing of our business combination, where it appears that such requirement would otherwise not be met. The purpose of any such purchases of public warrants could be to reduce the number of public warrants outstanding or to vote such warrants on any matters submitted to the warrantholders for approval in connection with our business combination. Any such purchases of our securities may result in the completion of our business combination that may not otherwise have been possible. In addition, if such purchases are made, the public “float” of our shares of Class A common stock or warrants may be reduced and the number of beneficial holders of our securities may be reduced, which may make it difficult to maintain or obtain the quotation, listing or trading of our securities on a national securities exchange.



If we conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules of the SEC, we will, pursuant to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation: (a) conduct the redemptions pursuant to Rule 13e-4 and Regulation 14E of the Exchange Act, which regulate issuer tender offers; and (b) file tender offer documents with the SEC prior to completing our initial business combination which contain substantially the same financial and other information about our initial business combination and the redemption rights as is required under Regulation 14A of the Exchange Act, which regulates the solicitation of proxies.



Limitation on Redemption upon Completion of our Initial Business Combination if we Seek Stockholder Approval



Notwithstanding the foregoing, if we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our initial business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that a public stockholder, together with any affiliate of such stockholder or any other person with whom such stockholder is acting in concert or as a “group” (as defined under Section 13 of the Exchange Act), will be restricted from seeking redemption rights with respect to more than an aggregate of 20% of the shares sold in our initial public offering, which we refer to as the “Excess Shares.” Such restriction shall also be applicable to our affiliates. We believe this restriction will discourage stockholders from accumulating large blocks of shares, and subsequent attempts by such holders to use their ability to exercise their redemption rights against a proposed initial business combination as a means to force us or our management to purchase their shares at a significant premium to the then-current market price or on other undesirable terms. Absent this provision, a public stockholder holding more than an aggregate of 20% of the shares sold in our initial public offering could threaten to exercise its redemption rights if such holder’s shares are not purchased by us, the Sponsor or our management at a premium to the then-current market price or on other undesirable terms. By limiting our stockholders’ ability to redeem no more than 20% of the shares sold in our initial public offering without our prior consent, we believe we will limit the ability of a small group of stockholders to unreasonably attempt to block our ability to complete our initial business combination, particularly in connection with an initial business combination with a target that requires as a closing condition that we have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash. However, we would not be restricting our stockholders’ ability to vote all of their shares (including Excess Shares) for or against our initial business combination.

Redemption of Public Shares and Liquidation if No Initial Business Combination



Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that we will have until eighteen (18) months from the closing of our initial public offering, or June 22, 2022, to complete our initial business combination. If we are unable to complete our initial business combination by June 22, 2022, we will: (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account including interest earned on the funds held in the trust account and not previously released to us to pay our taxes (less up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public stockholders’ rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidating distributions, if any), and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining stockholders and our board of directors, liquidate and dissolve, subject in each case to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. There will be no redemption rights or liquidating distributions with respect to our warrants, which will expire worthless if we fail to complete our initial business combination by June 22, 2022.
Competition



In identifying, evaluating and selecting a target business for our initial business combination, we may encounter competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours, including other special purpose acquisition companies, private equity groups and leveraged buyout funds, public companies and operating businesses seeking strategic acquisitions. Many of these entities are well established and have extensive experience identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates. Moreover, many of these competitors possess greater financial, technical, human and other resources than us. Our ability to acquire larger target businesses will be limited by our available financial resources. This inherent limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the acquisition of a target business. Furthermore, our obligation to pay cash in connection with our public stockholders who exercise their redemption rights may reduce the resources available to us for our initial business combination and our outstanding warrants, and the future dilution they potentially represent, may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses. Either of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating an initial business combination.
Employees



We currently have two executive officers: Carter Glatt and Michael Castaldy. These individuals are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters but they intend to devote as much of their time as they deem necessary to our affairs until we have completed our initial business combination. The amount of time they will devote in any time period will vary based on the stage of the business combination process we are in. We do not intend to have any full time employees prior to the completion of our initial business combination.
