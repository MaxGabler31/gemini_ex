Item 1.   Business
 
General

Industrial Services of America, Inc. (herein “ISA,” the “Company,” “we,” “us,” “our,” or other similar terms) is a Louisville, Kentucky-based company that buys, processes and markets ferrous and non-ferrous metals and other recyclable commodities and buys used autos in order to sell used auto parts. We purchase, process and sell ferrous and non-ferrous scrap metal to steel mini-mills, integrated steel makers, foundries, refineries and processors. We purchase ferrous and non-ferrous scrap metal primarily from industrial and commercial generators of steel, aluminum, copper, brass, stainless steel and other metals, as well as from scrap dealers and retail customers who deliver these materials directly to our facilities. We process scrap metal through our sorting, cutting, baling, and shredding operations. The shredding operations were restarted in May 2017, which had previously been idled in May 2015. We operate the auto shredder in the normal course of business subject to market conditions and operating needs.  Our non-ferrous scrap recycling operations consist primarily of collecting, sorting and processing various grades of copper, aluminum, stainless steel and brass. Our used automobile yard primarily purchases automobiles so that retail customers can locate and remove used parts for purchase.
 
On March 26, 2018, the Board appointed Todd L. Phillips as Chief Executive Officer. See Note 9 - Share-based Compensation and Other Compensation Agreements in the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Mr. Phillips has been the Company's Chief Financial Officer since December 31, 2014 and President since September 30, 2016 and will continue to serve in these roles.

ISA Recycling Operating Division
 
We have one segment, our Recycling Segment. Our Recycling Segment buys, processes and markets ferrous and non-ferrous metals and other recyclable commodities and buys used automobiles in order to sell used automobile parts. The Company purchases, processes and sells ferrous and non-ferrous scrap metal to steel mini-mills, integrated steel makers, foundries, refineries and processors. The Company purchases ferrous and non-ferrous scrap metal primarily from industrial and commercial generators of steel, aluminum, copper, brass, stainless steel and other metals, as well as from scrap dealers and retail customers who deliver these materials directly to our facilities. The Company processes ferrous scrap metal through sorting, cutting, baling, and shredding operations. The shredding operations were idled in May 2015 and restarted in May 2017. The non-ferrous scrap recycling operations consist primarily of collecting, sorting and processing various grades of copper, aluminum, stainless steel and brass.
 
We also operate the ISA Pick.Pull.Save used automobile parts yard, which is considered a product line within the Recycling Segment. We purchase automobiles for the yard through auctions, automobile purchase programs with various suppliers and general scrap purchases. Retail customers locate and remove used parts for purchase from automobiles within the yard. Freon, fuel, tires and certain core automobile parts are also sold to various resellers for additional revenue. All automobiles are sold as scrap metal or used in our shredding operations after a specified time period in the yard.

Ferrous Operations
 
Ferrous Scrap Purchasing - We purchase ferrous scrap from two primary sources: (i) industrial and commercial generators of steel and iron; and (ii) scrap dealers, peddlers, and other generators and collectors who sell us steel and iron scrap. Market demand and the composition, quality, size and weight of the materials are the primary factors that determine prices paid to these material providers.
 
Ferrous Scrap Processing - We prepare ferrous scrap material for resale through a variety of methods including sorting, cutting, baling and shredding operations. The shredding operations were idled in May 2015 and restarted in May 2017. We produce a number of differently sized, shaped and graded products depending upon customer specifications and market demand.
 

• | Sorting - After purchasing ferrous scrap material, we inspect it to determine how we should process it to maximize profitability. In some instances, we may sort scrap material and sell it without further processing. We separate scrap material for further processing according to its size, composition and grade by using conveyor systems, front-end loaders, crane-mounted electromagnets and claw-like grapples.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Cutting - Pieces of over-sized ferrous scrap material, such as obsolete steel girders and used pipe, which are too large for other processing, are cut with hand torches.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Baling - We process light-gauge ferrous materials such as clips, sheet iron and by-products from industrial and commercial processes, such as stampings, clippings and excess trimmings, by baling these materials into large, uniform blocks. We use cranes and conveyors to feed the material into a hydraulic press, which compresses the material into uniform blocks.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Shredding and related metal recovery - The shredding operations were idled in May 2015 and restarted in May 2017. We shred large pieces of scrap material, such as automobiles and major appliances, in our shredder by hammer mill action into pieces of a workable size that pass through magnetic separators to separate ferrous metal from non-ferrous metals, synthetic foam, fabric, rubber, stone, dirt, etc. The ferrous metal we recover from the shredding process is sold directly to customers or reused in some other metal blend. The residue by-product is usually referred to as “automobile shredder residue” ("ASR") or “shredder fluff." We further separate the ASR into non-ferrous metals and non-metal waste. The non-ferrous metals are sold directly to customers or reused in some other metal blend. We dispose of the non-metal waste, which can reduce the volume of the scrap as much as 25.0%, in a landfill. Revenues from the ferrous and non-ferrous metals related to this shredding and related metal recovery processes are recognized in revenue from ferrous operations in the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Ferrous Scrap Sales - We sell processed ferrous scrap material to end-users such as steel mini-mills, integrated steel makers and foundries, and brokers who aggregate materials for other large users. Most customers purchase processed ferrous scrap material through negotiated spot sales contracts, which establish the quantity purchased for the month and the pricing. The price we charge for ferrous scrap materials depends upon market supply and demand, as well as quality and grade of the scrap material. We deliver scrap ourselves or use third party carriers via truck, and/or rail car. Some customers choose to send their own delivery trucks. These trucks are weighed and loaded at one of our sites based on the sales order.
 
Auto Parts Operations
 
We operate a single self-service retail parts location. We generate revenue from the sale of parts, cores and scrap. Our location consists of an indoor retail facility combined with a fenced outdoor storage area for autos. We operate our self-service auto parts business under the name of ISA Pick.Pull.Save.
 
Non-Ferrous Operations
 
Non-Ferrous Scrap Purchasing - We purchase non-ferrous scrap from two primary sources: (i) industrial and commercial non-ferrous scrap material providers who generate or sell waste aluminum, copper, brass, stainless steel and other metals; and (ii) peddlers, scrap dealers, generators and collectors who deliver directly to our facilities material that they collect from a variety of sources. We also collect non-ferrous scrap from sources other than those that are delivered directly to our processing facilities by placing retrieval boxes at these sources. We subsequently transport the boxes to our processing facilities.
 
Non-Ferrous Scrap Processing - We prepare non-ferrous scrap metals, principally aluminum, copper, brass and stainless steel to sell by sorting, cutting and baling.

• | Sorting - Our sorting operations separate and identify non-ferrous scrap by using front-end loaders, grinders, hand torches and spectrometers. Our ability to identify metallurgical composition maximizes margins and profitability. We sort non-ferrous scrap material for further processing according to type, grade, size and chemical composition. Throughout the sorting process, we determine whether the material requires further processing before we sell it.

• | Cutting - Pieces of over-sized non-ferrous scrap material, which are too large for other processing methods, are cut with hand torches.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Baling - We process non-ferrous metals such as aluminum cans, sheet and siding by baling these materials into large uniform blocks. We use front-end loaders and conveyors to feed the material into a hydraulic press, which compresses the material into uniform blocks.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Non-Ferrous Scrap Sales - We sell processed non-ferrous scrap material either directly or indirectly to end-users or processors such as foundries, aluminum sheet and ingot manufacturers, copper refineries and smelters, steel mini-mills, integrated steel makers, steel foundries and refineries, copper wire processors and brass and bronze ingot manufacturers. Prices for the majority of non-ferrous scrap materials change based upon the daily publication of spot and futures prices on COMEX or the London Metals Exchange. We deliver scrap ourselves or use third party carriers via truck and/or rail car. Some customers choose to send their own delivery trucks. These trucks are weighed and loaded at one of our sites based on the sales order.
 
Company Background
 
ISA was incorporated in 1953 in Florida under the name ALSON MFG. CO. and originally designed and manufactured various forms of electrical products.
 
In 1984, ISA moved into waste handling and disposal equipment sales. 
 
In 1985, we began offering solid waste management consultations. 
 
We began focusing on ferrous and non-ferrous scrap metal recycling in 1997 and expanded into the stainless steel blending and high-temperature alloys recycling business in 2009.

In 2012, we opened the ISA Pick.Pull.Save used automobile yard.
 
In 2013, we discontinued the stainless steel blending and high-temperature alloys recycling business. 
 
In 2015, we exited the waste services business and idled our shredder.

In May 2017, we restarted our shredding operations.

Currently, our primary focus is ferrous and non-ferrous metal recycling, as well as selling used auto parts.
 
Competition
 
The metal recycling business is highly competitive and is subject to significant changes in economic and market conditions. Pricing and proximity to a metal source are the major competitive factors in the metal recycling business. We compete for the purchase and sale of scrap metal with large, well-financed recyclers of scrap metal as well as smaller metal facilities and brokers/dealers. 
Dependence on Major Customer
 
We had sales to one major customer that totaled approximately 21.2% and 16.3% of our net sales for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
 
Employees
 
As of February 28, 2019, we had 83 full-time employees. None of our employees are members of a union.
 
Effect of State and Federal Environmental Regulations
 
Although we believe that our business model adequately protects us from potential environmental liability, we also continue to use our best efforts to be in compliance with federal, state and local environmental laws. Such compliance has not historically constituted a material expense to us.
 
The recycling operations are subject to federal, state and local requirements, which regulate health, safety, the environment, zoning and land-use. We strive to conduct our operations in compliance with applicable laws and regulations. While such amounts expended in the past or that we anticipate spending in the future have not had and are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or operations, the possibility remains that technological, regulatory or enforcement developments, the results of environmental studies or other factors could materially alter this expectation.
