Item 1. | Business

We are an 139-year-old media enterprise with interests in local and national media brands. Founded in 1878, our motto is "Give light and the people will find their own way." Our mission is to do well by doing good — providing value to customers, employees and owners by informing, engaging and empowering those we serve. We serve audiences and businesses in our Local Media division through a portfolio of local television stations and their associated digital media products. Our Local Media division is one of the nation’s largest independent TV station ownership groups, with 33 television stations in 24 markets and a reach of nearly one in five U.S. television households. We have affiliations with all of the “Big Four” television networks. In our National Media division, we operate national media brands including podcast industry-leader, Midroll; next-generation national news network; Newsy, and four over-the-air broadcast networks, the Katz networks. We also operate an award-winning investigative reporting newsroom in Washington, D.C., and serve as the longtime steward of one of the nation's largest, most successful and longest-running educational programs, the Scripps National Spelling Bee. For a full listing of our outlets, visit http://www.scripps.com.
On October 2, 2017, we acquired the Katz networks. Katz operates four over-the-air networks — Bounce, Escape, Grit and Laff. Each of these networks reaches about 90 percent of all U.S. households. 
At the end of 2017, we began a comprehensive restructuring of our local and national media brands to position the company for improved performance and continued growth. The reorganization, effective December 31, 2017, includes merging local television and digital operations into a Local Media division and the national brands into a National Media division. In the third quarter, we began a deep analysis of our operating divisions and corporate cost structure, our non-core assets and the opportunities for our national content brands. We are committed to improving operating performance in our local media business, supporting the growth ahead with our national businesses and serving our audiences with news and information across all media platforms.
We also announced our plans at the end of 2017 to divest our radio business and have engaged a broker to assist us in the sales process. 
Financial information for each of our business segments can be found under “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10-K.

LOCAL MEDIA
Our Local Media segment is comprised of our local broadcast television stations and their related digital operations. We have operated broadcast television stations since 1947, when we launched Ohio’s first television station, WEWS, in Cleveland. Today, our television station group reaches approximately one in five of the nation’s television households and includes fifteen ABC affiliates, five NBC affiliates, two FOX affiliates and two CBS affiliates. We also have two MyTV affiliates, one CW affiliate, one independent station and three Azteca America Spanish-language affiliates. 
We produce high-quality news, information and entertainment content that informs and engages our local communities. We distribute our content on four platforms — broadcast, Internet, smartphones and tablets. It is our objective to develop content and applications designed to enhance the user experience on each of those platforms. Our ability to cover our communities across multiple digital platforms allows us to expand our audiences beyond our traditional broadcast television boundaries.
We believe the most critical component of our product mix is compelling news content, which is an important link to the community and aids our stations' efforts to retain and expand viewership. We have trained employees in our news departments to be multi-media journalists, allowing us to pursue a “hyper-local” strategy by having more reporters covering local news for our over-the-air and digital platforms. 
In addition to news programming, our television stations run network programming, syndicated programming and original programming. Our strategy is to rely less on expensive syndicated programming and to replace it with original programming which we control. We believe this strategy improves our Local Media division's financial performance. We currently air four original shows we produce ourselves or in partnership with others:

• | Pickler & Ben is a daily daytime lifestyle and entertainment show starring Kellie Pickler and Ben Aaron. For the 2017-2018 season, Pickler & Ben was available in 39 markets with a national reach of 23 percent of the country.


• | The List, an Emmy award winning infotainment show, was available in 46 markets reaching viewers in approximately 32 percent of the country.


• | The Now is a news show designed to take the audience into a deeper dive of the day's events and is available in more than 10 of our markets.


• | RightThisMinute is daily news and entertainment program featuring viral videos. RightThisMinute reaches nearly 95 percent of the nation's television households.

Revenue cycles and sources
Core Advertising 
Our core advertising is comprised of sales to local and national customers. The advertising includes a combination of broadcast air spots, as well as digital advertising. Our core advertising revenues account for 63% of our Local Media segment’s revenues in 2017. Pricing of broadcast spot advertising is based on audience size and share, the demographics of our audiences and the demand for our limited inventory of commercial time. Our stations compete for advertising revenues with other sources of local media, including competitors’ television stations in the same markets, radio stations, cable television systems, newspapers, digital platforms and direct mail.
Local advertising time is sold by each station’s local sales staff who call upon advertising agencies and local businesses, which typically include advertisers such as car dealerships, retail stores and restaurants. We seek to attract new advertisers to our television stations and to increase the amount of advertising sold to existing local advertisers by relying on experienced local sales forces with strong community ties, producing news and other programming with local advertising appeal and sponsoring or promoting local events and activities. 
National advertising time is generally sold through national sales representative firms that call upon advertising agencies, whose clients typically include automobile manufacturers and dealer groups, telecommunications companies and national retailers. 
Digital revenues are primarily generated from the sale of advertising to local and national customers on our local television websites, smartphone apps, tablet apps and other platforms. 
Cyclical factors influence revenues from our core advertising categories. Some of the cycles are periodic and known well in advance, such as election campaign seasons and special programming events (e.g. the Olympics or the Super Bowl). For example, our NBC affiliates benefit from incremental advertising demand from the coverage of the Olympics. Economic cycles are less predictable and beyond our control.
Due to increased demand in the spring and holiday seasons, the second and fourth quarters normally have higher advertising revenues than the first and third quarters.
Political Advertising
Political advertising is generally sold through our Washington D.C. sales office. Advertising is sold to presidential, gubernatorial, Senate and House of Representative candidates, as well as for state and local issues. It is also sold to political action groups (PACs) or other advocacy groups.
Political advertising revenues increase significantly during even-numbered years when local, state and federal elections occur. In addition, every four years, political spending is typically elevated further due to the advertising for the presidential election. Because of the cyclical nature of the political election cycle, there has been a significant difference in our operating results when comparing the performance of even-numbered years to odd numbered years. Additionally, our operating results are impacted by the number, importance and competitiveness of individual political races and issues discussed in our local markets. 
Retransmission Revenues
We earn revenues from retransmission consent agreements with multi-channel video programming distributors ("MVPDs") in our markets. Retransmission revenues were 33% of our Local Media segment's revenues in 2017. The MVPDs are cable operators and satellite carriers who pay us to offer our programming to their customers. The fees we receive are typically based on the number of subscribers the MVPD has in our local market and the contracted rate per subscriber.
We also receive fees from over-the-top (virtual MVPDs) such as YouTubeTV, DirectTV Now and Sony Vue. The fees we receive are typically based on the number of subscribers in our local market and the contracted rate per subscriber.
Expenses
Employee costs accounted for 46% of the Local Media segment costs and expenses in 2017.

We centralize certain functions, such as master control, traffic, graphics and political advertising, at company-owned hubs that do not require a presence in the local markets. This approach enables each of our stations to focus local resources on the creation of content and revenue-producing activities. We expect to continue to look for opportunities to centralize functions that do not require a local market presence. 
Programming costs, which include network affiliation fees, syndicated programming and shows produced for us or in partnership with others, were 30% of total segment costs and expenses in 2017. 
Our network-affiliated stations broadcast programming that is supplied to us by the networks in various dayparts. Under each affiliation agreement, the station broadcasts all of the programs transmitted by the network. In exchange, we pay affiliation fees to the network and the network sells a substantial majority of the advertising time during these broadcasts. We expect our network affiliation agreements to be renewed upon expiration.
Federal Regulation of Broadcasting — Broadcast television is subject to the jurisdiction of the FCC pursuant to the Communications Act of 1934, as amended (“Communications Act”). The Communications Act prohibits the operation of broadcast stations except in accordance with a license issued by the FCC and empowers the FCC to revoke, modify and renew broadcast licenses, approve the transfer of control of any entity holding such a license, determine the location of stations, regulate the equipment used by stations and adopt and enforce necessary regulations. As part of its obligation to ensure that broadcast licensees serve the public interest, the FCC exercises limited authority over broadcast programming by, among other things, requiring certain children's television programming and limiting commercial content therein, requiring the identification of program sponsors, regulating the sale of political advertising and the distribution of emergency information, and restricting indecent programming. The FCC also requires television broadcasters to close caption their programming for the benefit of persons with hearing impairment and to ensure that any of their programming that is later transmitted via the Internet is captioned. Network-affiliated television broadcasters in larger markets must also offer audio narration of certain programming for the benefit of persons with visual impairments. Reference should be made to the Communications Act, the FCC’s rules and regulations, and the FCC’s public notices and published decisions for a fuller description of the FCC’s extensive regulation of broadcasting.
Broadcast licenses are granted for a term of up to eight years and are renewable upon request, subject to FCC review of the licensee's performance. All the Company’s applications for license renewal during the current renewal cycle have been granted for full terms. While there can be no assurance regarding the renewal of our broadcast licenses, we have never had a license revoked, have never been denied a renewal, and all previous renewals have been for the maximum term.
FCC regulations govern the ownership of television stations, and the agency is required by statute to periodically review these rules. In November 2017, the FCC reconsidered an earlier agency decision to leave the rules generally intact and adopted significant changes to its local television ownership rules. In particular, the FCC voted to relax the television “duopoly rule” that generally restricted an applicant from owning or controlling more than one television station (or in some markets under certain conditions, more than two television stations) in the same market. The reconsideration order eliminated that rule’s requirement that eight independent local television station “voices” should remain after any merger, and it relaxed the prohibition against common ownership of two of the four most-viewed stations in a market, stating that proposed mergers of such “top-four” stations will instead be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. The Company enjoys a waiver of this television duopoly rule in the Green Bay, Wisconsin market. The order further reversed an earlier FCC decision to treat those stations participating in joint advertising sales agreements as if they were under common ownership. Station WSYM-TV, Lansing, Michigan, is a party to such a joint advertising agreement with a local station, but it enjoyed a permitted “grandfathered” status while the rule was in effect.
 This 2017 reconsideration order left in place the long-standing requirement that any television station that provides more than 15% of another in-market television station’s weekly programming is deemed to have an attributable interest in that station that subjects the stations to the FCC’s ownership limits. It also confirmed the earlier review order’s direction that any local stations that share facilities or services such as program production on a continuing basis must start disclosing these agreements in their public files. Stations WPTV-TV, West Palm Beach, Florida, and KIVI-TV, Nampa (Boise), Idaho, are parties to such shared services agreements, but this disclosure requirement will not take effect until it is approved by the Office of Management and Budget. 
With respect to national television ownership, the FCC voted in December 2017 to consider whether and how it might revisit its rule preventing applicants from obtaining an ownership interest in television stations whose total national audience reach would exceed 39% of all television households. Earlier in the year, the FCC reinstated the 50% discount applied to the number of households deemed covered by UHF television stations, and the new notice expressly addresses whether to retain this distinction for UHF.

We cannot predict the outcome of the expected court review of these television ownership rule changes or the effect of the FCC’s rule revisions on our stations' operations or our business.
The restrictions imposed by the FCC’s ownership rules may apply to a corporate licensee due to the ownership interests of its officers, directors or significant shareholders. If such parties meet the FCC’s criteria for holding an attributable interest in the licensee, they are likewise expected to comply with the ownership limits, as well as other licensee requirements such as compliance with certain criminal, antitrust, and antidiscrimination laws.
In order to provide additional spectrum for mobile broadband and other services, the FCC in 2017 conducted an incentive spectrum auction in which some television broadcasters agreed to voluntarily give up spectrum in return for a share of the auction proceeds. No Scripps station will be going off-air or relinquishing a current UHF-band allocation for a VHF-band allocation as a result of the auction, but 17 Scripps stations will be relocating to new channels in the reduced broadcast spectrum band. Broadcasters are concerned that the FCC’s approach to the post-auction “repacking” of the remaining television stations into this reduced broadcast spectrum may not adequately protect stations’ over-the-air service. Broadcasters also are concerned that the FCC’s post-auction plans may not provide sufficient time to complete the repacking before the sold spectrum will be authorized for wireless use and that there may not be adequate compensation for those stations that are required to change facilities. Implementing the post-auction changes will be complicated and costly, and stations located near the Canadian and Mexican borders may be at particular risk of service loss due to the need to coordinate international frequency use. Despite warnings about potential difficulties, such as a lack of available qualified tower crews for the significant number of moves that may be required, the FCC has expressed confidence that adequate time will be available to complete the repacking, and it has imposed a “hard” deadline that could require a station to cease broadcasting on its existing frequency even though an alternative facility is not yet ready to provide its over-the-air service.
The FCC has voted to allow broadcasters to voluntarily use a new digital television standard, ATSC 3.0. This Internet-protocol based transmission system will permit television stations to offer enhanced and innovative services coupled with much improved broadcast signal reception, particularly by mobile devices. The new standard, however, is incompatible with both existing television receivers and with a station’s ability to continue offering its service via the current ATSC 1.0 digital standard. To avoid loss of service to those viewers who lack a new receiver, stations switching to ATSC 3.0 will be required to arrange for a local station that continues to use the current 1.0 standard to air (on a subchannel) programming “substantially similar” to that offered by the switching station on its 3.0 channel. In return, the 3.0 station could host the 3.0 signal of its 1.0 “host” station. This “simulcasting” requirement will sunset in five years, unless extended by the FCC. 
The FCC remains committed to permitting non-broadcast spectrum use in the “white spaces” between television stations' protected service areas despite broadcasters’ concerns about the possibility of harmful interference to their existing service and to the potential for innovative uses of their broadcast spectrum in the future. In connection with the auction process, the FCC may further reduce the spectrum available for television broadcasting by reserving a 6 MHz channel in each market for non-broadcast, unlicensed services (including wireless microphones). The repacking of television broadcast spectrum and the reservation of spectrum in the “broadcast” band for interference-protected non-broadcast services could have a particularly adverse effect on the ability of low-power and translator television stations to offer service since these stations may not be able to find space to operate in the reduced band and they enjoy only “secondary” status that offers no protection from interference caused by a full-power station. We cannot predict the effect of these proceedings on our offering of digital television service or our business.
Broadcast television stations generally enjoy “must-carry” rights on any cable television system defined as “local” with respect to the station. Stations may waive their must-carry rights and instead negotiate retransmission consent agreements with local cable companies. Similarly, satellite carriers, upon request, are required to carry the signal of those television stations that request carriage and that are located in markets in which the satellite carrier chooses to retransmit at least one local station, and satellite carriers cannot carry a broadcast station without its consent. The Company has elected to negotiate retransmission consent agreements with cable operators and satellite carriers for both our network-affiliated stations and our independent stations.
Former FCC Chairman Wheeler announced in 2016 that the Commission would not actively proceed with its rulemaking to reexamine the retransmission consent negotiation process and particularly the standards that may trigger the agency’s intervention to enforce the obligation of the parties to negotiate these agreements in “good faith.” Nevertheless, a related agency proceeding remains open that looks toward the possible elimination of the “network nonduplication” and “syndicated exclusivity” rules that permit broadcasters to enforce certain contractual programming exclusivity rights through the FCC's processes rather than by judicial proceedings. We cannot predict the outcome of these proceedings or their possible impact on the Company.
9

Other proceedings before the FCC and the courts have reexamined the policies that protect television stations' rights to control the distribution of their programming within their local service areas. For example, the FCC has initiated a rulemaking proceeding on the degree to which an entity relying upon the Internet to deliver video programming should be subject to the regulations that apply to multi-channel video programming distributors (“MVPDs”), such as cable operators and satellite systems. This proceeding raises a variety of issues, including whether some Internet-based distributors might be able to take advantage of MVPDs' statutory copyright licensing rights. We cannot predict the outcome of such proceedings that address the use of new technologies to challenge traditional means of redistributing television broadcast programming or their possible impact on the Company.
During recent years, the FCC has significantly increased the penalties it imposes for violations of its rules and policies. For example, a recent settlement of an investigation involving a single radio station’s failure to broadcast proper sponsorship identification announcements in a series of ads required the licensee to make a payment of over $500,000. Uncertainty continues regarding the scope of the FCC's authority to regulate indecent programming, but the agency has increased its enforcement efforts regarding other programming issues such as sponsorship identification, broadcasting proper emergency alerts, and extending service to persons with disabilities. We cannot predict the effect of the FCC’s expanded enforcement efforts on the Company.
NATIONAL MEDIA
Our National Media segment represents our collection of national media brands including Katz, Midroll, and Newsy. Our national brands compete on emerging platforms and marketplaces where there is significant growth in both audience and revenue, such as over-the-top (OTT) or over-the-air (OTA) audio and video. OTT refers to the delivery of media over the internet. Consumers can access OTT content through apps on internet-connected devices such as computers, gaming consoles (such as PlayStation or Xbox), set-top boxes (such as Roku or Apple TV), smartphones, smart TVs and tablets. These marketplaces allow us to expand our national audience reach, enabling us to attract a variety of different advertisers.
Katz
Katz operates four over-the-air networks — Bounce, Escape, Grit and Laff. Katz was founded in 2011 by Jonathan Katz, a former Turner Broadcasting programming executive, with the launch of Bounce. The networks are primarily broadcast over-the-air on local broadcasters' digital sub-channels. They are also carried on some cable and satellite services. Each of the networks is a fast-growing, audience-targeted national broadcast network. Bounce is aimed at African-Americans; Grit airs action and adventure movies targeted at men; Escape runs true crime and documentaries targeting women; and Laff airs classic, well-loved comedies. Each of these Nielson rated networks reaches about 90 percent of all U.S. households as reported by Nielsen. 
The primary source of revenue for Katz is through the sale of advertising to national customers. The advertising revenue generated depends on viewership ratings and the rate paid by customers for certain viewer demographics. Katz sells its advertising in the upfront and scatter markets. In the upfront market, advertisers buy advertising time for upcoming seasons and, by committing to purchase in advance, lock in the advertising rates they will pay for the upcoming year. In the scatter market, advertisers buy their spots closer to the time when the spots will run. The mix of upfront and scatter market advertising time sold is based upon the economic conditions at the time the upfront sales take place, impacting the sell-out levels management is willing or able to obtain. The demand in the scatter market then impacts the pricing achieved for our remaining advertising inventory. Scatter market pricing can vary from upfront pricing and can be volatile. In some cases, advertising sales are subject to ratings guarantees that require us to provide additional advertising time if the guaranteed audience levels are not achieved.
Due to increased demand in the spring and holiday seasons, the second and fourth quarters normally have higher advertising revenues than the first and third quarters.
Katz has carriage agreements with local television broadcasters to carry one or more of the Katz networks. These carriage agreements are generally for a five year term. Under these agreements, Katz either pays a fixed fee or a portion of revenues for the carriage rights.
For programming, Katz enters into agreements to license existing programming and movies, as well as producing several original shows.
10

Midroll
Midroll creates original podcasts and operates a network that generates revenue for more than 300 shows. A podcast is a digital audio recording, usually part of a themed series, which is downloaded most often to mobile devices. In 2017, more than 67 million Americans listened to a podcast at least monthly. Midroll’s listening platform, Stitcher, is a mobile app where consumers can stream the latest in news, sports, talk, and entertainment on demand. We expect continued investment at Midroll for our Stitcher app, creating a best-in-class user experience for both the podcast, listener and advertiser.
Midroll earns revenue from the sale of advertising on its original podcasts, which it creates and distributes through platforms such as its Stitcher app and the iPhone podcast app. Midroll also is expanding into branded content, in which Midroll partners with content creators and pairs them with brand advertisers to create podcasts targeted to their consumers, through the Midroll Brand Studio.
Other revenue sources include podcast agency services. Midroll acts as a sales and marketing representative by working with advertisers to connect them to a specific podcast based on the advertiser's desired target audience. 
Midroll earns subscription revenue from the Stitcher Premium subscription service where users pay a standard monthly or annual fee for access to premium content and ad-free archived podcast episodes. 
Newsy
Newsy is our national news network focused on bringing perspective and analysis to reporting on world and national news, including politics, entertainment, science and technology. It is targeted toward a younger audience. In 2017, we expanded Newsy's distribution to include cable, and by the end of the year, we reached agreements with cable and satellite operators to carry Newsy into 26 million households. We expect continued investment in Newsy as we look to increase distribution and enhance our products.
Newsy also is distributed widely on platforms providing over-the-top television service, including Hulu, Roku, Amazon Fire TV, Apple TV, Sling TV and Chromecast. 
Newsy earns revenue from the sale of advertising on the platforms on which it is distributed. It also receives carriage fees from cable and satellite providers who pay us to offer our programming to their customers. The revenue we receive is typically based on the number of subscribers who receive the programming.
Newsy's programming strategy is to provide in-depth coverage of U.S. and world news targeted at 18-34 year-olds. As part of its cable launch, Newsy has created a programming lineup that includes shows such as the evening newsmagazine “The Why,” the morning show “The Day Ahead,” and the newsmaker spotlight program “30 Minutes With.” Newsy also produces investigative reports and documentaries.
Employees
As of December 31, 2017, we had approximately 4,100 full-time equivalent employees, of whom approximately 3,500 were with Local Media and 400 with National Media. Various labor unions represent approximately 400 employees, the majority of which are in Local Media. We have not experienced any work stoppages at our current operations since 1985. We consider our relationships with our employees to be satisfactory.
