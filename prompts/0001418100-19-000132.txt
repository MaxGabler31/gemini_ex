Item 1. | Business

Our Company
Avaya is a global leader in digital communications products, solutions and services for businesses of all sizes. We enable organizations around the globe to succeed by creating intelligent communications experiences for customers and employees. Avaya builds open, converged and innovative solutions to enhance and simplify communications and collaboration in the cloud, on-premises or a hybrid of both. Our global, experienced team of professionals delivers award-winning services from initial planning and design, to seamless implementation and integration, to ongoing managed operations, optimization, training and support. As of September 30, 2019, we had a presence in approximately 175 countries worldwide and during the past four fiscal years we served more than 90% of the Fortune 100 organizations. 
Operating Segments
Our business has two operating segments: Products & Solutions and Services.
Products & Solutions
Products & Solutions encompasses our unified communications and contact center platforms, applications and devices.

• | Unified Communications ("UC"): Avaya's UC solutions enable organizations to reimagine collaborative work environments and help companies increase employee productivity, improve customer service and reduce costs. With Avaya's UC solutions, organizations can provide their workers with a single application, or "app," for all-channel calling, messaging, meetings and team collaboration with the same ease of use as existing consumer apps. Avaya embeds communications directly into the apps, browsers and devices employees use every day giving them a more natural, efficient and flexible way to connect, engage, respond and share - where and how they want.

Avaya offers an open, extensible development platform, enabling customers and third parties to easily create custom applications and automated workflows for their unique needs, integrating Avaya’s capabilities into the customer's existing infrastructure and business applications. Our solutions enable a seamless communications experience that adapts to how employees work instead of changing how they work. Avaya continues to evolve its UC solutions including for cloud deployment.

• | Contact Center ("CC"): Avaya’s industry-leading digital contact center solutions enable customers to build a customized portfolio of applications to drive stronger customer engagement and higher customer lifetime value. Our reliable, secure and scalable communications solutions include voice, email, chat, social media, video, performance management and third-party integration that can improve customer service and help companies compete more effectively. Like the UC business, Avaya is evolving the CC solution set for cloud deployment.

We are also focused on ensuring an outstanding experience for mobile callers by integrating transformative technologies, including Artificial Intelligence ("AI"), mobility, big data analytics and cybersecurity into our contact center solutions. As organizations use these solutions to gain a deeper understanding of their customer needs, we believe that their teams become more efficient and effective and, as a result, their customer loyalty grows.
Both UC and CC are supported by our portfolio of innovative business phones and multimedia devices, which is one of the broadest in the industry. Avaya brings consumer technology to employee mobile devices and desktops in a way that can help our customers enhance customer service, internal and external collaboration and employee productivity. Customers experience seamless audio and video capabilities for both Avaya and approved third-party UC platforms via open Session Initiation Protocol ("SIP") devices. SIP is used for signaling and controlling multi-media communication sessions in applications of Internet telephony for voice and video calls, along with integration with numerous apps that help connect and accelerate business. Developers can easily customize capabilities for their specific needs with our client Software Development Kit ("SDK").
Services
Services consists of three business areas: Global Support Services, Enterprise Cloud and Managed Services and Professional Services.

• | Global Support Services provide offerings that address the risk of system outages and help businesses protect their technology investments. We help our customers maintain their competitiveness through proactive problem prevention, rapid resolution and continual solution optimization. The majority of our revenue in this business is recurring in nature.

3


• | Enterprise Cloud and Managed Services enable customers to take advantage of our technology via the cloud, on-premises, or a hybrid of both, depending on the solution and the needs of the customer. The majority of our revenue in this business is recurring in nature and based on multi-year services contracts.


• | Professional Services enable businesses worldwide to take full advantage of their IT and communications solution investments to drive measurable business results. Our experienced consultants and engineers partner with clients along each step of the solution lifecycle to deliver services that drive business transformation and provide continuously increasing value. The majority of our revenue in this business is non-recurring in nature.

Together, these comprehensive services enable clients to leverage communications technology to help them maximize their business results. We help our customers use communications to minimize the risk of outages, enable employee productivity and deliver a differentiated customer experience.
Our services teams also help our clients transition at their desired pace to next generation communications technology solutions, either via the cloud, on-premises, or a hybrid of both. Customers can choose various levels of support for their communications solutions, including deployment, training, monitoring, troubleshooting and optimization, and more. Our proactive, preventative system performance monitoring can quickly identify and resolve issues should they arise. Remote diagnostics and resolutions rapidly fix existing problems and avoid potential issues, helping our customers save time and reduce the risk of an outage.
Cloud 
For customers who choose a cloud model, we utilize Avaya OneCloud to deliver our Products & Solutions and Services. Avaya OneCloud delivers flexible business communications services and solutions to connect our customers with their customers, helping them to improve productivity and grow their businesses. With Avaya OneCloud, our customers can integrate, customize and scale operations to be more agile in delivering new products and services to market. Avaya OneCloud helps ensure that our customers have up-to-date technology, so they can deliver meaningful experiences to their customers.
Strategic Partnership with RingCentral
On October 3, 2019, we entered into certain agreements regarding a strategic partnership with RingCentral, Inc. (“RingCentral”), a leading provider of global enterprise cloud communications, collaboration and contact center solutions, to accelerate our transition to the cloud. Through this partnership, we will introduce and deploy Avaya Cloud Office by RingCentral (“Avaya Cloud Office” or “ACO”), a new global unified communications as a service (“UCaaS”) solution. Avaya Cloud Office will expand our industry-leading portfolio to offer a full suite of UC, CC, UCaaS and contact center as a service ("CCaaS") solutions to a global customer base, which includes more than 100,000 customers, over 100 million UC lines and 5 million CC users in approximately 175 countries. Avaya Cloud Office provides us with an opportunity to unlock value from a largely unmonetized base of our business as it brings compelling value to our customers and partners. ACO combines RingCentral’s leading UCaaS platform with Avaya technology, services and migration capabilities to create a highly differentiated UCaaS offering. Under the partnership, the Company is required to market and sell ACO as its exclusive UCaaS solution (subject to certain exceptions). Avaya now has a full suite of public, private and hybrid cloud solutions for its global UC and CC customers and partners. ACO is expected to launch in the second quarter of fiscal 2020. On October 25, 2019, the Company and RingCentral received notice from the U.S. Federal Trade Commission that it had granted early termination, effective immediately, of the applicable waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 ("HSR Act") for the transaction, and the transaction closed on October 31, 2019. The Company is currently in the process of evaluating the impact of the arrangement on its Consolidated Financial Statements.
Emergence from Bankruptcy
On January 19, 2017 (the "Petition Date"), Avaya Holdings Corp., together with certain of its affiliates (collectively, the "Debtors"), filed voluntary petitions for relief (the "Bankruptcy Filing") under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code (the "Bankruptcy Code") in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York (the "Bankruptcy Court"). On November 28, 2017, the Bankruptcy Court entered an order confirming the Second Amended Joint Plan of Reorganization filed by the Debtors on October 24, 2017 (the "Plan of Reorganization"). On December 15, 2017 (the "Emergence Date"), the Plan of Reorganization became effective and the Debtors emerged from bankruptcy. 
Beginning on the Emergence Date, the Company applied fresh start accounting, which resulted in a new basis of accounting and the Company becoming a new entity for financial reporting purposes. As a result of the application of fresh start accounting and the effects of the implementation of the Plan of Reorganization, the Consolidated Financial Statements after December 15, 2017 are not comparable with the Consolidated Financial Statements on or prior to that date. Our financial results for the period from October 1, 2017 through December 15, 2017 are referred to as those of the "Predecessor" period. Our financial results for the period from December 16, 2017 through September 30, 2018 are referred to as those of the "Successor" period or periods. Our results of operations as reported in our Consolidated Financial Statements for these periods are in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP"). Although GAAP

requires that we report on our results for the period from October 1, 2017 through December 15, 2017 and the period from December 16, 2017 through September 30, 2018 separately, we have in certain instances in this report presented operating results for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018 by combining the results of the Predecessor and Successor periods because such presentation provides the most meaningful comparison of our results to prior periods.
For a more detailed discussion of our bankruptcy proceedings (the "Restructuring"), see Part II, Item 7 "Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" and Part II, Item 8, Note 5, "Fresh Start Accounting," to our Consolidated Financial Statements.
Our Business Today
Our solutions address the needs of a diverse range of businesses, including large multinational enterprises, small and medium-sized businesses and government organizations. Our customers operate in a broad range of industries, including financial services, healthcare, hospitality, education, government, manufacturing, retail, transportation, energy, media and communications. We employ a flexible go-to-market strategy with direct or indirect presence in approximately 175 countries. As of September 30, 2019, we had more than 4,000 active channel partners and for fiscal 2019 our product revenue from indirect sales through our channel partners represented 70% of our total Products & Solutions segment revenue. 
For fiscal 2019, 2018 (on a combined basis) and 2017, we generated revenue of $2,887 million, $2,851 million, and $3,272 million, of which 42%, 44%, and 44% was generated by products and 58%, 56%, and 56% by services, respectively. Revenue by business area is presented in the following table for the periods indicated:

 | Successor | | | Predecessor | | Non-GAAP Combined | Predecessor 
(In millions) | Fiscal year ended September 30, 2019 | | Period from December 16, 2017throughSeptember 30, 2018 | | | Period fromOctober 1, 2017throughDecember 15, 2017 | Fiscal year ended September 30, 2018 | Fiscal year ended September 30, 2017

(a) | The Company's Networking business was sold on July 14, 2017.

A key focus of the Company is increasing its recurring revenue. We define recurring revenue as revenue from products and services that are delivered pursuant to multi-period contracts including recurring software revenue, maintenance, Global Support Services and Enterprise Cloud and Managed Services. Non-recurring revenue consists of hardware, non-recurring software and one-time professional services. Hardware predominantly consists of endpoints, more commonly referred to as phones, and non-recurring software is predominantly comprised of perpetual licenses. One-time professional services include installation services, as well as project-based deployment, design, and optimization services.
Trends Shaping Our Industry
We believe several trends are shaping our industry, creating a substantial opportunity for U.S. and other market participants to capitalize on these trends. These trends include:

• | Convergence with UC/collaboration and CC as they are becoming less distinct technologies, and more similar with integrated services and capabilities across devices and channels. Avaya already has more than 10,000 customers that range in size from 10 seats to 250,000 seats on a converged UC and CC platform, and we are in a position of strength to lead in bringing customers the power of this convergence.

• | Increasing remote workers and workforce mobility, with greater use of mobile devices by consumers and employees. This is happening as business leaders also shift priorities to digitally transform their companies, taking advantage of disruptive technologies like cloud-based solutions and delivery models, big data, IoT, cybersecurity and AI.


• | Increased preference for cloud delivery of applications, and management of multiple and varied devices, all of which must be handled with the security their business demands.


• | Omnichannel communication customer service continue to rise and become an increasingly critical element in contact center solutions, as consumers embrace new technologies and devices in creative ways and at an accelerating pace.


• | Increased adoption of AI is providing alternative methods for service components for both UC and CC. The market is adopting model-based implementation of AI communication services at an accelerated pace. This can potentially lower adoption cost, increase effectiveness and offer expanded alternatives for functions with traditional methods for rendered services.

 Our Market Opportunity
We believe that the aforementioned trends create significant market opportunity for employee, customer, developer and analytics engagement solutions. The limitations of traditional collaboration products and services and capital-intensive buying models present an opportunity for differentiated vendors to gain market share. We believe that the total available market for these solutions includes spending on UC and CC applications, as well as spending on one-time and recurring professional, enterprise cloud and managed services, and support services to implement, maintain and manage these solutions. We are expanding our business in several of these areas, such as enterprise cloud and managed services, and other growing markets that we serve, including large enterprises with more than 2,000 employees, as well as midmarket enterprises having between 250 and 1,000 agents for CC and between 1,000 and 5,000 employees for UC.
The growth opportunity in these markets comes from the need for enterprises to increase productivity and upgrade their UC strategy to a more integrated approach, to account for mobility, varied devices and multiple communications channels. In response to this need, we expect that aggregate total spending on UC, CC, developer engagement, analytics, support services, enterprise cloud and managed services and professional services to grow.
Furthermore, the midmarket is a growing opportunity for our solutions. We believe the market opportunity for the portion of the midmarket segment which we serve is growing and is currently underserved. We have a set of offerings that are specifically designed to address the needs of midmarket businesses and to simplify processes and streamline information exchange within companies. Our set of offerings provides midmarket companies the opportunity to deliver a collaboration experience that integrates voice, video and mobile device communications at price points that deliver favorable returns on their investment.
Although we have traditionally sold our products, services and solutions to Chief Information Officers ("CIOs"), our research finds that more and more of the buying decisions are being influenced by Chief Executive Officers ("CEOs"), Chief Marketing Officers ("CMOs") and Chief Digital Officers ("CDOs"). They are becoming more involved because digital transformation has expanded beyond the data center and IT infrastructure to encompass business operations and customer experiences. CEOs, CMOs and CDOs are recognizing growing customer and employee demand for better interactions across multiple channels, and they see an opportunity to differentiate their companies and lines of business through superior customer experience. We believe that due to the increasing importance of technology as both an internal and external facing presence of the enterprise, as well as the high stakes of data breaches, CEOs are increasingly engaged in the decision-making process. CMOs and CDOs are gaining additional budget authority as they are tasked with managing customer experience and marketing activities using modern communications technology and rich data. We believe that because of this shift in decision-making roles, customer engagement solutions need to provide businesses with better ways to engage with end users securely across multiple platforms and channels, creating better customer experiences and thus higher revenues for the business.

In our experience, decision makers have three critical priorities:

1) | Manage the reliable and secure integration of an increasing number and variety of devices and endpoints: Today, business users not only use desk-based devices, but also laptops, smartphones and tablets. Gartner reports for September 2019 forecast that these devices are growing at a compound annual growth rate of 1.9% for smartphones, and (2.2)% for tablets (traditional) worldwide from 2019 through 2023(1). To communicate seamlessly and securely across devices, applications and endpoints must be managed as part of an integrated communications infrastructure.


2) | Leverage existing technology infrastructure while positioning for the future: The speed at which new enterprise technology enters the market is challenging companies to rapidly adopt and install new technology. We believe this pressure creates strong demand for systems that do not require enterprise-wide overhauls of existing technology. Instead, it favors incremental, flexible, extensible technologies that are easy to adopt and compatible with existing infrastructures.


3) | Shift to cloud-based applications: Companies today seek technology that helps them lower Total Cost of Ownership ("TCO") and increase deployment speed and application agility, including a variety of public, private and hybrid cloud solutions. They also seek to shift away from a complex, proprietary capital-intensive model to one that is more open and efficient.

Our Answer
Mobility and AI
We are pursuing advances in mobility and AI as part of our disruptive innovation strategy. Given their growing importance in contact centers and in the broader communications area, we believe that by taking a leadership position in mobility and AI, and generating new revenue streams with each, we can enhance our overall competitiveness while protecting the market for our current core products.
Both mobility and AI are sizeable opportunities for Avaya, with the potential to expand Avaya’s Total Addressable Market ("TAM"). We are already generating revenue from AI, and we are embracing a few core principles as we pursue these innovations:

• | Disrupt - the more an innovation invalidates the status quo, the better;


• | Reduce adoption friction - make the innovation straightforward to select and deploy, embrace the multi-vendor marketplace; and


• | Partner intelligently - leverage provocative partner intellectual property and thought leadership to speed market introduction, presenting Avaya as the industry platform.

A Mobile Environment
The increase in mobile technology has created a world more focused on real-time, flexible and always-on communication. We see companies increasingly looking for ways to make corporate applications and customer information and interactions more accessible via mobile devices as the usage of those devices continues to rise worldwide.
To support the Avaya Mobile Experience, Avaya became a licensed mobile network operator in the U.S. This provides Avaya the ability to obtain control of toll-free numbers and treat them as part of the mobile network, bypassing the legacy fixed last mile and reducing cost. We estimate toll-free numbers to represent a $2 billion expense in the U.S. today and there is an opportunity for significant cost reduction for Avaya Mobile Experience customers.
In addition, our customers can now provide mobile omnichannel experiences directly to their mobile callers, for example, by responding to a call with an SMS or mobile web page, as well as utilizing our call deflection security capability which seamlessly converts voice calls into a digital interaction before the call connects, providing users with greater flexibility to maximize their customer experience during such interactions.
Our commercial model is simple: we charge a per-minute rate, and a per-call deflection fee if the customer is redirected to a web page, mobile application or message directly. We are building an Avaya Mobile Identity service to support mobile

applications. An advanced security framework sits underneath the service's applications identity and authentication capabilities, taking advantage of biometrics, blockchain and the latest cryptography technologies. We believe the security of this solution is a competitive advantage not easy to replicate by our competitors. With this next-generation, cloud-based, user ID and authentication solution, enterprises can encourage their customers to adopt a new method of accessing secure smartphone-based online enterprise services. This service will be accessible anywhere smartphone coverage is available. 
Use of AI
Our AI strategy is to build solutions internally and with partners to help organizations transform their customer experiences. We classify AI contact center applications in three categories:

◦ | Agent assistance and productivity;


◦ | Conversational self-service; and


◦ | Smart routing and behavioral pairing.

We have offers available today in each category and a development roadmap for the future. We deploy these solutions to drive value for our contact center customers. 
Avaya Conversational Intelligence ("ACI"), our agent assistance and productivity solution, offers and delivers a real-time speech transcription platform. Benefits include lower costs and increased productivity by reducing agent workload and driving better customer outcomes with real time guidance based on what is being said on the call. We enhance this conversational self-service via continued partnerships with Google AI and IBM Watson. Our approach allows customers to select from industry leading bots to support digital self-service and augment that self-service via select digital channels inclusive of leading social media and social messaging services.
Smart routing and behavioral pairing are offered through native integration with our partner, Afiniti, enabling a seamless deployment of enterprise behavioral pairing. These solutions help customers optimize the agent-customer assignment in order to maximize revenue, reduce churn and deliver other concrete and measurable benefits to large enterprises. We developed this product by leveraging years of experience and expertise in data modeling and do not believe there is an equivalent to this solution in the market today.
Avaya’s solutions and their features cover the spectrum of AI contact center application domains. Our platform is open, as evidenced by our AI Connect program. We integrate with IBM Watson, Google, Salesforce, Nuance and others, to complement our technology. Avaya was also selected by Intel for Intel’s AI Builders Program. Intel and Avaya engineers jointly engage at deep technical levels to improve the performance and scale of Avaya’s AI solutions, such as ACI, when deployed on Intel hardware.
Our efforts in AI solutions development have been recognized throughout the industry. Most recently, Avaya was named a winner of the 2018 Aragon Research Innovation Award for Artificial Intelligence in People-Centric Collaboration.
Communications-enabled Business Applications
Teams need to work together from any location, using their preferred applications, and are increasingly accessing these applications via the cloud. Moving in and out of applications to perform communications functions reduces productivity. Avaya helps employees obtain access to real-time information quickly and easily by integrating communication functionality directly into business applications.
Digital Engagement Hubs Replacing Call Centers
Like workforces, end users are also increasingly using mobile devices and expecting service interactions with companies across multiple communications channels and devices. Customer interactions are evolving from voice-centric, point-in-time, contact center transactions to ongoing customer conversations across multiple media and modes of communication. Customers expect businesses to know about the history of their interactions, even when they occur across a mix of self-service and agent assisted communications methods, including voice, video, email, chat, mobile, web and social media.
We aim to build on our industry leadership and grow our business by addressing these types of trends. We have and continue to invest in open communications platforms and ecosystems that serve a broad range of needs. While we remain committed to protecting and evolving the investments that customers have made in our technology and solutions, we are also responding to the emerging landscape by evolving our market and product approach in three important ways.

1) | We have invested in R&D and new technologies to develop and provide more comprehensive contact center and unified communications products and services, continuing our focus on enterprise customers while expanding the value we can provide to midmarket customers.

2) | We have evolved our product design philosophy, anticipating demand for applications that are cloud- and mobile-enabled. We design our products to be flexible, extensible, secure and reliable. This approach allows our customers to transition from traditional communications and collaboration technology to newer solutions that are more mobile, manageable and cost-effective.


3) | We have increased our focus on delivering integrated solutions including:

Unified Communications ("UC"): an integrated solution including voice and video calling, messaging, meetings, and team collaboration available through a single application on virtually any device, web browsers, huddle video room systems and multimedia phones. Our development environment enables customers and partners to create vertically oriented user experiences and integrate directly into cloud business applications.
Contact Center ("CC"): a single, integrated, digital solution which is open, context-driven, fully integrated and fully customizable through our open, easy-to-use development platform.
Services: Avaya is a leading provider of recurring support services relating to business communications products. Our worldwide services-delivery infrastructure and capabilities help customers address critical business communications needs from initial planning and design through implementation, maintenance and day-to-day operation, monitoring and troubleshooting.
Our Competitive Strengths
We believe the following competitive strengths position us to capitalize on the opportunities created by the market trends affecting our industry.
A Leading Position across our Primary Markets
We are a leader in business communications, with leading market share in worldwide contact center and unified messaging, and among the leaders in unified communications and enterprise telephony. We were recognized as a Leader in The Aragon Research Globe for Unified Communications and Collaboration in April 2019 and The Aragon Research Globe for Intelligent Contact Center reports in June 2019(1). Additionally, we believe that we are a leading provider of private cloud and managed services and that our market leadership and incumbent position within our customer base provides us with a superior opportunity to cross-sell to existing customers and position ourselves to win over new customers. Our strategic partnership with RingCentral will further enhance our cloud-based offerings with the introduction of Avaya Cloud Office.
Our Open Standards Technology Supports Multi-vendor, Multi-platform Environments
Our open, standards-based technology is designed to accommodate customers with multi-vendor environments seeking to leverage existing investments. Providing enterprises with strong integration capabilities allows them to take advantage of new collaboration and contact center technology as it is introduced. It does not limit customers to a single vendor or add to the backlog of integration work. We also continue to invest in our developer ecosystem, Avaya DevConnect, which has grown to include more than 110,000 members as of September 30, 2019. Avaya DevConnect, together with our Application Programming Interfaces ("API"), which are a set of routines, protocols and tools for building software applications and applications development environments, allow our customers to derive unique and additional value from our architecture.
Leading Service Capabilities Provide a Significant Recurring Revenue Stream
Avaya is a leading provider of recurring support services relating to business communications products. Our worldwide services-delivery infrastructure and capabilities help customers address critical business communications needs from initial planning and design through implementation, maintenance and day-to-day operation, monitoring and troubleshooting. We have more than 3,000 trained and certified professional consultants worldwide who can help customers find and implement the right communications solution.
We believe Avaya Services is well positioned for success due to our close collaboration between our R&D and service planning teams in advance of new products being released. As a pioneer of the omnichannel support experience in enterprise support, Avaya Services gives customers the option to interact with "Ava", our virtual agent, to get immediate answers online. Customers can also connect with one of our experts via web chat, web talk or web video. Avaya Services can also directly access our R&D teams when necessary to resolve customer issues. Avaya Services includes high levels of automation to on-board and manage a client's communications infrastructure, delivering faster, more effective deployments from proof of concept to production. This includes a robust communications automation platform with full event orchestration leveraging advanced AI functionality. All combined, these capabilities allow Avaya to provide quality service for Avaya products.
Avaya Services offers a broad portfolio of capabilities through our Professional Services organization, including implementation/enablement services, system optimization, innovation services, management partnership and custom applications development.

In addition, Avaya Services delivers Enterprise Cloud and Managed Services with a focus on customer performance and growth. These services can range from managing software releases, to operating customer cloud, premise or hybrid-based communication systems, to helping customers migrate to next-generation business communications environments. We believe that our deep understanding of application management supporting unified communications, contact center and video position us best to manage and operate cloud-based communications systems for our customers.
We believe our personnel are the best in the industry because they are trained and supported by the best in the industry. The high level of customer satisfaction ratings we receive for support transactions is a testament to the expertise of our people. These dedicated professionals have passion for satisfying customer needs, driving a proactive and preventive agenda to help customers maintain optimum levels of service.
Our Global Support Services and Enterprise Cloud and Managed Services are most often provided to customers through recurring contracts. Recurring contracts for Global Support Services typically have terms that range from one to five years, and contracts for Enterprise Cloud and Managed Services typically have terms that range from one to seven years. We believe our services relationships have provided us with a large recurring revenue base and significant visibility into our customers’ future collaboration needs.
Lower Total Cost of Ownership
Many vendors try to address customer demands by layering on more architectures and protocols. In the process, they frequently sacrifice simplicity, flexibility and TCO. In contrast, our products and services address these needs with less hardware and without sacrificing performance, which, when combined with our deployment methods help contribute to a lower TCO for Unified Communications and Contact Center solutions.
Our Growth Strategy 
We believe we are well-positioned to capitalize on the disruption and opportunity presented by digital transformation to create long-term sustainable value. We are investing significantly in our people and technology and have established four strategic pillars that will serve as our growth engines:

1) | Innovate in our core business solutions. As a leader in unified communications and the contact center, our extensive experience and expertise are critical factors in customers' decision-making processes. We will continue to invest in enhancing our core solution areas, delivering secure, scalable and reliable solutions that focus on simplifying and integrating the user experience.


2) | Bring emerging technologies to market. By innovating in disruptive areas such as AI and mobility, and building an ecosystem with technology partners like Afiniti and others, we will drive new opportunities for our customers.


3) | Deliver breadth and depth of cloud. Customers need a partner who can help them unlock the benefits of cloud, in a way that works for their specific needs, whether in the cloud, on-premises or a hybrid of both. Avaya is investing and building a cloud ecosystem, and delivering across all fronts with a cloud-first approach that builds on the power, reliability and security that customers have come to expect from Avaya. Our strategic partnership with RingCentral will further enhance our cloud-based offerings with the introductions of Avaya Cloud Office.


4) | Deliver high-value services. We provide world-class global services that help customers maximize the value of their investments and drive business value. We will expand offerings and capabilities in managed and professional services to meet the changing needs of our customers.

Expand our Cloud Offerings and Capabilities
In our experience, technology and business leaders are increasingly turning to cloud-based technologies and business models that allow enterprises to cut costs, increase productivity, simplify IT environments and shift, when possible, to subscription-based models. We are investing in a strategy to expand our cloud and hybrid cloud solutions and to deliver a complete portfolio of technologies across on-premises, private, public and hybrid cloud development models. We believe our strategic partnership with RingCentral under Avaya Cloud Office will allow us to further meet the market's desire for cloud-based models. 
Increase Mobility Offerings to Customers
As global workforces change and demand mobile engagement solutions, we intend to meet these demands. For example, the Avaya Aura Platform and Avaya IP Office Platform are designed to support mobility, providing dynamic access to applications and services based on need, not location. We launched the Avaya Mobile Experience, which keeps mobile calls to contact centers in a mobile network end-to-end, allowing for cost reduction, but more importantly allowing for new and enhanced end-customer experiences, as the mobile context is now available to the contact center. The Avaya Mobile Experience has now entered its commercial phase, with customer contracts signed and deployments under way.
10

Invest in Open Standards, Product Differentiation and Innovation
As potential customers look to migrate to our products and services, our open architecture can integrate with incumbent competitor systems and provide a path for gradual transition, while still achieving cost savings and improved functionality.
During fiscal 2019, we enhanced our product line with 113 new products, versions and releases. We also expect to continue to make investments in product innovation and R&D across the portfolio to create enhancements and breakthroughs. We believe this approach will encourage customers to upgrade their products with a higher degree of frequency. We also plan to continue embracing cloud computing and mobility opportunities, and to seek new ways to leverage the virtual desktop infrastructure trend to securely deliver business communications to users. Our AI strategy is to build solutions internally and with partners to help organizations transform their customer experiences. We have offers available today and a development roadmap. We are deploying these disruptive solutions to drive value for our contact center customers. 
Expand our Services Business
We are working to broaden the options for cloud-based service offerings, expand our consulting services capabilities and to upsell the installed base to our Enterprise Cloud and Managed Services offerings. We also strive to provide more options along the spectrum of our existing service offerings. We are constantly developing our tools and infrastructure to improve the service levels we provide. Our custom applications development team also currently has a backlog of customer-funded application development opportunities that we are working to monetize.
Increase our Midmarket Offerings, Capabilities and Market Share
We believe our market opportunity for the portion of the midmarket segment that Avaya serves is growing. We define the midmarket as firms with between 250 and 1,000 agents for CC and between 1,000 and 5,000 employees for UC. Not only do we believe this segment is growing, but we also believe midmarket businesses are underserved and willing to invest in IT enhancements. We intend to continue to invest in our midmarket offerings and go-to-market resources to increase market share and meet the growing demands of this segment.
Increase Sales to Existing Customers and Pursue New Customers
We believe that we have a significant opportunity to increase our sales to our existing customers by offering new solutions from our diverse product portfolio, including cloud and mobility solutions. This ability is supported by our market leadership, global scale and extensive customer interaction, including at the C-suite level, and creates a strong platform from which to drive and shape the evolution of enterprise communications. Our track record with our customers gives us credibility that we believe provides us with a competitive advantage in helping them cope with this evolution. In addition, we believe our refreshed product and services portfolio provides increased potential for acquiring new customers.
We have worked diligently to become both HIPAA and PCI DSS compliant as we believe the ability to service these two areas will significantly expand our potential customer base and total addressable market. These new certifications allow for market penetration into otherwise restrictive and difficult markets, including healthcare and pharmaceuticals.
Invest in Sales and Distribution Capabilities
Our flexible go-to-market strategy consists of both a direct sales force and indirect sales through our channel partners, allowing us to reach customers across industries and around the globe. We intend to continue investing in our channel partners and sales force to optimize their market focus, enter new vertical segments, and to provide our channel partners with training, marketing programs and technical support through our Avaya Edge program. During fiscal 2019, we more than doubled the number of signed agents, achieving a total of 495 compared to 234 agents in fiscal 2018, to expand distribution for small to midmarket customers. Under the Master Agent program, small to midmarket sales agents connect potential customers with Avaya, which then handles the rest of the transaction including contracting, provisioning, managing and billing the unified communications services for the business. The Master Agent program provides a new option that rounds out the available choices for customers, channel partners and sales agents to access Avaya’s industry-leading communications solutions.
We also leverage our sales and distribution channels to accelerate customer adoption and generate an increasing percentage of our revenue from our new high-value software products, video collaboration, midmarket offerings and user experience applications.
Expand Margins and Profitability
We have maintained our focus on profitability levels and implemented several cost-saving initiatives. These initiatives have contributed to improvements in our gross margin. We expect to pursue additional cost-reduction opportunities, which are likely to be more targeted and may include increased automation of our processes, headcount attrition, actions to address unproductive assets, real estate consolidation, sales back-office and frontline skill transformations and balancing our professional services structure. For example, in July 2017, we sold our Networking business, which had historically underperformed our other two segments in profitability. While we anticipate margin and profitability growth to increase over 
11

the long-term as a result of these cost-saving initiatives, we expect slight decreases in margin during fiscal 2020 as we invest in our new product offerings, mainly ReadyNow and ACO. 
Our Products and Solutions
Avaya provides a diverse leading-edge portfolio of products and solutions which, when combined with the robust set of offers from our partner ecosystem, create powerful solutions to address our customers' unique needs and challenges. Much of our portfolio has undergone rigorous interoperability and security testing and has been approved for acquisition by the U.S. Government.
Avaya unified communications and contact center products and solutions help organizations of all sizes improve efficiency, engagement and competitiveness. Our open and flexible solutions seamlessly integrate voice, video and data, so users can communicate and collaborate in real-time in the mode best suited to each interaction, for the best experience, every time. 
Unified Communications
We unify the communications capabilities that businesses use every day, delivering experiences that can transform organizations.
Voice and Video Calling 
Voice often remains the center of communications, as a conversation often can be the fastest and clearest way to resolve issues and build relationships. Avaya provides simple access to advanced features, all available via desk phones, the web and mobile devices. 
Many enterprises can base their communications and customer contact services on an Avaya Aura foundation. This high-performance solution features five nines reliability (99.999% uptime), is scalable up to 300,000 users and 1,000,000 devices, and is built to the customers’ specific needs. Its virtualized architecture approach allows for flexible deployment models, from operating on-site at the customer location, to running in public clouds like Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure or Google Cloud Platform. Perpetual and flexible subscription licensing models are available, and it can also be delivered as a service from Avaya.
Small to medium businesses can take advantage of the seamless voice, video and mobility capabilities that large enterprises use, but at a scale that is efficient and affordable for them. Our collaboration and communications solutions are built to simplify processes, streamline communications and adapt to changing business needs. They offer significant deployment and licensing flexibility, and additional capabilities can be added as needed. They can be deployed on-premises or through virtualized or containerized architectures in the cloud, with licensing models ranging from perpetual to subscription models.
Messaging and Employee Collaboration 
Avaya’s premier unified communications app, Avaya IXTM Workplace, provides one-stop access to all communications needs. Its "mobile-first" design provides at-a-glance visibility and one-touch access to everything that a user needs in real time, including a personal calendar and meetings, contacts, instant messages / chat and voice and video calling. Available across Windows, Mac, Android, iOS devices and WebRTC enabled browsers, a user can support multiple devices from a single extension giving one-number reach on the user’s device of choice. This enterprise-grade solution delivers reliable and secure access from virtually any device or location, including remote access without VPN connectivity.
Avaya’s unified communications capabilities also include our cloud-based team collaboration app, Avaya IXTM Collaboration. It provides users both inside and outside an organization with persistent team messaging and chat, file sharing and task assignment, along with one-touch audio and video conferencing. The Essential level, which is a standard package, is available for free, with Business and Power packages available for purchase with high-capacity and expanded features.
Meetings and Conferencing
Avaya takes rich meeting and conferencing capabilities to the desktops and mobile devices that employees use every day. Our premier solution, Avaya IXTM Meetings, integrates audio, HD video, web collaboration and streaming into a single solution that delivers the benefits of face-to-face interactions from virtually any device to improve employee engagement and team productivity, and serve customers better and faster. 
The solution enables users to meet and stay productive from nearly anywhere on their Windows, Mac, iOS or Android devices; dial in with their phones for audio conferencing; and use huddle or HD video room systems from Avaya or nearly any H.323 or SIP standards-based vendor. WebRTC technology enables meeting participants to join directly from their browser without downloading an app or plug-in, which is invaluable for guest participants.
12

Avaya IXTM Meetings is available in the cloud or on-premises and is integrated into the Avaya IXTM Workplace app for one touch access to schedule, start or join a meeting. Avaya also offers a unique hybrid deployment model where an Avaya customer with on-premises telephony can seamlessly consume their meetings capabilities from the cloud.
Application Developer Products
Along with off-the-shelf integration with popular business applications such as Salesforce, Slack and Office 365, Avaya’s unified communications platform simplifies embedding communications and collaboration capabilities into business applications, such as customer relationship management or enterprise resources planning. This platform allows customers, third parties and Avaya to create customized engagement applications and environments to meet unique needs. Customers and third parties can integrate business applications with unified communications technology and contact center capabilities including voice, video, messages and meetings. Avaya also offers a cloud-based execution and test environment for developing proof-of-concept applications.
Avaya IXTMClient SDK provides a developer-friendly set of tools that enables the building of innovative user experiences for vertical or business specific applications. Any functionality Avaya uses in its own clients and applications is available to developers through the SDK. Developers can mix and match functionality from both our unified communications and contact center solutions.
Avaya has an extensive developer program boasting over one million active developers. Avaya DevConnect enables third parties to support and extend the capabilities of Avaya solutions to address business challenges. Thousands of companies from around the world are program members, including developers, system integrators, service providers, and Avaya customers.
Communications Platform as a Service ("CPaaS") 
Avaya also has a full API enabled CPaaS platform offering voice, SMS, call recording, speech recognition, text to speech transcription, burstable SIP trunking and conferencing services as communications-enabling applications and workflows across the enterprise.
Avaya is further investing in its CPaaS platform to enable its global Aura customer base to attach cloud native applications that can be used as opposed to making additional capital investments. We believe that engagement platforms and applications developed on CPaaS will be one of the largest growth areas for Avaya in the next 12-36 months.
Contact Center
Avaya provides an integrated contact center portfolio consisting of assisted service, self-service, workforce engagement management and AI solutions that enables customers to increase operational efficiency, empower more engaged workforces to perform more effectively and improve the quality and value of customer interactions. Enterprise and midmarket customers can select the deployment option that best suits their business needs, whether on-premises, in the cloud or a hybrid of both. 
Assisted Service
Avaya provides the core integrated solutions for serving the needs of the entire customer engagement strategy across all devices and channels including mobile, web, voice, video, email, webchat, chatbot, SMS, social and fax. 
Avaya IXTM Contact Center solutions empower businesses to deliver managed, measurable and prompt responses to customer inquiries throughout the customer journey. Organizations can improve customer experiences, accelerate interactions, build brand loyalty and improve agent efficiency. 
Avaya IXTM Workspaces combines information from multiple sources, including customer profiles, buying history and interaction journeys, and makes them instantly available in a single, consolidated desktop, improving agent productivity and allowing supervisors to allocate resources to higher-value interactions.
Self-Service
Avaya's Self-Service solutions enable agents to focus their efforts on higher priority tasks by automating inbound and outbound speech, video, email and chat applications. With Avaya Self-Service solutions, contact centers can increase efficiency, have lower reliance on more expensive agent-based service and empower customers by giving them access to service when they want it, via their preferred touch point. Common uses for contact centers include automating simple, repetitive tasks, such as account status, providing proactive notifications for appointments, past due notices, service outages and connecting with customers through seamless two-way interaction via email/SMS.
Workforce Engagement Management
13

Workforce Engagement Management improves customer experience, operational performance and industry compliance. Through interaction recording, quality evaluations, customer feedback, automated scheduling and real-time and historical reports, contact centers can identify areas of excellence and improvement. 
The Avaya IXTM Workforce Engagement solution suite unifies contact recording, quality monitoring, eLearning, coaching, performance scorecards, workforce management, voice analytics, desktop and process analytics, and customer feedback within a single user interface, and centralizes administration and reporting for ease of use. Organizations can securely capture, analyze and store customer interactions that can be used to help comply with regulatory mandates such as Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard ("PCI DSS"), General Data Protection Regulation ("GDPR") and Markets in Financial Instruments Directive ("MiFID") II.
By monitoring interactions from start to finish, supervisors can evaluate agent performance across customer discussions, data entry, screen navigation and data retrieval to uncover performance shortfalls; obtain insight into customer expectations; and take steps to proactively address customer requirements quickly and effectively. Organizations can also improve agent performance with automated coaching, eLearning and scoreboard assessments to transfer knowledge and best practices.
Avaya IXTM Workforce Engagement also enables more efficient resource management by enabling supervisors to analyze historical data to forecast future transaction volume and handle times by automatically producing schedules to deploy the right agents with the appropriate skills at the right time.
Avaya Analytics helps enterprises analyze customer trends, develop benchmarks and focus service improvements leveraging real-time and historical reporting. Enterprises can take advantage of big data across their entire organization to gain actionable insights into the customer journey and team analytics.
AI Solutions
Avaya AI Solutions enable contact centers to create smarter interactions and represent a quantum leap forward compared to more traditional contact center solutions, advancing the customer experience and agent performance. Organizations can improve the customer journey through intelligent pairing, self-service, chatbots, virtual assistants and machine learning. 
Avaya AI Solutions can help organizations create more personalized customer experiences, garner deeper customer insights, drive customer loyalty, improve agent management and satisfaction, lower their TCO and increase growth, profitability and revenues. 
By intelligently pairing callers to agents, organizations can identify subtle, yet valuable, patterns of human interactions and behavior that can help transform their contact center into a revenue center. Avaya AI Solutions integrate with industry leading chatbot, Natural Language Processing ("NLP") and digital messaging aggregators. Organizations can engage with customers across social media, chat and messaging channels to provide immediate self-service, as well as deliver them to agent-based customer care with full context of the upfront automated experience.
To enhance the mobile caller experience, reduce fraud and phishing, and lower costs, Avaya and non-Avaya contact centers can use Avaya Mobile Experience. Unique in the marketplace, this patented, cloud-based, toll-free and Direct Inward Dial ("DID") service identifies mobile devices and gathers verifiable caller information that can be used to reduce call-handling times and offer tailored mobile caller experiences, such as the ability to switch from a voice to a digital interaction.

Our Services
The Company’s Services portfolio consults, enables, supports, manages, optimizes and even outsources enterprise communications products (applications and networks) to help customers achieve better business outcomes. Avaya’s portfolio of services enables customers to mitigate risk, reduce TCO and optimize communication products. Services is supported by patented design and management tools, and by network operations and technical support centers around the world.
The Company’s Services portfolio is divided into Professional Services, Global Support Services and Enterprise Cloud and Managed Services.
Professional Services
Avaya Professional Services enables our clients to work with some of the best Unified Communications and Contact Center technical talent in the industry to architect, design, implement and develop innovative communications solutions.
Our strategic and technical consulting, as well as our deployment and customization services, help customers accelerate business performance and deliver an improved customer experience. Whether deploying new products or optimizing existing capabilities, we leverage specialists globally across three core areas:

1) | Enablement Services: Provide access to expertise and resources for planning, defining and deploying Avaya products to maximize technology potential, simplify business processes, improve security and minimize risk. Avaya integrates and tests equipment, trains employees and deploys a plan to help ensure success.


2) | Optimization Services: Help drive increased value and improved business results by leveraging customers’ existing technology. Avaya's advanced solution architects analyze a communications environment in the context of customer business priorities, recommend enhancements and implement proven best practices.


3) | Innovation Services: Help identify improved methods for using communications and collaboration to increase business productivity, employee efficiency and customer service levels. Our consultative approach, deep industry experience and custom application services-from business planning to execution and product integration-create alignment with a customer’s specific business objectives.

In fiscal 2019, we expanded our focus on several key areas that are central to our going forward strategy:

1) | Customer Journey Transformation: We are engaging with our key clients in a highly consultative way to help them better leverage their communications investment. This model has led to an increase in large, complex projects for our top enterprise clients. Our extensive knowledge of our customers' journeys, leveraging reference architectures, is a cornerstone of Avaya’s growth strategy going forward.


2) | Agile Development Business: The increase in large projects has also led to increases in our agile development business. We help clients develop customized, leading-edge applications that fully integrate into their environment to solve key business problems and take advantage of opportunities.


3) | Professional Services: We have a fully integrated, global professional services team that has grown to more than 1,200 professionals today. This team provides the same high level of technical talent and tool support in all regions of the world. To further this team’s effectiveness, Avaya expects to implement a new professional automated tool in fiscal 2020. The tool will improve our ability to deliver the highest level of quality support our customers have come to expect, while increasing the efficiency of their budget. Among a wide range of benefits, the integrated tool streamlines resource assignment allowing for earlier engagement and tighter alignment with our sales group, ultimately improving near term as well as long term productivity and service levels.

Global Support Services
Global Support Services provides maintenance support across the Avaya portfolio and an ecosystem of third-party integrated solutions. We believe Avaya has the largest UC and CC client base in the world and possesses the largest set of UC and CC technical talent of any vendor, leveraging world class automation to support our clients. 
The portfolio includes: 

• | A comprehensive suite of support options both directly and through partners to proactively resolve issues and improve uptime. Global Support Services offers capabilities that include 24/7 remote support, proactive remote monitoring, sophisticated diagnostic tools, parts replacement and on-site response.


• | Our Avaya Support website quickly connects customers to advanced Avaya technicians via live chat, voice or video. The website also provides access to "Ava," an interactive virtual chat agent based on Avaya Automated Chat that

15

quickly searches our knowledge base and a wide range of "how-to" videos to answer customer support questions. Ava learns with each customer interaction and can make the decision to transition the chat to an Avaya technician, often without the customer realizing the change is taking place.
Avaya offers market-leading support, management and optimization of enterprise communications networks. We do this through patented design and management tools, and network operations and technical support centers around the world. The contracts for these services typically run three years, though they can be of both shorter and longer duration depending upon customer preferences. Custom or complex services contracts are typically five years in length.
All new support solutions are published online by our engineers, generally within 30 minutes of finding a resolution, adding value for customers by providing known solutions for potential issues rapidly. Most of our customers also benefit from Avaya EXPERT Systems, which provides real-time monitoring of diagnostic and system status. This solution proactively identifies potential issues to improve reliability, uptime and faster issue resolution.
Avaya can also manage existing infrastructure from nearly any communications vendor. Many customers leverage this model to manage existing complex environments. Customers are also provided with the option of upgrading to the latest technology through a recurring operational expense, rather than a one-time capital expenditure.
We have and will continue to make investments to improve our client support. Examples of this over the past year include:

• | Enhanced automation to enable our clients to get to the right technical expert in a quicker and more effective way, improving overall customer satisfaction.


• | Implemented a new Support Services Customer Success team, which we believe has helped enable us to more rapidly onboard and understand our clients' UC and CC strategies, issues and opportunities. We expect this investment to help our clients further view us as a trusted consultative provider that will result in increased adoption, accelerated momentum and transition to our full-service stack, including the cloud.


• | Continuing to evolve our real-time, automated evaluation of global clients' solution performance, which gives visibility across many different support criteria to enable proactive deep-dives with clients.

Enterprise Cloud and Managed Services
Enterprise Cloud and Managed Services provides a set of managed and private cloud services for enterprise clients, where Avaya runs the production operations of a client’s communications environment, either on their premise (managed services) or hosted on our data centers (private cloud). Avaya is one of the largest communications private cloud providers in the world, having been a leader in this area for the past nine years. Our offering has been based on a fully managed, dedicated set of hardware and software in our data centers or within a client’s data center. Our go-forward strategy is focused on developing a new, innovative, next-generation global virtualized private cloud offering. 
Our enterprise clients want Avaya to help lead them into next-generation cloud solutions at their specific pace and scope. They require a high level of architecture support to design a private cloud solution that effectively integrates with their key applications, offering them the ability to do Proof of Concepts ("POCs") and trials of cloud delivery models in a low-risk and effective fashion with seamless transitions to full production environments, and using financial models that reduce their TCO. In effect, customers want a near public cloud price model, with the ability to flexibly customize and integrate in a private cloud model.
Our strategy is to build a global virtualized private cloud service based on a set of "Ready Now" reference architectures. In January 2019, we introduced ReadyNow at our customer conference and began roll out in February. Along with several custom elements Avaya has standardized in a "mass custom" model, the key elements of the new offer which will include the following:

1) | A standard set of Avaya OneCloudTM ReadyNow reference architectures that enable quick and effective POC’s and trials, prior to implementing production environments for clients. The cloud platform will be based on Avaya’s industry-leading UC and CC technology that will meet the majority of enterprise client requirements, with the ability to customize.


2) | A new set of automation platforms to effectively build and deploy solutions for clients that will enable Avaya to replicate a client’s sophisticated premise-based implementations to our cloud solution in an unprecedented level of speed, accuracy and effectiveness.


3) | A client success model to help clients ramp up users on the platform and achieve defined business outcomes.


4) | A new Enterprise Communications Cloud Architect team, consisting of some of the best enterprise communications cloud technical talent in the industry, that works with clients in the architecture, design, operations and implementation of their secure virtualized private cloud environment. In addition, the Avaya team

16

will stay with the client as their top technical advisor as they move to full production in their new private cloud environment, helping them fully realize the benefit of the solution and driving adoption, growth and retention.

5) | A set of managed services offers to effectively operate the private cloud environment at a high level of availability, performance and Quality of Service ("QOS") Service Level Agreements ("SLAs"). These offerings will include full multi-vendor support of their current communications technology environment as they begin their migration to the cloud.


6) | A global network of data centers running the same virtualized private cloud architectures, all run with the same industry-leading set of automation, workflow and team.

The Avaya customer set provides an excellent opportunity for growth. We have the relationships and knowledge to become our existing customers cloud communications provider. Our partners' accounts are also an excellent opportunity for growth, with Avaya providing the cloud capability and the partner developing the opportunity to increase recurring revenue with their client set.

Our CCaaS and our UCaaS solutions help teams connect, call, meet and collaborate with others using both Avaya and third-party platforms devices or systems from most locations. 
Cloud Enablement Products
On May 20, 2019, the Company made a $10 million investment in a UCaaS provider enabling compliance with Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program ("FedRAMP") security requirements. This strategic investment allows Avaya to offer a cloud-based Voice over Internet Protocol infrastructure service via a FedRAMP authorized hosting platform and reinforces our determination to provide industry leading products in the cloud space to an even broader customer base, especially in the restrictive government space.
UCaaS, CCaaS, CPaaS and Converged Platform: The UCaaS, CCaaS and CPaaS services are cloud delivered services that use multi-tenant control technology and containerized communications platforms to extend Avaya’s industry leading contact center, unified communications and disruptive products to the cloud, allowing Avaya-hosted and third parties to make them available as a service. Converged Platform offers our customers a fully enabled turnkey solution with complete Avaya hardware and software for those seeking a rapid solution deployment or who prefer a fully configured and engineered solution from Avaya.
Avaya Powered by IXTM is a partner-hosted cloud solution that offers the complete capabilities of Avaya IP Office, Avaya IP Office Contact Center and Avaya Contact Center Select software. Hosted in the partner’s datacenter, it leverages Avaya’s unique hybrid cloud solutions for seamless integration and migration between a customer’s premises-based solution and cloud-delivered services.
Avaya IXTM Meetings is a cloud service, sold by our partners but hosted by Avaya, where customers can purchase virtual HD video meeting rooms in the cloud for a monthly fee or through an annual contract. Users can connect with Windows, MacOS, iOS and Android devices and through WebRTC enabled browsers, along with video conferencing room systems.
Research and Development ("R&D")
We make substantial investments in R&D to develop new systems, solutions and software in support of business communications, including, but not limited to, converged communications systems, communications applications, multimedia contact center innovations, collaboration tools, messaging applications, video, speech-enabled applications, business 
17

infrastructure and architecture, converged mobility systems, cloud offerings, web services, artificial intelligence, communications-enabled business processes and applications, and services for our customers. Over the past three fiscal years, we have invested $800 million in R&D, including technology acquisitions.
We invested 16.7%, 16.9%, and 15.7% in R&D as a percentage of product revenue in fiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. These investments reflect a consistent investment in R&D as a percentage of product revenue. Our investments in fiscal 2019 focused on driving innovative cloud solutions across our portfolio, new AI and mobile capabilities, and new releases of our UC and CC solutions. 
Patents, Trademarks and Other Intellectual Property
We own a significant number of patents important to our business and we expect to continue to file patent applications to protect our R&D investments in new products and services across all areas of our business. As of September 30, 2019, we had more than 4,500 patents and pending patent applications, including foreign counterpart patents and foreign applications. Our patents and pending patent applications cover a wide range of products and services involving a variety of technologies, including, but not limited to, unified communications (including video, social media, telephony and messaging), contact centers, wireless communications and networking. The durations of our patents are determined by the laws of the country of issuance. For the U.S., patents may be 20 years from the date of the patent's filing, depending upon term adjustments made by the patent office. In addition, we hold numerous trademarks, in the U.S. and in other countries. We also have licenses to intellectual property for the manufacture, use and sale of our products.
We obtain patent and other intellectual property rights used in connection with our business when practicable and appropriate. Historically, we have done so both organically, through commercial relationships, and in connection with acquisitions.
We look to maximize the return on investment in our patent portfolio by selectively selling patents at market prices and cross licensing with other parties when such sales or licensing is in our interests. These monetization programs are conducted in a manner that helps to preserve Avaya’s freedom to operate and to help ensure that Avaya retains patents needed for defensive use.
From time to time, assertions of infringement of certain patents or other intellectual property rights of others have been made against us. In addition, certain pending claims are in various stages of litigation. Based on our experience and customary industry practice, we believe that any licenses or other rights that might be necessary for us to continue with our current business could be obtained on commercially reasonable terms. For more information concerning the risks related to patents, trademarks and other intellectual property, see Item 1A, "Risk Factors-Risks Related to Our Business-Intellectual Property and Information Security-We may be subject to litigation and infringement claims, which could cause us to incur significant expenses or prevent us from selling our products or services."
Alliances and Partnerships
Avaya has formed commercial and partnering arrangements through global alliances to expand the availability of our products and services and enhance the value derived by customers. A recent example of such a partnership is Avaya's strategic partnership with RingCentral. Global alliances are strategically oriented technical and commercial relationships with key partners. We have three primary types of global alliances: Global Service Provider alliances, Global Systems Integrator alliances and Ecosystem alliances.

1) | Global Service Provider alliances are partnering arrangements with leading telecommunications service providers, such as AT&T, for enterprise communications and collaboration. We pursue sell-to and sell-through opportunities for Avaya products and services. These alliances are integral in selling and implementing our cloud-based services. We also see them as a principal route to market for our UCaaS and CCaaS solutions.


2) | Global Systems Integrator alliances are identical in nature to our Global Service Provider alliances, except that these are forged with systems integrator partners, such as IBM, as well as key channel partners with strong professional services and systems integration capabilities, such as ConvergeOne.


3) | Ecosystem alliances are partnering arrangements by Avaya with industry leaders, including Google, IBM Nuance, Salesforce, Verint, Afiniti, Intel and other leading technology companies. These ecosystem alliances expand the already robust set of technology partnerships established through the Avaya DevConnect program with deeper, R&D-led integrations and/or expanded GTM efforts, such as the DevConnect Select Product Program or the Avaya & Friends Program for international markets.

Our channel partners serve our customers worldwide through Avaya Edge, our business partner program. Through certifications, the Avaya Edge program positions reseller partners to sell, implement and maintain our communications systems, applications and services. Avaya Edge offers clearly defined partner categories with financial, technical, sales and marketing benefits that grow with levels of certification. We support partners in the program by providing a portfolio of industry-leading products in addition to sales, marketing and technical support. Although the terms of individual channel 
18

partner agreements may deviate from our standard program terms, our standard program agreements for resellers generally provide for a term of one year, with automatic renewal for successive one-year terms. Agreements may generally be terminated by either party for convenience upon 30-days' prior notice, and our standard program agreements for distributors may generally be terminated by either party for convenience upon 90 days prior notice. Certain of our contractual agreements with our largest distributors and resellers, however, permit termination of the relationship by either party for convenience upon prior notice of 180 days. Our partner agreements generally provide for responsibilities, conduct, order and delivery, pricing and payment, and include customary indemnification, warranty and other similar provisions. The Company's largest distributor, ScanSource Inc., is also its largest customer and represented 11% of the Company's total consolidated revenue for fiscal 2019. See Item 1A, "Risk Factors-Risks Related to Our Business-Our Operations, Markets and Competition-Our strategy depends in part on our reliance on our indirect sales channel" for additional information on the Company's reliance on its indirect sales channel.
Development Partnerships
The Avaya DevConnect program is designed to promote the development, compliance-testing and co-marketing of innovative third-party products that are compatible with Avaya’s standards-based products. Member organizations have expertise in a broad range of technologies, including IP telephony, contact center and unified communications applications.
As of September 30, 2019, approximately 30,000 companies have registered with the program, including more than 300 companies operating at higher program levels, eligible for technical support and to submit their products or services for compatibility testing by the Avaya Solution Interoperability and Test Lab ("Avaya Test Lab").

Sales and Distribution
Our global go-to-market strategy is designed to focus and strengthen our reach and impact on large multinational enterprises, midmarket and regional enterprises and small businesses. Our go-to-market strategy is intended to serve our customers the way they prefer to work with us, either directly with Avaya or indirectly through our sales channel, which includes our global network of channel alliance partners, distributors, dealers, value-added resellers, telecommunications service providers and system integrators. Our sales organizations are equipped with a broad product and software portfolio, complemented with services offerings including product support, integration and other professional services, and Enterprise Cloud and Managed Services.
We continue to focus on efficient deployment of Avaya sales resources, both directly and indirectly through our channel partners, for maximum market penetration and global growth. Our investment in our sales organization includes sales process, skills and solutions curricula for all roles within our sales organization.
Manufacturing and Suppliers
We have outsourced substantially all of our manufacturing operations to several contract manufacturers. Our contract manufacturers produce the vast majority of our products in facilities located in southern China, with other products manufactured in facilities located in Mexico, Taiwan, Germany, Ireland and the U.S. All manufacturing of our products is performed in accordance with detailed specifications and product designs, furnished or approved by Avaya, and is subject to rigorous quality control standards. We periodically review our product manufacturing operations and consider changes we believe may be necessary or appropriate. We also purchase certain hardware components and license certain software components from third-party Original Equipment manufacturers ("OEMs"), which we then resell separately or as part of our products under the Avaya brand.
In some cases, certain components are available only from a single source or from a limited number of suppliers. Delays or shortages associated with these components could cause significant disruption to our operations, although we have not yet had any such event have a material impact on us. We have also outsourced substantially all our warehousing and distribution logistics operations to several providers of such services on a global basis, and any delays or material changes in such services could cause significant disruption to our operations, although many alternative suppliers are active in the market today.

more information on risks related to products, components and logistics, see Item 1A, "Risk Factors-Risks Related to Our Business-Our Operations, Markets and Competition-We rely on third-party contract manufacturers, component suppliers and partners (some of which are sole source and limited source suppliers) and warehousing and distribution logistics providers. If these relationships are disrupted and we are unable to obtain substitute manufacturers, suppliers or partners, on favorable terms or at all, our business, operating results and financial condition may be harmed."
The Company has not experienced any material impacts from the tariffs levied by the U.S. Government on goods manufactured in China and sold into U.S. markets.
Competition
Although we believe we are differentiated from any single competitor, the following represent the Company's primary competitors in various lines of our business:

• | Enterprise UC: Cisco, Microsoft, NEC, Unify, Alcatel-Lucent Enterprise and Huawei.


• | Midmarket UC: Mitel, NEC, Cisco and Microsoft.


• | Cloud Products and Services: Cisco, Microsoft, RingCentral, 8x8, Mitel, Google, LogMeIn, Fuze and Twilio.


• | Video Products and Solutions: Cisco, Microsoft, Zoom, LogMeIn, Google, Poly, Huawei, ZTE, BlueJeans and LifeSize.


• | Enterprise Contact Center Products and Services: Genesys, Cisco, Aspect Software, Huawei, Enghouse Interactive and Mitel.


• | Midmarket Contact Center Products and Services: Genesys, Cisco, Five9, NICE InContact, Amazon and Vonage.

We also face competition in certain geographies with companies that have a particular strength and focus in these regions, such as Huawei and ZTE in China, Intelbras in Latin America and Matsushita Electric in Asia.
While we believe our global, in-house end-to-end services organization as well as our indirect channel provide us with a competitive advantage, we face competition from companies offering products and services directly or indirectly through their channel partners, as well as resellers, consulting and systems integration firms and network service providers.
For more information on risks related to our competition, see Item 1A, "Risk Factors-Risks Related to Our Business-Our Operations, Markets and Competition-We face formidable competition from providers of unified communications and contact center solutions and services, including cloud-based solutions, and this competition may negatively impact our business and limit our growth."
Employees
As of September 30, 2019, we had approximately 7,900 employees, of whom approximately 2,800 were located in the U.S. and approximately 5,100 were located outside the U.S. Approximately 7,500 were non-represented employees and approximately 350 were represented employees covered by collective bargaining agreements. Of the approximately 350 full-time employees covered by collective bargaining agreements, approximately 328 were in the U.S. and the rest were located outside the U.S. We’ve attracted new talent and strengthened our management team. We’ve assembled a new senior management team who are action-oriented, have a disruptive mindset and the willingness to move the business forward to achieve our objectives. 
Environmental, Health and Safety Matters
We are subject to a wide range of governmental requirements relating to safety, health and environmental protection, including:

• | certain provisions of environmental laws governing the cleanup of soil and groundwater contamination;


• | various local, federal and international laws and regulations regarding the material content and electrical design of our products that require us to be financially responsible for the collection, treatment, recycling and disposal of those products; and


• | various employee safety and health regulations that are imposed in various countries within which we operate.

We are currently involved in a few remediations at currently or formerly owned or leased sites, which we do not believe will have a material impact on our business or results of operations. See Item 1A, "Risk Factors-Risks Related to Our Business-Global Operations and Regulations-We may be adversely affected by environmental, health and safety laws, regulations, costs and other liabilities" for a discussion of the potential impact such governmental requirements and climate change risks may have on our business.
