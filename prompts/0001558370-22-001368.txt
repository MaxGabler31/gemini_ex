Item 1.    Business 
Our Company
We are a gastrointestinal, or GI, healthcare company dedicated to advancing the treatment of GI diseases and redefining the standard of care for GI patients. We are focused on the development and commercialization of innovative GI product opportunities in areas of significant unmet need, leveraging our demonstrated expertise and capabilities in GI diseases. 
LINZESS® (linaclotide), our commercial product, is the first product approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration, or U.S. FDA, in a class of GI medicines called guanylate cyclase type C agonists, or GC-C agonists, and is indicated for adult men and women suffering from irritable bowel syndrome with constipation, or IBS-C, or chronic idiopathic constipation, or CIC. LINZESS is available to adult men and women suffering from IBS-C or CIC in the United States, or the U.S., and Mexico, IBS-C or chronic constipation in Japan, and IBS-C in China. Linaclotide is available under the trademarked name CONSTELLA® to adult men and women suffering from IBS-C or CIC in Canada, and to adult men and women suffering from IBS-C in certain European countries. 
We have strategic partnerships with leading pharmaceutical companies to support the development and commercialization of linaclotide throughout the world, including with AbbVie Inc. (together with its affiliates), or AbbVie, in the U.S. and all countries worldwide other than China (including Hong Kong and Macau) and Japan, AstraZeneca AB (together with its affiliates), or AstraZeneca, in China (including Hong Kong and Macau) and Astellas Pharma Inc., or Astellas, in Japan. We also aim to leverage our leading development and commercialization capabilities in GI to bring additional treatment options to GI patients; for example, in November 2021, we entered into a collaboration and license option agreement, or the COUR Collaboration Agreement, with COUR Pharmaceutical Development Company, Inc., or COUR, that grants us an option to acquire an exclusive license, or the License, to research, develop, manufacture and commercialize, in the U.S., products containing CNP-104, a tolerizing immune modifying nanoparticle for the treatment of primary biliary cholangitis, or PBC.
In 2021, we evolved our GI-focused strategy, building on our commercial success and GI development capabilities to focus on three core priorities: maximize LINZESS, strengthen our innovative GI pipeline, and deliver sustained profits and generate cash flow.
We were incorporated in Delaware on January 5, 1998 as Microbia, Inc. On April 7, 2008, we changed our name to Ironwood Pharmaceuticals, Inc. To date, we have dedicated a majority of our activities to the research, development and commercialization of linaclotide, as well as to the research and development of our other product candidates.
Performance Against 2021 Core Priorities

1. | Maximize LINZESS
---+-----------------


● | We recognized $400.4 million in collaborative arrangements revenue related to sales of LINZESS in the U.S. during the year ended December 31, 2021, a 9% increase compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. This increase was primarily driven by an increase in LINZESS prescription demand in the U.S. in 2021 compared to 2020.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | In May 2021, we and AbbVie entered into a settlement agreement with a generic drug manufacturer, Teva Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc., or Teva. Pursuant to the terms of the settlement, we and AbbVie will grant Teva a license to market a generic version of 72 mcg LINZESS beginning March 31, 2029 (subject to U.S. FDA approval), unless certain limited circumstances, customary for settlement agreements of this nature, occur. With this settlement agreement, we and AbbVie have settled with the filers of all known ANDAs to date seeking approval to market generic versions of LINZESS.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | In August 2021, the U.S. FDA approved a revised label for LINZESS based on clinical safety data that had been generated thus far in pediatric studies. The updated label modified the boxed warning for risk of

serious dehydration and contraindication against use in children to those less than two years of age. The boxed warning and contraindication previously applied to all children less than 18 years of age and less than six years of age, respectively. The safety and effectiveness of LINZESS in patients less than 18 years of age have not been established. Clinical pediatric programs in IBS-C and functional constipation are ongoing.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


2. | Strengthen Innovative GI Pipeline
---+----------------------------------


● | In November 2021, we entered into the COUR Collaboration Agreement with COUR, a biotechnology company developing novel immune-modifying nanoparticles to treat autoimmune diseases. The COUR Collaboration Agreement grants us an option to acquire an exclusive license to research, develop, manufacture and commercialize, in the U.S., products containing CNP-104, a potential treatment for PBC, a rare autoimmune disease targeting the liver that affects an estimated 133,000 people in the U.S. COUR has initiated a clinical study, or the Initial Study, evaluating the safety, tolerability, and pharmacodynamic effects and efficacy of CNP-104 in PBC patients. In December 2021, the U.S. FDA granted Fast Track Designation to CNP-104.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

● | We are advancing IW-3300, a GC-C agonist, for the potential treatment of visceral pain conditions, such as interstitial cystitis / bladder pain syndrome, or IC/BPS, and endometriosis. IC/BPS affects an estimated 4 to 12 million Americans, according to the Interstitial Cystitis Association. An estimated 4 million reproductive-age women in the U.S. have been diagnosed with endometriosis, according to a study published in Gynecologic and Obstetric Investigation. Both diseases have a limited number of treatment options available. In December 2021, the U.S. FDA accepted our Investigational New Drug Application, or IND, and the Phase I clinical program has commenced in the first quarter of 2022 to evaluate the safety and tolerability of IW-3300 in healthy volunteers.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


3. | Deliver Sustained Profits and Generate Cash Flow
---+-------------------------------------------------


● | Delivered net income of $528.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2021, reflecting our third consecutive full year of profitability.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | We generated $261.9 million in cash from operations during the year ended December 31, 2021, ending the year with $620.1 million in cash and cash equivalents.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on our Business
There continue to be significant uncertainties surrounding the extent and duration of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business and operations and the COVID-19 pandemic may have a material adverse impact on our business and financial condition in the future. We took important actions in 2021 designed to mitigate the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business. We continue to evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operating results and financial condition. The impact of COVID-19 on our business and financial condition is more fully described below in Part II, Item 7: Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of —Trends and Uncertainties.
GI Programs – IBS-C and CIC
IBS-C and CIC are chronic, functional GI disorders that afflict millions of sufferers worldwide. As many as 11.5 million adults suffer from IBS-C and as many as 28.5 million adults suffer from CIC in the U.S., according to the Lieberman GI Patient Landscape Survey performed in 2010, or the Lieberman Survey. Symptoms of IBS-C include abdominal pain, discomfort and/or bloating and constipation symptoms (e.g., incomplete evacuation, infrequent bowel movements, hard/lumpy stools), while CIC is primarily characterized by constipation symptoms. Greater than 65% of IBS-C patients suffer from bloating and/or discomfort at least one time per week, according to the Lieberman Survey. 
Linaclotide—U.S. In August 2012, the U.S. FDA approved LINZESS as a once-daily treatment for adult men and women suffering from IBS-C (290 mcg dose) or CIC (145 mcg dose). We and AbbVie began commercializing 

6




LINZESS in the U.S. in December 2012. In January 2017, the U.S. FDA approved a 72 mcg dose of linaclotide for the treatment of adult men and women with CIC.
 We and AbbVie continue to explore ways to enhance the clinical profile of linaclotide by studying linaclotide in additional indications, populations, and formulations to assess its potential to treat various conditions. In September 2020, based on Phase IIIb data demonstrating the efficacy and safety of LINZESS 290 mcg on the overall abdominal symptoms of bloating, pain and discomfort, in adult patients with IBS-C, the U.S. FDA approved our Supplemental New Drug Application to include a more comprehensive description of the effects of LINZESS in its approved label. 
​
We and AbbVie have established a nonclinical and clinical post-marketing plan with the U.S. FDA to understand the safety and efficacy of LINZESS in pediatric patients. In August 2021, the U.S. FDA approved a revised label for LINZESS based on clinical safety data that had been generated thus far in pediatric studies. The updated label modified the boxed warning for risk of serious dehydration and contraindication against use in children to those less than two years of age. The boxed warning and contraindication previously applied to all children less than 18 years of age and less than 6 years of age, respectively. The safety and effectiveness of LINZESS in patients less than 18 years of age have not been established. Clinical pediatric programs in IBS-C and functional constipation are ongoing.
Linaclotide—Global. AbbVie has rights to develop and commercialize linaclotide in all countries worldwide other than China (including Hong Kong and Macau) and Japan. In November 2012, the European Commission granted marketing authorization to CONSTELLA for the symptomatic treatment of moderate to severe IBS-C in adults. CONSTELLA is the first, and to date, only drug approved in the European Union, or E.U., for IBS-C. CONSTELLA first became commercially available in certain European countries beginning in the second quarter of 2013. AbbVie is commercializing CONSTELLA in a number of European countries, including the United Kingdom, Italy and Spain. 
In December 2013 and February 2014, linaclotide was approved in Canada and Mexico, respectively, as a treatment for adult men and women suffering from IBS-C or CIC. AbbVie has exclusive rights to commercialize linaclotide in Canada as CONSTELLA and in Mexico as LINZESS. In May 2014, CONSTELLA became commercially available in Canada and in June 2014, LINZESS became commercially available in Mexico. 
Astellas has rights to develop, manufacture and commercialize linaclotide in Japan. In December 2016, the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare approved LINZESS for the treatment of adults with IBS-C in Japan. In March 2017, Astellas began commercializing LINZESS for the treatment of adults with IBS-C in Japan. In August 2018, the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare approved LINZESS for the treatment of adults with chronic constipation in Japan. In September 2018, Astellas began commercializing LINZESS for the treatment of adult patients with chronic constipation in Japan.
AstraZeneca has rights to develop, manufacture and commercialize linaclotide in China (including Hong Kong and Macau). In January 2019, the Chinese National Medical Products Administration approved the marketing application for LINZESS for adults with IBS-C in China. AstraZeneca began commercializing LINZESS in China in November 2019.
IW-3300
We are also advancing IW-3300, a GC-C agonist, which is in Phase I development for the potential treatment of visceral pain conditions, such as IC/BPS and endometriosis. IC/BPS affects an estimated 4 to 12 million Americans, according to the Interstitial Cystitis Association. An estimated 4 million reproductive-age women in the U.S. have diagnosed endometriosis, according to a study published in Gynecologic and Obstetric Investigation in 2017. Both diseases have a limited number of treatment options available.
CNP-104
Through the COUR Collaboration Agreement, we have an option to acquire an exclusive license from COUR to research, develop, manufacture and commercialize, in the U.S., products containing CNP-104 for the potential treatment of PBC. PBC affects an estimated 133,000 people in the U.S. Currently, there is no approved therapy that addresses the root cause of the autoimmune destruction of the bile ducts in PBC.

Collaborations and Partnerships 
As part of our GI-focused strategy, we have established development and commercial capabilities that we plan to leverage as we seek to bring multiple medicines to patients. We intend to play an active role in the development and commercialization of our products in the U.S., either independently or with partners that have strong capabilities. We also intend to establish strong global brands by out-licensing development and commercialization rights to our products in other key territories to high-performing partners. We plan to seek collaborations that increase the value of our products by providing meaningful economics and incentives for us and any potential partner. We intend to continue to expand our expertise in GI by accessing innovative externally developed products and to leverage our existing capabilities to develop and commercialize these products in the U.S.
We have pursued a partnering strategy for commercializing linaclotide that has allowed us to focus our commercialization efforts in the U.S. and enabled partners with strong global capabilities to commercialize linaclotide in territories outside of the U.S. 
The following chart shows our revenue for the U.S. and territories outside of the U.S. as a percentage of our total revenue for each of the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019. 
​

​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​
--------------+---+-------------------------+---+-------+---+-------+--
​ | ​ | Year Ended December 31, | ​
​ | | 2021 | | 2020 | | 2019 | 
U.S. | | 97.8 | % | 95.8 | % | 78.0 | %
Japan | ​ | 0.6 | % | 1.1 | % | 13.0 | %
Rest of world | | 1.6 | % | 3.1 | % | 9.0 | %
​ | | 100.0 | % | 100.0 | % | 100.0 | %

​
Revenue attributable to our linaclotide partnerships comprised substantially all of our revenue for each of the years indicated. Further, we currently derive a significant portion of our revenue from our LINZESS collaboration with AbbVie for the U.S. and believe that the revenues from this collaboration will continue to constitute a significant portion of our total revenue for the foreseeable future. Our revenue from our LINZESS collaboration with AbbVie for the U.S. is highly dependent on the responsiveness of patients to fill prescriptions and other factors such as wholesaler buying patterns. Our collaborative arrangements revenue outside of the U.S. has fluctuated for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019 based on timing of milestone and non-contingent payments. Our collaborative arrangements revenue may continue to fluctuate as a result of the timing and amount of royalties from sales of linaclotide in the markets in which it is currently approved, or any other markets where linaclotide receives approval, as well as clinical and commercial milestones received and recognized under our strategic partnerships outside of the U.S. 
Collaboration Agreement for North America with AbbVie 
In September 2007, we entered into a collaboration agreement with AbbVie to develop and commercialize linaclotide for the treatment of IBS-C, CIC and other GI conditions in North America. Under the terms of the collaboration agreement, we and AbbVie are jointly and equally funding the development and commercialization of LINZESS in the U.S., with equal share of any profits or losses. Additionally, we granted AbbVie exclusive rights to develop and commercialize linaclotide in Canada and Mexico for which we receive royalties in the mid-teens percent on net sales in those countries. AbbVie is solely responsible for the further development, regulatory approval and commercialization of linaclotide in those countries and funding any costs.
License Agreement with AbbVie (All countries other than the countries and territories of North America, China (including Hong Kong and Macau), and Japan)
In April 2009, we entered into a license agreement with Almirall, S.A., or Almirall, or the European License Agreement, to develop and commercialize linaclotide in Europe (including the Commonwealth of Independent States and Turkey) for the treatment of IBS-C, CIC and other GI conditions. In October 2015, Almirall transferred its exclusive license to develop and commercialize linaclotide in Europe to AbbVie. In January 2017, we and AbbVie entered into an amendment to the European License Agreement. The European License Agreement, as amended, extended the license to 

8




develop and commercialize linaclotide in all countries other than China (including Hong Kong and Macau), Japan, and the countries and territories of North America. We refer to the additional licensed countries as the Expanded Territory. Under the European License agreement, AbbVie is obligated to pay us (i) certain commercial milestones totaling up to $42.5 million, (ii) royalties based on sales volume in Europe, beginning in the mid-single digits percent and escalating to the upper-teens percent, and (iii) on a country-by-country and product-by-product basis in the Expanded Territory, a royalty as a percentage of net sales of products containing linaclotide as an active ingredient in the upper-single digits for five years following the first commercial sale of a linaclotide product in a country, and in the low-double digits thereafter. The royalty rate for products in the Expanded Territory will decrease, on a country-by-country basis, to the lower-single digits, or cease entirely, following the occurrence of certain events. 
License Agreement for Japan with Astellas
In November 2009, we entered into a license agreement with Astellas to develop and commercialize linaclotide for the treatment of IBS-C, CIC and other GI conditions in Japan. Pursuant to this license agreement, as amended, we were responsible for the supply of linaclotide active pharmaceutical ingredient, or API, to Astellas. On August 1, 2019, we and Astellas amended and restated the license agreement. Under the terms of the amended and restated license agreement, we are no longer responsible for the supply of linaclotide API to Astellas and Astellas is responsible for its own supply of linaclotide API in Japan. Astellas is obligated to pay royalties to us at rates beginning in the mid-single-digits percent and escalating to low-double-digits percent, based on aggregate annual net sales in Japan of products containing linaclotide API. 
Collaboration Agreement for China (including Hong Kong and Macau), with AstraZeneca
In October 2012, we entered into a collaboration agreement with AstraZeneca to co-develop and co-commercialize linaclotide in China (including Hong Kong and Macau). In September 2019, we and AstraZeneca amended and restated the collaboration agreement, under which AstraZeneca obtained the exclusive right to develop, manufacture and commercialize products containing linaclotide in the territory. Under the terms of the amended and restated agreement, we transferred all manufacturing responsibilities in China (including Hong Kong and Macau) to AstraZeneca, and we are entitled to receive non-contingent payments totaling $35.0 million in three installments through 2024, of which $10.0 million was received in January 2021. In addition, AstraZeneca may be required to make milestone payments totaling up to $90.0 million contingent on the achievement of certain sales targets and is required to pay tiered royalties to us at rates beginning in the mid-single-digits percent and increasing up to twenty percent based on the aggregate annual net sales of products containing linaclotide in the territory. 
Collaboration and License Option Agreement with COUR
In November 2021, we entered into the COUR Collaboration Agreement with COUR, pursuant to which we have been granted an option to acquire an exclusive license to research, develop, manufacture and commercialize, in the U.S., products containing CNP-104 for the treatment of PBC. COUR has commenced the Initial Study evaluating the safety, tolerability, and pharmacodynamic effects and efficacy of CNP-104 in PBC patients. In December 2021, the U.S. FDA granted Fast Track Designation to CNP-104.
​
Pursuant to the terms of the COUR Collaboration Agreement, we made an upfront, non-refundable payment of $6.0 million to COUR and we will pay COUR non-contingent payments and milestone payments totaling $13.5 million in connection with certain development activities and regulatory milestones. After reviewing the data from the Initial Study, if we exercise the option, we will pay COUR $35.0 million in exchange for the exclusive license. Additionally, we will pay royalties to COUR in the high single digits to low double digits percentage of the aggregated annual net sales in the U.S. of products containing CNP-104 and COUR will be eligible to receive commercial milestone payments of up to $440.0 million over the term of the agreement.
​
Other Agreements
Disease Education and Promotional Agreement with Alnylam
In August 2019, we and Alnylam entered into a disease education and promotional agreement, or the Alnylam Agreement, for Alnylam’s GIVLAARI for the treatment of acute hepatic porphyria. The Alnylam agreement, as 

9




amended, was terminated in June 2021 with an effective termination date of September 30, 2021. Under the Alnylam Agreement, we received service fees totaling $5.5 million for services rendered from the commencement of the agreement through December 31, 2020, and we remain eligible to receive royalties based on a percentage of net sales of GIVLAARI that are directly attributable to our promotional efforts prior to the termination of the Alnylam agreement through September 30, 2022, which is one year following the termination of the agreement.
​
Our Strategy
Our vision is to become the leading U.S. GI-focused healthcare company. To achieve this vision, we are dedicated to leveraging our development and commercial expertise to advance the treatment of GI diseases and redefine the standard of care for patients suffering from GI diseases. Our strategy is focused on three core priorities: maximize LINZESS, strengthen our innovative GI pipeline, and deliver sustained profits and generate cash flow. Key elements of our strategy include:

● | assembling a team with a singular passion and documented success in creating, developing and commercializing GI medicines that can make a significant difference in patients’ lives;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | successfully and profitably commercializing LINZESS in collaboration with AbbVie in the U.S.;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | exploring development opportunities to enhance the clinical profile of LINZESS by studying linaclotide in additional indications, populations and formulations to assess its potential to treat various conditions;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | leveraging our U.S.-focused commercial capabilities in marketing, reimbursement, patient engagement and sales to expand the commercial potential of LINZESS; collaborating with global partners who share our vision, values, culture, and processes to develop and commercialize linaclotide outside of the U.S.;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | evaluating innovative, externally developed products for in-licensing or acquisition opportunities, prioritizing assets that address serious, organic GI diseases, provide scientific innovation, sound mechanistic rational, a strong clinical safety profile, a clear development path towards commercialization and in disease areas primarily managed by gastroenterologists; and

Competition 
Linaclotide competes globally with certain branded and generic prescription therapies and over the counter, or OTC, products for the treatment of IBS-C and CIC, or their associated symptoms.
OTC laxatives make up the majority of the treatments in the U.S. for IBS-C and CIC, according to our internal research. LINZESS accounts for the majority of branded prescriptions in the U.S. for adults with IBS-C and CIC, according to 2021 data from IQVIA Inc. National Prescription Audit. 
Until the launch of LINZESS, the only available branded prescription therapy for IBS-C and CIC in the U.S. was AMITIZA® (lubiprostone), which was approved for the treatment of CIC in 2006, for the treatment of IBS-C in 2008, and for the treatment of opioid induced constipation in 2013. AMITIZA is being commercialized in the U.S. by Takeda Pharmaceuticals Limited. AMITIZA also is being commercialized for the treatment of adults with CIC in certain European countries, including the United Kingdom and Switzerland by Sucampo AG, and for the treatment of chronic constipation in Japan by Mylan N.V., an authorized generic version of AMITIZA became available in the U.S. in January 2021 and is being commercialized by Endo International plc., and we expect additional generic versions of AMITIZA may become available. TRULANCE® (plecanatide) was approved in the U.S. for the treatment of CIC in adults in January 2017 and for the treatment of IBS-C in adults in January 2018 and is being commercialized in the U.S. by Bausch Health Companies. Shire plc obtained approval of MOTEGRITY™ (prucalopride) in the U.S. for the treatment of CIC in adults in December 2018. In April 2019, US WorldMeds, LLC received approval for the reintroduction of ZELNORM™ (tegaserod) in the U.S. for the treatment of IBS-C in women under the age of 65, and in November 2021, Ardelyx, Inc., or Ardelyx, announced its plans to launch IBSRELATM (tenapanor), Ardelyx’s U.S. FDA approved treatment for IBS-C in adults, in the second quarter of 2022. ISBRELA is not currently commercially available. 
Manufacturing and Supply
It is our objective that the supply of linaclotide be safe and effective, with redundancy built into critical steps of the supply chain, and that each of our collaboration partners are in a position to manage the supply and distribution of linaclotide in their respective territories through a combination of contract manufacturers and in-house manufacturing capabilities. Linaclotide production consists of three phases—manufacture of the API (sometimes referred to as drug substance), manufacture of finished drug product and manufacture of finished goods. We and/or our partners have commercial supply agreements with multiple third-party manufacturers for the production of linaclotide API. We believe the current commercial suppliers have the capabilities to produce linaclotide API in accordance with current good manufacturing practices, or GMP, on a sufficient scale to meet the worldwide development and commercial needs for linaclotide. The commercial suppliers of linaclotide API are subject to routine inspections by regulatory agencies worldwide and also undergo periodic audit and certification by our partners’ or our own quality department. 
Each of AbbVie, Astellas and AstraZeneca is responsible for linaclotide API, finished drug product and finished goods manufacturing (including bottling and packaging) and distributing the finished goods to wholesalers in its respective territories. 
Prior to linaclotide, there was no precedent for long-term room temperature shelf storage formulation for an orally dosed peptide to be produced in millions of capsules per year. Our efforts to date have led to formulations that are both cost effective and able to meet the stability requirements for commercial pharmaceutical products.
Sales and Marketing
For the foreseeable future, we intend to develop and commercialize our drugs in the U.S. alone or with partners, and expect to rely on partners to develop and commercialize our drugs in territories outside the U.S. In executing our strategy, our goal is to retain oversight over the worldwide development and commercialization of our products by playing an active role in their commercialization or finding partners who share our vision, values, culture and processes.
To date, we have established a high-quality commercial organization dedicated to bringing innovative, highly-valued GI healthcare solutions to our customers, including patients, payors, and healthcare providers. Our GI commercial capabilities, including marketing, patient engagement and sales, are designed to support our existing product as well as potential future internally and externally developed products. 

11




We are also coordinating efforts with our linaclotide partners to launch and maintain an integrated, global linaclotide brand. By leveraging the knowledge base and expertise of our experienced commercial team and the insights of each of our linaclotide commercialization partners, we continually improve our collective marketing strategies.
Patents and Proprietary Rights
We actively seek to protect the proprietary technology that we consider important to our business, including pursuing patents that cover our products, compositions, and formulations, their methods of use and the processes for their manufacture, as well as any other relevant inventions and improvements that are commercially important to the development of our business. We also rely on trade secrets that may be important to the development of our business.
Our success will depend significantly on our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other proprietary protection for the technology, inventions and improvements we consider important to our business; defend our patents; preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets; and operate without infringing the patents and proprietary rights of third parties.
The term of individual patents depends upon the legal term of the patents in the countries in which they are obtained. In most countries in which we file, the patent term is 20 years from the date of filing the non-provisional application. We expect to apply, and have applied, for patent term extension in countries where it is available.
Linaclotide Patent Portfolio
Our linaclotide patent portfolio is currently composed of 14 patents in the U.S., including 12 U.S. patents listed in the U.S. FDA publication, Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations, or the Orange Book, seven granted European patents, most of which have been validated in available European countries, ten granted Japanese patents, five granted Chinese patents, 61 issued patents in other foreign jurisdictions, and numerous pending U.S., foreign and Patent Cooperation Treaty, or PCT, patent applications. We and our partners own, either jointly or individually, all of the issued patents and pending applications.
The issued U.S. patents, which will expire between 2024 and 2033, contain claims directed to the linaclotide molecule, pharmaceutical compositions thereof, methods of using linaclotide to treat GI disorders, processes for making the molecule, and room temperature stable formulations of linaclotide and methods of use thereof. The 72 mcg, 145 mcg and 290 mcg LINZESS doses are covered by various composition of matter patents in the U.S., the latest of which expires in 2026. In addition, the commercial formulations of the 72 mcg, 145 mcg and 290 mcg LINZESS doses are covered by patents in the U.S. that expire in the early 2030s. The granted European patents, which will expire between 2024 and 2036, some of which are subject to potential patent term extension, contain claims directed to the linaclotide molecule, pharmaceutical compositions thereof, uses of linaclotide to prepare medicaments for treating GI disorders, and room temperature stable formulations of linaclotide and their use in treating IBS-C and chronic constipation. The granted Chinese patents, which will expire between 2024 and 2032, the granted Japanese patents, which will expire between 2025 and 2036, some of which are subject to granted and potential patent term extension, and the granted patents in other foreign jurisdictions, which will expire between 2024 and 2034, some of which may be subject to potential patent term extension, contain claims directed to the linaclotide molecule, pharmaceutical compositions of linaclotide for use in treating GI disorders, and room temperature stable formulations of linaclotide.
We have pending patent applications in certain countries worldwide that, if issued, will expire between 2024 and 2040 and which include claims covering the linaclotide molecule, methods of using linaclotide to treat GI disorders, the current commercial formulations of linaclotide and uses thereof to treat GI disorders and delayed release and other potential formulations of linaclotide.
The patent term of a patent that covers an U.S. FDA approved drug is also eligible for patent term extension, which permits patent term extension as compensation for some of the patent term lost during the U.S. FDA regulatory review process. The Hatch Waxman Act permits a patent term extension of a single patent applicable to an approved drug for up to five years beyond the expiration of the patent but the extension cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval by the U.S. FDA. The United States Patent and Trademark Office has issued a Certificate of Patent Term Extension for U.S. Patent 7,304,036, which covers linaclotide and methods of use thereof. As a result, the patent term of this patent was extended to August 30, 2026, 14 years from the date of linaclotide’s approval by the U.S. FDA. Similar provisions are available in Europe and certain other foreign 

12




jurisdictions to extend the term of a patent that covers an approved drug. We have received patent term extensions in Japan for several of our linaclotide patents. We have also received patent term extensions, called supplementary protection certificates, for certain linaclotide patents from several national patent offices in Europe.
We and AbbVie received Paragraph IV certification notice letters regarding ANDAs submitted to the U.S. FDA by five generic drug manufacturers requesting approval to engage in commercial manufacture, use, sale and offer for sale of linaclotide capsules (72 mcg, 145 mcg and 290 mcg), proposed generic versions of LINZESS. All five manufacturers requested approval for their 145 mcg and 290 mcg generic doses of LINZESS and two requested additional approval for their 72 mcg generic doses of LINZESS. We and AbbVie have entered into settlement agreements with all five of these generic drug manufacturers providing for licenses to market their 72 mcg (if applicable),145 mcg and 290 mcg generic versions of LINZESS, beginning as early as March 2029 (subject to U.S. FDA Approval), unless certain limited circumstances, customary for settlement agreements of this nature, occur. 
Government Regulation
Our business is subject to government regulation in both the U.S. and in other countries. In the U.S., pharmaceutical products are subject to extensive regulation by the U.S. FDA. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and other federal and state statutes and regulations, as well as similar foreign regulations, govern, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, storage, recordkeeping, approval, labeling, promotion and marketing, distribution, post-marketing requirements and assessments, post-approval monitoring and reporting, sampling, and import and export of pharmaceutical products. The U.S. FDA and other regulatory authorities have very broad enforcement authority and failure to abide by applicable regulatory requirements can result in administrative or judicial sanctions being imposed on us, including warning letters, refusals of government contracts, clinical holds, civil penalties, injunctions, restitution, disgorgement of profits, recall or seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, withdrawal of approval, refusal to approve pending applications, and civil or criminal prosecution.
U.S. FDA Approval Process
No company may market a new drug in the U.S. until it has submitted an NDA to the U.S. FDA, and the U.S. FDA has approved it. The steps required before the U.S. FDA may approve an NDA generally include:

● | conducting nonclinical laboratory tests and animal tests in compliance with U.S. FDA’s good laboratory practice, or GLP, requirements;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | development, manufacture and testing of active pharmaceutical product and dosage forms suitable for human use in compliance with current GMP;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | conducting adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials that establish the safety and efficacy of the product for its specific intended use(s);
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | in order to evaluate a drug in humans in the U.S., an IND must be submitted and come into effect before human clinical trials may begin;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the submission to the U.S. FDA of an NDA;
--+------------------------------------------


● | satisfactory completion of one or more U.S. FDA inspections of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the product, or components thereof, are produced to assess compliance with current GMP requirements and to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the product’s identity, strength, quality and purity;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | inspections of other sources of data in the NDA, such as inspection of clinical trial sites to assess compliance with good clinical practice, or GCP, requirements are also generally required; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | U.S. FDA review and approval of the NDA.
--+-----------------------------------------

Nonclinical tests include laboratory evaluation of the product candidate, as well as animal studies to assess the potential safety and efficacy of the product candidate. The conduct of the nonclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements including GLP. We must submit the results of the nonclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data and a proposed clinical trial protocol to the U.S. FDA as part of an IND, which must become effective before we may commence human clinical trials in the U.S. The IND will automatically become effective 30 days after its receipt by the U.S. FDA, unless the U.S. FDA raises concerns or questions before that time about the conduct of the proposed trial. In such a case, we must work with the U.S. FDA to resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can proceed. We cannot be sure that submission of an IND will result in the U.S. FDA allowing clinical trials to begin, or that, once begun, issues will not arise that will cause us or the U.S. FDA to modify, suspend or terminate such trials. The study protocol and informed consent information for patients in clinical trials must also be submitted to an institutional review board, or IRB, for approval. An IRB may also require the clinical trial at the site to be halted, either temporarily or permanently, for failure to comply with the IRB requirements or if the trial has been associated with unexpected serious harm to subjects. An IRB may also impose other conditions on the trial. For studies conducted outside of the U.S., similarly, we are subject to local regulations which may differ from the U.S. and local regulations must be followed appropriately.
Clinical trials involve the administration of the product candidate to humans under the supervision of qualified investigators, generally physicians not employed by or under the trial sponsor’s control. Clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases, though the phases may overlap or be combined. In Phase I, the initial introduction of the drug into healthy human subjects, the drug is usually tested for safety (adverse effects), dosage tolerance and pharmacologic action, as well as to understand how the drug is taken up by and distributed within the body. Phase II usually involves studies in a limited patient population (individuals with the disease under study) to:

● | evaluate preliminarily the efficacy of the drug for specific, targeted conditions;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | determine dosage tolerance and appropriate dosage as well as other important information about how to design larger Phase III trials; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | identify possible adverse effects and safety risks.
--+----------------------------------------------------

Phase III trials generally further evaluate clinical efficacy and test for safety within an expanded patient population. The conduct of clinical trials is subject to extensive regulation, including compliance with GCP regulations and guidance, and regulations designed to protect the rights and safety of subjects involved in investigations.
The U.S. FDA may order the temporary or permanent discontinuation of a clinical trial at any time or impose other sanctions if it believes that the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with U.S. FDA requirements or presents an unacceptable risk to the clinical trial patients. We may also suspend clinical trials at any time on various grounds.
The results of the nonclinical and clinical studies, together with other detailed information, including the manufacture and composition of the product candidate, are submitted to the U.S. FDA in the form of an NDA requesting approval to market the drug. The U.S. FDA approval of the NDA is required before marketing of the product may begin in the U.S. If the NDA contains all pertinent information and data, the U.S. FDA will “file” the application and begin review. The review process, however, may be extended by U.S. FDA requests for additional information, nonclinical or clinical studies, clarification regarding information already provided in the submission, or submission of a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy. The U.S. FDA may refer an application to an advisory committee for review, evaluation and recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. The U.S. FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. Before approving an NDA, the U.S. FDA will typically inspect the facilities at which the product candidate is manufactured and will not approve the product candidate unless current GMP compliance is satisfactory. The U.S. FDA also typically inspects facilities responsible for performing animal testing, as well as clinical investigators who participate in clinical trials. The U.S. FDA may refuse to approve an NDA if applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied or may require additional testing or information. The U.S. FDA may also limit the indications for use and/or require post-marketing testing and surveillance to monitor the safety or efficacy of a product. Once granted, product approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or problems are identified following initial marketing.

14




The testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, and our product candidates may not be approved on a timely basis, if at all. The time and expense required to perform the clinical testing necessary to obtain U.S. FDA approval for regulated products can frequently exceed the time and expense of the research and development initially required to create the product. The results of nonclinical studies and initial clinical trials of our product candidates are not necessarily predictive of the results from large-scale clinical trials, and clinical trials may be subject to additional costs, delays or modifications due to a number of factors, including difficulty in obtaining enough patients, investigators or product candidate supply. Failure by us or our collaborators, licensors or licensees, including AbbVie, Astellas and AstraZeneca, to obtain, or any delay in obtaining, regulatory approvals or in complying with requirements could adversely affect commercialization and our ability to receive product or royalty revenues.
Hatch-Waxman Act
The Hatch-Waxman Act established abbreviated approval procedures for generic drugs. Approval to market and distribute these drugs is obtained by submitting an ANDA with the U.S. FDA. The application for a generic drug is “abbreviated” because it need not include nonclinical or clinical data to demonstrate safety and effectiveness and may instead rely on the U.S. FDA’s previous finding that the brand drug, or reference drug, is safe and effective. In order to obtain approval of an ANDA, an applicant must, among other things, establish that its product is bioequivalent to an existing approved drug and that it has the same active ingredient(s), strength, dosage form, and route of administration. A generic drug is considered bioequivalent to its reference drug if testing demonstrates that the rate and extent of absorption of the generic drug is not significantly different from the rate and extent of absorption of the reference drug when administered under similar experimental conditions.
The Hatch-Waxman Act also provides incentives by awarding, in certain circumstances, certain legal protections from generic competition. This protection comes in the form of a non-patent exclusivity period, during which the U.S. FDA may not accept, or approve, an application for a generic drug, whether the application for such drug is submitted through an ANDA or a through another form of application, known as a 505(b)(2) application.
The Hatch-Waxman Act grants five years of exclusivity when a company develops and gains NDA approval of a new chemical entity that has not been previously approved by the U.S. FDA. This exclusivity provides that the U.S. FDA may not accept an ANDA or 505(b)(2) application for five years after the date of approval of previously approved drug, or four years in the case of an ANDA or 505(b)(2) application that challenges a patent claiming the reference drug (see discussion below regarding Paragraph IV Certifications). The Hatch‑Waxman Act also provides three years of exclusivity for approved applications for drugs that are not new chemical entities, if the application contains the results of new clinical investigations (other than bioavailability studies) conducted or sponsored by the applicant that were essential to approval of the application. Examples of applications that may require new clinical investigations essential to approval and receive three-year exclusivity include applications for new indications, dosage forms (including new drug delivery systems), strengths, or conditions of use for an already approved product. This three‑year exclusivity period only protects against U.S. FDA approval of ANDAs and 505(b)(2) applications for generic drugs for the conditions of approval (for example, indication or dosage form) that required new clinical investigations that were essential to approval; it does not prohibit the U.S. FDA from accepting or approving ANDAs or 505(b)(2) NDAs for generic drugs that do not include such conditions of approval.
Paragraph IV Certifications. Under the Hatch‑Waxman Act, NDA applicants and NDA holders must provide information about certain patents claiming their drugs, or methods of use of the drug that is the subject of the NDA, for listing in the Orange Book. When an ANDA or 505(b)(2) application is submitted, it must contain one of several possible certifications regarding each of the patents listed in the Orange Book for the reference drug. A certification that a listed patent is invalid, unenforceable or will not be infringed by the sale of the proposed product is called a “Paragraph IV” certification. A certification that provides the date a listed patent will expire, but does not challenge the validity, enforceability or infringement of the patent, is called a “Paragraph III” certification. FDA can approve the ANDA or 505(b)(2) application containing the Paragraph III certification upon expiration of the patent.
Within 20 days of the acceptance by the U.S. FDA of an ANDA or 505(b)(2) application containing a Paragraph IV certification, the applicant must notify the NDA holder and patent owner that the application has been submitted, and provide the factual and legal basis for the applicant’s opinion that the patent is invalid, unenforceable, or not infringed. The NDA holder or patent holder may then initiate a patent infringement suit in response to the Paragraph IV notice. If this is done within 45 days of receiving notice of the Paragraph IV certification, a 30‑month stay of the U.S. 

15




FDA’s ability to approve the ANDA or 505(b)(2) application is triggered. The U.S. FDA may approve the proposed product before the expiration of the 30‑month stay only if a court finds the patent invalid or not infringed, and the court may shorten or lengthen the 30-month stay under certain limited circumstances.
Patent Term Extension. Under the Hatch‑Waxman Act, a portion of the patent term lost during product development and U.S. FDA review of an NDA or 505(b)(2) application is extended if approval of the application is the first permitted commercial marketing of a drug containing the active ingredient. The patent term extension period is generally one‑half the time between the effective date of the IND and the date of submission of the NDA, plus the time between the date of submission of the NDA and the date of U.S. FDA approval of the product. The maximum period of patent term extension is five years, and the patent cannot be extended to more than 14 years from the date of U.S. FDA approval of the product. Only one unexpired patent claiming the drug product, a method of using the product or a method of manufacturing the product is eligible for extension and the patent holder must apply for extension within 60 days of approval. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, in consultation with the U.S. FDA, reviews and approves the application for patent term extension.
Other Regulatory Requirements
After approval, finished drug products are subject to extensive continuing regulation by the U.S. FDA, which include company obligations to manufacture products in accordance with current GMP, maintain and provide to the U.S. FDA updated safety and efficacy information, report adverse experiences with the product, keep certain records and submit periodic reports, obtain U.S. FDA approval of certain manufacturing or labeling changes, and comply with U.S. FDA promotion and advertising requirements and restrictions. Failure to meet these obligations can result in various adverse consequences, both voluntary and U.S. FDA-imposed, including product recalls, withdrawal of approval, restrictions on marketing, and the imposition of civil fines and criminal penalties against the NDA holder. In addition, later discovery of previously unknown safety or efficacy issues may result in restrictions on the product, manufacturer or NDA holder.
We and our partners and any third-party manufacturers we or our partners engage are required to comply with applicable U.S. FDA manufacturing requirements contained in the U.S. FDA’s current GMP regulations. Current GMP regulations require, among other things, quality control and quality assurance as well as the corresponding maintenance of records and documentation. The manufacturing facilities for our products must meet current GMP requirements to the satisfaction of the U.S. FDA pursuant to a pre-approval inspection before we can use them to manufacture our products. We and any third-party manufacturers are also subject to periodic inspections of facilities by the U.S. FDA and other authorities, including procedures and operations used in the testing and manufacture of our products to assess our compliance with applicable regulations.
With respect to post-market product advertising and promotion, the U.S. FDA imposes a number of complex regulations on entities that advertise and promote pharmaceuticals, which include, among others, standards for direct-to-consumer advertising, prohibitions on promoting drugs for uses, conditions or diseases, or in patient populations that are not consistent with the drug’s approved labeling (known as “off-label use”), and principles governing industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities. Failure to comply with U.S. FDA requirements can have negative consequences, including adverse publicity, warning or untitled letters from the U.S. FDA, mandated corrective advertising or communications with doctors or patients, and civil or criminal penalties. Although physicians may prescribe legally available drugs for off-label uses, manufacturers may not market or promote such off-label uses.
Changes to some of the conditions established in an approved application, including changes in indications, labeling, or manufacturing processes or facilities, require submission and U.S. FDA approval of a new NDA or NDA supplement before the change can be implemented. An NDA supplement for a new indication typically requires clinical data similar in type and quality to the clinical data supporting the original application for the original indication, and the U.S. FDA uses similar procedures and actions in reviewing such NDA supplements as it does in reviewing NDAs.
Adverse event reporting and submission of periodic reports is required following U.S. FDA approval of an NDA. The U.S. FDA also may require post-marketing testing, known as Phase IV testing, risk evaluation and mitigation strategies, and surveillance to monitor the effects of an approved product or to place conditions on an approval that restrict the distribution or use of the product.

Outside the U.S., our and our collaborators’ abilities to market a product are contingent upon receiving marketing authorization from the appropriate regulatory authorities. The requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, marketing authorization, pricing and reimbursement vary widely from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. At present, foreign marketing authorizations are applied for at a national level, although within the E.U. registration procedures are available to companies wishing to market a product in more than one E.U. member state. We are subject to U.S. federal and foreign anti-corruption laws. Those laws include the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, which prohibits U.S. corporations and their representatives from offering, promising, authorizing, or making payments to any foreign government official, government staff member, political party or political candidate in an attempt to obtain or retain business abroad. The scope of the FCPA encompasses certain healthcare professionals in many countries. We are also subject to similar laws of other countries that have enacted anti-corruption laws and regulations.
Pricing and Reimbursement
Within the U.S., significant uncertainty exists regarding the coverage and reimbursement status of products approved by the U.S. FDA. Sales of our products depend, in part, on the extent to which our products will be covered by third-party payors, such as government health programs, commercial insurance and managed healthcare organizations. The process for determining whether a third-party payor will provide coverage for a finished drug product typically is separate from the process for setting the price of a finished drug product or for establishing the reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the finished drug product once coverage is approved. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific finished drug products on an approved list, also known as a formulary, which might not include all of the U.S. FDA-approved drugs for a particular indication. A decision by a third-party payor not to cover our products or to restrict coverage of our products could reduce utilization of our products. Moreover, a third-party payor’s decision to provide coverage for a finished drug product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development. Additionally, coverage and reimbursement for finished drug products can differ significantly from payor to payor. One third-party payor’s decision to cover a particular finished drug product or service does not ensure that other payors will also provide coverage for the medical product or service or will provide coverage at an adequate reimbursement rate. 
The containment of healthcare costs has become a priority of federal and state governments, and the prices of drugs have been a focus in this effort. Federal and state governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost-containment programs, including restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. Adoption of new or enhanced cost-containment measures could limit our net revenue and results. Third party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services and examining the medical necessity and cost effectiveness of medical products and services, in addition to their safety and efficacy. Restrictions in coverage or decreases in third-party reimbursement for our products could have a material adverse effect on our sales, results of operations and financial condition. We expect that the pharmaceutical industry will experience pricing pressures due to the increasing influence of managed care (and related implementation of managed care strategies to control utilization), additional federal and state legislative and regulatory proposals to regulate pricing of drugs, limit coverage of drugs or reduce reimbursement for drugs, and public scrutiny of drug pricing. While we cannot predict what executive, legislative and regulatory proposals will be adopted or other actions will occur, such events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and profitability. For additional information relating to pricing and reimbursement, see Item 1A, Risk Factors, elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Sales and Marketing
The marketing and sale of pharmaceutical products are subject to comprehensive governmental regulation both within and outside the U.S. 
​
Within the U.S., numerous federal, state and local authorities have jurisdiction over, or enforce laws related to, such activities, including the U.S. FDA, U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency, Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General, the U.S. Department of Justice, state Attorneys General, state departments of health and state pharmacy boards.
​
We are subject to the requirements of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and accompanying regulations that prohibit pharmaceutical companies from promoting a drug prior to approval from the U.S. FDA and from promoting an approved drug in a manner inconsistent with the approved label.
​

17




We are also subject to various federal and state laws pertaining to health care “fraud and abuse,” including anti-kickback laws and false claims laws, for activities related to sales of any of our products or product candidates that may in the future receive marketing approval. Anti-kickback laws generally prohibit persons from soliciting, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, to induce either the referral of an individual, for an item or service or the purchasing or ordering of a good or service, for which payment may be made under federal healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. Although the specific provisions of these laws vary, their scope is generally broad and there may not be regulations, guidance or court decisions that apply the laws to particular industry practices. False claims laws prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, information or claims for payment from Medicare, Medicaid, or other third-party payors that are false or fraudulent. Violations of fraud and abuse laws may be punishable by criminal or civil sanctions, including fines and civil monetary penalties, and/or exclusion from federal health care programs (including Medicare and Medicaid). 
​
Laws and regulations have been enacted by the federal government and various states to regulate the sales and marketing practices of pharmaceutical manufacturers with marketed products. The laws and regulations generally limit financial interactions between manufacturers and health care providers, require disclosure to the government and public of such interactions and/or require reporting of pricing information or marketing expenditures. Many of these laws and regulations contain ambiguous requirements or require administrative guidance for implementation.
​
Our Legacy Business
Separation
On April 1, 2019, we completed a tax-free spin off of our soluble guanylate cyclase, or sGC, business into a separate publicly traded company, Cyclerion Therapeutics, Inc., or Cyclerion. In connection with the separation of our sGC business, or the Separation, certain assets and liabilities related to the sGC business were transferred to Cyclerion, including various U.S. and foreign patents and Patent Cooperation Treaty patent applications. The Separation and related agreements are more fully described in Note 3, Cyclerion Separation, to our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
Human Capital
​
As of December 31, 2021, we had 219 employees. Of these employees, 40 were on our drug development team, 126 were on our sales and commercial team, and 53 were in general and administrative functions. We consider our employee relations to be good. 
​
Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion (EDI)
​
We believe that creating an equitable, diverse, and inclusive culture is critical to attracting, motivating and retaining the talent necessary to deliver on our mission. Approximately 49% of our employees are women, and women represent approximately 29% of our leadership team (vice president and above) and nearly 27% of our board of directors (including our board and audit chairs). Additionally, approximately 19% of our employees are racially or ethnically diverse and, in 2021, approximately 24% of our new hires were racially or ethnically diverse. Our equity, diversity and inclusion principles are also reflected in our employee training and policies.
In 2021, we continued to advance our equity, diversity, and inclusion, or EDI, initiatives with strong advocacy by our leadership team and board of directors. In 2021, we incorporated into our corporate goals an EDI scorecard reflecting numerous metrics and deliverables. Over the course of the year we achieved our target level of performance on these EDI metrics. We strove to ensure that our candidate pools included diverse candidates and, as a result, both of the executive officers hired in 2021 represent diverse populations. For 2022, we are committed to furthering our EDI efforts consistent with our long-term EDI strategy adopted in 2020. Our board of directors has approved a specific corporate goal for 2022 aimed at fostering an environment where employees feel included and empowered. Current EDI initiatives include empowering our employee resource groups, such as W@IRWD (Women at Ironwood) and ISTAR (Ironwood Stands Together Against Racism), introducing new learning and development opportunities, strengthening our talent acquisition strategies, supporting equality programs in our local communities and delivering on metrics for retention, career advancement, and employee survey feedback from diverse populations.

Compensation and Benefits
All our employees receive equity and are encouraged to think and act as owners of Ironwood. We strive to provide pay, benefits, and services that are competitive to market and to create incentives to attract, motivate and retain our employees. We are focused on pay equity and regularly monitor our pay practices among similar roles and responsibilities throughout our organization. 
Communication and Engagement
​
We strongly believe that our success depends on employees understanding how their work contributes to our ability to execute on our vision, mission and strategy. Communication and engagement have been especially critical in light of challenges brought on by macro events such as the COVID-19 pandemic, the competition for talent in the biopharmaceutical industry and employees’ higher expectations on engagement by their employers. To this end, we utilize a variety of channels to facilitate open and direct communication, including frequent town hall meetings, Ironwood intranet, CEO blog, leadership engagement opportunities, regular communications regarding business updates, and employee engagement surveys.
Health, Wellness and Safety in the Face of the COVID-19 Pandemic
​
The health and safety of all our employees is a top priority for us. We have augmented certain healthcare, childcare and leave benefits in an effort to support our employees and their families in the face of the unique challenges brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic. We maintain a working group focused on creating and keeping employees well informed about the company’s latest plans and guidance around COVID-19. We also provided personal protective equipment, at-home COVID-19 test kits and safety trainings for field-based employees, a home supply stipend to create home office space, reallocated commuter benefits for home office use, extended additional wellness benefits including backup childcare, and provided our employees with resilience training, among other efforts.
