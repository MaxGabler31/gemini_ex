 Item 1.  Business.
 (a)General Development of Business
 Spin-Off of Liberty Broadband from Liberty Media Corporation
 During May 2014, the board of directors of Liberty Media Corporation and its subsidiaries (“Liberty”) authorized management to pursue a plan to spin-off to its stockholders common stock of a wholly-owned subsidiary, Liberty Broadband Corporation (“Liberty Broadband”), and to distribute subscription rights to acquire shares of Liberty Broadband’s common stock (the “Broadband Spin-Off”). Liberty Broadband was formed in 2014 as a Delaware corporation. At the time of the Broadband Spin-Off, Liberty Broadband was comprised of, (i) Liberty’s former interest in Charter Communications, Inc. (“Legacy Charter”), (ii) Liberty’s former wholly-owned subsidiary TruePosition, Inc. (“TruePosition”), (iii) Liberty’s former minority equity investment in Time Warner Cable, Inc. (“Time Warner Cable”, “TWC”, “Legacy Time Warner Cable” or “Legacy TWC”), (iv) certain deferred tax liabilities, as well as liabilities related to the Time Warner Cable written call options and (v) initial indebtedness, pursuant to margin loans entered into prior to the completion of the Broadband Spin-Off. The Broadband Spin-Off was accounted for at historical cost due to the pro rata nature of the distribution to holders of Liberty common stock. 
 In the Broadband Spin-Off, record holders of Liberty’s former Series A, Series B and Series C common stock received one-fourth of a share of the corresponding series of Liberty Broadband common stock for each share of Liberty common stock held by them, with cash paid in lieu of fractional shares. In addition, following the completion of the Broadband Spin-Off, on December 10, 2014, Liberty Broadband stockholders received a subscription right to acquire one share of Liberty Broadband Series C common stock for every five shares of Liberty Broadband common stock they held at a per share subscription price of $40.36, which was a 20% discount to the 20-trading day volume weighted average trading price of the Liberty Broadband Series C common stock following the completion of the Broadband Spin-Off. The rights offering was fully subscribed on January 9, 2015, with 17,277,224 shares of Series C common stock issued to those rightsholders exercising basic and, as applicable, oversubscription privileges. The subscription rights were issued to raise capital for general corporate purposes of Liberty Broadband. The Broadband Spin-Off and rights offering were intended to be tax-free to stockholders of Liberty and Liberty Broadband, respectively. During September 2015, Liberty entered into a closing agreement with the IRS which provided that the Broadband Spin-Off qualified for tax-free treatment. 
 Following the Broadband Spin-Off, Liberty and Liberty Broadband operate as separate, publicly traded companies, and neither has any stock ownership, beneficial or otherwise, in the other. In connection with the Broadband Spin-Off, Liberty and Liberty Broadband entered into certain agreements in order to govern certain of the ongoing relationships between the two companies after the Broadband Spin-Off and to provide for an orderly transition. These agreements include a reorganization agreement, a services agreement, a facilities sharing agreement and a tax sharing agreement.
 The reorganization agreement provides for, among other things, the principal corporate transactions (including the internal restructuring) required to effect the Broadband Spin-Off, certain conditions to the Broadband Spin-Off and provisions governing the relationship between Liberty Broadband and Liberty with respect to and resulting from the Broadband Spin-Off. The tax sharing agreement provides for the allocation and indemnification of tax liabilities and benefits between Liberty and Liberty Broadband and other agreements related to tax matters. Pursuant to the tax sharing agreement, Liberty Broadband has agreed to indemnify Liberty, subject to certain limited exceptions, for losses and taxes resulting from the Broadband Spin-Off to the extent such losses or taxes result primarily from, individually or in the aggregate, the breach of certain restrictive covenants made by Liberty Broadband (applicable to actions or failures to act by Liberty Broadband and its subsidiaries following the completion of the Broadband Spin-Off). Pursuant to the services agreement, Liberty provides Liberty Broadband with general and administrative services including legal, tax, accounting, treasury and investor relations support. Under the facilities sharing agreement, Liberty Broadband shares office space with Liberty and related amenities at Liberty’s corporate headquarters. Liberty Broadband will reimburse Liberty for direct, out-of-pocket expenses incurred by Liberty in providing these services and for costs that will be negotiated semi-annually.

 Charter’s Time Warner Cable Merger and Bright House Transaction 
 On May 18, 2016, Time Warner Cable merged with Legacy Charter (the “Time Warner Cable Merger”). In connection with the Time Warner Cable Merger, Legacy Charter underwent a corporate reorganization, resulting in CCH I, LLC, a former subsidiary of Legacy Charter (“Charter”), becoming the new publicly traded parent company. Also on May 18, 2016, the previously announced acquisition of Bright House Networks, LLC (“Bright House” or “Legacy Bright House”) from Advance/Newhouse Partnership (“A/N”) by Charter (the “Bright House Transaction”) was completed. In connection with the Time Warner Cable Merger and Bright House Transaction, Liberty Broadband entered into certain agreements with Legacy Charter, Charter, Liberty Interactive Corporation (“Liberty Interactive”) and Time Warner Cable. In connection with the Time Warner Cable Merger and Bright House Transaction (collectively, the “Transactions”), Liberty Broadband exchanged its shares of Time Warner Cable for shares of Charter and purchased additional shares of Charter. As a result, and pursuant to proxy agreements entered into with Liberty Interactive and A/N, Liberty Broadband controls 25.01% of the aggregate voting power of Charter. For further discussion of the Transactions, see “Narrative Description of Business.”

 (c)Narrative Description of Business 
 Charter Communications, Inc.
 Introduction
 Charter is the second largest cable operator in the United States and a leading broadband communications services company providing video, Internet and voice services to approximately 27.2 million residential and business customers at December 31, 2017. In addition, Charter sells video and online advertising inventory to local, regional and national advertising customers and fiber-delivered communications and managed information technology (“IT”) solutions to large enterprise customers. 
 Charter also owns and operates regional sports networks and local sports, news and community channels and sells security and home management services in the residential marketplace. Charter’s core strategy is to deliver high quality products at competitive prices, combined with outstanding service. This strategy, combined with simple, easy to understand pricing and packaging, is central to Charter’s goal of growing its customer base while also selling more services to each customer. Charter expects to execute this strategy by managing its operations in a consumer-friendly, efficient and cost-effective manner. Charter's operating strategy includes insourcing much of its customer care and field operations workforces, which results in higher quality service transactions. While an insourced operating model can increase field operations and customer care costs associated with each service transaction, the higher quality nature of insourced labor service transactions significantly reduces the volume of service transactions per customer, more than offsetting the higher investment made in each service transaction. As Charter reduces the number of service transactions and recurring costs per customer relationship, Charter effectively passes those savings on to customers in the form of products and prices that the company believes provides more value than what its competitors offer. The combination of offering competitively priced products and high quality service allows Charter to increase the number of customers it serves over its fixed network and increase the number of products it sells to each customer, while at the same time reducing the number of service transactions per relationship, improving customer satisfaction and reducing churn, which results in lower costs to acquire and serve customers. Charter is also reducing operating costs per customer relationship by providing customers with the ability to communicate with it through a variety of new forums that they may favor over telephonic communications. These forums include Charter’s customer website, mobile device applications, online chat and social media, which are less costly for Charter to provide than direct telephonic communications. Ultimately, this operating strategy enables Charter to offer high quality, competitively priced services profitably, while continuing to invest in new products and services.
 Time Warner Cable Merger
 On May 18, 2016, the previously announced Time Warner Cable Merger was completed, which resulted in Legacy Charter and TWC becoming wholly owned subsidiaries of Charter, which was a wholly owned subsidiary of Legacy Charter at the time. As a result of the Time Warner Cable Merger, Charter became the new public parent company that holds the operations of the combined companies and was renamed Charter Communications, Inc. Pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement, upon consummation of the Time Warner Cable Merger, 285 million outstanding shares of TWC common stock were converted into 143 million shares of Charter Class A common stock valued at approximately $32 billion as of the date of acquisition. In addition, TWC shareholders (excluding Liberty Broadband and Liberty Interactive) received approximately $28 billion in cash. As of May 18, 2016, the total value of the Time Warner Cable Merger was approximately $85 billion, including cash, equity and TWC assumed debt. The purchase price also includes an estimated pre-combination vesting period fair value of $514 million for equity awards converted into Charter awards upon closing of the Time Warner Cable Merger and $69 million of cash paid to former TWC employees and non-employee directors who held equity awards, whether vested or not vested.  Bright House Transaction
 Also, on May 18, 2016, Charter and A/N completed the previously announced Bright House Transaction, pursuant to a definitive Contribution Agreement. Pursuant to the Bright House Transaction, Charter became the owner of the membership interests in Bright House and the other assets primarily related to Bright House (other than certain excluded assets and liabilities and non-operating cash). As of the date of acquisition, the purchase price totaled approximately $12.2 billion consisting of (a) $2 billion in cash, (b) 25 million convertible preferred units of Charter Communications Holdings, LLC (“Charter Holdings”) with a face amount of $2.5 billion that pay a 6% annual preferential dividend, (c) approximately 31.0 million common units of Charter

Holdings that are exchangeable into Charter Class A common stock on a one-for-one basis and (d) one share of Charter Class B common stock.
 Liberty Broadband Transactions 
 In connection with the Time Warner Cable Merger, Charter and Liberty Broadband completed their previously announced transactions pursuant to their investment agreement, in which Liberty Broadband purchased for cash approximately 22.0 million shares of Charter Class A common stock valued at $4.3 billion at the closing of the Time Warner Cable Merger to partially finance the cash portion of the Time Warner Cable Merger consideration. In connection with the Bright House Transaction, Liberty Broadband purchased approximately 3.7 million shares of Charter Class A common stock valued at $700 million at the closing of the Bright House Transaction. See note 5 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for more information on the Transactions. Products and Services
 Charter offers its customers subscription-based video services, including video on demand (“VOD”), high definition (“HD”) television, and digital video recorder (“DVR”) service, Internet services and voice services. As of December 31, 2017, 74% of Charter’s footprint was all-digital, enabling Charter to offer more HD channels, faster Internet speeds and better video picture quality and the company intends to transition the remaining portions of its Legacy TWC and Legacy Bright House footprints to all-digital. Charter’s video, Internet, and voice services are offered to residential and commercial customers on a subscription basis, with prices and related charges based on the types of service selected, whether the services are sold as a “bundle” or on an individual basis, and the equipment necessary to receive Charter’s services. Bundled services are available to substantially all of Charter’s passings, and approximately 59% of Charter’s customers subscribe to a bundle of services.
 All customer statistics as of December 31, 2017 include the operations of Legacy TWC, Legacy Bright House and Legacy Charter, each of which is based on individual legacy company reporting methodology. These methodologies differ and their differences may be material. Statistical reporting will be conformed over time to a single reporting methodology. The

(a) | Charter calculates the aging of customer accounts based on the monthly billing cycle for each account. On that basis, as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, customers include approximately 245,800 and 208,400 customers, respectively, whose accounts were over 60 days past due, approximately 19,500 and 15,500 customers, respectively, whose accounts were over 90 days past due, and approximately 12,600 and 8,000 customers, respectively, whose accounts were over 120 days past due.

(b) | In the second quarter of 2017, Charter conformed the seasonal customer program in the Legacy Bright House footprint to its program. Prior to the plan change, Legacy Bright House customers enrolling in the seasonal plan were charged a one-time fee and counted as customer disconnects, and as new connects, when moving off the seasonal plan. Under Charter’s seasonal plan, residential customers pay a reduced monthly fee while the seasonal plan is active and remain reported as customers. Excluding the impact of customer activity related to Legacy Bright House’s seasonal plan, residential customer relationships and video, Internet and voice PSUs at December 31, 2016 would have been higher by approximately 10,000, 8,000, 12,000 and 7,000 respectively.
----+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(c) | Customer relationships include the number of customers that receive one or more levels of service, encompassing video, Internet and voice services, without regard to which service(s) such customers receive. Customers who reside in residential multiple dwelling units (“MDUs”) and that are billed under bulk contracts are counted based on the number of billed units within each bulk MDU. Total customer relationships excludes enterprise customer relationships.

(d) | Monthly residential revenue per residential customer is calculated as total residential video, Internet and voice annual revenue divided by twelve divided by average residential customer relationships during the respective year.
----+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(e) | Monthly small and medium business revenue per customer is calculated as total small and medium business annual revenue divided by twelve divided by average small and medium business customer relationships during the respective year.
----+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(f) | Enterprise PSUs represent the aggregate number of fiber service offerings counting each separate service offering as an individual PSU.

 Residential Services
 Video Services
 Charter’s video customers receive a package of basic programming which, in its all-digital markets, generally includes a digital set-top box that provides an interactive electronic programming guide with parental controls, access to pay-per-view services, including VOD (available to nearly all of their passings), digital music channels and the option to view certain video services on third party devices. Customers have the option to purchase additional tiers of services including premium channels which provide original programming, commercial-free movies, sports, and other special event entertainment programming. Substantially all of Charter’s video programming is available in HD. Charter also offers certain video packages containing a limited number of channels via its cable television systems.
 In the vast majority of its footprint, Charter offers VOD service which allows customers to select from approximately 35,000 titles at any time. VOD includes standard definition, HD and three dimensional content. VOD programming options may be accessed for free if the content is associated with a customer’s linear subscription, or for a fee on a transactional basis. VOD services are also offered on a subscription basis included in a digital tier premium channel subscription or for a monthly fee. Pay-per-view channels allow customers to pay on a per-event basis to view a single showing of a one-time special sporting event, music concert, or similar event on a commercial-free basis.
 Charter’s goal is to provide its video customers with the programming they want, when they want it, on any device. DVR service enables customers to digitally record programming and to pause and rewind live programming. Customers can also use the Spectrum TV application available on mobile devices, residential devices and on their website to watch up to 250 channels of cable TV, view VOD programming, remotely control digital set-top boxes while in the home and to program DVRs remotely. Customers also have access to programmer authenticated applications and websites (known as TV Everywhere services) such as HBO Go®, Fox Now®, Discovery Go® and WatchESPN®.
 In certain markets, Charter has launched Spectrum Guide®, a network or “cloud-based” user interface that can run on traditional set-top boxes, with a look and feel that is similar to that of the Spectrum TV App. Spectrum Guide® is designed to allow Charter’s customers to enjoy a state-of-the-art video experience on the majority of its set-top boxes, including accessing third-party video applications such as Netflix. The guide enables customers to find video content more easily across cable TV channels and VOD options. Charter plans to continue to deploy Spectrum Guide across its footprint and enhance this technology in 2018 and beyond.
 Internet Services
 In 2017, Charter completed its launch of Spectrum pricing and packaging (“SPP”) and now offers an entry level Internet download speed of at least 100 megabits per second (“Mbps”) across 99% of its footprint and 200 Mbps across 17% of its footprint, which among other things, allows several people within a single household to stream HD video content online while simultaneously using their Internet service for non-video purposes. Additionally, leveraging DOCSIS 3.1 technology, Charter had introduced speed offerings of 940 Mbps (“Spectrum Internet Gig”) in 17% of its footprint as of December 31, 2017. Finally, Charter offers a security suite with its Internet services which, upon installation by customers, provides protection against computer viruses and spyware and includes parental control features.
 Charter offers an in-home Wi-Fi product that provides customers with high performance wireless routers to maximize their in-home wireless Internet experience. Additionally, Charter offers an out-of-home Wi-Fi service in most of its footprint to Internet customers at designated “hot spots.” In 2018, Charter expects to continue to expand Wi-Fi accessibility to its customers through its network of Wi-Fi hotspots.
 Voice Services
 Charter provides voice communications services using voice over Internet protocol (“VoIP”) technology to transmit digital voice signals over its network. Charter’s voice services include unlimited local and long distance calling to the United States, Canada, Mexico and Puerto Rico, voicemail, call waiting, caller ID, call forwarding and other features and offers 

 
  I-8


 
international calling either by the minute, or through packages of minutes per month. For customers that subscribe to both voice and video offerings, caller ID on TV is also available in most areas.
 Mobile Services
 Charter’s mobile strategy is built on the long-term vision of an integrated fixed/wireless network with differentiated products, and the ability to maximize the potential of its existing cable business. Charter intends to launch its Spectrum-branded mobile service in 2018 to residential customers via its mobile virtual network operator (“MVNO”) reseller agreement with Verizon Wireless. In the second phase, Charter plans to use its Wi-Fi network in conjunction with additional unlicensed or licensed spectrum to improve network performance and expand capacity to offer consumers a superior wireless service.​​ In furtherance of this second phase, Charter has experimental wireless licenses from the FCC that it is utilizing to test next generation wireless services in several markets around the country. Charter currently plans to only offer its Spectrum mobile service to residential customers subscribing to its Internet service. In the future, Charter may also offer mobile service to its small and medium business customers on similar terms. Charter believes Spectrum-branded mobile services will drive more sales of its core products, create longer customer lives and increase profitability and cash flow over time. As Charter launches its new mobile services, it expects an initial funding period to grow a new product as well as negative working capital impacts from the timing of device-related cash flows when it provides the handset or tablet to customers pursuant to equipment installment plans.
 Charter is exploring working with a variety of partners and vendors in a number of operational areas within the wireless space, including: creating common operating platforms; technical standards development and harmonization; device forward and reverse logistics; and emerging wireless technology platforms. The efficiencies created are expected to provide more choice, innovative products and competitive prices for customers. Charter intends to consider and pursue opportunities in the mobile space which may include entering into joint ventures or partnerships with wireless or cable providers which may require significant investment. There is no assurance Charter will enter into such arrangements or that if it does, that they will be successful.
 Commercial Services
 Charter offers scalable broadband communications solutions for businesses and carrier organizations of all sizes, selling Internet access, data networking, fiber connectivity to cellular towers and office buildings, video entertainment services and business telephone services. Small and Medium Business
 Spectrum Business offers Internet, voice and video services to small and medium businesses over its hybrid fiber coaxial network that are similar to those that Charter provides to its residential customers. Spectrum Business includes a full range of video programming and entry-level Internet speeds of 100 Mbps downstream and 10 Mbps upstream. Additionally, customers can upgrade their Internet speeds to 200 or 300 Mbps downstream. Spectrum Business also includes a set of business services including web hosting, e-mail and security, and multi-line telephone services with more than 30 business features including web-based service management, that are generally not available to residential customers. Enterprise Solutions
 Spectrum Enterprise offers fiber-delivered communications and managed IT solutions to larger businesses, as well as high-capacity last-mile data connectivity services to wireless and wireline carriers, Internet Service Providers and other competitive carriers on a wholesale basis. Spectrum Enterprise’s product portfolio includes fiber Internet access, voice trunking services, hosted voice, Ethernet services that privately and securely connect geographically dispersed client locations, and video solutions designed to meet the needs of hospitality, education, and health care clients. In addition, Spectrum Enterprise is beginning market field trials of an innovative Hybrid Software-Defined Wide Area Network, that enables businesses to leverage the performance of Ethernet, the ubiquity of Internet connectivity and the flexibility of a software-defined solution to solve a wide array of business communications and networking challenges. Charter’s managed IT portfolio includes Cloud Infrastructure as a Service and Cloud Desktop as a Service, and managed hosting, application, and messaging solutions, along with other related IT and professional services.  Charter’s large serviceable footprint allows it to effectively serve business customers with multiple 

 
  I-9


 
sites across given geographic regions.  These customers can benefit from obtaining advanced services from a single provider simplifying procurement and potentially reducing their costs.
 Advertising Services
 Charter’s advertising sales division, Spectrum Reach®, offers local, regional and national businesses the opportunity to advertise in individual and multiple markets on cable television networks and digital outlets. Charter receives revenue from the sale of local advertising across various platforms such as MTV®, CNN® and ESPN®. In any particular market, Charter typically inserts local advertising on up to 60 channels. Charter’s large footprint provides opportunities for advertising customers to address broader regional audiences from a single provider and thus reach more customers with a single transaction. Charter’s size also provides scale to invest in new technology to create more targeted and addressable advertising capabilities.
 Available advertising time is generally sold by Charter’s advertising sales force. In some markets, Charter has formed advertising interconnects or entered into representation agreements with other video distributors, including, among others, Verizon Communications Inc.’s (“Verizon”) fiber optic service (“FiOS”) and AT&T Inc.’s (“AT&T”) U-verse and DIRECTV platforms, under which Charter sells advertising on behalf of those operators. In other markets, Charter enters into representation agreements under which another operator in the area will sell advertising on its behalf. These arrangements enable Charter and its partners to deliver linear commercials across wider geographic areas, replicating the reach of local broadcast television stations to the extent possible. In addition, Charter enters into interconnect agreements from time to time with other cable operators, which, on behalf of a number of video operators, sells advertising time to national and regional advertisers in individual or multiple markets.
 Additionally, Charter sells the advertising inventory of its owned and operated local sports, news and lifestyle channels, of its regional sports networks that carry Los Angeles Lakers’ basketball games and other sports programming and of SportsNet LA, a regional sports network that carries Los Angeles Dodgers’ baseball games and other sports programming. 
 Charter is in the process of deploying advanced advertising products such as its Audience App, which uses its proprietary set-top box viewership data (all anonymized and aggregated) to optimize linear inventory, and household addressability, which allows for more finite targeting, within various parts of its footprint. These new products will be distributed across more of its footprint in 2018.
 Other Services
 Regional Sports and News Networks
 Charter has an agreement with the Los Angeles Lakers for rights to distribute all locally available Los Angeles Lakers’ games through 2033. Charter broadcasts those games on its regional sports network, Spectrum SportsNet. Charter also manages 16 local news channels, including Spectrum News NY1, a 24-hour news channel focused on New York City, 10 local sports channels and one local lifestyle community channel, and it owns 26.8% of Sterling Entertainment Enterprises, LLC (doing business as SportsNet New York), a New York City-based regional sports network that carries New York Mets’ baseball games as well as other regional sports programming.
 American Media Productions, LLC ("American Media Productions"), an unaffiliated third party, owns SportsNet LA, a regional sports network carrying the Los Angeles Dodgers’ baseball games and other sports programming. In accordance with agreements with American Media Productions, Charter acts as the network’s exclusive affiliate and advertising sales representative and has certain branding and programming rights with respect to the network. In addition, Charter provides certain production and technical services to American Media Productions. The affiliate, advertising, production and programming agreements continue through 2038.

  Charter’s Network Technology and Customer Premise Equipment
 Charter’s network includes three key components: a national backbone, regional/metro networks and a “last-mile” network. Both its national backbone and regional/metro network components utilize a redundant Internet Protocol (“IP”) ring/mesh architecture. The national backbone component provides connectivity from regional demarcation points to nationally centralized content, connectivity and services. The regional/metro network components provide connectivity between the regional demarcation points and headends within a specific geographic area and enable the delivery of content and services between these network components.
 Charter’s last-mile network utilizes a hybrid fiber coaxial cable (“HFC”) architecture, which combines the use of fiber optic cable with coaxial cable. In most systems, Charter delivers its signals via fiber optic cable from the headend to a group of nodes, and uses coaxial cable to deliver the signal from individual nodes to the homes served by that node. For Charter’s fiber Internet, Ethernet, carrier wholesale, SIP and PRI Spectrum Enterprise customers, fiber optic cable is extended from individual nodes to the customer’s site. For certain new build and MDU sites, Charter increasingly brings fiber to the customer site. Charter’s design standard is six strands of fiber to each node, with two strands activated and four strands reserved for spares and future services. This design standard allows these additional strands to be utilized for additional residential traffic capacity, and enterprise customer needs as they arise. Charter believes that this hybrid network design provides high capacity and signal quality. The design also provides two-way signal capabilities for the support of interactive services.
 HFC architecture benefits include:

· | bandwidth capacity to enable traditional and two-way video and broadband services;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | dedicated bandwidth for two-way services; and
--+----------------------------------------------


· | signal quality and high service reliability.
--+---------------------------------------------

  Approximately 98% of Charter’s estimated passings are served by systems that have bandwidth of 750 megahertz or greater as of December 31, 2017. This bandwidth capacity enables Charter to offer HD television, DOCSIS-based Internet services and voice services.
 An all-digital platform enables Charter to offer a larger selection of HD channels, faster Internet speeds and better picture quality while providing greater plant security and enabling lower installation and disconnect service truck rolls. Charter is

currently all-digital in 74% of its footprint and intends to transition the remaining portions of its Legacy TWC and Legacy Bright House footprints.
 Charter has been introducing its new set-top box, WorldBox, to consumers in certain markets. The WorldBox design has opened the set-top box market to new vendors and reduced Charter’s set-top box costs. WorldBox also includes more advanced features and functionality than older set-top boxes, including faster processing times, IP capabilities with increased speed, additional simultaneous recordings, increased DVR storage capacity, and a greater degree of flexibility for consumers to take Charter-provisioned set-top boxes with them, if and when, they move residences. Charter has also been introducing its new cloud-based user interface, Spectrum Guide®, to its video customers in certain markets. Spectrum Guide® improves video content search and discovery, and fully enables Charter’s on-demand offering. In addition, Spectrum Guide® can function on the majority of Charter’s set-top boxes, reducing costs and customer disruption to swap equipment for new functionality.
 Management, Customer Operations and Marketing
 Charter’s operations are centralized, with senior executives located at several key corporate offices, responsible for coordinating and overseeing operations, including establishing company-wide strategies, policies and procedures. Sales and marketing, network operations, field operations, customer operations, engineering, advertising sales, human resources, legal, government relations, information technology and finance are all directed at the corporate level. Regional and local field operations are responsible for customer premise service transactions and maintaining and constructing that portion of Charter’s network which is located outdoors. In 2018, Charter’s field operations group continues to focus on standardizing practices, processes, procedures and metrics.
 Charter continues to focus on improving the customer experience through enhanced product offerings, reliability of services, and delivery of quality customer service. As part of Charter’s operating strategy, Charter is committed to investments and hiring plans that continue to insource most of its customer operations workload. 
 In-house domestic call centers handled approximately 75% of Charter’s customer service calls and are managed centrally to ensure a consistent, high quality customer experience. Routing calls by particular call types to specific agents that only handle such call types, enables agents to become experts in addressing specific customer needs, thus creating a better customer experience. Charter also continues to migrate its call centers to full virtualization which allows calls to be routed across Charter’s call centers regardless of the location origin of the call, reducing call wait times, and saving costs. A new call center agent desktop interface tool, already used at Legacy Charter, is being developed for Legacy TWC and Legacy Bright House. This new desktop interface tool will enable virtualization of all call centers, regardless of legacy billing platform, and will better serve its customers.
 Charter also provides customers with the opportunity to interact with the company through a variety of forums in addition to telephonic communications, including through its customer website, mobile device applications, online chat, and social media. Charter’s customer websites and mobile applications enable customers to pay their bills, manage their accounts, order new services and utilize self-service help and support.
 Charter sells its residential and commercial services using a national brand platform known as Spectrum®, Spectrum Business® and Spectrum Enterprise®. These brands reflect Charter’s comprehensive approach to industry-leading products, driven by speed, performance and innovation. Charter’s marketing strategy emphasizes the sale of its bundled services through targeted direct response marketing programs to existing and potential customers, and increases awareness and the value of the Spectrum brand. Charter’s marketing organization creates and executes marketing programs intended to grow customer relationships, increase the number of services it sells per relationship, retain existing customers and cross-sell additional products to current customers. Charter monitors the effectiveness of its marketing efforts, customer perception, competition, pricing, and service preferences, among other factors, in order to increase its responsiveness to customers and to improve sales and customer retention. Charter’s marketing organization manages the majority of the sales channels including direct sales, on-line, outbound telemarketing and stores.

 Programming
 Charter believes that offering a wide variety of video programming choices influences a customer’s decision to subscribe and retain its cable video services. Charter obtains basic and premium programming, usually pursuant to written contracts, from a number of suppliers. Media corporation consolidation has, however, resulted in fewer suppliers and additional selling power on the part of programming suppliers. Charter’s programming contracts are generally for a fixed period of time, usually for multiple years, and are subject to negotiated renewal. Recently, Charter has begun entering into agreements to co-produce original content which gives it the right to provide customers with certain exclusive content, for a period of time.
 Programming is usually made available to Charter for a license fee, which is generally paid based on the number of customers to whom it makes that programming available. Programming license fees may include “volume” discounts and financial incentives to support the launch of a channel and/or ongoing marketing support, as well as discounts for channel placement or service penetration. For home shopping channels, Charter typically receives a percentage of the revenue attributable to its customers’ purchases. Charter also offers VOD and pay per view channels of movies and events that are subject to a revenue split with the content provider.
 Charter’s programming costs have increased in excess of customary inflationary and cost-of-living type increases. Charter expects programming costs to continue to increase due to a variety of factors including, annual increases pursuant to Charter’s programming contracts, contract renewals with programmers and the carriage of incremental programming, including new services, higher expanded basic video penetration and VOD programming. Increases in the cost of sports programming and the amounts paid for broadcast station retransmission consent have been the largest contributors to the growth in Charter’s programming costs over the last few years. Additionally, the demands of large media companies who link carriage of their most popular networks to carriage and cost increases of their less popular networks, has limited Charter’s flexibility in creating more tailored and cost-sensitive programming packages for consumers. 
 Federal law allows commercial television broadcast stations to make an election between “must-carry” rights and an alternative “retransmission-consent” regime. When a station opts for retransmission-consent, Charter is not allowed to carry the station’s signal without that station’s permission. Continuing demands by owners of broadcast stations for cash payments at substantial increases over amounts paid in prior years in exchange for retransmission consent will increase Charter’s programming costs or require Charter to cease carriage of popular programming, potentially leading to a loss of customers in affected markets.
 Over the past several years, increases in Charter’s video service rates have not fully offset the increases in its programming costs, and with the impact of increasing competition and other marketplace factors, Charter does not expect the increases in its video service rates to fully offset the increase in its programming costs for the foreseeable future. Although Charter passes along a portion of amounts paid for retransmission consent to the majority of its customers, Charter’s inability to fully pass programming cost increases on to its video customers has had, and is expected in the future to have, an adverse impact on Charter’s cash flow and operating margins associated with its video product. In order to mitigate reductions of Charter’s operating margins due to rapidly increasing programming costs, Charter continues to review its pricing and programming packaging strategies.
 Charter currently has programming contracts that have expired and others that will expire at, or before the end, of 2018. Charter will seek to renew these agreements on terms that it believes are favorable. There can be no assurance, however, that these agreements will be renewed on favorable or comparable terms. To the extent that Charter is unable to reach agreements with certain programmers on terms that Charter believes are reasonable, Charter has been, and may in the future be, forced to remove such programming channels from its line-up, which may result in a loss of customers.

  Ownership Interests
 We own an approximate 22.7% economic ownership interest in Charter, based on shares of Charter’s Class A common stock issued and outstanding as of December 31, 2017, and, pursuant to proxy agreements entered into with Liberty Interactive and A/N, control 25.01% of the aggregate voting power of Charter. Upon the closing of the Time Warner Cable Merger, the Second Amended and Restated Stockholders Agreement, dated as of May 23, 2015, by and among Legacy Charter, Charter, Liberty Broadband and A/N, as amended (the “Stockholders Agreement”), became fully effective. Under the Stockholders Agreement, we have the right to designate three directors to the Charter board of directors, subject to certain exclusions and requirements. Charter has agreed to cause the appointment of at least one of our designees to serve on the nominating and corporate governance, finance, audit and compensation and benefits committees of the board, provided they meet the independence and other qualifications for membership on those committees. Skyhook
 Skyhook Holding, Inc. (formerly known as “TruePosition”) was originally incorporated on November 24, 1992 to provide technology for locating wireless phones and other mobile devices. TruePosition offered a passive network-based location system based on its patented U-TDOA technology (the “U-TDOA Service”) to provide E-9-1-1 services domestically and to enhance services in support of commercial applications and national security/law enforcement operations worldwide. In February 2014, TruePosition acquired Skyhook Wireless, Inc., an alternative location services provider that offered a positioning system using device-based measurements to calculate location, as opposed to TruePosition’s network-based technology.  In 2015, as a result of the loss of one of its major customers – a wireless carrier that accounted for 80-90% of TruePosition’s revenue – as well as changes in the regulatory environment for E-9-1-1 services, TruePosition ceased making further investment in its U-TDOA Service. Thereafter, in May 2016, TruePosition and Skyhook Wireless, Inc. combined operations in order to focus on the development and sale of Skyhook’s device-based location technology. On January 1, 2017, TruePosition changed its name to Skyhook Holding, Inc. to reflect this combination of operations. Skyhook Holding, Inc. and Skyhook Wireless, Inc. are referred to collectively herein as “Skyhook.”  
 Today, Skyhook markets and sells two primary products: (1) a location determination service called the Precision Location Solution; and (2) a location intelligence and data insights service called Geospatial Insights. 
 Skyhook’s Precision Location Solution works by collecting nearby radio signals (such as information from Wi-Fi access points, cell towers, IP addresses and other radio beacons) that are observed by a mobile device. The Precision Location Solution then matches these identified signals to the approximate geolocation of billions of geolocated Wi-Fi access points, cell towers and IP addresses which are maintained in Skyhook’s proprietary reference database. Based on the signal strength of the received measurements and the pre-determined positions of the access points, cell towers and other beacons that are stored in the reference database, Skyhook can then calculate a precise location of the mobile device. Since the Precision Location Solution uses the 

 
  I-14


 
existing hardware on the mobile device and observes signal scans that have already been performed by the device, it does not require additional hardware installations or consume any additional power from the mobile device. The Precision Location Solution is primarily marketed to, and used by, mobile device makers (including phones, laptops, tablets, gaming devices, wearables and other wireless-connected Internet of Things products), wireless carriers, and asset tracking platforms to understand the precise geographic location and movement of mobile devices. In addition, the Precision Location Solution can contribute to improving the location determination capabilities of a hybrid location system that utilizes other satellite and terrestrial location technologies, such as GPS, by increasing accuracy, reducing power consumption and improving the time it takes to deliver a location result. 
 Skyhook’s Geospatial Insights product uses anonymized location data to analyze foot traffic patterns and better understand the real-world behavior of consumers. By mapping the movement of mobile devices to specific venues and points-of-interest, Skyhook can draw insights regarding user visits to retail stores, restaurants, hotels, airports and other locations, as well as attendance at concerts, sporting events or other public gatherings. The resulting data provides a rich view of customer behavior, loyalty and purchase intent, as well as insights about the performance of a business or its competitors. Skyhook markets and sells Geospatial Insights to enterprises, research and consulting firms, financial institutions and advertisers, among others. These customers use Geospatial Insights data to understand, measure and optimize the performance of businesses, to benchmark performance against competitors, to improve customer experience, to advertise to and target existing and prospective customers with the right message, and to measure the efficacy of advertising campaigns in driving real-world actions.   
 Skyhook’s revenue is derived from the sale and integration of its Precision Location Solution (including the licensing of software and data components that make up that solution) and the licensing of Geospatial Insights data. In addition, Skyhook earns revenue through entering into licensing agreements with companies to utilize its underlying intellectual property (including patents).
 Regulatory Matters
 Charter    The following summary addresses the key regulatory and legislative developments affecting the cable industry and Charter’s services for both residential and commercial customers. Cable system operations are extensively regulated by the federal government (primarily the FCC), certain state governments, and many local governments. A failure to comply with these regulations could subject Charter to substantial penalties. Charter’s business can be dramatically impacted by changes to the existing regulatory framework, whether triggered by legislative, administrative, or judicial rulings. Congress and the FCC have frequently revisited the subject of communications regulation and they are likely to do so again in the future. Charter could be materially disadvantaged in the future if it is subject to new regulations or regulatory actions that do not equally impact its key competitors. Charter cannot provide assurance that the already extensive regulation of its business will not be expanded in the future. In addition, Charter is already subject to Charter-specific conditions regarding certain business practices as a result of the FCC’s approval of the Transactions. Video Service
 Must Carry/Retransmission Consent
 There are two alternative legal methods for carriage of local broadcast television stations on cable systems. Federal “must carry” regulations require cable systems to carry local broadcast television stations upon the request of the local broadcaster. Alternatively, federal law includes “retransmission consent” regulations, by which popular commercial television stations can prohibit cable carriage unless the cable operator first negotiates for “retransmission consent,” which may be conditioned on significant payments or other concessions. Popular stations invoking “retransmission consent” have been demanding substantial compensation increases in their recent negotiations with cable operators, thereby significantly increasing Charter’s operating costs.
 Additional government-mandated broadcast carriage obligations, including those related to the FCC’s newly adopted enhanced technical broadcasting option (Advanced Television Systems Committee 3.0), could disrupt existing programming 

 
  I-15


 
commitments, interfere with Charter’s preferred use of limited channel capacity, and limit Charter’s ability to offer services that appeal to customers and generate revenues.
 Cable Equipment
 In 1996, Congress enacted a statute requiring the FCC to adopt regulations designed to assure the development of an independent retail market for “navigation devices,” such as cable set-top boxes. As a result, the FCC required cable operators to make a separate offering of security modules (i.e., a “CableCARD”) that can be used with retail navigation devices. Some of the FCC’s rules requiring support for CableCARDs were vacated by the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia in 2013, and another of these rules was repealed by Congress in 2014, but the basic obligation to provide separable security for retail devices remains in place. In 2016, the FCC proposed to replace its CableCARD regime with burdensome new rules that would have required Charter to make disaggregated “information flows” available to set-top boxes and apps supplied by third parties. That proposal was not adopted, but various parties may continue to advocate alternative regulatory approaches to reduce consumer dependency on traditional operator provided set-top boxes. It remains uncertain whether the FCC or Congress will change the legal requirements related to Charter’s set-top boxes and what the impact of any such changes might be. Privacy and Information Security Regulation
 The Communications Act of 1934, as amended (the “Communications Act”) limits Charter’s ability to collect, use, and disclose customers’ personally identifiable information for its video, voice, and Internet services, as well as provides requirements to safeguard such information. Charter is subject to additional federal, state, and local laws and regulations that impose additional restrictions on the collection, use and disclosure of consumer information. Further, the FCC, Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”), and many states regulate and restrict the marketing practices of communications service providers, including telemarketing and sending unsolicited commercial emails.
 As a result of the FCC’s 2017 decision to reclassify broadband Internet access service as an “information service,” the FTC once again has the authority, pursuant to its authority to enforce against unfair or deceptive acts and practices, to protect the privacy of Internet service customers, including Charter’s use and disclosure of certain customer information.  Although one court decision has raised questions regarding the extent of FTC jurisdiction over companies that offer both common carrier services as well as non-common carrier services, that decision has been stayed, pending review by the full Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.
 Charter’s operations are also subject to federal and state laws governing information security. In the event of an information security breach, such rules may require consumer and government agency notification and may result in regulatory enforcement actions with the potential of monetary forfeitures. The FCC, the FTC and state attorneys general regularly bring enforcement actions against companies related to information security breaches and privacy violations.
 Various security standards provide guidance to telecommunications companies in order to help identify and mitigate cybersecurity risk. One such standard is the voluntary framework released by the National Institute for Standards and Technology (“NIST”) in February 2014, in cooperation with other federal agencies and owners and operators of U.S. critical infrastructure. The NIST cybersecurity framework provides a prioritized and flexible model for organizations to identify and manage cyber risks inherent to their business. It was designed to supplement, not supersede, existing cybersecurity regulations and requirements. Several government agencies have encouraged compliance with the NIST cybersecurity framework, including the FCC, which is also considering expansion of its cybersecurity guidelines or the adoption of cybersecurity requirements. NIST recently proposed draft updates to this voluntary framework and is expected to release final revisions in 2018. 
 After the repeal of the FCC’s 2016 privacy rules through the Congressional Review Act in 2017, many states and local authorities have considered legislative or other actions that would impose additional restrictions on Charter’s ability to collect, use and disclose certain information.  Despite language in the FCC’s December 2017 decision reclassifying broadband Internet access service as an “information service,” that preempts state and local privacy regulations that conflict with federal policy, Charter expects these state and local efforts to regulate online privacy to continue in 2018.  Additionally, several state legislatures are considering the adoption of new data security and cybersecurity legislation that could result in additional network and information security requirements for Charter’s business.  There are also bills pending in both the U.S. House of Representatives and Senate that could impose new privacy and data security obligations.  Charter cannot predict whether any of these efforts will be successful or preempted, or how new legislation and regulations, if any, would affect its business.

 Pole Attachments
 The Communications Act requires most utilities owning utility poles to provide cable systems with access to poles and conduits and simultaneously subjects the rates charged for this access to either federal or state regulation. In 2011 and again in 2015, the FCC amended its existing pole attachment rules to promote broadband deployment. The 2011 order allows for new penalties in certain cases involving unauthorized attachments, but generally strengthens the cable industry’s ability to access investor-owned utility poles on reasonable rates, terms, and conditions. Additionally, the 2011 order reduces the federal rate formula previously applicable to “telecommunications” attachments to closely approximate the rate formula applicable to “cable” attachments. The 2015 order continues the reconciliation of rates, effectively closing the remaining “loophole” that potentially allowed for significantly higher rates for “telecommunications” than for “cable” attachments in certain scenarios, and minimizing the rate consequences of any of Charter’s services if deemed “telecommunications” for pole attachment purposes. Neither the 2011 order nor the 2015 order directly affect the rate in states that self-regulate (rather than allow the FCC to regulate pole rates), but many of those states have substantially the same rate for cable and telecommunications attachments.
 Some municipalities have enacted “one-touch” make-ready pole attachment ordinances, which permit third parties to alter components of Charter’s network attached to utility poles in ways that could adversely affect its businesses. Some of these ordinances have been challenged with differing results. In 2017, the FCC initiated a rulemaking that considers amending its pole attachment rules to permit a “one-touch” make-ready-like process for the poles within its jurisdiction. If adopted, these rules could have a similar effect as the municipal one-touch make-ready ordinances and adversely affect Charter’s businesses.
 Cable Rate Regulation
 Federal law strictly limits the potential scope of cable rate regulation.  Pursuant to federal law, all video offerings are universally exempt from rate regulation, except for a cable system’s minimum level of video programming service, referred to as “basic service,” and associated equipment.  Rate regulation of basic service and associated equipment operates pursuant to a federal formula, with local governments, commonly referred to as local franchising authorities, primarily responsible for administering this regulation.  The majority of Charter’s local franchising authorities have never certified to regulate basic service cable rates.  In 2015, the FCC adopted an order (which was subsequently upheld on appeal) reversing its historic approach to rate regulation certifications and requiring a local franchise authority interested in regulating cable rates to first make an affirmative showing that there is no “effective competition” (as defined under federal law)  in the community. Very few local franchise authorities have filed the necessary rate regulation certification, and the FCC’s 2015 order should make it more difficult for such entities to assert rate regulation in the future.
 There have been calls to impose expanded rate regulation on the cable industry. Confronted with rapidly increasing cable programming costs, it is possible that Congress may adopt new constraints on the retail pricing or packaging of cable programming. Any such constraints could adversely affect Charter’s operations.
 Ownership Restrictions
 Federal regulation of the communications field traditionally included a host of ownership restrictions, which limited the size of certain media entities and restricted their ability to enter into competing enterprises.  Through a series of legislative, regulatory, and judicial actions, most of these restrictions have been either eliminated or substantially relaxed.  Changes in this regulatory area could alter the business environment in which Charter operates. Access Channels
 Local franchise agreements often require cable operators to set aside certain channels for public, educational, and governmental access programming. Federal law also requires cable systems to designate up to 15% of their channel capacity for commercial leased access by unaffiliated third parties, who may offer programming that Charter’s customers do not particularly desire. The FCC adopted revised rules in 2007 mandating a significant reduction in the rates that operators can charge commercial leased access users and imposing additional administrative requirements that would be burdensome on the cable industry. The effect of the FCC’s revised rules was stayed by a federal court, pending a cable industry appeal and an adverse finding by the Office of Management and Budget. Although commercial leased access activity historically has been relatively limited, increased activity in this area could further burden the channel capacity of Charter’s cable systems.

 
  I-17


 

 Other FCC Regulatory Matters
 FCC regulations cover a variety of additional areas, including, among other things: (1) equal employment opportunity obligations; (2) customer service standards; (3) technical service standards; (4) mandatory blackouts of certain network and syndicated programming; (5) restrictions on political advertising; (6) restrictions on advertising in children's programming; (7) licensing of systems and facilities; (8) maintenance of public files; (9) emergency alert systems; (10) inside wiring and exclusive contracts for MDU complexes; and (11) disability access, including new requirements governing video-description and closed-captioning. Each of these regulations restricts Charter’s business practices to varying degrees and may impose additional costs on Charter’s operations.
 It is possible that Congress or the FCC will expand or modify its regulation of cable systems in the future, and Charter cannot predict at this time how that might impact its business.
 Copyright
 Cable systems are subject to a federal copyright compulsory license covering carriage of television and radio broadcast signals. The copyright law provides copyright owners the right to audit Charter’s payments under the compulsory license, and Charter is currently subject to ongoing compulsory copyright audits. The possible modification or elimination of this compulsory copyright license is the subject of continuing legislative proposals and administrative review and could adversely affect Charter’s ability to obtain desired broadcast programming.
 Copyright clearances for non-broadcast programming services are arranged through private negotiations. Cable operators also must obtain music rights for locally originated programming and advertising from the major music performing rights organizations. These licensing fees have been the source of litigation in the past, and Charter cannot predict with certainty whether license fee disputes may arise in the future.
 Franchise Matters
 Charter’s cable systems generally are operated pursuant to nonexclusive franchises, permits, and similar authorizations granted by a municipality or other state or local government entity in order to utilize and cross public rights-of-way. Cable franchises generally are granted for fixed terms and in many cases include monetary penalties for noncompliance and may be terminable if the franchisee fails to comply with material provisions. The specific terms and conditions of cable franchises vary significantly between jurisdictions. Cable franchises generally contain provisions governing cable operations, franchise fees, system construction, maintenance, technical performance, customer service standards, supporting and carrying public access channels, and changes in the ownership of the franchisee. A number of states subject cable systems to the jurisdiction of centralized state government agencies, such as public utility commissions. Although local franchising authorities have considerable discretion in establishing franchise terms, certain federal protections benefit cable operators. For example, federal law caps local franchise fees.
 Prior to the scheduled expiration of Charter’s franchises, it generally initiates renewal proceedings with the granting authorities.  The Communications Act, which is the primary federal statute regulating interstate communications, provides for an orderly franchise renewal process in which granting authorities may not unreasonably withhold renewals.  In connection with the franchise renewal process, however, many governmental authorities require the cable operator to make additional costly commitments. Historically, Charter has been able to renew its franchises without incurring significant costs, although any particular franchise may not be renewed on commercially favorable terms or otherwise.  If Charter fails to obtain renewals of franchises representing a significant number of its customers, it could have a material adverse effect on Charter’s consolidated financial condition, results of operations, or its liquidity.  Similarly, if a local franchising authority’s consent is required for the purchase or sale of a cable system, the local franchising authority may attempt to impose more burdensome requirements as a condition for providing its consent.
 The traditional cable franchising regime has undergone significant change as a result of various federal and state actions. The FCC has adopted rules that streamline entry for new competitors (particularly those affiliated with telephone companies) and reduce certain franchising burdens for these new entrants. The FCC adopted more modest relief for existing cable operators.

 
  I-18


 

 At the same time, a substantial number of states have adopted new franchising laws. Again, these laws were principally designed to streamline entry for new competitors, and they often provide advantages for these new entrants that are not immediately available to existing cable operators. In many instances, these franchising regimes do not apply to established cable operators until the existing franchise expires or a competitor directly enters the franchise territory. 
 Internet Service
 In 2015, the FCC determined that broadband Internet access services, such as those Charter offers, were a form of “telecommunications service” under the Communications Act and, on that basis, imposed rules banning service providers from blocking access to lawful content, restricting data rates for downloading lawful content, prohibiting the attachment of non-harmful devices, giving special transmission priority to affiliates, and offering third parties the ability to pay for priority routing.  The 2015 rules also imposed a “transparency” requirement, i.e., an obligation to disclose all material terms and conditions of Charter’s service to consumers.
 In December 2017, the FCC adopted an order reversing its treatment of broadband as a “telecommunications service,” reclassifying broadband as an “information service,” and eliminating the 2015 rules other than the transparency requirement, which it eased in significant ways. The FCC also ruled that state regulators may not impose obligations similar to federal obligations that the FCC removed. It is expected that various parties will challenge the FCC’s December 2017 ruling in court and at the FCC, and it cannot be predicted how any such court and administrative challenges will be resolved.  Moreover, it is possible that the FCC might further revise its approach to broadband Internet access in the future, or that Congress might enact legislation affecting the rules applicable to the service.
 The FCC’s December 2017 ruling does not affect other regulatory obligations on broadband Internet access providers.  Notably, broadband providers are required by the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act ("CALEA") to configure their networks in a manner that facilitates the ability of law enforcement, with proper legal authorization, to obtain information about customers, including the content of their Internet communications. The FCC and Congress also are considering subjecting Internet access services to the Universal Service funding requirements. These funding requirements could impose significant new costs on Charter’s Internet service. Also, the FCC and some state regulatory commissions direct certain subsidies to telephone companies deploying broadband to areas deemed to be “unserved” or “underserved.” Charter has opposed such subsidies when directed to areas that it serves. Despite Charter’s efforts, future subsidies may be directed to areas served by Charter, which could result in subsidized competitors operating in its service territories.  State and local governmental organizations have also adopted Internet-related regulations. These various governmental jurisdictions are also considering additional regulations in these and other areas, such as privacy, pricing, service and product quality, imposition of local franchise fees on Internet-related revenue and taxation. The adoption of new Internet regulations or the adaptation of existing laws to the Internet could adversely affect Charter’s business.
 Aside from the FCC’s generally applicable regulations, Charter has made certain commitments to comply with the FCC’s order in connection with the FCC’s approval of the Time Warner Cable Merger and the Bright House Transaction (discussed below).
 Voice Service
 The Telecommunications Act of 1996 created a more favorable regulatory environment for Charter to provide telecommunications and/or competitive voice services than had previously existed. In particular, it established requirements ensuring that competitive telephone companies could interconnect their networks with those providers of traditional telecommunications services to open the market to competition. The FCC has subsequently ruled that competitive telephone companies that support VoIP services, such as those Charter offers its customers, are entitled to interconnection with incumbent providers of traditional telecommunications services, which ensures that Charter’s VoIP services can compete in the market. Since that time, the FCC has initiated a proceeding to determine whether such interconnection rights should extend to traditional and competitive networks utilizing IP technology, and how to encourage the transition to IP networks throughout the industry. The FCC initiated a further proceeding in 2017 to consider whether additional changes to interconnection obligations are needed, including how and where companies interconnect their networks with the networks of other providers. New rules or obligations arising from these proceedings may affect Charter’s ability to compete in the provision of voice services.

 The FCC has collected extensive data from providers of point to point transport (“special access”) services, such as Charter, and the FCC may use those data to evaluate whether the market for such services is competitive, or whether the market should be subject to further regulation, which may increase Charter’s costs or constrain Charter’s ability to compete in this market.
 Further regulatory changes are being considered that could impact Charter’s voice business and that of its primary telecommunications competitors. The FCC and state regulatory authorities are considering, for example, whether certain common carrier regulations traditionally applied to incumbent local exchange carriers should be modified or reduced, and, in some jurisdictions, the extent to which common carrier requirements should be extended to VoIP providers. The FCC has already determined that certain providers of voice services using Internet Protocol technology must comply with requirements relating to 9-1-1 emergency services (“E-9-1-1”), the CALEA (the statute governing law enforcement access to and surveillance of communications), Universal Service Fund contributions, customer privacy and Customer Proprietary Network Information issues, number portability, network outage reporting, rural call completion, disability access, regulatory fees, back-up power obligations and discontinuance of service. In March 2007, a federal appeals court affirmed the FCC’s decision concerning federal regulation of certain VoIP services, but declined to specifically find that VoIP service provided by cable companies, such as Charter provides, should be regulated only at the federal level. As a result, some states have begun proceedings to subject cable VoIP services to state level regulation, and at least one state has asserted jurisdiction over Charter’s VoIP services. Charter prevailed on a legal challenge to that state’s assertion of jurisdiction. However, the state has appealed that ruling in a case which is now pending before a federal appellate court in Minnesota. Although Charter has registered with, or obtained certificates or authorizations from the FCC and the state regulatory authorities in those states in which Charter offers competitive voice services in order to ensure the continuity of its services and to maintain needed network interconnection arrangements, it is unclear whether and how these and other ongoing regulatory matters ultimately will be resolved.
 Transaction-Related Commitments
 In connection with approval of the Transactions, federal and state regulators imposed a number of post-merger conditions on Charter including but not limited to the following.
 FCC Conditions

· | Offer settlement-free Internet interconnection to any party that meets the requirements of Charter’s Interconnection Policy (available on Charter’s website) on terms generally consistent with the policy for seven years (with a possible reduction to five);
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Deploy and offer high-speed broadband Internet access service to an additional two million locations over five years;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Refrain from charging usage-based prices or imposing data caps on any fixed mass market broadband Internet access service plans for seven years (with a possible reduction to five);
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Offer 30/4 Mbps discounted broadband where technically feasible to eligible customers throughout Charter’s service area for four years from the offer’s commencement; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Continue to provide CableCARDs to any new or existing customer upon request for use in third-party retail devices for four years and continue to support such CableCARDs for seven years (in each case, unless the FCC changes the relevant rules).
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  The FCC conditions also contain a number of compliance reporting requirements.
 DOJ Conditions
 The Department of Justice (“DOJ”) Order prohibits Charter from entering into or enforcing any agreement with a video programmer that forbids, limits or creates incentives to limit the video programmer’s provision of content to online video distributors (“OVDs”). Charter will not be able to avail itself of other distributors’ provisions through its most favored nation provisions if they are inconsistent with this prohibition. The DOJ’s conditions are effective for seven years, although Charter may petition the DOJ to eliminate the conditions after five years.

 
  I-20

--+---------------------------------------

  Skyhook
 Skyhook is subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the United States and in foreign jurisdictions that involve matters central to its technology and ongoing business, including the collection and storage of location information, privacy and data protection, intellectual property, data security and data retention, and other business and compliance-related laws. The application, scope, interpretation, and enforcement of applicable laws and regulations in many of these areas are often uncertain, particularly in the new and rapidly-evolving mobile technology industry in which Skyhook operates.  In addition, existing laws may be interpreted and applied inconsistently from one jurisdiction to another, and inconsistently with Skyhook’s current policies and practices. The introduction of new products or the expansion of Skyhook’s sales activities in certain jurisdictions may subject it to additional laws and regulations, or increase the risk posed to Skyhook’s business by non-compliance. 
 In particular, data protection, privacy, and other laws and regulations can be more restrictive in certain jurisdictions than those in the United States. For example, as a result of its international activities, Skyhook is subject to laws and regulations that dictate whether, how, and under what circumstances it can transfer or process from the European Union (the “EU”) to the United States. In addition, certain activities of Skyhook may be subject to the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) which comes into effect in May 2018.  The GDPR is intended to reach broadly most companies that operate in any manner in the EU, and serves to impose certain requirements on businesses that collect and process “personal data” from individuals in the EU. The GDPR subjects businesses to significant fines and other penalties for non-compliance.  At this early stage, it is unclear how the GDPR will be applied by EU authorities in any specific manner, though the costs of compliance could be high.
 Skyhook is also monitoring additional proposed and pending legislation and regulations in the U.S. and abroad that are related to its technology and business operations, including regulations that implement specific privacy or data protection rules.
 Competition
 Charter
 Residential Services
 Charter faces intense competition for residential customers, both from existing competitors, and, as a result of the rapid development of new technologies, services and products, from new entrants.

 
  I-21


 

 Video competition
 Charter’s residential video service faces competition from direct broadcast satellite (“DBS”) service providers, which have a national footprint and compete in all of Charter’s operating areas. DBS providers offer satellite-delivered pre-packaged programming services that can be received by relatively small and inexpensive receiving dishes. DBS providers offer aggressive promotional pricing, exclusive programming (e.g., NFL Sunday Ticket) and video services that are comparable in many respects to Charter’s residential video service. Charter’s residential video service also faces competition from companies with fiber-based networks, primarily AT&T U-verse, Frontier Communications Corporation (“Frontier”) FiOS and Verizon FiOS, which offer wireline video services in approximately 27%, 8% and 4%, respectively, of Charter’s operating areas. AT&T also owns DIRECTV, and as a combined company provides video service (via IP or satellite) and voice service (via IP or wireless) across Charter’s entire footprint, and delivers video, Internet, voice and mobile services across 45% of Charter’s passings. AT&T also announced the acquisition of Time Warner Inc. in October 2016 which is subject to regulatory approval. If approved, it is not yet clear how AT&T will use the various programming and studio assets it would acquire from Time Warner Inc. to benefit its own products on its four video platforms or what potential program access conditions, as part of any regulatory approval, might apply.
 Charter’s residential video service also faces growing competition from a number of other sources, including companies that deliver linear network programming, movies and television shows on demand and other video content over broadband Internet connections to televisions, computers, tablets and mobile devices. These newer categories of competitors include virtual multichannel video programming distributors (“V-MVPD”)  such as DirecTV NOW, Sling TV, Playstation Vue, YouTube TV and Hulu Live, and direct to consumer products offered by programmers that have not traditionally sold programming directly to consumers, such as HBO Now, CBS All Access and Showtime Anytime. Other online video business models have also developed, including, (i) subscription video on demand (“SVOD”) services such as Netflix, Amazon Prime, and Hulu Plus, (ii) ad-supported free online video products, including YouTube and Hulu, some of which offer programming for free to consumers that Charter currently purchases for a fee, (iii) pay-per-view products, such as iTunes and Amazon Instant, and (iv) additional offerings from wireless providers which continue to integrate and bundle video services and mobile products. Historically, Charter has generally viewed SVOD online video services as complementary to its own video offering, and has developed a cloud-based guide that is capable of incorporating video from many online video services currently offered in the marketplace. As the proliferation of online video services grows, however, services from V-MVPDs and new direct to consumer offerings, as well as piracy and password sharing, could negatively impact the growth of Charter’s video business.
 Internet competition
 Charter’s residential Internet service faces competition from the phone companies’ DSL, fiber-to-the-home (“FTTH”) and wireless broadband offerings, as well as from a variety of companies that offer other forms of online services, including wireless and satellite-based broadband services. AT&T, Frontier FiOS and Verizon’s FiOS are Charter’s primary FTTH competitors. Given the FTTH deployments of Charter’s competitors, launches of broadband services offering 1 gigabits per second (“Gbps”) speed have recently grown. Several competitors, including AT&T, Verizon’s FiOS and Google, deliver 1 Gbps broadband speed in at least a portion of their footprints which overlap Charter’s footprint. DSL service is often offered at prices lower than Charter’s Internet services, although typically at speeds much lower than the minimum speeds Charter offers as part of SPP. Various wireless phone companies are now offering third and fourth generation (3G and 4G) wireless Internet services and some have announced that they intend to offer faster fifth generation (5G) services in the future. Some wireless phone companies offer unlimited data packages to customers. In addition, a growing number of commercial areas, such as retail malls, restaurants and airports, offer Wi-Fi Internet service. Numerous local governments are also considering or actively pursuing publicly subsidized Wi-Fi Internet access networks. These options offer alternatives to cable-based Internet access.
 Voice competition
 Charter’s residential voice service competes with wireless and wireline phone providers, as well as other forms of communication, such as text messaging on cellular phones, instant messaging, social networking services, video conferencing and email. Charter also competes with “over-the-top” phone providers, such as Vonage, Skype, magicJack, Google Voice and Ooma, Inc., as well as companies that sell phone cards at a cost per minute for both national and international service. The increase in the number of different technologies capable of carrying voice services and the number of alternative communication options available to customers as well as the replacement of wireline services by wireless have intensified the competitive environment in which Charter operates its residential voice service. When launched, Charter’s mobile service will compete with other wireless providers such as Verizon, AT&T, T-Mobile US, Inc. (“T-Mobile”) and Sprint Corporation (“Sprint”).

 
  I-22


 

 Regional Competitors
 In some of Charter’s operating areas, other competitors have built networks that offer video, Internet and voice services that compete with its services. For example, in certain markets, Charter’s residential video, Internet and voice services compete with Google Fiber, Cincinnati Bell Inc., Hawaiian Telcom, RCN Telecom Services, LLC, Grande Communications Networks, LLC and WideOpenWest Finance, LLC.
 Additional competition
 In addition to multi-channel video providers, cable systems compete with other sources of news, information and entertainment, including over-the-air television broadcast reception, live events, movie theaters and the Internet. Competition is also posed by fixed wireless and satellite master antenna television systems, or SMATV systems, serving MDUs, such as condominiums, apartment complexes, and private residential communities.
 Business Services
 Charter faces intense competition across each of its business services product offerings. Charter’s small and medium business video, Internet, networking and voice services face competition from a variety of providers as described above. Charter’s enterprise solutions also face competition from the competitors described above as well as other telecommunications carriers, such as metro and regional fiber-based carriers. Charter also competes with cloud, hosting and related service providers and application-service providers. Advertising
 Charter faces intense competition for advertising revenue across many different platforms and from a wide range of local and national competitors. Advertising competition has increased and will likely continue to increase as new advertising avenues seek to attract the same advertisers. Charter competes for advertising revenue against, among others, local broadcast stations, national cable and broadcast networks, radio stations, print media and online advertising companies and content providers. Security and Home Management
 Charter’s IntelligentHome service faces competition from traditional security companies, such as the ADT Corporation, service providers such as Verizon and AT&T, as well as new entrants, such as Vivint, Inc., Alarm.com, Inc. and NEST Labs, Inc.
 Skyhook    Skyhook’s Precision Location Solution competes against (1) other satellite and terrestrial based location technology offerings, such as GPS; (2) other providers of Wi-Fi and cell-based positioning, such as Google and HERE, a former subsidiary of Nokia; and (3) other in-house developed location solutions. There are also a number of new location technologies in development which may further increase competition to be a location solution for new devices and which may require Skyhook to meet more stringent accuracy standards. In addition, Skyhook’s Geospatial Insights services compete against other geofencing and location intelligence offerings from other niche location companies. 
 Skyhook owns significant intellectual property around the world that relates to its location products and services and provides possible competitive advantages. Skyhook’s intellectual property portfolio includes patents, patent applications, copyrights, trade secrets, trademarks, and other intellectual property rights. Skyhook believes that it has a defensible and useful intellectual property portfolio and it actively seeks to protect and license its global intellectual property rights as well as to deter unauthorized use of its intellectual property and other assets. For example, in 2015, Skyhook entered into a settlement agreement and license that resolved a lawsuit that Skyhook had brought against Google, in connection with claims that Google had infringed eight Skyhook patents. In 2016, Skyhook entered into a license agreement to grant to the licensee a perpetual, non-exclusive, non-transferable, worldwide license to patents and patent applications owned by Skyhook in exchange for a lump sum payment. Skyhook has successfully worked with customers to enter into license agreements but cannot provide assurance that current

patents will be enforceable or infringed, that they will deter unauthorized use, that Skyhook’s attempts to secure intellectual property licenses will be successful, or that its additional patent applications will ever be allowed or granted.
 Seasonality and Cyclicality 
 Charter
 Charter’s business is subject to seasonal and cyclical variations. Its results are impacted by the seasonal nature of customers receiving cable services in college and vacation markets. Charter’s revenue is subject to cyclical advertising patterns and changes in viewership levels. Its advertising revenue is generally higher in the second and fourth calendar quarters of each year, due in part to increases in consumer advertising in the spring and in the period leading up to and including the holiday season. U.S. advertising revenue is also cyclical, benefiting in even-numbered years from advertising related to candidates running for political office and issue oriented advertising. Charter’s capital expenditures and trade working capital are also subject to significant seasonality based on the timing of subscriber growth, network programs, specific projects and construction. Employees
 Liberty Broadband
 Liberty Broadband currently does not have any corporate employees. Liberty provides Liberty Broadband with certain services pursuant to a services agreement, and certain of Liberty’s corporate employees and executive officers serve as corporate employees and executive officers of Liberty Broadband. Charter
 As of December 31, 2017, Charter had approximately 94,800 active full-time equivalent employees.
 Skyhook
 As of December 31, 2017, Skyhook had 56 full and part-time employees. None of these employees is represented by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement. Liberty Broadband believes that relations with these employees are good. (d)Financial Information About Geographic Areas
