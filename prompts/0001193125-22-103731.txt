Item 1. | Business.
--------+----------

Overview 
 We are a blank check company incorporated as a Delaware corporation, whose business purpose is to effect a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses, which we refer to as our initial business combination. 
Initial Public Offering 
 On September 8, 2021, we consummated our initial public offering of 28,750,000 units, including 3,750,000 units issued to the underwriters upon full exercise of their over-allotment option. Each unit consists of one share of Class A common stock of the Company, par value $0.0001 per share, and one-half of one redeemable warrant of the Company, with each warrant entitling the holder thereof to purchase one share of Class A common stock for $11.50 per whole share. The units were sold at a price of $10.00 per unit, generating gross proceeds to the Company of $287,500,000. 
 Simultaneously with the closing of the initial public offering, we completed the private sale of an aggregate of 1,133,484 placement units to our sponsor at a purchase price of $10.00 per placement unit, generating gross proceeds of $11,334,840. 
 A total of $293,250,000, comprised of $283,906,250 of the proceeds from the initial public offering (which amount includes $10,062,500 of the underwriters’ deferred discount) and $9,343,750 of the proceeds of the sale of the placement units was placed in the trust account maintained by Continental, acting as trustee. 
 We must complete our initial business combination by September 8, 2022, 12 months from the closing of our initial public offering. If our initial business combination is not consummated by September 8, 2022 (or by March 8, 2023 if we extend the maximum time for completion as permitted under our amended and restated certificate of incorporation), then our existence will terminate, and we will distribute all amounts in the trust account. 
 TMTG Business Combination 
 On October 20, 2021, the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”) with DWAC Merger Sub Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company (“Merger Sub”), Trump Media & Technology Group Corp., a Delaware corporation (“TMTG”), our sponsor, in the capacity as the representative for certain stockholders of the Company, and TMTG’s Chief Legal Officer, in the capacity as the representative for stockholders of TMTG. 
Merger Agreement 
 This section describes the material provisions of the Merger Agreement (as defined below) but does not purport to describe all of the terms thereof. The following summary is qualified in its entirety by reference to the complete text of the Merger Agreement. DWAC’s stockholders and other interested parties are urged to read such agreement in its entirety. Unless otherwise defined herein, the capitalized terms used below are defined in the Merger Agreement. 
General Terms and Effects 
 Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, subject to the terms and conditions set forth therein, (i) upon the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement (the “Closing”), Merger Sub will merge with and into TMTG (the “Merger” and, together with the other transactions contemplated by the Merger 
 
1 

  Agreement, the “Transactions”), with TMTG continuing as the surviving corporation in the Merger and a wholly-owned subsidiary of DWAC. In the Merger, (i) all shares of TMTG common stock (together, “TMTG Stock”) issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than those properly exercising any applicable dissenters rights under Delaware law) will be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration (as defined below); (ii) each outstanding option to acquire shares of TMTG common stock (whether vested or unvested) will be assumed by DWAC and automatically converted into an option to acquire shares of DWAC common stock, with its price and number of shares equitably adjusted based on the conversion ratio of the shares of TMTG common stock into the Merger Consideration and (iii) each outstanding restricted stock unit of TMTG shall be converted into a restricted stock unit relating to shares of DWAC common stock. At the Closing, DWAC will change its name to “Trump Media & Technology Group Corp.”. 
 Merger Consideration 
 The aggregate merger consideration to be paid pursuant to the Merger Agreement to holders of TMTG Stock as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (“TMTG Stockholders” and, together with the holders of TMTG options and restricted stock units immediately prior to the Effective Time, the “TMTG Security Holders”) will be an amount equal to $875,000,000, subject to adjustments for TMTG’s closing debt, net of cash and unpaid transaction expenses (the “Merger Consideration”), plus the additional contingent right to receive the Earnout Shares (as defined below) after the Closing, as described below. The Merger Consideration to be paid to TMTG Stockholders will be paid solely by the delivery of new shares of DWAC common stock, with each valued at the price per share (the “Redemption Price”) at which each DWAC share of common stock is redeemed or converted pursuant to the redemption by DWAC of its public stockholders in connection with DWAC’s initial business combination, as required by DWAC’s amended and restated certificate of incorporation and by-laws and DWAC’s initial public offering prospectus (the “Redemption”). The Merger Consideration will be subject to a post-Closing true up 90 days after the Closing. 
 The Merger Consideration will be allocated among the holders of TMTG’s common stock, pro rata amongst them based on the number of shares of TMTG common stock owned by such stockholder, provided, however, that the Merger Consideration otherwise payable to TMTG Stockholders is subject to the withholding of the Escrow Shares (as defined below) and is subject to reduction for indemnification obligations and purchase price adjustments. 
 Escrow Shares 
 At the Closing, five percent (5%) of the Merger Consideration (the “Escrow Shares”) otherwise issuable to the TMTG Stockholders (allocated pro rata among the TMTG Stockholders based on the Merger Consideration otherwise issuable to them at the Closing) will be deposited into a segregated escrow account with Continental (or such other escrow agent reasonably acceptable to DWAC and TMTG), as escrow agent, and held in escrow together with any dividends, distributions or other income on the Escrow Shares (the “Escrow Property”) in accordance with an escrow agreement to be entered into in connection with the Transactions (the “Escrow Agreement”). The Escrow Property will be held in the escrow account for a period of twelve (12) months after the Closing as the sole and exclusive source of payment for any post-Closing purchase price adjustments and indemnification claims (other than fraud claims (as described below). The TMTG Stockholders will have the right to vote the Escrow Shares while they are held in escrow. 
Earnout 
 In addition to the Merger Consideration set forth above, the TMTG Stockholders will also have a contingent right to receive up to an additional 40,000,000 shares of DWAC common stock (the “Earnout Shares”) after the Closing based on the price performance of the DWAC common stock during the three (3) year period following 
 
2 

  the Closing (the “Earnout Period”). The Earnout Shares shall be earned and payable during the Earnout Period as follows: 
 

• | if the dollar volume-weighted average price (“VWAP”) of DWAC’s common stock equals or exceeds $15.00 per share for any 20 trading days within any 30 trading day period, the Purchaser shall issue to the TMTG Stockholders an aggregate of 15,000,000 Earnout Shares;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | if the VWAP of DWAC’s common stock equals or exceeds $20.00 per share for any 20 trading days within any 30 trading day period, the Purchaser shall issue to the TMTG Stockholders an aggregate of 15,000,000 Earnout Shares; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | if the VWAP of DWAC’s common stock equals or exceeds $30.00 per share for any 20 trading days within any 30 trading day period, the Purchaser shall issue to the TMTG Stockholders an aggregate of 10,000,000 Earnout Shares.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


If there is a final determination that the TMTG Stockholders are entitled to receive Earnout Shares, then such Earnout Shares will be allocated pro rata amongst the TMTG Stockholders. The number of shares of DWAC common stock constituting any earnout payment shall be equitably adjusted for stock splits, stock dividends, combinations, recapitalizations and the like after the Closing. 
 Representations and Warranties 
 The Merger Agreement contains a number of representations and warranties by each of DWAC and TMTG as of the date of the Merger Agreement and as of the date of the Closing. The representations and warranties made by DWAC and TMTG are customary for transactions similar to the Transactions. 
Indemnification and Survival 
 The representations and warranties of TMTG shall survive the Closing for twelve (12) months; provided, however, that fraud claims relating to TMTG shall survive indefinitely. The representations and warranties made by DWAC do not survive the Closing and DWAC does not have any post-Closing indemnification obligations. 
 TMTG Stockholders, severally, will provide indemnification after the Closing for any breach of any representations and warranties or covenants of TMTG in the Merger Agreement and or in any certificate delivered by TMTG, any TMTG Stockholder or the Seller Representative, with such indemnification based on the pro rata Merger Consideration received by each TMTG Stockholder. TMTG Stockholders will also provide indemnification after the Closing for (i) any actions by persons or entities who were holders of equity securities of TMTG or its subsidiaries (including options, warrants, convertible debt or other convertible securities) prior to the Closing arising out of the sale, purchase, termination, cancellation, expiration, redemption or conversion of any such securities or (ii) any indebtedness or unpaid transaction expenses of TMTG or its subsidiaries that were not shown on the final closing statement for the Transaction. 
 Indemnification claims by DWAC for breaches of TMTG representations and warranties, other than certain fundamental representations, are subject to an aggregate deductible of $2,000,000, and there will be no indemnification for the first $2,000,000 of losses. Indemnification claims can only be made against the Escrow Property, which is the sole source of remedy after the Closing, except for fraud claims. Any Escrow Shares that are received by DWAC for indemnification claims will be cancelled by DWAC. The maximum aggregate amount of indemnification payments shall not exceed the amount of Escrow Property, except in the case of fraud claims, in which case it will not exceed the Merger Consideration actually paid (based on the Redemption Price). 
 Covenants of the Parties 
 Each party agreed in the Merger Agreement to use its commercially reasonable efforts to effect the Closing. The Merger Agreement also contains certain customary covenants by each of the parties during the 
 
3 

  period between the signing of the Merger Agreement and the earlier of the Closing or the termination of the Merger Agreement in accordance with its terms (the “Interim Period”), regarding (1) the provision of access to their properties, books and personnel; (2) the operation of their respective businesses in the ordinary course of business; (3) provision of financial statements by TMTG; (4) DWAC’s public filings; (5) no insider trading; (6) notifications of certain breaches, consent requirements or other matters; (7) efforts to consummate the Closing and obtain third party and regulatory approvals; (8) tax matters; (9) further assurances; (10) public announcements; and (11) confidentiality. Each party also agreed during the Interim Period not to solicit or enter into any inquiry, proposal or offer, or any indication of interest in making an offer or proposal for an alternative competing transactions, to notify the others as promptly as practicable in writing of the receipt of any inquiries, proposals or offers, requests for information or requests relating to an alternative competing transaction or any requests for non-public information relating to such transaction, and to keep the others informed of the status of any such inquiries, proposals, offers or requests for information. There are also certain customary post-Closing covenants regarding (1) tax matters; (2) maintenance of books and records; (3) indemnification of directors and officers; and (4) use of trust account proceeds. 
 The Merger Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated thereby requires the approval of both DWAC’s stockholders and TMTG Stockholders. DWAC agreed, as promptly as practicable after the date of the Merger Agreement, to prepare, with reasonable assistance from TMTG, and file with the SEC, a registration statement on Form S-4 in connection with the registration under the Securities Act of the issuance of the shares of DWAC common stock to be issued to the TMTG Stockholders as Merger Consideration (the “Form S-4”), and containing a proxy statement/prospectus for the purpose of DWAC soliciting proxies from the stockholders of DWAC to approve the Merger Agreement, the transactions contemplated thereby and related matters (the “DWAC Stockholder Approval Matters”) at a special meeting of DWAC’s stockholders (the “DWAC Special Meeting”) and providing such stockholders an opportunity to participate in the Redemption. TMTG also agreed in the Merger Agreement to call a meeting of its stockholders or obtain written consent and use its reasonable best efforts to solicit from TMTG Stockholders proxies in favor of the Merger Agreement and the Transactions and certain related matters (the “TMTG Stockholder Approval”), and to take all other actions necessary or advisable to secure such approvals, including enforcing the Voting Agreement (as described below). 
 The parties also agreed to take all necessary action, so that effective at the Closing, the entire board of directors of DWAC (the “Post-Closing Board”) will consist of seven individuals, four of whom shall be independent directors in accordance with Nasdaq requirements. Two of the members of the Post-Closing Board will be individuals (at least one of whom shall be an independent director) designated by DWAC prior to the Closing and five of the members of the Post-Closing Board (at least three of whom shall be independent directors) will be designated by TMTG prior to the Closing. At or prior to Closing, DWAC will provide each member of the Post-Closing Board with a customary director indemnification agreement, in form and substance reasonably acceptable to such director. The parties also agreed to take all action necessary including causing DWAC’s executive officers to resign, so that the individuals serving as the chief executive officer and chief financial officer, respectively, of DWAC immediately after the Closing will be the same individuals as that of TMTG immediately prior to the Closing. 
 During the Interim Period, DWAC, may but is not required to, seek to enter into and consummate subscription agreements with investors relating to a private equity investment and/or backstop arrangements in connection with the Transactions (the “PIPE Investment”), and if so, TMTG agreed to cooperate in connection with such PIPE Investment and use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause such PIPE Investment to occur, including having TMTG’s senior management participate in any investor meetings and roadshows as reasonably requested by DWAC. 
 DWAC agreed to use its best efforts to, as promptly as practicable after the effective date of the Form S-4, obtain the approval of the DWAC stockholders to amend the amended and restated certificate of incorporation of DWAC (the “DWAC Charter Amendment”) to provide that (i) the name of DWAC shall be changed to “Trump Media & Technology Group Corp.” or such other name as mutually agreed upon and 
 
4 

  (ii) remove and change certain provisions in the amended and restated certificate of incorporation related to DWAC’s status as a blank check company, and file the DWAC Charter Amendment with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware. 
 The parties agreed that during the Interim Period, TMTG shall adopt an equity incentive plan and authorize 7,500,000 shares of TMTG Stock for issuance pursuant to such Equity Plan. 
 DWAC and TMTG also agreed to jointly fund any expenses incurred in connection with obtaining an extension by DWAC of the time it has to consummate a business combination; provided that at such time DWAC and TMTG are engaged in the proxy review process with the SEC.

 PIPE Investment 
 On December 4, 2021, in support of the TMTG Business Combination, the Company entered into securities purchase agreements (the “SPAs”) with certain institutional investors (the “PIPE Investors”), pursuant to which the PIPE Investors agreed to purchase up to an aggregate of 1,000,000 shares of the Company’s Series A Convertible Preferred Stock for a purchase price of $1,000 per share for an aggregate commitment of up to $1,000,000,000 in a private placement (the “PIPE”) to be consummated concurrently with the TMTG Business Combination. The shares are currently convertible into 29,761,905 shares of the Company’s common stock, subject to upward adjustment. The shares of Preferred Stock have an initial conversion price per share of $33.60 and are initially convertible into an aggregate of 29,761,905 shares of common stock (subject to adjustment, as described below under “Conversion”). 
 SPA 
 Pursuant to the terms of the SPA, DWAC agreed to certain restrictions on future stock offerings, subject to certain exceptions, including that the company will not issue (or enter into any agreement to issue) any shares of common stock or common stock equivalents until 90 days after either (i) all of the common stock underlying the Preferred Stock is registered, sold or eligible to be sold without registration, or (ii) the first date following the first anniversary of the Closing that no PIPE Investor is an affiliate of the Company ((i) and (ii), collectively, the “Effective Date”). DWAC also agreed that until one year after the Effective Date, the company shall not undertake a reverse or forward stock split or reclassification of the company’s common stock without the prior written consent of the PIPE Investors holding a majority in interest of the shares of Preferred Stock, subject to certain exceptions. 
 
8 

  Each PIPE Investor agreed in the SPA that, with respect to matters arising out of, resulting from, in connection with or relating to the Transaction Documents or the transactions contemplated hereby, it and its affiliates will not have any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies in DWAC’s trust account held for its public stockholders, and agreed not to, and waived any right to, make any claim against the trust account (including any distributions therefrom). 
 The material terms of the Preferred Stock as set forth in the form of Certificate of Designation of Preferences, Rights and Limitations for the Preferred Stock (the “Certificate of Designation”) are summarized below: 
 Rank. The Preferred Stock shall rank (i) senior to all of the common stock of the post-combination company (“Pubco”); (ii) senior to any class or series of capital stock of Pubco hereafter created specifically ranking by its terms junior to any Preferred Stock (“Junior Securities”); (iii) on parity with any class or series of capital stock of Pubco created specifically ranking by its terms on parity with the Preferred Stock (“Parity Securities”); and (iv) junior to any class or series of capital stock of Pubco hereafter created specifically ranking by its terms senior to any Preferred Stock, in each case, as to dividends or distributions of assets upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up of Pubco, whether voluntarily or involuntarily. 
 Dividends. Except for stock dividends or distributions for which certain adjustments are to be made, the holders of Preferred Stock will be entitled to receive dividends equal (on an as-if-converted-to-common-stock basis) to and in the same form as dividends actually paid on shares of the common stock when, as and if such dividends are paid on shares of the common stock; provided, however, to the extent that any such holder’s right to participate in any such distribution would result in such holder exceeding the Beneficial Ownership Limitation (as defined below), then such holder shall not be entitled to participate in such distribution to such extent (or in the beneficial ownership of any shares of common stock as a result of such distribution to such extent) and the portion of such distribution shall be held in abeyance for the benefit of such holder until such time, if ever, as its right thereto would not result in the holder exceeding the Beneficial Ownership Limitation. No other dividends shall be paid on shares of Preferred Stock. 
 Liquidation Preference. In the event of a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of Pubco, the holders of the Preferred Stock will be entitled to receive $0.0001 per share of the respective Preferred Stock held and an amount equal to any dividends declared but unpaid thereon, before any payments are made to holders of common stock or any Junior Securities and pari passu with any distribution to the holders of Parity Securities. After such payment to the holders of Preferred Stock, holders of shares of Preferred Stock will be entitled to receive out of the assets of the company the same amount that a holder of common stock would receive if the Preferred Stock were fully converted (without limitations) to common stock which amounts shall be paid pari passu with all holders of common stock. 
 Conversion. Each share of Preferred Stock may be converted at the holder’s option at any time after issuance into that number of shares of common stock at an initial conversion price of $33.60, which is equal to a 20% discount to DWAC’s volume-weighted average closing price (“VWAP”) for the five consecutive trading days prior to and including December 1, 2021 (subject to adjustments as more fully described below); provided that the number of shares of common stock to be issued pursuant to such conversion does not, when aggregated with all other shares of common stock owned by such holder and its affiliates at such time, result in such holder or any of its affiliates beneficially owning (as determined in accordance with Section 13(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the rules thereunder) in excess of 4.99% (or, upon election by such holder prior to the issuance of any shares of Preferred Stock, 9.99%) of all of the common stock outstanding at such time (the “Beneficial Ownership Limitation”). 
 The conversion price shall automatically adjust downward (each, a “Conversion Price Adjustment”) to the greater of: (i) the product of (x) the average of the ten (10) consecutive daily VWAPs over the ten (10) consecutive trading days following the closing date of the TMTG Business Combination (subject to

  adjustment for splits, stock combinations, reclassification, dividends, and the like) and (y) 60% (i.e., applying a discount of 40%); and (ii) $10.00 (subject to adjustment for splits, stock combinations, reclassification, dividends, and the like). If the formula results in a conversion price over $33.60, there is no downward adjustment. 
 If the Company is unable to include all the shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the Preferred Stock in the Initial Registration Statement (as defined below), at the time of filing of each subsequent registration statement, the then current conversion price is subject to downward adjustment based on the formula set forth above, where the 10-day VWAP is measured from the 10-day period following the effective date of the applicable registration statement, so that upon each Conversion Price Adjustment, for so long as a holder still holds any shares of Preferred Stock (including, for the avoidance of doubt, a single share or any fraction of a single share), the Preferred Stock held by such holder shall subsequently be convertible into the number of shares of common stock such that the holder will be entitled to the aggregate number of shares of common stock based on its initial purchase of Preferred Stock pursuant to the SPA convertible at the conversion price then in effect following the applicable Conversion Price Adjustment. There is no further downward adjustment if the new Conversion Price Adjustment is greater than the then current conversion price. 
 Voting. The Preferred Stock shall have no voting rights, except that as long as any shares of Preferred Stock are outstanding, the company shall not, without the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the then outstanding shares of the Preferred Stock, (a) alter or change adversely the powers, preferences or rights given to the Preferred Stock or alter or amend the Certificate of Designation, (b) amend its certificate of incorporation or other charter documents in any manner that adversely affects any rights of the holders, (c) increase the number of authorized shares of Preferred Stock, or (d) enter into any agreement with respect to any of the foregoing. 
 Registration Rights. The PIPE Investors were also given registration rights in a registration rights agreement (the “Registration Rights Agreement”) pursuant to which DWAC will be required to file a resale registration statement for all of the shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the Preferred Stock held by the PIPE Investors within 10 days following the filing of the proxy statement/prospectus to be filed in connection with the TMTG Business Combination and shall be declared effective no later than the closing of the TMTG Business Combination (the “Initial Registration Statement”). Thereafter, Pubco will be required to register and to maintain the registration for all shares underlying the Preferred Stock until the Effective Date. 
 Liquidated Damages. Failure by Pubco to timely file and to obtain and maintain effectiveness of any registration statement required to be filed under the Registration Rights Agreement will result in Pubco paying to each PIPE Investor an amount in cash, as liquidated damages and not as a penalty, equal to (A) with respect to the first two months, 2% of the subscription price paid by each PIPE Investor for any unregistered registrable securities, plus (B) with respect to the third month and beyond, 6% of the subscription price paid by each PIPE Investor for any unregistered registrable securities. In no case will the maximum aggregate liquidated damages payable to a PIPE Investor exceed 20% of the subscription price paid by such PIPE Investor. If Pubco fails to pay any liquidated damages in full within seven days after the date payable, Pubco will pay interest thereon at a rate of 18% per annum (or such lesser maximum amount that is permitted to be paid by applicable law) to the PIPE Investor, until such amounts, plus all such interest thereon, are paid in full, subject to the aggregate limitation. 
 Liquidated Damages Escrow Account. Upon the Closing, Pubco will deposit into a third party escrow account solely for purposes of paying the holders any required liquidated damages as they accrue (the “Liquidated Damages Escrow Account”), an amount equal to 20% of the aggregate subscription price paid by all the PIPE Investors for any registrable securities not, on the Closing, covered by (i.e. eligible for resale pursuant to) the Initial Registration Statement. Any balance remaining in the Liquidated Damages Escrow Account shall 
 
10 

  be released to Pubco once all registrable securities are included in an effective registration statement. In the event all registrable securities are included in the Initial Registration Statement, the Liquidated Damages Escrow Account will not be required. 
 Waiver Letter 
 In connection with the PIPE and in accordance with Section 4.3(b)(ii) of DWAC’s amended and restated certificate of incorporation, ARC Global Investments II LLC, as majority holder of DWAC’s Class B common stock, waived certain anti-dilution rights of the holders of Class B common stock (the “Class B Holders”) to any increase in the number of shares of Class A common stock issuable upon conversion of the Class B common stock. In exchange for such waiver, and in the event that the transactions contemplated by the SPA are consummated in accordance with its terms, the Class B Holders will be entitled to receive (i) an aggregate of 744,048 shares of Class A common stock (the “Anti-dilution Shares”) and (ii) warrants to purchase an aggregate of 744,048 shares of Class A common stock (the “Warrants”) at an exercise price per share of $33.60 for a term of five years. The Warrants shall otherwise have terms, including but not limited to registration rights, that are substantially identical to the warrants previously issued to the Class B Holders and shall not contain any anti-dilution or reset provisions, except for standard adjustments for any stock splits, stock dividends, recapitalizations and similar events. 
 The Anti-dilution Shares and the Warrants shall be subject to the same lock-up provisions as are applicable to the shares and warrants previously issued to the Class B Holders; provided, however, in no event shall such lock-up period terminate before the date that is 30 days following the earlier of (i) the date that all shares underlying the Preferred Stock have been registered on an effective registration statement or (ii) one year following the Closing. 
 In connection with the PIPE, at the Closing DWAC will pay EF Hutton, as DWAC’s placement agent and capital markets advisor, a fee equal to 2.5% of the gross proceeds of the PIPE. Assuming no redemptions by DWAC’s stockholders, the PIPE, together with amounts delivered from DWAC’s trust account, is expected to generate approximately $1.25 billion of net proceeds, after deducting estimated transaction fees and related expenses. Such funds will be used to fund the payment of expenses incurred in connection with the TMTG Business Combination, liabilities owed by DWAC and to otherwise provide working capital and funds for corporate purposes for Pubco following the Closing. 
 The closing of the PIPE is conditioned on the concurrent closing of the TMTG Business Combination and other customary closing conditions and is terminable by the PIPE Investors if the TMTG Business Combination has not closed by the Outside Date. Other than as specifically discussed, this Report does not assume the closing of either the TMTG Business Combination or the PIPE. 
 The SPA and related agreements are further described in the Form 8-K filed by us on December 6, 2021. The Company intends to file with the SEC the Form S-4, which will include a preliminary proxy statement of the Company, and a prospectus in connection with the TMTG Business Combination. For additional information regarding the SPA and the PIPE, including a discussion of risks and uncertainties associated with the PIPE, please see the Form S-4 which the Company intends to file after the filing of this Report. 
 Our Search for Business Combination Opportunities 
 To date, our efforts have been limited to organizational activities, as well as activities related to our initial public offering and investigating potential business combinations. As of the date of this Report, the Company anticipates that the TMTG Business Combination will be consummated on or before the Outside Date. While we have entered into a Merger Agreement with TMTG, in the event we are unable to consummate the TMTG Business Combination, we will continue to pursue a business combination. 
Business Strategy 
 While we may pursue an initial business combination target in any industry or geographic location, in the event the TMTG Business Combination is not consummated, we intend to focus our search on middle market and 
 
11 

  emerging growth technology-focused companies in the Americas, in SaaS and technology or FinTech and Financial Services. Most of these companies will ultimately need to consolidate to achieve the scale necessary to attain high revenue growth and attractive profitability. We believe that acquiring a leading emerging growth technology company will provide a platform to fund consolidation and fuel growth for our company. Segments we might explore include, but are not limited to, technology and technologically enabled industrial, supply chain, logistics, vehicles, security and manufacturing businesses. There is no restriction in the geographic location of targets we can pursue, although we intend to initially prioritize the Americas as the geographical focus. 
 Competitive Advantages 
 In the event the TMTG Business Combination is not consummated, we intend to capitalize on the following competitive advantages in our pursuit of a target company:

• | Established Deal Sourcing Network. We believe the strong track record of our management team and financial advisor will enable us to get access to quality deal pipeline. In addition, we believe we, through our management team and financial advisor, have contacts and sources from which to generate acquisition opportunities and possibly seek complementary follow-on business arrangements. These contacts and sources include those in government, private and public companies, private equity and venture capital funds, investment bankers, attorneys and accountants.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Status as a Publicly Listed Acquisition Company. We believe our structure makes us an attractive business combination partner to prospective target businesses, such as TMTG. As a publicly listed company, we offer a target business an alternative to the traditional initial public offering process. We believe that some target businesses will favor this alternative, which we believe is less expensive, while offering greater certainty of execution, than the traditional initial public offering process. During an initial public offering, there are typically underwriting fees and marketing expenses, which would be costlier than a business combination with us. Furthermore, once a proposed business combination is approved by our stockholders (if applicable) and the transaction is consummated, the target business will have effectively become public, whereas an initial public offering is always subject to the underwriter’s ability to complete the offering, as well as general market conditions that could prevent the offering from occurring. Once public, we believe our target business would have greater access to capital and additional means of creating management incentives that are better aligned with stockholders’ interests than it would as a private company. It can offer further benefits by augmenting a company’s profile among potential new customers and vendors and aid in attracting talented management staffs.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Industry Opportunity 
 While we may acquire a business in any industry, in the event the TMTG Business Combination is not consummated, our focus will be in the industries referenced above. We believe that our target industries are attractive for a number of reasons: 
 SaaS and Technology 
 We believe we are currently in the midst of a secular shift in the SaaS sub-segment of the technology industry, which is driving rapid growth in both annual spending and the number of actionable acquisition targets requiring a public market solution. This is driven in part by large corporations, which are constantly upgrading legacy technology and expanding their SaaS toolkits. We believe another major driver are new corporations which heavily rely in SaaS solutions given their cost-efficiency and scalability. Specifically, we see great opportunity in companies that are constantly evolving. 
 Private technology companies are fundamentally changing the world at an unprecedented pace by establishing new markets, creating new experiences and disrupting legacy industries. Key technological advances and practices, such as cloud computing, data analytics and intelligence platforms, open-source software development, developer-focused software tools, and software-defined networking, storage and computing, are 
 
12 

  allowing technology companies to rapidly effect change in every major sector of the global economy. Agile private technology companies have embraced these advances and practices to create business models and address market needs that will enable them to reach significant financial scale and create stockholder value. 
 FinTech and Financial Services 
 The FinTech landscape has matured from a niche venture market to an expansive global industry comprised of numerous large-scale institutionalized businesses that consistently experience strong growth in revenue and profits. FinTech adoption by both consumers and businesses continues to benefit from robust secular tailwinds including the growth in digital commerce, the proliferation of mobile technology, the ubiquitous acceptance of digital payments, and continuous technological advancement, positioning the sector for long-term growth. In 2019, the EY Global FinTech Adoption Index estimated that 64% of digitally active consumers globally utilized FinTech products and that consumer awareness of FinTech is even higher. 
 The number of technology company initial public offerings has also diminished. An average of 159 technology companies went public each year during the 1990s, according to the research firm Deal Logic. Since 2010, however, that yearly average plummeted to only 38, a 76% drop. That smaller initial public offering market has also been predominantly focused on so-called “unicorn” companies (meaning start-up, typically VC-backed companies, often focused on technology, with valuations of over $1 billion). The median market capitalization of a venture-backed initial public offering was about $660 million in 2012; in 2017 it was $1.1 billion, based on data from the University of Florida. We believe this means that very promising, but non-unicorn companies (such as we will likely target for our initial business combination) are in many instances missing out on the ability to do a traditional initial public offering. 
 Our management team believes that these factors present an intriguing paradox: a growing number of new companies have attracted more private capital. Yet once they flourish, they have a narrower exit route. In addition, that exit route is often reserved for larger companies, a substantial disadvantage for smaller private technology companies. 
 Ultimately, we believe this same paradox creates a long-term opportunity for stockholder return via an initial business combination with a smaller, high-performing private technology company or companies. Additionally, it provides a persuasive argument for such companies to join with us, as we believe they have fewer exit options than presently exist for unicorns. 
 Acquisition Criteria 
 Consistent with our strategy, we have identified the following general criteria and guidelines that we believe are important in evaluating prospective target businesses. In the event the TMTG Business Combination is not consummated, we intend to use these criteria and guidelines in evaluating acquisition opportunities, but we may decide to enter into our initial business combination with a target business that does not meet these criteria and guidelines. 

• | Target Size: consistent with our investment thesis as described above, we plan to target businesses of total enterprise value from $400 million to $2 billion in the Americas, companies in the SaaS and Technology or Fintech and Financial Services.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Businesses with Revenue and Earnings Growth Potential. We will seek to acquire one or more businesses that have the potential for significant revenue and earnings growth through a combination of both existing and new product development, increased production capacity, expense reduction and synergistic follow-on acquisitions resulting in increased operating leverage.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Businesses with Potential for Strong Free Cash Flow Generation. We will seek to acquire one or more businesses that have the potential to generate strong, stable and increasing free cash flow. We may also seek to prudently leverage this cash flow in order to enhance stockholder value.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



13 

  
• | Strong Management. We will seek companies that have strong, experienced management teams in place, or are a platform to assemble an effective management team with a track record of driving growth and profitability. We will spend significant time assessing a company’s leadership and human fabric, and maximizing its efficiency over time.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Benefit from Being a Public Company. We intend to acquire one or more businesses that will benefit from being publicly-traded and can effectively utilize the broader access to capital and the public profile that are associated with being a publicly traded company.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Defensible Market Position. We intend to acquire one or more businesses that have a defensible market position, with demonstrated advantages when compared to their competitors and which create barriers to entry against new competitors.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


These criteria are not intended to be exhaustive. Any evaluation relating to the merits of a particular initial business combination may be based, to the extent relevant, on these general guidelines as well as other considerations, factors and criteria that from time to time our management may deem relevant. 
 Sourcing of Potential Initial Business Combination Targets 
 Certain members of our management team have developed a wide network of professional services contacts and business relationships. The members of our board of directors also have significant executive management and public company experience with technology related companies and bring additional relationships that further broaden our network. 
 This network has provided our management team with a flow of referrals that have resulted in numerous transactions. In the event that the TMTG Business Combination is not consummated, we believe that the network of contacts and relationships of our management team will provide us with an important source of acquisition opportunities. In addition, we anticipate that target business candidates will be brought to our attention from various unaffiliated sources, including investment market participants, private equity groups, investment banks, consultants, accounting firms and large business enterprises. 
 Members of our management team and our independent directors directly or indirectly own founder shares and/or placement units and, accordingly, may have a conflict of interest in determining whether a particular target business is an appropriate business with which to effectuate our initial business combination. Further, each of our officers and directors may have a conflict of interest with respect to evaluating a particular business combination if the retention or resignation of any such officers and directors was included by a target business as a condition to any agreement with respect to our initial business combination. 
 In addition, each of our officers and directors presently has, and any of them in the future may have additional, fiduciary or contractual obligations to other entities pursuant to which such officer or director is or will be required to present a business combination opportunity to such entity. In particular, Patrick Orlando, our Chief Executive Officer and Chairman, serves as Chief Executive officer and director of Benessere Capital Acquisition Corp. and Eric Swider and Justin Shaner, our directors, both serve as directors of Benessere Capital Acquisition Corp. Benessere Capital Acquisition Corp. is a special purpose acquisition company that focuses its search for a business combination on technology-focused middle market and emerging growth companies in North, Central and South America, which overlaps with the industry and geographic scope of our search. Mr. Orlando also serves as a director of Maquia Capital Acquisition Corporation, a special purpose acquisition corporation that initially focuses its search for a business combination with technology-focused middle market and emerging growth companies in North America, which also overlaps with the industry and geographic scope of our search. As of the date of this Report, Bennessere Capital Acquisition Corp. had entered into a Business Combination Agreement dated November 23, 2021 with eCombustible Energy LLC while Maquia Capital Acquisition Corporation had not entered into a business combination. 
 
14 

  In addition, our sponsor and our officers and directors may sponsor or form other special purpose acquisition companies similar to ours or may pursue other business or investment ventures during the period in which we are seeking an initial business combination. Any such companies, businesses or investments may present additional conflicts of interest in pursuing an initial business combination. However, we do not believe that any such potential conflicts would materially affect our ability to complete our initial business combination. 
 Status as a Public Company 
 We believe our structure makes us an attractive business combination partner to target businesses such as TMTG. As a public company, we offer a target business an alternative to the traditional initial public offering through a merger or other business combination with us. Following an initial business combination, we believe the target business would have greater access to capital and additional means of creating management incentives that are better aligned with stockholders’ interests than it would as a private company. A target business can further benefit by augmenting its profile among potential new customers and vendors and aid in attracting talented employees. In a business combination transaction with us, the owners of the target business may, for example, exchange their shares of stock in the target business for our shares of Class A common stock (or shares of a new holding company) or for a combination of our shares of Class A common stock and cash, allowing us to tailor the consideration to the specific needs of the sellers. 
 Although there are various costs and obligations associated with being a public company, we believe target businesses will find this method a more expeditious and cost effective method to becoming a public company than the typical initial public offering. The typical initial public offering process takes a significantly longer period of time than the typical business combination transaction process, and there are significant expenses in the initial public offering process, including underwriting discounts and commissions, marketing and road show efforts that may not be present to the same extent in connection with an initial business combination with us. 
 Furthermore, once a proposed initial business combination is completed, the target business will have effectively become public, whereas an initial public offering is always subject to the underwriters’ ability to complete the offering, as well as general market conditions, which could delay or prevent the offering from occurring or could have negative valuation consequences. Following an initial business combination, we believe the target business would then have greater access to capital and an additional means of providing management incentives consistent with stockholders’ interests and the ability to use its shares as currency for acquisitions. Being a public company can offer further benefits by augmenting a company’s profile among potential new customers and vendors and aid in attracting talented employees. 
 While we believe that our structure and our management team’s backgrounds make us an attractive business partner, some potential target businesses may view our status as a blank check company, such as our lack of an operating history and our ability to seek stockholder approval of any proposed initial business combination, negatively. 
 We are an “emerging growth company,” as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act, as modified by the JOBS Act. As such, we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not “emerging growth companies” including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the independent registered public accounting firm attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. If some investors find our securities less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our securities and the prices of our securities may be more volatile. 
 In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an “emerging growth company” can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying 
 
15 

  with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an “emerging growth company” can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have taken advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period. 
 We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (1) (a) December 31, 2026, (b) the last day of the fiscal year in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.07 billion, or (c) the last day of the fiscal year in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our Class A common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the prior June 30th, and (2) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt securities during the prior three-year period. 
 Additionally, we are a “smaller reporting company” as defined in Rule 10(f)(1) of Regulation S-K. Smaller reporting companies may take advantage of certain reduced disclosure obligations, including, among other things, providing only two years of audited financial statements. We will remain a smaller reporting company until the last day of the fiscal year in which (1) the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates equals or exceeds $250 million as of the end of the prior June 30th, or (2) our annual revenues equaled or exceeded $100 million during such completed fiscal year and the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the prior June 30th. 
 Financial Position 
  With funds available for an initial business combination initially in the amount of $293,257,098 before payment of $10,062,500 of deferred underwriting fees, before fees and expenses associated with our initial business combination (other than deferred underwriting fees), we offer a target business a variety of options such as creating a liquidity event for its owners, providing capital for the potential growth and expansion of its operations or strengthening its balance sheet by reducing its debt or leverage ratio. Because we are able to complete our initial business combination using our cash, debt or equity securities, or a combination of the foregoing, we have the flexibility to use the most efficient combination that will allow us to tailor the consideration to be paid to the target business to fit its needs and desires. 
Effecting Our Initial Business Combination 
 We are not presently engaged in, and we will not engage in, any operations until we consummate our initial business combination. We intend to effectuate our initial business combination using cash from the proceeds of our initial public offering and the sale of the placement units, the proceeds of the sale of our shares in connection with our initial business combination (pursuant to backstop agreements we may enter into or otherwise), shares issued to the owners of the target, debt issued to bank or other lenders or the owners of the target, or a combination of the foregoing. We may seek to complete our initial business combination with a company or business that may be financially unstable or in its early stages of development or growth, which would subject us to the numerous risks inherent in such companies and businesses. 
 If our initial business combination is paid for using equity or debt securities, or not all of the funds released from the trust account are used for payment of the consideration in connection with our initial business combination or used for redemptions of our Class A common stock, we may apply the balance of the cash released to us from the trust account for general corporate purposes, including for maintenance or expansion of operations of the post-transaction company, the payment of principal or interest due on indebtedness incurred in completing our initial business combination, to fund the purchase of other companies or for working capital. 
 As in the case of the TMTG Business Combination, we may seek to raise additional funds through a private offering of debt or equity securities in connection with the completion of our initial business combination, and we may effectuate our initial business combination using the proceeds of such offering rather than using the amounts held in the trust account. In addition, we intend to target businesses larger than we could acquire with the net proceeds of our initial public offering and the sale of the placement units, and may as a result be required 
 
16 

  to seek additional financing to complete such proposed initial business combination. Subject to compliance with applicable securities laws, we would expect to complete such financing only simultaneously with the completion of our initial business combination. In the case of an initial business combination funded with assets other than the trust account assets, our proxy materials or tender offer documents disclosing the initial business combination would disclose the terms of the financing and, only if required by applicable law or stock exchange requirements, we would seek stockholder approval of such financing. There are no prohibitions on our ability to raise funds privately, or through loans in connection with our initial business combination. 
 Sources of Target Businesses 
 If the TMTG Business Combination is not consummated, we anticipate that target business candidates will be brought to our attention from various unaffiliated sources, including investment bankers and investment professionals, as a result of being solicited by us by calls or mailings. These sources may also introduce us to target businesses in which they think we may be interested on an unsolicited basis, since many of these sources will have read this Report and know what types of businesses we are targeting. Our officers and directors, as well as our sponsor and their affiliates, may also bring to our attention target business candidates that they become aware of through their business contacts as a result of formal or informal inquiries or discussions they may have, as well as attending trade shows or conventions. In addition, we expect to receive a number of deal flow opportunities that would not otherwise necessarily be available to us as a result of the business relationships of our officers and directors and our sponsor and their affiliates. We may engage these firms or other individuals in the future, in which event we may pay a finder’s fee, consulting fee, advisory fee or other compensation to be determined in an arm’s length negotiation based on the terms of the transaction. We will engage a finder only to the extent our management determines that the use of a finder may bring opportunities to us that may not otherwise be available to us or if finders approach us on an unsolicited basis with a potential transaction that our management determines is in our best interest to pursue. Payment of finder’s fees is customarily tied to completion of a transaction, in which case any such fee will be paid out of the funds held in the trust account. In no event, however, will our sponsor or any of our existing officers or directors be paid any finder’s fee, reimbursement, consulting fee, monies in respect of any payment of a loan or other compensation by the company prior to, or in connection with any services rendered for any services they render in order to effectuate, the completion of our initial business combination (regardless of the type of transaction that it is). None of our sponsor, executive officers or directors, or any of their respective affiliates, will be allowed to receive any compensation, finder’s fees or consulting fees from a prospective business combination target in connection with a contemplated initial business combination except as set forth herein. We have agreed to pay Benessere Enterprises Inc., an affiliate of our sponsor, a total of $15,000 per month for office space, utilities and secretarial and administrative support and to reimburse our sponsor for any out-of-pocket expenses related to identifying, investigating and completing an initial business combination. Some of our officers and directors may enter into employment or consulting agreements with the post-transaction company following our initial business combination. The presence or absence of any such fees or arrangements will not be used as a criterion in our selection process of an initial business combination candidate. 
 TMTG is not affiliated with our sponsor or any of our officers or directors, but in the event we do not consummate the TMTG Business Combination, we are not prohibited from pursuing an initial business combination with an initial business combination target that is affiliated with our sponsor, officers or directors or making the initial business combination through a joint venture or other form of shared ownership with our sponsor, officers or directors. In the event we seek to complete our initial business combination with an initial business combination target that is affiliated with our sponsor, officers or directors, we, or a committee of independent directors, would obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm or another independent entity that commonly renders valuation opinions that such an initial business combination is fair to our company from a financial point of view. We are not required to obtain such an opinion in any other context. 
 If any of our officers or directors becomes aware of an initial business combination opportunity that falls within the line of business of any entity to which he or she has pre-existing fiduciary or contractual obligations, he or she may be required to present such business combination opportunity to such entity prior to presenting 
 
17 

  such business combination opportunity to us (including Benessere Capital Acquisition Corp. and Maquia Capital Acquisition Corporation). Our officers and directors currently have certain relevant fiduciary duties or contractual obligations that may take priority over their duties to us. 
 Selection of a Target Business and Structuring of our Initial Business Combination 
 Nasdaq rules require that we must complete one or more business combinations having an aggregate fair market value of at least 80% of the value of the assets held in the trust account (excluding the deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable on the interest earned on the trust account) at the time of our signing a definitive agreement in connection with our initial business combination. The fair market value of our initial business combination will be determined by our board of directors based upon one or more standards generally accepted by the financial community, such as discounted cash flow valuation, a valuation based on trading multiples of comparable public businesses or a valuation based on the financial metrics of M&A transactions of comparable businesses. If our board of directors is not able to independently determine the fair market value of our initial business combination, we will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm or another independent entity that commonly renders valuation opinions with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria. While we consider it unlikely that our board of directors will not be able to make an independent determination of the fair market value of our initial business combination, it may be unable to do so if it is less familiar or experienced with the business of a particular target or if there is a significant amount of uncertainty as to the value of a target’s assets or prospects. We do not intend to purchase multiple businesses in unrelated industries in conjunction with our initial business combination. Subject to this requirement, our management will virtually have unrestricted flexibility in identifying and selecting one or more prospective target businesses, although we will not be permitted to effectuate our initial business combination with another blank check company or a similar company with nominal operations. 
 In any case, we will only complete an initial business combination in which we will own or acquire 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquire a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. If we own or acquire less than 100% of the equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses, the portion of such business or businesses that are owned or acquired by the post-transaction company is what will be taken into account for purposes of Nasdaq’s 80% fair market value test. 
 To the extent we effect our initial business combination with a company or business that may be financially unstable or in its early stages of development or growth we may be affected by numerous risks inherent in such company or business. Although our management will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in a particular target business, we cannot assure you that we will properly ascertain or assess all significant risk factors. 
 In evaluating a prospective business target, we expect to conduct a thorough due diligence review, which may encompass, among other things, meetings with incumbent management and employees, document reviews, interviews of customers and suppliers, inspection of facilities, as well as a review of financial and other information that will be made available to us. 
 The time required to select and evaluate a target business and to structure and complete our initial business combination, and the costs associated with this process, are not currently ascertainable with any degree of certainty. Any costs incurred with respect to the identification and evaluation of a prospective target business with which our initial business combination is not ultimately completed will result in our incurring losses and will reduce the funds we can use to complete another business combination. 
 Lack of Business Diversification 
 For an indefinite period of time after the completion of our initial business combination, the prospects for our success may depend entirely on the future performance of a single business. Unlike other entities that have 
 
18 

  the resources to complete business combinations with multiple entities in one or several industries, it is probable that we will not have the resources to diversify our operations and mitigate the risks of being in a single line of business. In addition, we intend to focus our search for an initial business combination in a single industry. By completing our initial business combination with only a single entity, our lack of diversification may: 
 

• | subject us to negative economic, competitive and regulatory developments, any or all of which may have a substantial adverse impact on the particular industry in which we operate after our initial business combination, and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | cause us to depend on the marketing and sale of a single product or limited number of products or services.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Limited Ability to Evaluate the Target’s Management Team 
 Although we intend to closely scrutinize the management of a prospective target business, including that of TMTG, when evaluating the desirability of effecting our initial business combination with that business, our assessment of the target business’ management may not prove to be correct. In addition, the future management may not have the necessary skills, qualifications or abilities to manage a public company. Furthermore, the future role of members of our management team, if any, in the target business cannot presently be stated with any certainty. The determination as to whether any of the members of our management team will remain with the combined company will be made at the time of our initial business combination. While it is possible that one or more of our directors will remain associated in some capacity with us following our initial business combination, it is unlikely that any of them will devote their full efforts to our affairs subsequent to our initial business combination. Moreover, we cannot assure you that members of our management team will have significant experience or knowledge relating to the operations of the particular target business. 
 We cannot assure you that any of our key personnel will remain in senior management or advisory positions with the combined company. The determination as to whether any of our key personnel will remain with the combined company will be made at the time of our initial business combination. 
 Following an initial business combination, we may seek to recruit additional managers to supplement the incumbent management of the target business. We cannot assure you that we will have the ability to recruit additional managers, or that additional managers will have the requisite skills, knowledge or experience necessary to enhance the incumbent management. 
 Stockholders May Not Have the Ability to Approve Our Initial Business Combination 
 We may conduct redemptions without a stockholder vote pursuant to the tender offer rules of the SEC. However, we will seek stockholder approval of the TMTG Business Combination and, if the TMTG Business Combination is not consummated, of any future proposed initial business combination if it is required by applicable law or applicable stock exchange listing requirements, or we may decide to seek stockholder approval for business or other legal reasons. Presented in the table below is a graphic explanation of the types of initial business combinations we may consider and whether stockholder approval is currently required under Delaware law for each such transaction. 

Type of Transaction | WhetherStockholderApproval isRequired
Purchase of assets | No 
Purchase of stock of target not involving a merger with the company | No 
Merger of target into a subsidiary of the company | No 
Merger of the company with a target | Yes 



19 

  Under Nasdaq’s listing rules, stockholder approval would be required for our initial business combination if, for example: 
 

• | we issue shares of Class A common stock that will be equal to or in excess of 20% of the number of shares of our Class A common stock then outstanding (other than in a public offering);
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | any of our directors, officers or substantial stockholders (as defined by Nasdaq rules) has a 5% or greater interest (or such persons collectively have a 10% or greater interest), directly or indirectly, in the target business or assets to be acquired or otherwise and the present or potential issuance of common stock could result in an increase in outstanding common stock or voting power of 5% or more; or
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the issuance or potential issuance of common stock will result in our undergoing a change of control.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Permitted Purchases of our Securities 
 If we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our initial business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our sponsor, initial stockholders, directors, officers, advisors or their affiliates may purchase public shares or public warrants in privately negotiated transactions or in the open market either prior to or following the completion of our initial business combination. There is no limit on the number of shares our initial stockholders, directors, officers or their affiliates may purchase in such transactions, subject to compliance with applicable law and Nasdaq rules. However, they have no current commitments, plans or intentions to engage in such transactions and have not formulated any terms or conditions for any such transactions. If they engage in such transactions, they will not make any such purchases when they are in possession of any material nonpublic information not disclosed to the seller or if such purchases are prohibited by Regulation M under the Exchange Act. We do not currently anticipate that such purchases, if any, would constitute a tender offer subject to the tender offer rules under the Exchange Act or a going-private transaction subject to the going-private rules under the Exchange Act; however, if the purchasers determine at the time of any such purchases that the purchases are subject to such rules, the purchasers will comply with such rules. Any such purchases will be reported pursuant to Section 13 and Section 16 of the Exchange Act to the extent such purchasers are subject to such reporting requirements. None of the funds held in the trust account will be used to purchase shares or public warrants in such transactions prior to completion of our initial business combination. 
 The purpose of any such purchases of shares could be to vote such shares in favor of the initial business combination and thereby increase the likelihood of obtaining stockholder approval of the initial business combination or to satisfy a closing condition in an agreement with a target that requires us to have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash at the closing of our initial business combination, where it appears that such requirement would otherwise not be met. The purpose of any such purchases of public warrants could be to reduce the number of public warrants outstanding or to vote such warrants on any matters submitted to the warrant holders for approval in connection with our initial business combination. Any such purchases of our securities may result in the completion of our initial business combination that may not otherwise have been possible. In addition, if such purchases are made, the public “float” of our shares of Class A common stock or warrants may be reduced and the number of beneficial holders of our securities may be reduced, which may make it difficult to maintain or obtain the quotation, listing or trading of our securities on a national securities exchange. 
 Our sponsor, officers, directors and/or their affiliates anticipate that they may identify the stockholders with whom our sponsor, officers, directors or their affiliates may pursue privately negotiated purchases by either the stockholders contacting us directly or by our receipt of redemption requests submitted by stockholders following our mailing of proxy materials in connection with our initial business combination. To the extent that our sponsor, officers, directors or their affiliates enter into a private purchase, they would identify and contact only potential selling stockholders who have expressed their election to redeem their shares for a pro rata share of the 
 
20 

  trust account or vote against our initial business combination, whether or not such stockholder has already submitted a proxy with respect to our initial business combination. Our sponsor, officers, directors or their affiliates will only purchase public shares if such purchases comply with Regulation M under the Exchange Act and the other federal securities laws. 
 Any purchases by our sponsor, officers, directors and/or their affiliates who are affiliated purchasers under Rule 10b-18 under the Exchange Act will only be made to the extent such purchases are able to be made in compliance with Rule 10b-18, which is a safe harbor from liability for manipulation under Section 9(a)(2) and Rule 10b-5 of the Exchange Act. Rule 10b-18 has certain technical requirements that must be complied with in order for the safe harbor to be available to the purchaser. Our sponsor, officers, directors and/or their affiliates will not make purchases of common stock if the purchases would violate Section 9(a)(2) or Rule 10b-5 of the Exchange Act. We expect that any such purchases will be reported pursuant to Section 13 and Section 16 of the Exchange Act to the extent such purchases are subject to such reporting requirements. 
 Redemption Rights for Public Stockholders upon Completion of our Initial Business Combination 
 We will provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their shares of Class A common stock upon the completion of our initial business combination, including the TMTG Business Combination, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account as of two business days prior to the consummation of the initial business combination including interest earned on the funds held in the trust account and not previously released to us to pay our taxes, divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, subject to the limitations described herein. The amount in the trust account is initially anticipated to be approximately $10.20 per public share. The per-share amount we will distribute to investors who properly redeem their shares will not be reduced by the deferred underwriting commissions we will pay to the underwriters. Our sponsor, officers and directors have entered into a letter agreement with us, pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to any founder shares and placement shares and any public shares held by them in connection with the completion of our initial business combination. Our anchor investors have entered into investment agreements with us and our sponsor, pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to any founder shares held by them in connection with the completion of our initial business combination. 
Manner of Conducting Redemptions 
 We will provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their public shares of Class A common stock upon the completion of our initial business combination either (i) in connection with a stockholder meeting called to approve the initial business combination, as in the case of the TMTG Business Combination, or (ii) by means of a tender offer. The decision as to whether we will seek stockholder approval of a proposed initial business combination or conduct a tender offer will be made by us, solely in our discretion, and will be based on a variety of factors such as the timing of the transaction and whether the terms of the transaction would require us to seek stockholder approval under the law or stock exchange listing requirement. Under Nasdaq rules, asset acquisitions and stock purchases would not typically require stockholder approval while direct mergers with our company where we do not survive and any transactions where we issue more than 20% of our outstanding common stock or seek to amend our amended and restated certificate of incorporation would require stockholder approval. If we structure an initial business combination with a target company in a manner that requires stockholder approval, we will not have discretion as to whether to seek a stockholder vote to approve the proposed initial business combination. We may conduct redemptions without a stockholder vote pursuant to the tender offer rules of the SEC unless stockholder approval is required by law or stock exchange listing requirements or we choose to seek stockholder approval for business or other legal reasons. So long as we maintain a listing for our securities on Nasdaq, we will be required to comply with such rules. 
 
21 

  If stockholder approval of the transaction is required by law or stock exchange listing requirement, or we decide to obtain stockholder approval for business or other legal reasons, we will, pursuant to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation: 
 

• | conduct the redemptions in conjunction with a proxy solicitation pursuant to Regulation 14A of the Exchange Act, which regulates the solicitation of proxies, and not pursuant to the tender offer rules, and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | file proxy materials with the SEC.
--+-----------------------------------


In the event that we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination, we will distribute proxy materials and, in connection therewith, provide our public stockholders with the redemption rights described above upon completion of the initial business combination. 
 If we seek stockholder approval, unless otherwise required by applicable law, regulation or stock exchange rules, we will complete our initial business combination only if a majority of the outstanding shares of common stock present and entitled to vote at the meeting to approve the initial business combination when a quorum is present are voted in favor of the initial business combination. A quorum for such meeting will consist of the holders present in person or by proxy of shares of outstanding capital stock of the Company representing a majority of the voting power of all outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company entitled to vote at such meeting. Our initial stockholders will count toward this quorum and pursuant to the letter agreement, our sponsor, officers and directors have agreed to vote any founder shares and placement shares held by them and any public shares acquired by them (including in open market and privately negotiated transactions) in favor of our initial business combination. Our anchor investors have agreed to vote any founder shares held by them in favor of our initial business combination. For purposes of seeking approval of the majority of our outstanding shares of common stock voted, non-votes will have no effect on the approval of our initial business combination once a quorum is obtained. As a result, in addition to our initial stockholders’ founder shares and placement shares and our anchor investors’ founder shares, we would need 982,701, or 3.4%, of the 28,750,000 public shares sold in our initial public offering to be voted in favor of an initial business combination (assuming only the minimum number of shares representing a quorum are voted) in order to have our initial business combination approved (assuming that the initial stockholders do not purchase any units in our initial public offering or units or shares in the after-market). In light of the units purchased by our anchor investors, if the anchor investors vote their public shares in favor of our initial business combination, no affirmative votes from other public stockholders would be required to approve our initial business combination. However, because our anchor investors are not obligated to continue owning any public shares following the closing and are not obligated to vote any public shares in favor of our initial business combination, we cannot assure you that any of these anchor investors will be stockholders at the time our stockholders vote on our initial business combination, and, if they are stockholders, we cannot assure you as to how such anchor investors will vote on any business combination. We intend to give approximately 30 days (but not less than 10 days nor more than 60 days) prior written notice of any such meeting, if required, at which a vote shall be taken to approve our initial business combination. These quorum and voting thresholds, and the voting agreements of our initial stockholders, may make it more likely that we will consummate our initial business combination. Each public stockholder may elect to redeem its public shares irrespective of whether they vote for or against the proposed transaction. 
 If a stockholder vote is not required and we do not decide to hold a stockholder vote for business or other legal reasons, we will, pursuant to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation: 
 

• | conduct the redemptions pursuant to Rule 13e-4 and Regulation 14E of the Exchange Act, which regulate issuer tender offers, and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | file tender offer documents with the SEC prior to completing our initial business combination which contain substantially the same financial and other information about the initial business combination and the redemption rights as is required under Regulation 14A of the Exchange Act, which regulates the solicitation of proxies.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



22 

  Upon the public announcement of our initial business combination, we or our sponsor will terminate any plan established in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 to purchase shares of our Class A common stock in the open market if we elect to redeem our public shares through a tender offer, to comply with Rule 14e-5 under the Exchange Act. 
 In the event we conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules, our offer to redeem will remain open for at least 20 business days, in accordance with Rule 14e-1(a) under the Exchange Act, and we will not be permitted to complete our initial business combination until the expiration of the tender offer period. In addition, we will not redeem any public shares unless our net tangible assets will be at least $5,000,001 either immediately prior to or upon consummation of our initial business combination and after payment of underwriters’ fees and commissions (so that we are not subject to the SEC’s “penny stock” rules) or any greater net tangible asset or cash requirement which may be contained in the agreement relating to our initial business combination. If public stockholders tender more shares than we have offered to purchase, we will withdraw the tender offer and not complete the initial business combination. 
 Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that we may not redeem our public shares unless our net tangible assets are at least $5,000,001 either immediately prior to or upon consummation of our initial business combination and after payment of underwriters’ fees and commissions (so that we are not subject to the SEC’s “penny stock” rules) or any greater net tangible asset or cash requirement which may be contained in the agreement relating to our initial business combination. For example, the proposed initial business combination may require: (i) cash consideration to be paid to the target or its owners, (ii) cash to be transferred to the target for working capital or other general corporate purposes or (iii) the retention of cash to satisfy other conditions in accordance with the terms of the proposed initial business combination. In the event the aggregate cash consideration we would be required to pay for all shares of Class A common stock that are validly submitted for redemption plus any amount required to satisfy cash conditions pursuant to the terms of the proposed initial business combination exceed the aggregate amount of cash available to us, we will not complete the initial business combination or redeem any shares, and all shares of Class A common stock submitted for redemption will be returned to the holders thereof. 
 Limitation on Redemption upon Completion of our Initial Business Combination if we Seek Stockholder Approval 
 Notwithstanding the foregoing, if we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our initial business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that a public stockholder, together with any affiliate of such stockholder or any other person with whom such stockholder is acting in concert or as a “group” (as defined under Section 13 of the Exchange Act), will be restricted from seeking redemption rights with respect to more than an aggregate of 15% of the shares sold in our initial public offering (4,312,500 shares of Class A common stock), which we refer to as the “Excess Shares.” Such restriction shall also be applicable to our affiliates. We believe this restriction will discourage stockholders from accumulating large blocks of shares, and subsequent attempts by such holders to use their ability to exercise their redemption rights against a proposed initial business combination as a means to force us or our management to purchase their shares at a significant premium to the then-current market price or on other undesirable terms. By limiting our stockholders’ ability to redeem no more than 15% of the shares sold in our initial public offering without our prior consent, we believe we will limit the ability of a small group of stockholders to unreasonably attempt to block our ability to complete our initial business combination, particularly in connection with an initial business combination with a target that requires as a closing condition that we have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash. However, we would not be restricting our stockholders’ ability to vote all of their shares (including Excess Shares) for or against our initial business combination. 
 
23 

  Tendering Stock Certificates in Connection with Redemption Rights 
 We may require our public stockholders seeking to exercise their redemption rights, whether they are record holders or hold their shares in “street name,” to either tender their certificates to our transfer agent up to two business days prior to the vote on the proposal to approve the initial business combination, or to deliver their shares to the transfer agent electronically using the DWAC System, at the holder’s option. The proxy materials that we will furnish to holders of our public shares in connection with our initial business combination will indicate whether we are requiring public stockholders to satisfy such delivery requirements. Accordingly, a public stockholder would have up to two days prior to the vote on the initial business combination to tender its shares if it wishes to seek to exercise its redemption rights. Given the relatively short exercise period, it is advisable for stockholders to use electronic delivery of their public shares. 
 There is a nominal cost associated with the above-referenced tendering process and the act of certificating the shares or delivering them through the DWAC System. The transfer agent will typically charge the tendering broker certain fee and it would be up to the broker whether or not to pass this cost on to the redeeming holder. However, this fee would be incurred regardless of whether or not we require holders seeking to exercise redemption rights to tender their shares. The need to deliver shares is a requirement of exercising redemption rights regardless of the timing of when such delivery must be effectuated. 
 The foregoing is different from the procedures used by many special purpose acquisition companies. In order to perfect redemption rights in connection with their business combinations, many blank check companies would distribute proxy materials for the stockholders’ vote on an initial business combination, and a holder could simply vote against a proposed initial business combination and check a box on the proxy card indicating such holder was seeking to exercise his or her redemption rights. After the initial business combination was approved, the company would contact such stockholder to arrange for him or her to deliver his or her certificate to verify ownership. As a result, the stockholder then had an “option window” after the completion of the initial business combination during which he or she could monitor the price of the company’s stock in the market. If the price rose above the redemption price, he or she could sell his or her shares in the open market before actually delivering his or her shares to the company for cancellation. As a result, the redemption rights, to which stockholders were aware they needed to commit before the stockholder meeting, would become “option” rights surviving past the completion of the initial business combination until the redeeming holder delivered its certificate. The requirement for physical or electronic delivery prior to the meeting ensures that a redeeming holder’s election to redeem is irrevocable once the initial business combination is approved. 
 Any request to redeem such shares, once made, may be withdrawn at any time up to the date of the stockholder meeting. Furthermore, if a holder of a public share delivered its certificate in connection with an election of redemption rights and subsequently decides prior to the applicable date not to elect to exercise such rights, such holder may simply request that the transfer agent return the certificate (physically or electronically). It is anticipated that the funds to be distributed to holders of our public shares electing to redeem their shares will be distributed promptly after the completion of our initial business combination. 
 If our initial business combination is not approved or completed for any reason, then our public stockholders who elected to exercise their redemption rights would not be entitled to redeem their shares for the applicable pro rata share of the trust account. In such case, we will promptly return any certificates delivered by public holders who elected to redeem their shares. 
 If the TMTG Business Combination is not completed, we may continue to try to complete an initial business combination with a different target until September 8, 2022 (or March 8, 2023, if we have extended the maximum time). 
 Ability to Extend Time to Complete Business Combination 
 If we anticipate that we may not be able to consummate our initial business combination within 12 months following our IPO, the sponsor may, but is not obligated, to cause our Company to extend the period of time to consummate a 
 
24 

  business combination two times by an additional three months each time (for a total of up to 18 months following our IPO to complete a business combination). Pursuant to the terms of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and the trust agreement between us and Continental on September 2, 2021, in order to extend the time available for us to consummate our initial business combination, our sponsor, upon five days advance notice prior to the applicable deadline, must deposit into the trust account for each three-month extension $2,875,000 if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full (or $0.10 per share) on or prior to the date of the applicable deadline. The insiders or their affiliates or designees will receive a non-interest bearing, unsecured promissory note equal to the amount of any such deposit that will not be repaid in the event that we are unable to close a business combination unless there are funds available outside the trust account to do so. Such notes would either be paid upon consummation of our initial business combination, or, at the lender’s discretion, converted upon consummation of our business combination into additional private units at a price of $10.00 per unit. In the event that we receive notice from our insiders five days prior to the applicable deadline of their intent to effect an extension, we intend to issue a press release announcing such intention at least three days prior to the applicable deadline. In addition, we intend to issue a press release the day after the applicable deadline announcing whether or not the funds had been timely deposited. Our insiders and their affiliates or designees are not obligated to fund the trust account to extend the time for us to complete our initial business combination. To the extent that some, but not all, of our insiders, decide to extend the period of time to consummate our initial business combination, such insiders (or their affiliates or designees) may deposit the entire amount required. Any notes issued pursuant to these loans would be in addition to any notes issued pursuant to working capital loans made to us. 
 Redemption of Public Shares and Liquidation if no Initial Business Combination 
 Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that we will have only 12 months (or up to 18 months if we extend the time for completion as permitted under our amended and restated certificate of incorporation) from the closing of our initial public offering to complete our initial business combination. If we are unable to complete our initial business combination by September 8, 2022 (or March 8, 2023, if we have extended the maximum time), we will: (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account including interest earned on the funds held in the trust account and not previously released to us to pay our taxes (less up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public stockholders’ rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidating distributions, if any), subject to applicable law, and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining stockholders and our board of directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject in the case of clauses (ii) and (iii) above to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. There will be no redemption rights or liquidating distributions with respect to our warrants, which will expire worthless if we fail to complete our initial business combination within the 12-month time period (or up to 18 month period if we have extended the maximum time). 
 Our sponsor, officers, and directors have entered into a letter agreement with us, pursuant to which they will waive their rights to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to any founder shares and placement shares held by them if we fail to complete our initial business combination by September 8, 2022 (or March 8, 2023, if we have extended the maximum time). However, if our sponsor, officers or directors acquire public shares, whether in or after our initial public offering, they will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to such public shares if we fail to complete our initial business combination within such 12 month period (or up to 18 months if we have extended the period of time). 
 Our sponsor, officers and directors have agreed, pursuant to a written agreement with us, that they will not propose any amendment to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation (i) to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to allow redemption in connection with our initial business combination or certain amendments to our charter prior thereto or to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our initial 
 
25 

  business combination within 12 months (or up to 18 months if we have extended the period of time) from the closing of our initial public offering or (ii) with respect to any other provision relating to stockholders’ rights or pre-initial business combination activity, unless we provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem their shares of Class A common stock upon approval of any such amendment at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account including interest earned on the funds held in the trust account and not previously released to us to pay our taxes divided by the number of then outstanding public shares. However, we may not redeem our public shares unless our net tangible assets are at least $5,000,001 either immediately prior to or upon consummation of our initial business combination and after payment of underwriters’ fees and commissions (so that we are not subject to the SEC’s “penny stock” rules). If this optional redemption right is exercised with respect to an excessive number of public shares such that we cannot satisfy the net tangible asset requirement (described above), we would not proceed with the amendment or the related redemption of our public shares at such time. 
 We expect that all costs and expenses associated with implementing our plan of dissolution, as well as payments to any creditors, will be funded from amounts remaining out of the approximately $327,731 of proceeds held outside the trust account, as of December 31, 2021, although we cannot assure you that there will be sufficient funds for such purpose. We will depend on sufficient interest being earned on the proceeds held in the trust account to pay any tax obligations we may owe. However, if those funds are not sufficient to cover the costs and expenses associated with implementing our plan of dissolution, to the extent that there is any interest accrued in the trust account not required to pay taxes, we may request the trustee to release to us an additional amount of up to $100,000 of such accrued interest to pay those costs and expenses. 
 If we were to expend all of the net proceeds of our initial public offering and the sale of the placement units, other than the proceeds deposited in the trust account, and without taking into account interest, if any, earned on the trust account, the per-share redemption amount received by stockholders upon our dissolution would be approximately $10.20. The proceeds deposited in the trust account could, however, become subject to the claims of our creditors which would have higher priority than the claims of our public stockholders. We cannot assure you that the actual per-share redemption amount received by stockholders will not be substantially less than $10.20. Under Section 281(b) of the DGCL, our plan of dissolution must provide for all claims against us to be paid in full or make provision for payments to be made in full, as applicable, if there are sufficient assets. These claims must be paid or provided for before we make any distribution of our remaining assets to our stockholders. While we intend to pay such amounts, if any, we cannot assure you that we will have funds sufficient to pay or provide for all creditors’ claims. 

Although we seek to have all vendors, service providers, prospective target businesses or other entities with which we do business execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies held in the trust account for the benefit of our public stockholders, there is no guarantee that they will execute such agreements or even if they execute such agreements that they would be prevented from bringing claims against the trust account including but not limited to fraudulent inducement, breach of fiduciary responsibility or other similar claims, as well as claims challenging the enforceability of the waiver, in each case in order to gain an advantage with respect to a claim against our assets, including the funds held in the trust account. If any third party refuses to execute an agreement waiving such claims to the monies held in the trust account, our management will perform an analysis of the alternatives available to it and will only enter into an agreement with a third party that has not executed a waiver if management believes that such third party’s engagement would be significantly more beneficial to us than any alternative. Examples of possible instances where we may engage a third party that refuses to execute a waiver include the engagement of a third party consultant whose particular expertise or skills are believed by management to be significantly superior to those of other consultants that would agree to execute a waiver or in cases where management is unable to find a service provider willing to execute a waiver. Marcum LLP, our independent registered public accounting firm, and the underwriters of the our IPO, will not execute agreements with us waiving such claims to the monies held in the trust account. 
   
26 

  In addition, there is no guarantee that such entities will agree to waive any claims they may have in the future as a result of, or arising out of, any negotiations, contracts or agreements with us and will not seek recourse against the trust account for any reason. Our sponsor has agreed that it will be liable to us if and to the extent any claims by a third party for services rendered or products sold to us, or a prospective target business with which we have entered into a written letter of intent, confidentiality or similar agreement or business combination agreement, reduce the amount of funds in the trust account to below the lesser of (i) $10.20 per public share and (ii) the actual amount per public share held in the trust account as of the date of the liquidation of the trust account, if less than $10.20 per share due to reductions in the value of the trust assets, less taxes payable, provided that such liability will not apply to any claims by a third party or prospective target business who executed a waiver of any and all rights to the monies held in the trust account (whether or not such waiver is enforceable) nor will it apply to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of our initial public offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. However, we have not asked our sponsor to reserve for such indemnification obligations, nor have we independently verified whether our sponsor has sufficient funds to satisfy its indemnity obligations and believe that our sponsor’s only assets are securities of our company. Therefore, we cannot assure you that our sponsor would be able to satisfy those obligations. None of our officers or directors will indemnify us for claims by third parties including, without limitation, claims by vendors and prospective target businesses. 
 In the event that the proceeds in the trust account are reduced below (i) $10.20 per public share or (ii) such lesser amount per public share held in the trust account as of the date of the liquidation of the trust account, due to reductions in value of the trust assets, in each case net of the amount of interest which may be withdrawn to pay taxes, and our sponsor asserts that it is unable to satisfy its indemnification obligations or that it has no indemnification obligations related to a particular claim, our independent directors would determine whether to take legal action against our sponsor to enforce its indemnification obligations. While we currently expect that our independent directors would take legal action on our behalf against our sponsor to enforce its indemnification obligations to us, it is possible that our independent directors in exercising their business judgment may choose not to do so if, for example, the cost of such legal action is deemed by the independent directors to be too high relative to the amount recoverable or if the independent directors determine that a favorable outcome is not likely. We have not asked our sponsor to reserve for such indemnification obligations and we cannot assure you that our sponsor would be able to satisfy those obligations. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that due to claims of creditors the actual value of the per-share redemption price will not be less than $10.20 per public share. 

We will seek to reduce the possibility that our sponsor will have to indemnify the trust account due to claims of creditors by endeavoring to have all vendors, service providers, prospective target businesses or other entities with which we do business execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to monies held in the trust account. Our sponsor will also not be liable as to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of our initial public offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. We had access to up to approximately $327,731 of cash held outside of the trust account, as of December 31, 2021, with which to pay any such potential claims (including costs and expenses incurred in connection with our liquidation, currently estimated to be no more than approximately $100,000). In the event that we liquidate and it is subsequently determined that the reserve for claims and liabilities is insufficient, stockholders who received funds from our trust account could be liable for claims made by creditors. 
 Under the DGCL, stockholders may be held liable for claims by third parties against a corporation to the extent of distributions received by them in a dissolution. The pro rata portion of our trust account distributed to our public stockholders upon the redemption of our public shares in the event we do not complete our initial business combination by September 8, 2022 (or March 8, 2023, if we extend the maximum time to complete a business combination) may be considered a liquidating distribution under Delaware law. If the corporation complies with certain procedures set forth in Section 280 of the DGCL intended to ensure that it makes reasonable provision for all claims against it, including a 60-day notice period during which any third-party claims can be brought against the corporation, a 90-day period during which the corporation may reject any
 
27 

  claims brought, and an additional 150-day waiting period before any liquidating distributions are made to stockholders, any liability of stockholders with respect to a liquidating distribution is limited to the lesser of such stockholder’s pro rata share of the claim or the amount distributed to the stockholder, and any liability of the stockholder would be barred after the third anniversary of the dissolution. 
 Furthermore, if the pro rata portion of our trust account distributed to our public stockholders upon the redemption of our public shares in the event we do not complete our initial business combination by September 8, 2022 (or March 8, 2023, if we extend the maximum time to complete a business combination) is not considered a liquidating distribution under Delaware law and such redemption distribution is deemed to be unlawful (potentially due to the imposition of legal proceedings that a party may bring or due to other circumstances that are currently unknown), then pursuant to Section 174 of the DGCL, the statute of limitations for claims of creditors could then be six years after the unlawful redemption distribution, instead of three years, as in the case of a liquidating distribution. If we are unable to complete our initial business combination by September 8, 2022 (or March 8, 2023, if we have extended the maximum time), we will: (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account including interest earned on the funds held in the trust account and not previously released to us to pay our taxes (less up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public stockholders’ rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidating distributions, if any), subject to applicable law, and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining stockholders and our board of directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject in the case of clauses (ii) and (iii) above to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. Accordingly, it is our intention to redeem our public shares as soon as reasonably possible following our 18th month and, therefore, we do not intend to comply with those procedures. As such, our stockholders could potentially be liable for any claims to the extent of distributions received by them (but no more) and any liability of our stockholders may extend well beyond the third anniversary of such date. 
 Because we will not be complying with Section 280, Section 281(b) of the DGCL requires us to adopt a plan, based on facts known to us at such time that will provide for our payment of all existing and pending claims or claims that may be potentially brought against us within the subsequent 10 years. However, because we are a blank check company, rather than an operating company, and our operations will be limited to searching for prospective target businesses to acquire, the only likely claims to arise would be from our vendors (such as lawyers, investment bankers, etc.) or prospective target businesses. As described above, pursuant to the obligation contained in our underwriting agreement, we will seek to have all vendors, service providers, prospective target businesses or other entities with which we do business execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies held in the trust account. As a result of this obligation, the claims that could be made against us are significantly limited and the likelihood that any claim that would result in any liability extending to the trust account is remote. Further, our sponsor may be liable only to the extent necessary to ensure that the amounts in the trust account are not reduced below (i) $10.20 per public share or (ii) such lesser amount per public share held in the trust account as of the date of the liquidation of the trust account, due to reductions in value of the trust assets, in each case net of the amount of interest withdrawn to pay taxes and will not be liable as to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of our initial public offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. In the event that an executed waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against a third party, our sponsor will not be responsible to the extent of any liability for such third-party claims. 
 If we file a bankruptcy petition or an involuntary bankruptcy petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, the proceeds held in the trust account could be subject to applicable bankruptcy law, and may be included in our bankruptcy estate and subject to the claims of third parties with priority over the claims of our stockholders. To the extent any bankruptcy claims deplete the trust account, we cannot assure you we will be able to return $10.20 per share to our public stockholders. Additionally, if we file a bankruptcy petition or an involuntary bankruptcy petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, any distributions received by stockholders could be viewed under 
 
28 

  applicable debtor/creditor and/or bankruptcy laws as either a “preferential transfer” or a “fraudulent conveyance.” As a result, a bankruptcy court could seek to recover some or all amounts received by our stockholders. Furthermore, our board of directors may be viewed as having breached its fiduciary duty to our creditors and/or may have acted in bad faith, thereby exposing itself and our company to claims of punitive damages, by paying public stockholders from the trust account prior to addressing the claims of creditors. We cannot assure you that claims will not be brought against us for these reasons. 
 Our public stockholders will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account only upon the earlier to occur of: (i) the completion of our initial business combination, (ii) the redemption of any public shares properly tendered in connection with a stockholder vote to amend any provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation (A) to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to allow redemption in connection with our initial business combination or certain amendments to our charter prior thereto or to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination within 12 months (or up to 18 months if we have extended the period of time) from the closing of our initial public offering or (B) with respect to any other provision relating to stockholders’ rights or pre-initial business combination activity, and (iii) the redemption of all of our public shares if we are unable to complete our business combination by September 8, 2022 (or March 8, 2023, if we have extended the maximum time), subject to applicable law. In no other circumstances will a stockholder have any right or interest of any kind to or in the trust account. In the event we seek stockholder approval in connection with our initial business combination, a stockholder’s voting in connection with the initial business combination alone will not result in a stockholder’s redeeming its shares to us for an applicable pro rata share of the trust account. Such stockholder must have also exercised its redemption rights as described above. These provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, like all provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, may be amended with a stockholder vote. 
 Competition 
 In identifying, evaluating and selecting a target business for our initial business combination, we may encounter intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours, including other blank check companies (including Benessere Capital Acquisition Corp. and Maquia Capital Acquisition Corporation), private equity groups and leveraged buyout funds, and operating businesses seeking strategic business combinations. Many of these entities are well established and have extensive experience identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates. Moreover, many of these competitors possess greater financial, technical, human and other resources than we do. Our ability to acquire larger target businesses will be limited by our available financial resources. This inherent limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the initial business combination of a target business. Furthermore, our obligation to pay cash in connection with our public stockholders who exercise their redemption rights may reduce the resources available to us for our initial business combination and our outstanding warrants, and the future dilution they potentially represent, may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses. Either of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating an initial business combination. 
Employees 
 We currently have two officers. These individuals are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters but they devote as much of their time as they deem necessary, in the exercise of their respective business judgement, to our affairs until we have completed our initial business combination. The amount of time they devote in any time period will vary based on whether a target business has been selected for our initial business combination and the stage of the initial business combination process we are in. We do not intend to have any full-time employees prior to the completion of our initial business combination. We do not have an employment agreement with any member of our management team.

  Periodic Reporting and Financial Information 
 We have registered our units, Class A common stock and warrants under the Exchange Act and have reporting obligations, including the requirement that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with the SEC. In accordance with the requirements of the Exchange Act, our annual reports will contain financial statements audited and reported on by our independent registered public accountants. 
 We will provide stockholders with audited financial statements of the prospective target business as part of the tender offer materials or proxy solicitation materials sent to stockholders to assist them in assessing the target business. In all likelihood, these financial statements will need to be prepared in accordance with, or reconciled to, GAAP, or IFRS, depending on the circumstances, and the historical financial statements may be required to be audited in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. These financial statement requirements may limit the pool of potential targets for our initial business combination, because some targets may be unable to provide such statements in time for us to disclose such statements in accordance with federal proxy rules and complete our initial business combination within the prescribed time frame. We cannot assure you that any particular target business identified by us as a potential business combination candidate will have financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP or that the potential target business will be able to prepare its financial statements in accordance with the requirements outlined above. To the extent that these requirements cannot be met, we may not be able to acquire the proposed target business. While this may limit the pool of potential business combination candidates, we do not believe that this limitation will be material. 
 We will be required to evaluate our internal control procedures for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2022 as required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Only in the event we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer or an accelerated filer, and no longer qualify as an emerging growth company, will we be required to have our internal control procedures audited. A target company may not be in compliance with the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act regarding adequacy of their internal controls. The development of the internal controls of any such entity to achieve compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act may increase the time and costs necessary to complete any such business combination. We have filed a Registration Statement on Form 8-A with the SEC to register our securities under Section 12 of the Exchange Act. As a result, we are subject to the rules and regulations promulgated under the Exchange Act. We have no current intention of filing a Form 15 to suspend our reporting or other obligations under the Exchange Act prior or subsequent to the consummation of our initial business combination. 
 We are an “emerging growth company,” as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act, as modified by the JOBS Act. As such, we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not “emerging growth companies” including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. If some investors find our securities less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our securities and the prices of our securities may be more volatile. 
 In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an “emerging growth company” can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an “emerging growth company” can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have taken advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period. 
 We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (1) (a) December 31, 2026, (b) the last day of the fiscal year in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.07 billion, or (c) the last day of the fiscal year in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our shares of 
 
30 

  Class A common stock that are held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the prior June 30th, and (2) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt during the prior three-year period. References herein to “emerging growth company” will have the meaning associated with it in the JOBS Act. 
 Additionally, we are a “smaller reporting company” as defined in Item 10(f)(1) of Regulation S-K. Smaller reporting companies may take advantage of certain reduced disclosure obligations, including, among other things, providing only two years of audited financial statements. We will remain a smaller reporting company until the last day of the fiscal year in which (1) the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates equals or exceeds $250 million as of the end of that year’s second fiscal quarter, or (2) our annual revenues equaled or exceeded $100 million during such completed fiscal year and the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the end of that year’s second fiscal quarter.
