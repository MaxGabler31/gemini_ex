ITEM 1. BUSINESS
OVERVIEW
 
We are an IT-solutions provider and until recently, provided a multi-dimensional e-commerce platform that facilitates shopping, business, trade and integrates online & office transactions in a single application. Prior to June 2019, we developed and operated a mobile platform designed to consolidate users’ cash and connect merchants to consumers by offering a cashless form of transaction, in-app shopping and a user rewards system. On June 2019, we ceased the operation of the platform but continue to maintain our IT solution business operations. During the fiscal years ended July 31, 2019, and 2018, we generated comprehensive losses of $1,493,284 and $1,556,408, respectively.
 
In March 2019, we embarked on a diversification plan to move into the energy, oil & gas sector to strengthen our financial position. On October 24, 2019, we entered into a nonbinding Memorandum of Understanding with MIG Next Technologies Sdn. Bhd. (the “MOU”) pursuant to which the parties agreed to explore a strategic partnership to exploit that certain thermal catalytic cracking technology with proprietary permanent catalyst, named as CHCSTDRP (CH Closed System Thermally Depolymerisation Refining Process) Technology, in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth in the MOU. Pursuant to the MOU, MIG Next Technologies Sdn. Bhd. (“MIG Next”), agreed not to initiate, solicit, encourage, directly or indirectly, or accept any offer or proposal, regarding a strategic partnership relating to the exploitation of such technology by any person other than Company. The MOU expires on the date that is six (6) months from the date of the MOU unless otherwise extended by the parties.
 
Two Hundred Sixty Thousand and Two Hundred Fifty Thousand (260,000 and 250,000 respectively) ordinary shares of MIG Next, representing 27.66% and 26.60% respectively of the issued and outstanding securities of MIG Next, are held by Shiong Han Wee, our Chief Executive Officer and Director and Kwueh Lin Wong, our Secretary and Director.

Our goal is to explore green technology in the pursuit of improving the quality of living through positive economic contributions and responsible energy production. We believe that we will require approximately USD3,000,000 to fund our diversification plan for the next 18 months. We intend to finance our business expansion efforts through sales of our securities to existing shareholders and loans from existing shareholders or financial institutions.
 
OUR NEW GREEN TECHNOLOGY FOCUS
 
With economic growth, industrialization and growing population in developing countries such as Malaysia, there is an increase in energy demand to meet the consumption patterns of the population. In light of the global environmental problems that call for drastic cuts on fossil fuel use, the Malaysian government is taking initiatives to implement policies to address this acceleration of consumption through green technology (GT) applications. The term ‘green technology’ refers to technology that is considered environmentally friendly based on its production process or supply chain. GT includes alternative means of energy production that are less harmful to the environment than traditional ways of generating energy, such as burning fossil fuels.
 
Green technology initiatives are in line with Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) that have been adopted by 193 countries across the globe. The SDGs provide clear guidelines and targets for all countries to implement in accordance with their own priorities and the environmental challenges of the world at large. GT plays a key role towards achieving the indicators of SDGs, namely Goal 6 (clean water and sanitation), Goal 7 (affordable and clean energy), Goal 11 (sustainable cities and communities), Goal 12 (responsible consumption and production) and Goal 13 (climate action). We believe that GT is the future of any economy due to rising energy costs and the threat of global warming. We expect that businesses will increasingly recognize the benefits of using technology to reduce their carbon footprint and minimize waste.
 
Prospective Green Technology
 
WECT is exploring a transformation technology that uses thermal depolymerization technology as the base paired with catalytic cracking process using quantum entanglement principle to turn organic & inorganic substances to produce oil, gas and charcoal. On October 24, 2019, we entered into a nonbinding Memorandum of Understanding with MIG Next pursuant to which the parties agreed to explore a strategic partnership to exploit thermal catalytic cracking technology with proprietary permanent catalyst, named as CHCSTDRP (CH Closed System Thermally Depolymerisation Refining Process) Technology, in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth in the MOU. Pursuant to the MOU, MIG Next agreed not to initiate, solicit, encourage, directly or indirectly, or accept any offer or proposal, regarding a strategic partnership relating to the exploitation of such technology by any person other than Company. The MOU expires on the date that is six (6) months from the date of the MOU unless otherwise extended by the parties.
 
Two Hundred Sixty Thousand and Two Hundred Fifty Thousand (260,000 and 250,000 respectively) ordinary shares of MIG Next, representing 27.66% and 26.60% respectively of the issued and outstanding securities of MIG Next, are held by Shiong Han Wee, our Chief Executive Officer and Director and Kwueh Lin Wong, our Secretary and Director.
 
We intend to work with industry specialists and engineers who have taken more than 15 years to perfect this process, which we believe has been successfully proven at a research center in Netherlands and Malaysia. To fund our diversification plan and operation in the next 18 months, we will require approximately USD3,000,000. We intend to finance our business expansion efforts through sales of our securities to existing shareholders and loans from existing shareholders or financial institutions.
HISTORY
 
We were incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on April 25, 2007. Prior to our acquisition of MIG Mobile Tech Berhad (“MMT”), a corporation organized under the laws of Malaysia, we were an exploration stage company engaged in the acquisition and exploration of mineral properties. We were also a “shell company” with no meaningful assets or operations other than our efforts to identify and merge with an operating company. We operated under the name “Contact Minerals Corp. and our securities traded under the symbol “CNTM.” Effective November 6, 2017, we changed our name to “WECONNECT Tech International, Inc.” and our symbol to “WECT.” Our business office is located at 1st Floor, Block A, Axis Business Campus, No. 13A & 13B, Jalan 225, Section 51A, 46100 Petaling Jaya, Selangor, Malaysia. Effective June 8, 2018, we consummated the acquisition of 49,831,007 shares of MMT (the “MMT Shares”), constituting approximately 99.662% of the issued and outstanding securities of MMT. As a result of our acquisition of the MMT Shares, we ventured into the IT solution business with a focus on users located in Malaysia. On June 2019, MMT ceased the operation of the platform and currently only maintains its IT solution business operations.

Major Vendors
 
During the twelve months ended July 31, 2019, no vendors accounted for 10% or more of our total operating costs.
 
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND PATENTS
 
We expect to rely on patents, trade secrets, copyrights, expertise, trademarks, license agreements and contractual provisions to establish our intellectual property rights and protect our “WeConnect” brand and services. These legal means, however, afford only limited protection and may not adequately protect our rights. Litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights, protect our trade secrets or determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others. Litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and management attention. Any unauthorized disclosure or use of our intellectual property could make it more expensive to do business and harm our operating results.
 
The laws of Malaysia and our target countries may not protect our brand and services and intellectual property to the same extent as U.S. laws, if at all. We may be unable to fully protect our intellectual property rights in these countries. Furthermore, companies in the internet, social media technology and other industries may own large numbers of patents, copyrights and trademarks and may frequently request license agreements, threaten litigation or file suit against us based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights.
 
We intend to seek the widest possible protection for significant product and process developments in our major markets through a combination of trade secrets, trademarks, copyrights and patents, if applicable. We anticipate that the form of protection will vary depending upon the level of protection afforded by the particular jurisdiction. Initially, we expect that our revenue will be derived mainly from our operations in Malaysia where intellectual property protection may be limited and difficult to enforce. In such instances, we may seek protection of our intellectual property through measures taken to increase the confidentiality of our findings.
 
We also intend to register trademarks as a means of protecting the brand names of our companies and products. In addition to this, we also aim to protect our trademarks against infringement and also seek to register design protection where appropriate.
 
We rely on trade secrets and unpatentable knowledge that we seek to protect, in part, by confidentiality agreements. We expect that, where applicable, we will require our employees to execute confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of employment with us. We expect these agreements to provide that all confidential information developed or made known to the individual during the course of the individual's relationship with us is to be kept confidential and not to be disclosed to third parties except in specific limited circumstances. The agreements will also provide that all inventions conceived by the individual while rendering services to us shall be assigned to us as the exclusive property of our company. There can be no assurance, however, that all persons who we desire to sign such agreements will sign, or if they do, that these agreements will not be breached, that we would have adequate remedies for any breach, or that our trade secrets or unpatentable knowledge will not otherwise become known or be independently developed by competitors.
