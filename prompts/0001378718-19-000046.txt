ITEM 1.  BUSINESS
Company Overview
We are one of the world’s leading distributors and providers of comprehensive supply chain management services to the global aerospace industry, based on annual sales. Our services range from traditional distribution to the management of supplier relationships, quality assurance, kitting, just-in-time (JIT) delivery, chemical management services (CMS), third-party logistics (3PL) or fourth-party logistics (4PL) programs and point-of-use inventory management. We supply over 550,000 active stock-keeping units (SKUs), including C-class hardware, chemicals, electronic components, bearings, tools and machined parts. In fiscal 2019, sales of hardware including bearings and other products represented 49.9% of our net sales, sales of chemicals represented 42.8% of our net sales and sales of electronic components represented 7.3% of our net sales. We serve our customers under both (1) long-term contractual arrangements (Contracts), which include JIT contracts that govern the provision of comprehensive outsourced supply chain management services and long-term agreements (LTAs) that typically set prices for specific products, and (2) ad hoc sales.
Founded in 1953 by the father of our current Chairman of the Board of Directors, we have grown to serve over 7,000 customers, which are primarily in the commercial, military and general aviation sectors, including the leading original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and their subcontractors, through which we support nearly all major Western aircraft programs, and also sell products to airline-affiliated and independent maintenance, repair and overhaul (MRO) providers. We also service customers in the automotive, energy, health care, industrial, pharmaceutical and space sectors. We have approximately 3,300 employees and operate across 55 locations in 17 countries. The following charts illustrate the composition of our fiscal year 2019 net sales based on our sales data.

Hardware
Sales of C-class aerospace hardware represented 46%, 47% and 47% of our fiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017 product sales, respectively. Fasteners, our largest category of hardware products, include a wide range of highly engineered aerospace parts that are designed to hold together two or more components, such as rivets (both blind and solid), bolts (including blind bolts), screws, nuts and washers. Many of these fasteners are designed for use in specific aircraft platforms and others can be used across multiple platforms. Materials used in the manufacture of these fasteners range from standard alloys, such as aluminum, steel or stainless steel, to more advanced materials, such as titanium, Inconel and Waspaloy.
Chemicals
Chemical sales represented 43%, 42% and 42% of our fiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017 product sales, respectively. Our chemical product offerings include adhesives; sealants and tapes; lubricants; oil and grease; paints and coatings; industrial gases; coolants and metalworking fluids; and, cleaners and cleaning solvents.
Electronic Components
We offer highly reliable interconnect and electro-mechanical products, including connectors, relays, switches, circuit breakers, lighted products, wire and cable and interconnect accessories. We also offer value-added assembled products including mil-circular and rack and panel connectors and illuminated push button switches. We maintain large quantities of connector components in inventory, which allows us to respond quickly to customer orders. In addition, our lighted switch assembly operation affords customers same day service, including engraving capabilities in multiple languages.
Bearings
Our product offering includes a variety of standard anti-friction products designed to both commercial and military aircraft specifications, such as airframe control bearings, rod ends, spherical bearings, ball bearings, needle roller bearings, bushings and precision bearings.
Machined Parts and Tooling
Machined parts are designed for a specific customer and are assigned unique OEM-specific SKUs. The machined parts we distribute include laser cut or stamped brackets, milled parts, shims, stampings, turned parts and welded assemblies made of materials ranging from high-grade steel or titanium to nickel based alloys.
We stock a full range of tools needed for the installation and removal of many of our products, including air and hydraulic tools as well as drill motors, and we also offer factory authorized maintenance and repair services for these tools. In addition to selling these tools, we also rent or lease these tools to our customers.
Our Services
In addition to our traditional distribution services, we have developed innovative value-added services, such as quality assurance, kitting, JIT supply chain management, CMS and 3PL/4PL programs for our customers.
Quality Assurance
Our quality assurance (QA) function is a key component of our service offering, with approximately 6% of our employees dedicated to this area. We believe we offer an industry-leading QA function as a result of our rigorous processes, sophisticated testing equipment and dedicated QA staff. Our superior QA performance is demonstrated by a comparison of our customers’ aggregate rejection rate of the products we deliver, which was 0.09% during fiscal 2019, to our rejection rate of the products we receive from our suppliers, which was 2.22% during fiscal 2019.
Our QA department inspects the inventory we purchase to ensure the accuracy and completeness of documentation. For many of our customers, these inspections are conducted at our in-house laboratory, where we operate sophisticated testing equipment. We also maintain an electronic copy of the relevant certifications for the inventory, which can include a manufacturer certificate of conformance, test reports, process certifications, material distributor certifications and raw material mill certifications. Our industry-leading QA capabilities also allow our JIT customers to reduce the number of personnel dedicated to the QA function and reduce the delays caused by the rejection of improperly inspected products.
Kitting
Kitting involves the packaging of an entire bill of materials or a complete “ship-set” of products, which reduces the amount of time workers spend retrieving products from storage locations. Kits can be customized in varying configurations and sizes and can contain up to several hundred different products. All of our kits and components contain fully certified and traceable products and are assembled by our full-service kitting department at our Central Stocking Locations (CSLs), or at our customer sites.
JIT Supply Chain Management and CMS
JIT supply chain management, which includes CMS, involves the delivery of products on an as-needed basis to the point-of-use at a customer’s manufacturing line. JIT programs are designed to prevent excess inventory build-up and shortages and improve manufacturing efficiency. Each JIT contract requires us to maintain an efficient inventory tracking, analysis and replenishment program and is designed to provide high levels of stock availability and on-time delivery. We believe customers that utilize our comprehensive JIT supply chain management services are frequently able to realize significant benefits including:

• | reduced inventory levels and lower inventory excess and obsolescence (E&O) expense, in part because such customers only purchase what they need, and make more efficient use of their floor space;


• | increased accuracy in forecasting and planning, resulting in substantially improved on-time delivery, reduced expediting costs and fewer disruptions of production schedules;


• | improved quality assurance resulting in a substantial reduction in customer product rejection rates; and


• | reduced administrative and overhead costs relating to procurement, QA, supplier management and stocking functions.

Before signing a JIT contract, our customers typically experience outages of many SKUs and, in some cases, have up to a year’s worth of inventory on hand for other SKU’s. As part of our JIT programs, we generally assume custody of the customer’s existing inventory at the onset of the contract, immediately reducing their management of their physical inventory on hand with lower costs. Customer inventory is generally assumed on a consignment basis and is entered in our perpetual inventory system in a distinct customer-specific “virtual warehouse.” Software protocol in our IT systems requires the system to first “look” to a customer’s consigned inventory when parts replenishment is required. In certain cases, we can sell this consigned inventory to our base of over 7,000 other active customers around the world, gradually drawing down the customer’s inventory. As the consigned inventory for each SKU is exhausted, our stock of Wesco-sourced product is then used for replenishment.
Another key strength of our JIT programs is our ability to utilize highly scalable and customizable point-of-use systems to develop an efficient supply chain management system and automated replenishment solution for any number of SKUs. In order to minimize inventory on hand, certain indicators are used to trigger the replenishment of product, with all replenishment activity done via hand-held scanners that transmit orders to our stocking locations.
In certain circumstances, we also provide our JIT and CMS customers with additional value-added services, including the implementation of process control and usage reduction programs; safety data-sheet management, support for environmental, health and safety compliance (EHS) and reporting; and assistance with the development of waste management strategies.
Customers are also increasingly seeking 3PL or 4PL arrangements to optimize supply chain management by outsourcing either specific logistics and distribution functions or their entire logistics function to a service provider like us. 
Aftermarket Sales 
We sell products to airline-affiliated, OEM-affiliated and independent MRO providers on both a Contract and ad hoc basis. We have expanded our efforts to increase our presence in both the commercial and military aerospace MRO markets, in part through the introduction of our updated Wesco e-commerce sales platform, which we believe provides us with a cost-effective way to further penetrate the aftermarket. In addition, we have targeted domestic and international airlines and maintenance centers that we believe are assuming an expanded role within the MRO market.
Going forward, we expect commercial MRO providers to benefit from many of the same trends as those impacting the commercial OEM market, including industry passenger volumes and capacity utilization, as well as requirements to maintain aging aircraft and the cost of fuel, which can lead to greater utilization of existing planes. The commercial MRO market may also benefit from directives or notifications announced by international industry regulators and trade associations. Such directives or notifications can serve to bolster required maintenance, and thus the demand for new and existing aerospace products. Furthermore, we expect demand in the military MRO market to be driven by changes in overall fleet size and the level of U.S. military operational activity domestically and overseas. We believe that our presence in this market helps us mitigate the volatility of new military aircraft sales with sales to the aftermarket. 
Customer Contracts
We sell products to our customers under two types of arrangements: (1) Contracts, which include JIT supply chain management contracts and LTAs, and (2) ad hoc sales.
Contracts
Typically, our master sales contracts with our customer run for three to five years without minimum purchase requirements annually, or over the term of the contract and contain termination for convenience provisions that generally allow for our customers to terminate their contracts on short notice without meaningful penalties.
JIT Contracts.  JIT contracts, which include CMS contracts, are structured to supply the product requirement for specific SKUs, production lines or facilities. Given our direct involvement with JIT customers, volume requirements and purchasing frequency under these contracts is highly predictable. Under JIT contracts, customers purchase specified products from us at a fixed price or a pass-through price, on an as-needed basis, and we are often responsible for maintaining high levels of stock availability of those products. JIT contracts typically contain termination for convenience provisions, which generally allow our customers to terminate their contracts on short notice without meaningful penalties and often provide for us to be reimbursed for the cost of any inventory specifically procured for the customer or inventory that is not commonly sold to our other customers. JIT customers often purchase products from us that are not covered under their contracts on an ad hoc basis. For additional information about our JIT supply chain management services, see “-Our Products and Services-Our Services-JIT Supply Chain Management and CMS.”
LTAs.  LTAs are essentially negotiated price lists for customers or individual customer sites that cover a range of pre-determined products, purchased on an as-needed basis. LTAs allow the customer to buy contracted SKUs from us and may obligate us to maintain stock availability for those products. Once an LTA is in place, the customer is then able to place individual purchase orders with us for any of the contractually specified products. LTAs typically contain termination for convenience provisions, which generally allow for our customers to terminate their contracts on short notice without meaningful penalties and often provide that we are reimbursed for the cost of any inventory specifically procured for the customer or inventory that is not commonly sold to our other customers. LTA customers also frequently purchase products from us on an ad hoc basis, which are not captured under the contractual pricing arrangement.
Ad Hoc Sales
Ad hoc sales represent products purchased from us on an as-needed basis and are generally supplied out of our existing inventory. Typically, ad hoc orders are for smaller quantities of products than those ordered under Contracts, and are often urgent in nature. Given our breadth and volume of inventory, it is not uncommon for even our competitors to purchase products from us on an ad hoc basis when their own stocks prove to be inadequate. In an environment of increasing aircraft production and oftentimes relatively long supplier lead-times, product shortages can become increasingly common for OEMs, subcontractors, MRO providers and distributors with less sophisticated forecasting abilities and procurement organizations.
Under each of the sales arrangements described above, we typically warrant that the products we sell conform to the drawings and specifications that are in effect at the time of delivery in the applicable contract, and that we will replace defective or non-conforming products for a period of time that varies from contract to contract. We, in turn, look to the product manufacturer to indemnify us for liabilities resulting from defective or non-conforming products. We do not accrue for warranty expenses as our claims related to defective and non-conforming products have not been significant.
Backlog
We have determined that sales backlog is not a relevant measure of our business. Our contracts generally do not include minimum purchase requirements, annually or over the term of the agreement, and contain termination for convenience provisions that generally allow for our customers to terminate their contracts on short notice without meaningful penalties. As a result, we have no material sales backlog.
Customers 
We sell to over 7,000 active customers worldwide. During fiscal 2019, Lockheed Martin represented approximately 13% of our total net sales, consisting of multiple contracts across multiple independent programs such that no individual contract is material. Our top 10 customers collectively accounted for 53% of our total net sales during fiscal 2019. 
During fiscal 2019, 73% of our net sales were derived from major OEMs, such as Airbus, Boeing, BAE Systems, Bombardier, Cessna, Embraer, Gulfstream, Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman and Raytheon, and many of their subcontractors. Government sales comprised 16% of our net sales during fiscal 2019 and were derived from various military parts procurement agencies such as the U.S. Defense Logistics Agency, or from defense contractors buying on their behalf. Aftermarket sales to airline-affiliated or independent MRO providers made up 4% of our fiscal 2019 net sales. The remaining 7% of our net sales were to other distributors.
During fiscal 2019, 56% of our net sales were derived from customers supporting commercial programs and 44% of our net sales were derived from customers supporting military programs. We also service international customers in markets that include Australia, Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Malaysia, Mexico, the Philippines, Poland, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, South Korea, Turkey and the United Kingdom. For additional information about our net sales and long-lived assets by geographic area, see Note 20 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Procurement
We source our inventory from over 6,000 suppliers globally, including Amphenol, Arconic, CAAP Company, Esterline, Henkel, Lisi Aerospace, PPG Industries, Precision Castparts Corp., TriMas, and 3M. During fiscal 2019, Precision Castparts Corp. and Arconic supplied 9% and 8%, respectively, of the products we purchased, and our ten largest suppliers during fiscal 2019 accounted for 38% of our purchases. Suppliers typically prefer to deal with a relatively small number of large and sophisticated distributors in order to improve production efficiency; reduce finished goods inventory and related obsolescence costs; maintain pricing discipline; improve performance in meeting on-time-delivery targets to the end customers; and consolidate customer accounts, which can reduce administrative and overhead costs relating to sales and marketing, customer service and other functions. As a result of our size and our long-standing relationships with many of our suppliers, we are often able to take advantage of significant volume-based discounts when purchasing inventory. Given our industry position and close cooperation with suppliers, we believe that we are in an excellent position to become a distributor for new product lines as they become available. 
Our management analyzes supply, demand, cost and pricing factors to make inventory investment decisions, which are facilitated by our highly customized IT systems, and we maintain close relationships with the leading suppliers in the industry. Our strong understanding of the global aerospace industry is derived from our long-term relationships with major OEMs, subcontractors and suppliers. In addition, our direct insight into our customers’ production rates often allows us to detect industry trends. Furthermore, our ability to forecast demand, share inventory and usage information, and place purchase orders with our suppliers well in advance of our customer requirements can provide us with a distinct advantage in an industry where inventory availability is critical for customers that need specific products within a stipulated timeframe to meet their own production and delivery commitments. However, despite our expertise in this area, effective inventory management is an ongoing challenge, and we continue to take steps to enhance the effectiveness of our procurement practices and mitigate the negative impact of inventory builds on our cash flow. For additional information about the impact of inventory on our business, including our cash flows, see Part I, Item 1A. “Risk Factors-Risks Related to Our Business and Industry-We may be unable to effectively manage our inventory, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations,” Part II, Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Other Factors Affecting Our Financial Results-Fluctuations in Cash Flow,” and Part II, Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates-Inventories.”
Information Technology Systems
We have invested to build integrated, highly customized IT systems that enable our purchasing and sales organizations to make more informed decisions, our inventory management system to operate in an efficient manner and certain of our customers to make online purchases directly from us. Our primary scalable IT infrastructure is based on IBM and Oracle hardware and applications including the Oracle JD Edwards EnterpriseOne (JDE) enterprise resource planning (ERP) system and our proprietary chemical supply chain management system, tcmIS®, which was developed on the Oracle Enterprise database. These customized IT systems provide us visibility into quantities, stocking locations and purchases across our customer base by individual inventory item, enabling us to accurately fill an average of 17,300 orders per day and provide an exceptional level of customer service. These systems are fully capable of interfacing with external enterprise business systems. Additionally, we have developed functionality for JIT delivery, which can integrate directly into our customers’ manufacturing process. This functionality includes recognition of signals and actions to fill customer bins from hand-held scanners, min/max data or proprietary signals from a customer’s ERP system. JDE and tcmIS® also support our EDI functionality, which allows our system to interface with customers and suppliers, regardless of technology, data format or connectivity. tcmIS® also 
supports additional chemical-specific functionality, such as product labeling and Global Harmonized System compliance. We also continue to invest in our infrastructure and cyber-defense capabilities to enhance both availability and data protection.
For our shipping logistics and export compliance support, we employ Precision Software’s TRA/X. TRA/X enables us to ship globally while maintaining tracking numbers and rating information for each customer shipment. In addition, at several of our distribution facilities, we use Minerva’s AIMS inventory management system to provide the best possible warehouse flow and cycle times. AIMS is tailored to fit our global warehouse operational needs and allows us to provide an expandable warehouse management system that can also incorporate transaction processing, work-in-progress and other manufacturing operations. AIMS interfaces with a broad range of material handling equipment, including horizontal and vertical carousels, conveyors, sorting equipment, pick systems and cranes.
Going forward, we will continue to evaluate our IT infrastructure and expect to undertake efforts to modernize our capabilities, particularly through investments in additional state of the art software and hardware that is designed to improve our ability to service our customers.
Seasonality
Our net sales may fluctuate quarterly based on the number of production days at our customers' facilities, which is driven by holidays and planned production shutdowns, particularly the winter holidays during our first fiscal quarter and the summer months during our fourth fiscal quarter.
Competition
The industry in which we operate is highly competitive and fragmented. We believe the principal competitive factors in our industry include the ability to provide superior customer service and support, on-time delivery, sufficient inventory availability, competitive pricing and an effective QA program. Our competitors include both U.S. and foreign companies, including divisions of larger companies and certain of our suppliers, some of which have significantly greater financial resources than we do, and therefore may be able to adapt more quickly to changes in customer requirements than we can. In addition to facing competition for Contract customers from our primary competitors, Contract customers or potential Contract customers may also determine that it is more cost effective to establish or re-establish an in-house supply chain management capability. Under these circumstances, we may be unable to sufficiently reduce our costs to provide competitive pricing while also maintaining acceptable operating margins.
Employees
As of September 30, 2019, we employed 3,302 personnel worldwide, 1,161 of whom were located at customer sites. We have 876 employees located outside of North America. We are not a party to any collective bargaining agreements with our employees.
Regulatory Matters
Governmental agencies throughout the world, including the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), prescribe standards for aircraft components, including virtually all commercial airline and general aviation products, as well as regulations regarding the repair and overhaul of airframes and engines. Specific regulations vary from country to country, although compliance with FAA requirements generally satisfies regulatory requirements in other countries. In addition, the products we distribute must also be certified by aircraft and engine OEMs. If any of the material authorizations or approvals that allow us to supply products is revoked or suspended, then the sale of the related products would be prohibited by law, which would have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
From time to time, the FAA or equivalent regulatory agencies in other countries propose new regulations or changes to existing regulations, which are usually more stringent than existing regulations. If these proposed regulations are adopted and enacted, we could incur significant additional costs to achieve compliance, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
We are also subject to government rules and regulations that include the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), the UK Bribery Act 2010 (Bribery Act), the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR), the Export Administration Regulations (EAR), economic sanctions and the False Claims Act. See “Risk Factors-Risks Related to Our Business and Industry-We are subject to unique business risks as a result of supplying equipment and services to the U.S. government directly and as a subcontractor, which could lead to a reduction in our net sales from, or the profitability of our supply 
arrangements with, the U.S. government” and “-Our international operations require us to comply with numerous applicable anti-corruption and trade control laws and regulations, including those of the U.S. government and various other jurisdictions, and our failure to comply with these laws and regulations could adversely affect our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations.”
Environmental Matters
We are subject to extensive federal, state, local and foreign laws, regulations, rules and ordinances relating to pollution, protection of the environment and human health and safety, and the handling, transportation, storage, treatment, disposal and remediation of hazardous substances, including potentially with respect to historical chemical blending and other activities that pre-dated our purchase of Haas. Actual or alleged violations of EHS laws or permit requirements could result in restrictions or prohibitions on operations and substantial civil or criminal sanctions, as well as, under some EHS laws, the assessment of strict liability and/or joint and several liability.
Furthermore, we may be liable for the costs of investigating and cleaning up environmental contamination on or from our operations or at off-site locations, including potentially with respect to historical chemical blending and other activities that pre-dated our purchase of our businesses. We may therefore incur additional costs and expenditures beyond those currently anticipated to address all such known and unknown situations under existing and future EHS laws.
In addition, governmental, regulatory and societal demands for increasing levels of product safety and environmental protection are resulting in increased pressure for more stringent regulatory control with respect to the chemical industry. The European Union’s Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH) regulations enacted in 2009 have been a continuing source of compliance obligations and restrictions on certain chemicals, and REACH-like regimes have now been adopted in several other countries. In the United States, the core provisions of the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) were amended in June 2016 for the first time in nearly 40 years. Among the more significant changes are that these amendments mandate safety reviews of existing “high priority” chemicals and regulatory action to control any “unreasonable risks” identified as result of such reviews. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) also now must make a no “unreasonable risk” finding before a new chemical can be fully commercialized. These new mandates create uncertainty about whether existing chemicals of importance to our business may be designated for restriction and whether the new chemical approval process may become more difficult and costly to comply with. These types of changes in the Company’s regulatory environment, particularly, but not limited to, in the United States, the European Union, Canada and China, could lead to heightened regulatory scrutiny and could adversely impact our ability to supply certain products and provide supply chain management services to our customers. Such changes also could result in compliance obligations for us directly or as part of our supply chain management services to customers, fines, ongoing monitoring and other future business activity restrictions, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s liquidity, financial position and results of operations. Finally, we have in the past sold products containing per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), including perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA). Certain PFAS, including PFOA, have been targeted for risk assessment, restriction, and high priority remediation and have been the subject of ongoing and substantial litigation in the both the U.S. and European Union. We have not received any claims or enforcement actions from governments or third parties relating to PFOA or any other PFAS.
