Recent Strategic Transactions
BellRing Brands, Inc.
On October 21, 2019, the initial public offering of a minority interest in our historical active nutrition business was completed (the “BellRing IPO”). As a result of the BellRing IPO and certain other transactions completed in connection with the BellRing IPO (the “BellRing formation transactions”), BellRing Brands, Inc. (“Old BellRing”) became a holding company owning 28.8% of the non-voting membership units (the “BellRing LLC units”) of BellRing Brands, LLC and a publicly-traded company with its Class A common stock, $0.01 par value per share (the “Old BellRing Class A Common Stock”), trading on the NYSE under the ticker symbol “BRBR”. Immediately after the BellRing IPO, Post owned 71.2% of the BellRing LLC units and one share of Old BellRing’s Class B common stock, $0.01 par value per share (the “Old BellRing Class B Common Stock”). For additional information regarding the BellRing IPO, refer to Note 4 within “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” in Item 8 of this report.
On March 9, 2022, pursuant to a transaction agreement and plan of merger, Post contributed its share of Old BellRing Class B Common Stock, all of its BellRing LLC units and cash to BellRing Brands, Inc. (formerly known as BellRing Distribution, LLC) (“BellRing”) in exchange for certain limited liability company interests in BellRing and the right to receive 
$840.0 million in aggregate principal amount of BellRing’s 7.00% senior notes maturing in 2030 (the “BellRing Notes” and such transactions are collectively referred to as the “BellRing Contribution”). On March 10, 2022, BellRing converted into a Delaware corporation and changed its name to “BellRing Brands, Inc.”, and Post consummated the distribution of 80.1% of its ownership interest in BellRing common stock, $0.01 par value per share (“BellRing Common Stock”), to Post’s shareholders (the “BellRing Distribution,” and such transaction, the BellRing Contribution, the BellRing Merger (as defined below) and the “Debt-for-Debt Exchange” (which refers to Post’s delivery of the BellRing Notes to certain of its lenders in full satisfaction of certain of its debt obligations on March 10, 2022, as described in more detail in Note 16 within “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” in Item 8 of this report) are collectively referred to as the “BellRing Spin-off”). Upon completion of the BellRing Distribution, BellRing Merger Sub Corporation, a wholly-owned subsidiary of BellRing, merged with and into Old BellRing (the “BellRing Merger”), with Old BellRing continuing as the surviving corporation and becoming a wholly-owned subsidiary of BellRing. Pursuant to the BellRing Merger, each outstanding share of Old BellRing Class A Common Stock was converted into one share of BellRing Common Stock plus $2.97 in cash. As a result of the BellRing Spin-off, BellRing became the holding company for the legacy Old BellRing business. Immediately following the BellRing Spin-off, Post owned approximately 14.2% of the BellRing Common Stock and Post shareholders owned approximately 57.3% of the BellRing Common Stock. The former Old BellRing stockholders owned approximately 28.5% of the BellRing Common Stock, maintaining the same effective percentage ownership interest in the BellRing business as prior to the BellRing Spin-off. The BellRing Distribution was structured in a manner intended to qualify as a tax-free distribution to Post shareholders for United States (“U.S.”) federal income tax purposes, except to the extent of any cash received in lieu of fractional shares of BellRing Common Stock. For additional information regarding the BellRing Spin-off, refer to Note 4 within “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” in Item 8 of this report.
On August 11, 2022, pursuant to an exchange agreement, Post transferred 14.8 million shares of BellRing Common Stock to certain lenders to repay and retire $342.3 million in aggregate principal amount of debt (such exchange, the “Debt-for-Equity Exchange”). Immediately after the completion of the Debt-for-Equity Exchange, Post held 4.6 million shares, or 3.4%, of BellRing Common Stock. For additional information regarding the Debt-for Equity Exchange, refer to Note 16 within “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” in Item 8 of this report. 
Refer to “Risk Factors” in Item 1A of this report for a discussion of certain risks related to the fiscal 2022 transactions.
Post Holdings Partnering Corporation
In May and June of 2021, Post and Post Holdings Partnering Corporation (“PHPC”), a special purpose acquisition company (a “SPAC”), consummated the initial public offering of 34.5 million units of PHPC (the “PHPC Units,” and such transaction, the “PHPC IPO”), of which PHPC Sponsor, LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Post (“PHPC Sponsor”), purchased 4.0 million PHPC Units. Each PHPC Unit consists of one share of Series A common stock of PHPC, $0.0001 par value per share (“PHPC Series A Common Stock”), and one-third of one redeemable warrant of PHPC, each whole warrant entitling the holder thereof to purchase one share of PHPC Series A Common Stock at an exercise price of $11.50 per share (the “PHPC Warrants”). The PHPC IPO generated gross proceeds to PHPC of $345.0 million. The PHPC Units, PHPC Series A Common Stock and PHPC Warrants each trade on the NYSE under the ticker symbols “PSPC.U”, “PSPC” and PSPC WS”, respectively. Under the terms of the PHPC IPO, PHPC is required to consummate a partnering transaction by May 28, 2023 (which may be extended to August 28, 2023 in certain circumstances).
Substantially concurrently with the closing of the PHPC IPO, PHPC completed the private sale of 1.1 million units of PHPC (the “PHPC Private Placement Units”), at a purchase price of $10.00 per PHPC Private Placement Unit, to PHPC Sponsor, generating proceeds to PHPC of $10.9 million (the “PHPC Private Placement”). The PHPC Private Placement Units sold in the PHPC Private Placement are identical to the PHPC Units sold in the PHPC IPO, except that, with respect to the warrants underlying the PHPC Private Placement Units (the “PHPC Private Placement Warrants”) that are held by PHPC Sponsor or its permitted transferees, such PHPC Private Placement Warrants (i) may be exercised for cash or on a cashless basis, (ii) are not subject to being called for redemption (except in certain circumstances when the PHPC Warrants are called for redemption and a certain price per share of PHPC Series A Common Stock threshold is met) and (iii) subject to certain limited exceptions, will be subject to transfer restrictions until 30 days following the consummation of PHPC’s partnering transaction. If the PHPC Private Placement Warrants are held by holders other than PHPC Sponsor or its permitted transferees, the PHPC Private Placement Warrants will be redeemable by PHPC in all redemption scenarios and exercisable by holders on the same basis as the PHPC Warrants.
In connection with the completion of the PHPC IPO, PHPC also entered into a forward purchase agreement with PHPC Sponsor (the “Forward Purchase Agreement”), providing for the purchase by PHPC Sponsor, at the election of PHPC, of up to 10.0 million units of PHPC (the “PHPC Forward Purchase Units”), subject to the terms and conditions of the Forward Purchase Agreement, with each PHPC Forward Purchase Unit consisting of one share of PHPC’s Series B common stock, $0.0001 par value per share, and one-third of one warrant to purchase one share of PHPC Series A Common Stock, for a purchase price of 
$10.00 per PHPC Forward Purchase Unit, in an aggregate amount of up to $100.0 million in a private placement to occur concurrently with the closing of PHPC’s partnering transaction. 
Proceeds of $345.0 million were deposited in a trust account established for the benefit of PHPC’s public stockholders consisting of certain proceeds from the PHPC IPO and certain proceeds from the PHPC Private Placement, net of underwriters’ discounts and commissions and other costs and expenses. The public stockholders of PHPC Series A Common Stock will be entitled in certain circumstances to redeem their shares of PHPC Series A Common Stock for a pro rata portion of the amount in the trust account at $10.00 per share of PHPC Series A Common Stock held, plus any pro rata interest earned on the funds held in the trust account and not previously released to PHPC to pay taxes (less up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses, if applicable).
In addition, Post, through PHPC Sponsor’s ownership of 8.6 million shares of Series F common stock of PHPC, $0.0001 par value per share (“PHPC Series F Common Stock”), has certain governance rights in PHPC. These rights include that, prior to PHPC’s partnering transaction, only holders of PHPC’s Series F Common Stock have the right to vote on the election of PHPC’s directors, as well as certain class voting rights regarding amendments of PHPC’s amended and restated certificate of incorporation.
As of September 30, 2022, Post beneficially owned 31.0% of the equity of PHPC and the net earnings and net assets of PHPC were consolidated within Post’s financial statements. The remaining 69.0% of the consolidated net earnings and net assets of PHPC, representing the percentage of economic interest in PHPC held by the public stockholders of PHPC through their ownership of PHPC equity, were allocated to redeemable noncontrolling interest. PHPC intends to partner with a company in the consumer products industry that complements the experience and expertise of Post’s management team and is a business to which Post believes it can add value.
For additional information regarding the PHPC IPO and related transactions, refer to “Risk Factors” in Item 1A of this report and Note 5 within “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” in Item 8 of this report.
8th Avenue
On October 1, 2018, 8th Avenue was separately capitalized by Post and third parties through a series of transactions (the “8th Avenue Formation Transactions”), and 8th Avenue became the holding company for Post’s private brand food products business. After completion of the 8th Avenue Formation Transactions, Post retained 60.5% of the common equity in 8th Avenue, which, effective October 1, 2018, is accounted for using the equity method. For additional information regarding 8th Avenue, refer to Note 5 within “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” in Item 8 of this report. 8th Avenue primarily manufactures and distributes private label peanut and other nut butters, pasta, dried fruit and nut products and granola.
Recent Events and Trends
Supply Chain
Emerging from the COVID-19 pandemic, labor shortages, input and freight inflation and other supply chain disruptions, including limited input availability and disruptions with third party manufacturers, continue to pressure our supply chain in all of our segments. We experienced inflationary headwinds across all segments of our business during the year ended September 30, 2022; however, these impacts were largely mitigated, with some time lag, through sales price increases, cost savings measures and hedging programs, when possible. We expect inflationary pressures to continue into fiscal 2023, and this trend could have a materially adverse impact in the future if inflation rates significantly exceed our ability to continue to achieve price increases or cost savings or if such price increases adversely impact demand for our products.
COVID-19 Pandemic
We continue to closely monitor the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our businesses. We have experienced higher demand in our foodservice business during fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021 as away-from-home food demand has continued to recover from the impacts of the pandemic. While foodservice volumes remain slightly below pre-pandemic levels, we continue to expect foodservice profitability will return to pre-pandemic levels in fiscal 2023. Our products sold through retail channels generally experienced an uplift in sales through the first half of fiscal 2021, driven by increased at-home consumption in reaction to the COVID-19 pandemic, and returned to normalized levels in fiscal 2022. We have experienced inflationary headwinds across all segments of our business and we continue to mitigate these impacts through sales price increases and cost saving measures. We expect this trend to continue into fiscal 2023. 
As the overall economy continues to recover from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, uncertainty remains and such trends ultimately depend on the length and severity of the pandemic and introduction of new strains and variants of the virus; the federal, state, and local government actions taken in response; and the macroeconomic environment. We have experienced some challenges resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, including labor shortages, input and freight inflation and other supply 
chain disruptions, including input availability. We cannot predict the ultimate impact from the COVID-19 pandemic on customer and consumer demand, our suppliers or the labor market.
Conflict in Ukraine
The ongoing conflict in Ukraine and the subsequent economic sanctions imposed by some countries have had, and may continue to have, an adverse impact on fuel, transportation and commodity costs and may cause supply and demand disruptions in the markets we serve, including Europe. While we do not have operations in Russia, Ukraine or Belarus and do not have significant direct exposure to customers or suppliers in those countries, our businesses and operations have been negatively impacted by increased inflation, escalating energy and fuel prices and constrained availability, and thus increasing costs, of certain raw materials and other commodities, and declarations of force majeure by certain suppliers during fiscal 2022. We expect certain energy costs and raw material costs to remain elevated as a result of the ongoing conflict. To date, the economic sanctions imposed on Russian businesses have not had a direct impact on our procurement of energy and raw materials, however, there can be no assurance that additional sanctions will not be implemented. If our energy and raw materials purchases are directly impacted by sanctions, we may incur additional costs to procure such commodities. Our ability to procure energy and raw materials in the quantities necessary for the normal operations of our business may be limited. In addition, the U.K. government has established an energy price cap, which is currently keeping our U.K.-based business energy costs below prevailing market rates. The price cap is set to expire in April 2023, after which energy costs to operate our U.K.-based facilities could increase materially.
Avian Influenza
During fiscal 2022 and continuing into fiscal 2023, our Foodservice and Refrigerated Retail segments were impacted by outbreaks of avian influenza (“AI”). As a result of AI, we have incurred, and anticipate will continue to incur, increased costs related to production inefficiencies, egg supply constraints and higher market-based egg prices due to the decreased availability of eggs on the open market. We have mitigated, and plan to continue to mitigate, these increased costs through the management of volume needs with customers and pricing actions to cover the higher cost structure. Through these actions, we anticipate we will continue to mitigate the impact of AI on the profitability of our egg business. However, these actions do not contemplate further AI outbreaks, and we expect AI to have continued impact on our egg business. 
Our Business Model
We operate a decentralized, adaptive business model, which provides us with flexibility to pursue acquisitions and other strategic transactions. Since our formation, we have expanded and established new platforms through numerous acquisitions. Our acquisition strategy has focused on businesses with product offerings that can strengthen our current portfolio, enable us to expand into complementary categories, geographic regions or distribution channels or provide diversification of cash flows in similar channels. In addition to acquisitions, we also have pursued and completed other types of strategic transactions. For example, we separately capitalized 8th Avenue with third parties in fiscal 2019, facilitated the completion of the BellRing IPO in fiscal 2020, the PHPC IPO in fiscal 2021 and the BellRing Spin-off and the Debt-for-Equity Exchange in fiscal 2022 and have completed other divestitures from time to time. 
Our Businesses
Post Consumer Brands 
Our Post Consumer Brands segment manufactures, markets and sells a portfolio of branded and private label packaged foods products primarily in the RTE cereal, hot cereal and peanut and nut butter categories. According to NielsenIQ’s Total U.S. expanded All Outlets Combined (“xAOC”) information, the RTE cereal category was $9.1 billion in sales for the 52-week period ended October 29, 2022 (“2022 NielsenIQ’s Total U.S. xAOC information”). Post Consumer Brands is the third largest seller of RTE cereals in the U.S. with a 19.8% branded share of retail dollar sales and a 23.7% branded share of retail pound sales, based on 2022 NielsenIQ’s Total U.S. xAOC information. NielsenIQ’s Total U.S. xAOC is representative of food, drug and mass merchandisers (including Walmart), some club retailers (including Sam’s Club and BJs), some dollar retailers (including Dollar General and Family Dollar) and military. Based on sales data for fiscal 2022, Post Consumer Brands’s core brands include the RTE cereal brands of Honey Bunches of Oats, Pebbles and Malt-O-Meal and the Peter Pan nut butter brand. Post Consumer Brands’s products are primarily manufactured through a flexible production platform at nine owned facilities in the U.S. and Canada, with our Peter Pan nut butters being primarily manufactured by third party manufacturers. 
Weetabix
Our Weetabix segment primarily markets and distributes branded and private label RTE cereal products. According to Nielsen’s ScanTrack data for the 52-week period ended November 5, 2022 (“2022 Nielsen’s ScanTrack data”), the U.K. cereals and breakfast drinks category was £1.4 billion in sales. According to 2022 Nielsen’s ScanTrack data, Weetabix holds the number two overall position for branded manufacturers in the U.K. cereals and breakfast drinks category, the Weetabix brand, a core brand in Weetabix’s portfolio, holds the number one brand position in the U.K. cereals and breakfast drinks category and 
the Alpen brand, another core brand in Weetabix’s portfolio, was the number one muesli brand in the U.K; the core brands were determined based on sales data for fiscal 2022. Nielsen’s ScanTrack data is representative of grocery, health and beauty and beverage purchases, collating data from, among others, major grocery stores, independent grocery chains, convenience stores and gas stations. Weetabix also markets and distributes breakfast drinks, hot cereals and protein-based RTD shakes and nutritional snacks. Weetabix’s products are primarily manufactured at three owned manufacturing facilities in the U.K. Weetabix’s main markets are the U.K. and the Republic of Ireland. Weetabix distributes products to multiple countries throughout the world mainly through a network of third party distributors in the respective markets. Weetabix’s protein-based RTD shakes and nutritional snacks are co-manufactured in Germany and distributed in the U.K. through a network of large retail outlets. Weetabix also has a physical presence in the emerging markets of China and Hong Kong, mainly served through the eCommerce channel. In addition, Weetabix has operations in Africa through two joint ventures, each of which owns a manufacturing facility. 
Cereal sold by our Post Consumer Brands and Weetabix segments together accounted for 44.3% of our consolidated net sales for fiscal 2022. For additional information regarding our net sales by product, refer to Note 21 within “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” in Item 8 of this report. 
Foodservice
Through our Foodservice segment, we primarily produce and distribute egg and potato products in the foodservice and food ingredient channels. We provide a broad portfolio of egg products under several brands, with the primary brands being Papetti’s and Abbotsford Farms, and potato products; the primary brands were determined based on sales data for fiscal 2022. The Foodservice segment also manufactures certain meat products. Our operations include fourteen egg products production facilities in the U.S., some of which are fully integrated from the maintenance of laying flocks through the processing of egg products, three potato processing facilities and two meat products processing and production facilities. Several of these production facilities also produce products for our Refrigerated Retail segment.
Refrigerated Retail
Through our Refrigerated Retail segment, we produce and distribute side dishes, eggs and egg products, sausage, cheese and other dairy and refrigerated products to retail customers. Our refrigerated side dish, potato and sausage products are sold primarily under the Bob Evans, Bob Evans Farms and Simply Potatoes brands. We sell private label egg products as well as branded egg products primarily under the Bob Evans Egg Whites brand and the Egg Beaters brand. Our cheese and other dairy case products are sold principally under the Crystal Farms brand. The primary brands were determined based on fiscal 2022 sales data. Our products are manufactured across twelve facilities, five of which are egg products processing facilities and two of which are potato processing facilities previously referenced under the Foodservice segment discussion. In addition, our Egg Beaters products are manufactured under a co-manufacturing agreement at a third party facility, and we also use third party manufacturers for many of our cheese products. 
Eggs and egg products sold by our Foodservice and Refrigerated Retail segments together accounted for 34.6% of our consolidated net sales for fiscal 2022, and side dishes (including potato products) sold by our Foodservice and Refrigerated Retail segments together accounted for 11.1% of our consolidated net sales for fiscal 2022. For additional information regarding our net sales by product, refer to Note 21 within “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” in Item 8 of this report. 
Sales, Marketing and Distribution
Each of our businesses has developed marketing strategies specific to its product lines. For certain of our products, we have consumer-targeted marketing campaigns, which generally include television, digital and print advertisements, coupon offers, rebate programs, co-marketing arrangements with complementary consumer product and entertainment companies and joint advertising with select retail customers. We also generally use print and digital advertising and social media, as well as more targeted grass roots programs such as sampling events, in order to increase brand awareness and loyalty at both national and local levels. Our internet and social media efforts are used to educate consumers about the nutritional value and flavor profiles of our products and for product promotion and consumer entertainment.
Our Post Consumer Brands segment sells products primarily through an internal sales staff and broker organizations. Our Weetabix segment services its key U.K. markets through a centralized commercial team which manages relationships with customers at the corporate level while a third party sales force operates at the store level to ensure maximum availability and compliance with agreed plans. Weetabix has in-country sales and marketing teams in the growth markets of Spain, the United Arab Emirates and China, and it also services emerging markets, such as China and Hong Kong, through the eCommerce channel. Our Foodservice and Refrigerated Retail segments sell and market their products primarily through dedicated teams of internal sales staff and broker organizations.
Generally, our products are distributed through a network of third party common carriers. In addition, our Refrigerated Retail segment has internal fleets that distribute certain of its products.
Research and Development
Our research and development efforts span our business segments. These capabilities extend to ingredients, packaging technologies, product sizes and delivery formats; new product and process development, as well as analytical support; bench-top and pilot plant capabilities; and research support to operations.
Raw Materials and Energy
Raw materials used in our businesses (purchased from local, regional and international suppliers) include ingredients and packaging materials. The principal ingredients for the Post Consumer Brands and Weetabix segments are agricultural commodities, including wheat, oats, rice, corn, other grain products, vegetable oils, dairy- and vegetable-based proteins, sugar and other sweeteners, fruit and nuts. The principal ingredients for the Foodservice and Refrigerated Retail segments are eggs, pork, pasta, potatoes, cheese, milk and butter. A portion of our egg needs comes from Company-owned layer hens, and the balance is purchased under third party contracts and in the spot market. We also buy significant amounts of grain to feed layer hens. In addition, we procure live sows at prevailing market prices, and under fixed price contracts, from terminals, local auctions, country markets and corporate and family farms in various U.S. locations. Our businesses also use large quantities of water. Each of our segments utilizes raw material sources that ensure that its products meet standards, certifications and customer requirements, where applicable, for example, non-GMO, organic, gluten-free and/or cage-free. The principal packaging materials used by our businesses are folding cartons, corrugated boxes, flexible and rigid plastic film, trays and containers, beverage packaging and plastic lined cartonboard. Our Refrigerated Retail segment also uses large quantities of carbon dioxide as a cooling agent during its sausage production.
In addition, our manufacturing and distribution operations use large quantities of natural gas, electricity and diesel fuel. Cereal processing ovens and most of the Foodservice and Refrigerated Retail production facilities generally are fueled by natural gas, which is obtained from local utilities or other local suppliers. Electricity and steam (generated in on-site, gas-fired boilers) also are used in our manufacturing facilities. In addition, considerable amounts of diesel fuel are used in connection with the distribution of our products, including in our internal fleet. Weetabix owns and operates its own combined heat and power generation unit, which is capable of supplying the majority of the requirements of its main operation site with power and steam which means the site can be operated using either electricity or natural gas.
Supply availability and prices paid for raw materials and energy can fluctuate widely due to external factors, including, as applicable, inflation, labor shortages, public health crises (such as the COVID-19 pandemic), geopolitical events, national or international disputes, terrorism, war or armed hostilities (such as the ongoing conflict in Ukraine), animal feed costs, any naturally occurring or climate change induced acute (including extreme weather and natural disasters) or chronic (including prolonged temperature and weather patterns) climatic events, agricultural yield, governmental programs, regulations and trade and tariff policies, insects, plant diseases, increased demand, diseases affecting livestock (such as the 2015 and 2022 AI outbreaks and the 2013 PEDV swine outbreak) and milk price supports established by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (the “USDA”). In addition, the prices of inputs may increase as we pursue more sustainable, specially sourced or certified raw materials or alternative energy sources, including mandatory or voluntary transitions to low carbon renewables. Higher prices for natural gas, electricity and fuel also may increase our ingredient, production and delivery costs.
We continuously monitor worldwide supply and cost trends for our raw materials and energy needs to enable us to take appropriate action to obtain the necessary raw materials and energy for our operations. During fiscal 2022, we experienced higher than expected raw materials and energy costs, largely due to cost pressures resulting from economic conditions, including inflation and rising interest rates, labor shortages and other downstream impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic and the ongoing conflict in Ukraine. We expect these heightened costs to continue in fiscal 2023. In addition, during fiscal 2022, we have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, shortages of certain of our raw materials and energy, which have resulted, and we expect to continue to result, in us paying increased costs for our inputs and have impacted, and may in the future impact, our ability to produce our products.
Trademarks and Intellectual Property
We own or have long-term licenses to use a number of trademarks that are critical to the success of our businesses. Our Post Consumer Brands business’s trademarks include Post®, Post Consumer Brands®, Honey Bunches of Oats®, Great Grains®, Post® Bran Flakes, Post® Shredded Wheat, Spoon Size® Shredded Wheat, Golden Crisp®, Alpha-Bits®, Ohs!®, Shreddies™, Post® Raisin Bran, Grape-Nuts®, Honeycomb®, Frosted Mini Spooners®, Golden Puffs®, Cinnamon Toasters®, Fruity Dyno-Bites®, Cocoa Dyno-Bites®, Berry Colossal Crunch®, Malt-O-Meal®, Farina™, Dyno-Bites®, Mom’s Best®, Better Oats®, CoCo Wheats®, Peter Pan®, Weetabix®, Barbara’s® and Puffins®, each of which we own, as well as several trademarks that we license from third parties for use in the U.S., Canada and several other international markets, such as Pebbles®, Oreo O’s®, Chips Ahoy!®, Honeymaid® and Premier Protein®.

We rely on a combination of trademark law, copyright law, trade secrets, non-disclosure and confidentiality agreements, provisions in other agreements and other measures to establish and protect our proprietary rights to our products, packaging, processes and intellectual property.
Seasonality
Demand for certain of our products may be influenced by holidays, changes in seasons or other events, which may impact customer and consumer spending patterns and the timing of promotional activities. For example, demand for our egg products, potatoes, sausage, side dishes, butter and cheese tends to increase during the Thanksgiving, Christmas, Easter and other holiday seasons, which may result in increased net sales during the first and third quarters of our fiscal year. Demand for our Malt-O-Meal hot wheat, Better Oats oatmeal and Ready Brek hot oats cereals also tends to be seasonably skewed towards the colder winter season. However, on a consolidated basis our net sales and results of operations generally are distributed relatively evenly over the quarters of our fiscal year. 
Customers
We sell Post Consumer Brands products primarily to grocery stores, mass merchandise customers, supercenters, club stores, natural/specialty stores and drug store customers. We also sell Post Consumer Brands products in the military, eCommerce and foodservice channels. Our Weetabix segment’s products are primarily sold to grocery stores, discounters, wholesalers and convenience stores and through eCommerce. Our Foodservice segment’s primary customers include foodservice distributors and national restaurant chains. Our Refrigerated Retail segment’s primary customers include grocery stores and mass merchandise customers. 
Our largest customer, Walmart, accounted for 14.4% of our consolidated net sales in fiscal 2022. No other customer accounted for more than 10% of our fiscal 2022 consolidated net sales, but each of our segments depend on sales to large customers. For example, the largest customer of our Post Consumer Brands segment, Walmart, accounted for 28.0% of Post Consumer Brands’s net sales in fiscal 2022. The largest customers of our Weetabix segment, Tesco and Asda, accounted for 29.6% of Weetabix’s net sales in fiscal 2022. The largest customers of our Foodservice segment, Sysco and US Foods, accounted for 36.6% of the segment’s net sales in fiscal 2022. Additionally, the largest customers of our Refrigerated Retail segment, Walmart and Kroger, accounted for 31.9% of the segment’s net sales in fiscal 2022. For purposes of this disclosure, “Walmart” refers to Walmart Inc. and its affiliates, which include Sam’s Club.
Competition
The consumer food and beverage categories in which we operate are highly competitive and highly sensitive to both pricing and promotion. Competition is based on, among other things, brand appeal, recognition and loyalty, taste, nutritional value, price, ingredients, product quality, product availability, variety, innovation, distribution, packaging, convenience, effective promotional activities and the ability to identify and satisfy dynamic, emerging consumer preferences. Our principal competitors in these categories may have substantial financial, marketing and other resources. In addition, in many of our product categories, we compete not only with widely advertised branded products, but also with private label and store brand products. Our principal strategies for competing in each of our segments include effective customer relationship management, category insights, superior product quality and food safety, product innovation, an efficient supply chain and competitive pricing. The categories in which we operate are expected to remain highly competitive for the foreseeable future.
Governmental Regulation and Environmental Matters
We are subject to regulation by federal, state, local and foreign governmental entities and agencies. Our activities in Canada and Europe are subject to regulations similar to those applicable to our businesses in the U.S. As a producer and distributor of goods for human consumption, our operations must comply with stringent production, storage, distribution, 
labeling and marketing standards administered by the applicable government entities, namely the Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”), the USDA, the Federal Trade Commission and state and local agencies in the U.S., as well as similar regulatory agencies in Canada, Mexico, the U.K., the European Union (the “E.U.”) and elsewhere. Products that do not meet regulatory standards may be considered to be adulterated and/or misbranded and subject to recall. 
Our facilities, like those of similar businesses, are subject to certain safety regulations, including regulations issued pursuant to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Act and similar regulations in Canada and the U.K. These regulations require us to comply with certain safety standards to protect our employees. Further, certain of our Foodservice and Refrigerated Retail operations are subject to laws that mandate specific housing requirements for layer hens and mandate specific space requirements for farm animal enclosures, including layer hens and pigs, which laws may vary on a state to state basis. We also are subject to laws, rules and regulations in the U.S. and other countries related to anti-corruption, antitrust and competition, economic sanctions and imports/exports.
In addition, our operations are subject to various federal, state and foreign laws and regulations regarding data privacy, including the General Data Protection Regulation, the E.U.’s retained law version of the General Data Protection Regulation and the California Consumer Privacy Act (as modified by the California Privacy Rights Act), each of which applies to certain of our businesses and deals with the collection and use of personal information obtained from data subjects. Our operations and products also are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations with respect to environmental matters, including air quality, noise, wastewater pretreatment and discharge, storm water, waste handling and disposal and other regulations intended to protect public health and the environment. 
We continue to monitor developments in laws and regulations. While the impact of laws and regulations on our businesses cannot be predicted with certainty, we currently do not believe that compliance with existing laws and regulations will have a material effect on our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position.
Human Capital
Post and its consolidated subsidiaries have approximately 10,420 employees as of November 1, 2022, of which approximately 8,700 are in the U.S., approximately 1,080 are in the U.K., approximately 470 are in Canada and approximately 170 are located in other jurisdictions. As of November 1, 2022, approximately 18.6% of such employees were unionized. We have entered into several collective bargaining agreements on terms that we believe are typical for the industries in which we operate. Most of the unionized workers at our facilities are represented under contracts which expire at various times throughout the next several years. In general, as these agreements expire, we believe that the agreements can be renegotiated on terms satisfactory to us. Any new collective bargaining agreements could result in changes to our cost structure at the relevant facilities. We believe that overall we have good relationships with employees and their representative organizations. 
Our people are critical to our success. While each of our businesses generally operates autonomously to implement its talent acquisition and management strategies with respect to its employees, our organization aligns to provide a safe, rewarding and respectful workplace where employees have opportunities to pursue development and career paths based on their skills, performance and potential. We adhere to our Code of Conduct, which sets forth a commitment to our stakeholders, including our employees, to operate with integrity.
Health and Safety
We are committed to maintaining a healthy and safe workplace for our employees. We adhere to a global environmental, health, safety and sustainability policy. We utilize a comprehensive safety and risk management system that incorporates rigorous safety standards and practices, employee and leadership training to ensure consistent implementation of our safety protocols and periodic internal and external audits to evaluate our compliance with such policies. Through regular communications between safety teams and leaders, we strive to continuously improve and update our safety protocols and practices. Our senior leadership team and our Board of Directors receive periodic updates regarding the performance of our safety and risk management system and our risk mitigation activities. 
Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, we have adhered to our infectious disease preparedness and response plans, which continue to be informed by national and local data in the geographies in which we operate and which have continually been reviewed and updated by a cross-functional team comprised of human resources, health and safety and other employees across our organization as the pandemic has evolved. At various points during the pandemic, we have implemented a variety of safety measures to protect the health and safety of our employees. As the number of critical COVID-19 cases began to trend downward, and consistent with national and local health department direction, certain pandemic related safety measures were relaxed at our corporate offices and manufacturing facilities. However, if these trends were to reverse or a vaccine-resistant variant were to emerge and become prevalent, we would reevaluate our safety protocols at that time and implement any additional safety protocols needed. Emerging from the pandemic, we continue to highlight, invest in and recognize the importance of our employees to the success of our businesses.
Talent Acquisition, Development, Engagement and Retention 
Acquiring, developing, engaging and retaining a diverse and talented workforce is key to accomplishing our talent acquisition, management and retention goals and to achieving business results. 
We continue to enhance our talent acquisition philosophy across the enterprise through community outreach initiatives, providing training and resources to our recruiters and people leaders on interviewing skills and by enhancing our career websites and resources.
We believe encouraging internal mobility is a key strategy to reducing attrition by retaining critical talent across our organization, as well as building succession plans with their future roles in mind. We continue to implement initiatives to encourage and remove barriers to internal mobility opportunities.
Another key factor in our human capital management strategy is providing development opportunities and resources for our employees. We offer a variety of training and development programs for employees. In addition, we encourage building individual development plans and offer a large array of training resources, ranging from technical skills to communication and performance feedback. We also provide robust compliance training. 
Our businesses conduct engagement surveys and then use those results to understand strengths and areas of opportunity. Many of our employees participate in company-organized volunteer events which foster a sense of community and giving.
We continue to review, evaluate and implement solutions and resources that address the physical, mental health and overall well-being of our employees. Our Total Rewards programs, plans and policies are designed to be comprehensive and competitive, support our business goals and be cost effective and promote shared fiscal responsibility. To support the health and financial needs of our employees, we offer competitive fixed and/or variable pay and a suite of benefit plans and programs to eligible employees, including medical, prescription drug, dental, vision, life insurance, disability coverage, employee assistance programs and defined benefit and defined contribution retirement plans.
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion
We are committed to building an inclusive culture throughout our organization. Our Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Council, which has representation from our holding company and each of our businesses, has been working to develop strategies and help establish initiatives for diversity, equity and inclusion (“DEI”) and create tools that can be used to align efforts and monitor and track progress across our organization. During fiscal 2021, we completed an internal assessment of our processes and practices, including an enterprise-wide culture survey, which informed our plans to focus on the following enterprise-wide DEI initiatives in fiscal 2022: (i) created an employee speak up line in an effort to foster a “speak up” culture with regard to DEI matters, (ii) developed training on how to foster more inclusive work environments, (iii) revised job descriptions to eliminate bias in our talent selection process, (iv) piloted several employee resource groups with a focus on DEI and (v) created a newsletter to share successful initiatives across our businesses, with a deliberate intention to learn and find ways to leverage such initiatives to support team member development and networking. Our Board of Directors receives periodic updates regarding our DEI efforts.
