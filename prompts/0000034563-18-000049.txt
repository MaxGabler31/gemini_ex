Item 1. | Business

Overview
Farmer Bros. Co., a Delaware corporation (including its consolidated subsidiaries unless the context otherwise requires, the “Company,” “we,” “us,” “our” or “Farmer Bros.”), is a national coffee roaster, wholesaler and distributor of coffee, tea and culinary products. We serve a wide variety of customers, from small independent restaurants and foodservice operators to large institutional buyers like restaurant, department and convenience store chains, hotels, casinos, healthcare facilities, and gourmet coffee houses, as well as grocery chains with private brand and consumer-branded coffee and tea products, and foodservice distributors. With a robust product line, including organic, Direct Trade, Project D.I.R.E.C.T.® and other sustainably-produced coffees, iced and hot teas, cappuccino, spices, and baking/biscuit mixes, among others, we offer a comprehensive approach to our customers by providing not only a breadth of high-quality products, but also value added services such as market insight, beverage planning, and equipment placement and service. We were founded in 1912, incorporated in California in 1923, and reincorporated in Delaware in 2004. We operate in one business segment.
Corporate Relocation
In fiscal 2015 we began the process of relocating our corporate headquarters, product development lab, and manufacturing and distribution operations from Torrance, California to a new facility housing these operations in Northlake, Texas (the “New Facility”) (the “Corporate Relocation Plan”). In order to focus on our core product offerings, in the second quarter of fiscal 2016, we sold certain assets associated with our manufacture, processing and distribution of raw, processed and blended spices and certain other culinary products (collectively, the “Spice Assets”) to Harris Spice Company Inc. (“Harris”). In fiscal 2017, we completed the construction of, and exercised the purchase option to acquire, the New Facility, relocated our Torrance operations to the New Facility, and sold our facility in Torrance, California (the “Torrance Facility”). We commenced distribution activities at the New Facility during the second quarter of fiscal 2017 and initial production activities late in the third quarter of fiscal 2017. We completed the Corporate Relocation Plan and began roasting coffee in the New Facility in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017. The New Facility received Safe Quality Food (SQF) certification in the third quarter of fiscal 2018. 
Recent Developments
Acquisitions
On October 2, 2017, we acquired substantially all of the assets and certain specified liabilities of Boyd Coffee Company (“Boyd Coffee”), a coffee roaster and distributor with a focus on restaurants, hotels, and convenience stores on the West Coast of the United States, in consideration of cash and preferred stock. The acquired business of Boyd Coffee (the “Boyd Business”) is expected to add to our product portfolio, improve our growth potential, deepen our distribution footprint and increase our capacity utilization at our production facilities.
In fiscal 2017, we completed two acquisitions. On October 11, 2016, we acquired substantially all of the assets and certain specified liabilities of China Mist Brands, Inc. dba China Mist Tea Company (“China Mist”), a provider of flavored and unflavored iced and hot teas, and on February 7, 2017, we acquired substantially all of the assets and certain specified liabilities of West Coast Coffee Company, Inc. (“West Coast Coffee”), a coffee roaster and distributor with a focus on the convenience store, grocery and foodservice channels. The China Mist acquisition extended our tea product offerings and gave us a greater presence in the premium tea industry, while the West Coast Coffee acquisition broadened our reach in the Northwestern United States.
DSD Restructuring Plan
As a result of an ongoing operational review of various initiatives within our direct-store-delivery or DSD selling organization, in the third quarter of fiscal 2017, we commenced a restructuring plan to reorganize our DSD operations in an effort to realign functions into a channel-based selling organization, streamline operations, acquire certain channel specific expertise, and improve selling effectiveness and financial results (the “DSD Restructuring Plan”). The DSD Restructuring Plan continued in fiscal 2018, and we expect to complete the DSD Restructuring Plan by the end of fiscal 2019.

New Facility Expansion
In the third quarter of fiscal 2018, we commenced a project to expand our production lines (the “Expansion Project”) in the New Facility including expanding capacity to support the transition of acquired business volumes. Construction, equipment procurement and installation associated with the Expansion Project are expected to be completed in fiscal 2019.

Business Strategy
Overview
We are a coffee company designed to deliver the coffee people want, the way they want it. We are focused on being a growing and profitable forward-thinking industry leader, championing coffee culture through understanding, leading, building and winning in the business of coffee. Through our sustainability, stewardship, environmental efforts, and leadership we are not only committed to serving the finest products available, considering the cost needs of the customer, but also insist on their sustainable cultivation, manufacture and distribution whenever possible.
In order to achieve our mission, we have had to grow existing capabilities and develop new ones over the years. More recently, we have undertaken initiatives such as, but not limited to, the following:

• | develop new products in response to demographic and other trends to better compete in areas such as premium coffees and teas;


• | expand production line capacity at the New Facility to integrate acquired product volumes and to support top-line growth;


• | grow through acquisitions to broaden our geographic reach and to increase our presence in the premium tea industry;

2


• | implement a channel-based selling strategy to better address the unique needs of each customer channel, more quickly respond to industry trends, and improve sales growth;


• | rethink aspects of our Company culture to improve productivity and employee engagement and to attract and retain talent;


• | embrace sustainability across our operations, in the quality of our products, as well as, how we treat our coffee growers; and


• | ensure our systems and processes provide high-quality products at a competitive cost, protection against cyber threats, and a safe environment for our employees and partners.

We differentiate ourselves in the marketplace through our product offerings and through our customer service model, with quality and sustainability as the underpinning, which includes:

• | a wide variety of coffee product offerings and packaging options across numerous brands and three quality tiers-value, premium and specialty;


• | consumer-branded coffee and tea products;


• | channel-based expertise;


• | beverage equipment placement and service;


• | hassle-free inventory and product procurement management;


• | DSD service;


• | merchandising support;


• | product and menu insights; and


• | a robust approach to social, environmental and economic sustainability throughout our business.

Our services provided to DSD customers are conducted primarily in person through Route Sales Representatives, or RSRs, who develop personal relationships with chefs, restaurant owners and food buyers at their delivery locations. We also provide comprehensive coffee programs to our national account customers, including private brand development, green coffee procurement, hedging, category management, sustainable sourcing and supply chain management. Through China Mist Tea-Loving Care®, we offer our customers an iced tea service that includes a diverse offering of on-trend products, brewing equipment calibrated to extract optimal flavor from our tea blends, specialized distribution, training and incentives, professional service, quality assurance, and strategic marketing support. 
Strategic Initiatives
We are focused on the following strategies to capitalize on our state-of-the-art New Facility, reduce costs, streamline our supply chain, expand the breadth of products and services we provide to our customers, broaden our geographic reach, increase our presence in high growth industries and product categories, and better position the Company for growth:
Capitalize on State-of-the-Art Facility

• | New Facility Investment. In fiscal 2017, we completed construction of and relocation to our state-of-the-art facility in Northlake, Texas. In fiscal 2018, we began a project to expand our production lines at the New Facility. We are focused on leveraging our investment in the New Facility to produce the highest quality coffee in response to the market shift to premium and specialty coffee, support the transition of acquired product volumes, and create opportunities for customer acquisition and sustainable long-term growth.


• | SQF Certification. We are committed to the highest standards in food quality and safety. In fiscal 2018, the New Facility received SQF certification, joining our Portland and Houston SQF-certified facilities. SQF is a Global Food Safety Initiative-based system that strengthens our commitment to supply safe quality coffee products and comply with food safety legislation. Required by many of our national account customers, SQF certification at the New Facility marks an important step that will allow us the production platform to increase volume for national account customers as needed.

Reduce Costs to Compete More Effectively

• | Acquisition Integration. Through our recent acquisitions we have worked to reduce costs by integrating the acquired businesses into our existing corporate and operational structure. Eliminating redundant functions, merging delivery networks and combining production processing and facilities are expected to result in added synergies and efficiencies compared to their pre-acquisition cost structures.


• | New Facility. We undertook the Corporate Relocation Plan, in part, to pursue improved production efficiency to allow us to provide a more cost-competitive offering of high-quality products. We believe the ongoing improvements in production efficiency will allow us to operate at a lower cost, generally over the long term.


• | DSD Restructuring Plan. As a result of an ongoing operational review of various initiatives within our DSD selling organization, in the third quarter of fiscal 2017, we commenced the DSD Restructuring Plan to reorganize our DSD operations in an effort to realign functions into a channel-based selling organization, streamline operations, acquire certain channel specific expertise, and improve selling effectiveness and financial results. We began recognizing cost benefits associated with the restructuring in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 and we anticipate annualized savings from the restructuring plan beginning in the second quarter of fiscal 2019. We expect to complete the DSD Restructuring Plan by the end of fiscal 2019. We continue to analyze our sales organization and evaluate other potential restructuring opportunities in light of our strategic priorities.


• | Supply Chain. In recent years, we have undertaken efforts to streamline our supply chain, including replacing our long-haul fleet operations with third-party logistics (“3PL“), resulting in a reduction in our fuel consumption and empty trailer miles, while improving our intermodal and trailer cube utilization; using vendor managed inventory arrangements to reconfigure our packaging methodology and reduce waste; and engaging third-party warehouse management services at the New Facility to facilitate cost savings by leveraging the third party's expertise in opening new facilities, implementing lean management practices, improving performance on certain key performance metrics, and standardizing best practices.


• | Telematics. In an effort to make our DSD fleet more fuel-efficient, during fiscal 2018 we installed telematics monitoring devices in our delivery trucks, allowing us to see contributing factors to our transportation-related carbon footprint. Installation of telematics monitoring devices has resulted in reduced idling time, a cut in rapid acceleration, and a reduction in fuel expenditures.

Optimize Sales and Portfolio of Products

• | Channel-Based Selling Organization. Changing from a geographic to a channel-based selling strategy is expected to allow us to better serve our customers and improve sales growth. We believe this channel-based selling strategy will empower our sales organization to better address the unique needs of each customer channel thereby deepening our customer relationships, allow us to create a more comprehensive customer support structure, enhance our marketing efforts, and allow us to respond more quickly to industry trends. To this end, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, we realigned our DSD and direct ship regional and national sales teams around sales channels to further our channel-based selling strategy.


• | Optimize Product Portfolio. In fiscal 2018, we undertook efforts to optimize our SKU count reducing our total SKU count by 11% excluding Boyd Coffee.

4

Strategic Investment in Assets and Evaluation of Cost Structure

• | Market Opportunities. We believe we are well-positioned to continue to pursue growth through additional, opportunistic M&A activity to deliver aligned brands, customers and innovation. For example, in fiscal 2018, we completed the Boyd Coffee acquisition to add to our product portfolio, improve our growth potential, deepen our distribution footprint and increase our capacity utilization at our production facilities. Additionally, in fiscal 2017, we completed the China Mist acquisition to extend our tea product offerings and give us a greater presence in the premium tea industry, and the West Coast Coffee acquisition to broaden our reach in the Northwestern United States. See Note 4, Acquisitions, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this report.


• | Asset Utilization. We continue to look for ways to deploy our personnel, systems, assets and infrastructure to create or enhance stockholder value. Areas of focus have included corporate staffing and structure, methods of procurement, logistics, inventory management, supporting technology, and real estate assets.


• | Investment in Technology. We have invested in technology and process improvements to improve our efficiency and the effectiveness of our sales and distribution network. Two initiatives that were completed in fiscal 2018 were advanced routing software for our last mile delivery and the next version of our hand-held sales and inventory management device for our delivery drivers.


• | Branch Consolidation and Property Sales. We evaluate our branch operation structure on an ongoing basis to identify opportunities to streamline the supply chain and reduce costs. In an effort to streamline our branch operations, in fiscal 2018, we sold a Texas branch property and in fiscal 2017 and 2016, we sold one and two Northern California branch properties, respectively.

Corporate Capabilities and Alignment to Create Stockholder Value

• | Investment in Human Resources. Our senior leadership team brings a proven track record of strategic and operational leadership capabilities. We have also added experienced and vibrant talent to our team and continue to benefit from our in-house expertise in sustainability, acquisition and integration, and operations.


• | Commitment to Employee Wellness. We are committed to creating a healthier and happier workforce which we believe contributes to our success. We have received certifications as a Fit-Friendly Worksite and a Blue Zone Workplace based on the activities and environment created in our workplace to support healthy living and promote wellness of our associates.


• | Employee Development. We have invested in a Learning Management System to enable training facilitation and tracking of training modules to support the development of employees at all levels and functions within the organization. During fiscal 2018, we deployed courses to our Quality, Manufacturing and Maintenance functions and we intend to expand our focus to include critical training modules that impact our entire workforce. We recently completed a Talent Planning Process of all exempt level employees across the organization. We calibrated the assessment of talent and created and began to execute on succession charts for all critical roles to ensure we have the right talent and capabilities to support the business today and in the future. 


• | Performance Driven Culture. In fiscal 2018, we continued to pursue greater alignment of employee individual goals with Company goals under our compensation plans in order to focus the entire organization on the effort to create value for our stockholders.


• | Product Development Lab. The New Facility includes a product development lab where we are focused on developing innovative products in response to industry trends and customer needs. In fiscal 2018, we developed new products including Artisan and Metro Single Origin coffees, cold brew coffees, Artisan hot teas and on trend seasonal coffees and cappuccinos.

Expand Sustainability Leadership

• | Sustainability. We believe that our collective efforts in measuring our social and environmental impact, creating programs for waste, water and energy reduction, promoting partnerships in our supply chain that aim at supply chain stability and food security, and focusing on employee engagement place us in a unique position to help retailers and foodservice operators create differentiated coffee and tea programs that can include sustainable supply chains, direct trade purchasing, training and technical assistance, recycling and composting networks, and

5

packaging material reductions. During fiscal 2018, we made the Carbon Disclosure Project's Climate A-List for our leadership in reducing Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions (direct emissions, indirect emissions from consumption of purchased electricity, heat or steam and other indirect emissions). Further, in fiscal 2018, we published our annual sustainability report based on the Global Reporting Initiative’s comprehensive compliance standard. In addition, China Mist is a member of the Ethical Tea Partnership (the “ETP”), a non-profit organization that works to improve the sustainability of the tea sector, the lives of tea workers and farmers, and the environment in which tea is produced. As a member of the ETP, China Mist sources all of its tea from tea plantations that are certified, monitored, and regularly audited by the ETP.

• | Science-Based Carbon Reduction Targets. We believe combating climate change is critical to the future of our company, the coffee industry, coffee growers and the world. In fiscal 2018 we began progress to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions across our roasting and administrative operations to achieve our Science Based Targets. Setting approved targets places us among those responsible businesses that are making measurable contributions to incorporate sustainability within their business strategy.


• | Zero Waste to Landfill. Achieving zero waste in our production and distribution facilities is a significant step in reaching our overall sustainability goals. In fiscal 2018 we achieved our goal of 90% waste diversion for our primary production and distribution facilities. To accomplish this goal, we implemented ambitious recycling and composting guidelines across these facilities. The enhanced efforts resulted in an approximate 80% reduction from previous years, meeting the Zero Waste International Alliance requirements for diverting waste sent to landfills in these locations.


• | LEED® Certified Facilities. Our Portland production and distribution facility was one of the first in the Northwest to achieve LEED® Silver Certification. We also achieved LEED® Silver Certification for our corporate offices at the New Facility.


• | Expansion of Project D.I.R.E.C.T.® Program. In fiscal 2018, we completed the baseline analysis of a third origin, Brazil, for our Project D.I.R.E.C.T.® program for sourcing green coffee. This information will be used to characterize farm level investments and technical assistance improvements within the communities from which we source these coffees. Project D.I.R.E.C.T.® is an impact-based product or raw material sourcing framework that utilizes data-based sustainability metrics to influence an inclusive, collaborative approach to sustainability along the supply chain. To evaluate whether coffee is Project D.I.R.E.C.T.®, we follow an outcome-based evaluation framework. The result of this evaluation impacts where we invest our resources within our supply chain and has led to an increased level of transparency for us. Project D.I.R.E.C.T.® represents a growing part of our coffee portfolio.


• | Green Coffee Traceability. We are committed to the inclusion of more sustainably-sourced coffees in our supply chain. Regulatory and reputational risks can increase when customers, roasters and suppliers cannot see back into their supply chain. To address these concerns, as well as to deepen our commitment to the longevity of the coffee industry, we track traceability levels from all green coffee suppliers on a per-contract basis.


• | Supplier Sustainability. We are committed to working with suppliers who share our social, environmental and economic sustainability goals. Regulatory and reputational risks can increase when suppliers are not held to the same strict standards to which we hold ourselves. To address this concern, in fiscal 2017, we surveyed all green coffee suppliers to assess their social, environmental, and economic sustainability practices and alignment with the United Nations Global Compact, a United Nations initiative to encourage businesses worldwide to adopt sustainable and socially responsible policies, documenting 99% compliance with United Nations Global Compact practices from all respondents. In fiscal 2018, we expanded this survey to include all green coffee suppliers along with our top suppliers of processed coffee and non-coffee products. We are awaiting the fiscal 2018 survey results.

Charitable Activities
We view charitable involvement as a part of our corporate responsibility and sustainability model: Social, Environmental, and Economic Development, or SEED. We endorse and support communities where our customers, 
6

employees, businesses, and suppliers are located, and who have enthusiastically supported us over the past 100 years. Our objective is to provide support toward a mission of supply chain stability with a focus on food security.
Recipient organizations include those with strong local and regional networks that ensure that families have access to nutritious food. Donations may take the form of corporate cash contributions, product donations, employee volunteerism, and workplace giving (with or without matching contributions).

• | Recipient organizations include Feeding America, Ronald McDonald House, and local food banks.


• | We support industry organizations such as World Coffee Research, which commits to grow, protect, and enhance supplies of quality coffee while improving the livelihoods of the families who produce it, and the Specialty Coffee Association (“SCA”) Sustainability Council and the Coalition for Coffee Communities, which are focused on sustainability in coffee growing regions.


• | Our employee-driven CAFÉ Crew organizes employee involvement at local charities and fund raisers, including support of Team Ronald McDonald House, riding in the Ride Against Hunger supported by Tarrant Area Food Bank, hosting local food drives and donation of Farmer Brothers products nearing the end of their shelf life to organizations related to Feeding America.


• | All of our usable and near expiring products or products with damaged packaging that can be donated are donated to Feeding America affiliated food banks nationwide, in an effort to keep all edible food waste from going to landfills.

Industry and Market Leadership
We have made the following investments in an effort to ensure we are well-positioned within the industry to take advantage of category trends, industry insights, and general coffee and tea knowledge to grow our business:

• | Coffee Industry Leadership. Through our dedication to the craft of sourcing, blending and roasting coffee, and our participation and/or leadership positions with the SCA, National Coffee Association, Coalition for Coffee Communities, International Women's Coffee Alliance, International Foodservice Manufacturers Association, Pacific Coast Coffee Association, Roasters Guild and World Coffee Research, we work to help shape the future of the coffee industry. We believe that due to our commitment to the industry, large retail and foodservice operators are drawn to working with us. We were among the first coffee roasters in the nation to receive SCA certification of a state-of-the-art coffee lab and operate Public Domain®, a specialty coffeehouse in Portland, Oregon. We also received SCA certification for our product development lab at the New Facility.


• | Market Insight and Consumer Research. We have developed a market insight capability internally that reinforces our business-to-business positioning as a thought leader in the coffee and tea industries. We provide trend insights that help our customers create winning products and integrated marketing strategies. Within this, we are focused on understanding key demographic groups such as Millennials and Hispanics, and key channel trends.

Raw Materials and Supplies
Our primary raw material is green coffee, an exchange-traded agricultural commodity that is subject to price fluctuations. Over the past five years, the coffee “C” market near month price per pound ranged from approximately $1.02 to $2.22. The coffee “C” market near month price as of June 30, 2018 and 2017 was $1.15 and $1.26 per pound, respectively. Our principal packaging materials include cartonboard, corrugated and plastic. We also use a significant amount of electricity, natural gas, and other energy sources to operate our production and distribution facilities.
We purchase green coffee beans from multiple coffee regions around the world. Coffee “C” market prices in fiscal 2018 traded in a 29 cent range during the year, and averaged 11% below the historical average for the past five years. There can be no assurance that green coffee prices will remain at these levels in the future. Some of the Arabica coffee beans we purchase do not trade directly on the commodity markets. Rather, we purchase these coffee beans on a negotiated basis from coffee brokers, exporters and growers, including Direct Trade and Fair Trade Certified™ sources and Rainforest Alliance Certified™ farms. Fair Trade Certified™ provides an assurance that farmer groups are receiving the Fair Trade minimum price and an additional premium for certified organic products through arrangements with cooperatives. Direct Trade products provide similar assurance except that the arrangements are provided directly to individual coffee growers instead of 
7

to cooperatives, providing these farmers with price premiums and dedicated technical assistance to improve farm conditions and increase both quality and productivity of sustainable coffee crops, at the individual farm level. Rainforest Alliance Certified™ coffee is grown using methods that help promote and preserve biodiversity, conserve scarce natural resources, and help farmers build sustainable lives. Our business model strives to reduce the impact of green coffee price fluctuations on our financial results and to protect and stabilize our margins, principally through customer arrangements and derivative instruments, as further explained in Note 8, Derivative Instruments, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this report.
Intellectual Property
We own a number of United States trademarks and service marks that have been registered with the United States Patent and Trademark Office. We also own other trademarks and service marks for which we have filed applications for U.S. registration. We have licenses to use certain trademarks outside of the United States and to certain product formulas, all subject to the terms of the agreements under which such licenses are granted. We believe our trademarks and service marks are integral to customer identification of our products. It is not possible to assess the impact of the loss of such identification. Depending on the jurisdiction, trademarks are generally valid as long as they are in use and/or their registrations are properly maintained and they have not been found to have become generic. Registrations of trademarks can also generally be renewed indefinitely as long as the trademarks are in use. In addition, we own numerous copyrights, registered and unregistered, registered domain names, and proprietary trade secrets, technology, know-how, and other proprietary rights that are not registered.
Seasonality
We experience some seasonal influences. The winter months historically have generally been our strongest sales months. However, our product line and geographic diversity provide some sales stability during the warmer months when coffee consumption ordinarily decreases. Additionally, we usually experience an increase in sales during the summer and early fall months from seasonal businesses located in vacation areas and from grocery retailers ramping up inventory for the winter selling season. Because of the seasonality of our business, results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for the full fiscal year.
Distribution
We operate production facilities in Northlake, Texas; Houston, Texas; Portland, Oregon; and Hillsboro, Oregon. Distribution takes place out of the New Facility, the Portland and Hillsboro facilities, as well as separate distribution centers in Northlake, Illinois; Moonachie, New Jersey; and Scottsdale, Arizona. Our products reach our customers primarily in the following ways: through our nationwide DSD network of 447 delivery routes and 111 branch warehouses as of June 30, 2018, or direct-shipped via common carriers or third-party distributors. DSD sales are primarily made “off-truck” to our customers at their places of business. Our DSD business includes office coffee services whereby we provide office coffee and tea products, including a variety of coffee brands and blends, brewing and beverage equipment, and foodservice supplies directly to offices. We operate a large fleet of trucks and other vehicles to distribute and deliver our products through our DSD network, and we rely on 3PL service providers for our long-haul distribution. We maintain inventory levels at each branch warehouse to promote minimal interruption in supply. We also sell coffee and tea products directly to consumers through our websites and sell certain products at retail and through foodservice distributors.
Customers
We serve a wide variety of customers, from small independent restaurants and foodservice operators to large institutional buyers like restaurant, department and convenience store chains, hotels, casinos, healthcare facilities, and gourmet coffee houses, as well as grocery chains with private brand and consumer-branded coffee and tea products, and foodservice distributors. Although no single customer accounted for 10% or more of our net sales in any of the last three fiscal years, we have a number of large national account customers, the loss of or reduction in sales to one or more of which is likely to have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. During fiscal 2018, our top five customers accounted for approximately 18% of our net sales. 
Most of our customers rely on us for distribution; however, some of our customers use third-party distribution or conduct their own distribution. Some of our customers are “price” buyers, seeking the low-cost provider with little concern 
8

about service, while others find great value in the service programs we provide. We offer a full return policy to ensure satisfaction and extended terms for those customers who qualify. Historically, our product returns have not been significant.
Competition 
The coffee industry is highly competitive, including with respect to price, product quality, service, convenience, technology and innovation, and competition could become increasingly more intense due to the relatively low barriers to entry. We face competition from many sources, including the institutional foodservice divisions of multi-national manufacturers of retail products many of which have greater financial and other resources than we do, such as The J.M. Smucker Company (Folgers Coffee) and The Kraft Heinz Company (Maxwell House Coffee), wholesale foodservice distributors such as Sysco Corporation and US Foods, regional and national coffee roasters such as S&D Coffee & Tea (Cott Corporation), Massimo Zanetti Beverage USA, Trilliant Food and Nutrition LLC, Gaviña & Sons, Inc., Royal Cup, Inc., Ronnoco Coffee, LLC, and Community Coffee Company, L.L.C., specialty coffee suppliers such as Rogers Family Company, Distant Lands Coffee, Mother Parkers Tea & Coffee Inc., Starbucks Corporation and Peet’s Coffee & Tea (JAB Holding Company), and retail brand beverage manufacturers such as Keurig Dr. Pepper Inc.. As many of our customers are small foodservice operators, we also compete with cash and carry and club stores (physical and on-line) such as Costco, Sam’s Club and Restaurant Depot and on-line retailers such as Amazon. We also face competition from growth in the single-serve, ready-to-drink coffee beverage and cold-brewed coffee channels, as well as competition from other beverages, such as soft drinks (including highly caffeinated energy drinks), juices, bottled water, teas and other beverages.
We believe our state-of-the-art production facility, longevity, product quality and offerings, national distribution network, industry and sustainability leadership, market insight, comprehensive approach to customer relationship management, and superior customer service are the major factors that differentiate us from our competitors. We compete well when these factors are valued by our customers, and we are less effective when only price matters. Our customer base is price sensitive, and we are often faced with price competition.
Working Capital
We finance our operations internally and through borrowings under our existing credit facility. For a description of our liquidity and capital resources, see Results of Operations and Liquidity, Capital Resources and Financial Condition included in Part II, Item 7 of this report and Note 19, Other Current Liabilities, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this report. Our working capital needs are greater in the months leading up to our peak sales period during the winter months, which we typically finance with cash flows from operations. In anticipation of our peak sales period, we typically increase inventory in the first quarter of the fiscal year. We use various techniques including demand forecasting and planning to determine appropriate inventory levels for seasonal demand. 
Regulatory Environment
The conduct of our businesses, including, among other things, the production, storage, distribution, sale, labeling, quality and safety of our products, and occupational safety and health practices, are subject to various laws and regulations administered by federal, state and local governmental agencies in the United States. Our facilities are subject to various laws and regulations regarding the release of material into the environment and the protection of the environment in other ways. We are not a party to any material legal proceedings arising under these regulations except as described in Note 24, Commitments and Contingencies, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this report.
Employees
On June 30, 2018, we employed approximately 1,600 employees, 432 of whom are subject to collective bargaining agreements expiring on or before June 30, 2022. 
Other
The nature of our business does not provide for maintenance of or reliance upon a sales backlog. None of our business is subject to renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts or subcontracts at the election of the government. We have no material revenues from foreign operations or long-lived assets located in foreign countries.
