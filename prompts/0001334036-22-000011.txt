ITEM 1. Business
The Company
Crocs, Inc. and our consolidated subsidiaries (collectively, the “Company,” “Crocs,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) are engaged in the design, development, worldwide marketing, distribution, and sale of casual lifestyle footwear and accessories for women, men, and children. We strive to be the world leader in innovative casual footwear, combining comfort and style with a value that consumers want. The vast majority of shoes within our collection contain Croslite™ material, a proprietary, molded footwear technology, delivering extraordinary comfort with each step.
We run our business across three geographic regions: the Americas, Asia Pacific, and Europe, Middle East, and Africa (“EMEA”), which are discussed in more detail in “Business Segments and Geographic Information” below. Within these regions, we prioritize five core markets where we believe the greatest opportunities for growth exist: (i) China, (ii) Japan, (iii) South Korea, (iv) the U.S., and (v) Western Europe.
Our Vision
Our brand philosophy has our consumer at its heart. As a global brand “of the people, for the people,” we have successfully created a brand with a broad democratic appeal and accessible price points that is aligned with global megatrends such as casualization and personalization. Our brand philosophy and vision has been an important driver of our results and we believe will continue to be important as we realize the full potential of our brand. To that end, in 2021, we continued our message of “Come As You Are” in all regions and channels.
Our growth framework is driven by four strategic areas of focus: (i) growing digital sales, (ii) gaining market share in sandals, (iii) growth opportunities in Asia, and (iv) ongoing product and marketing innovation.
Growing Digital Sales
Digital sales include sales directly to consumers through our company-owned websites, third-party marketplaces, and wholesale sales to our global e-tailers. Our digital sales in 2021 were 36.7% of revenues, compared to 41.5% of revenues in 2020, which was higher than 2021 partially as a result of consumer migration to online shopping during the COVID-19 pandemic, and 31.1% of revenues in 2019. We plan to grow our percentage of digital sales by elevating our consumer experience, personalizing the consumer journey, and investing in capabilities to grow consumer lifetime value. We believe our digital connection with our consumers will allow us to remain nimble and maximize the full potential of the Crocs brand, while staying focused on the online channels in which our consumers are increasingly shopping.
Gaining Sandals Market Share
Sandals have long been a focus of the Company, as a large and accessible growth avenue for the brand. While we have increased sales of sandals in recent years, we believe there is an opportunity for additional growth. We discuss sandals in more depth under “Innovation in Products” below.
Growth Opportunities in Asia
As a brand with a well-established global footprint, we believe we have a long-term sales growth opportunity in the Asia Pacific segment. Our five core markets include three markets in Asia: China, Japan, and South Korea. China, in particular, which is the second largest footwear market in the world and represented about 20% of global footwear sales in 2020, is a key focus for us. Our strategy for China growth focuses on penetrating the digital channel, investing in an ‘always on’ marketing playbook to drive brand awareness and relevance, driving store growth and increased productivity within our mono-branded partner portfolio, and opening and operating a focused set of stores within major cities and in key outlet centers.
Innovation in Products and Marketing
Products
Since we first introduced a single-style clog in six colors in 2002, we have grown to be a world leader of innovative, casual footwear for women, men, and children. Recognized globally for our unmistakable iconic clog silhouette, we have taken the successful formula of a simple design aesthetic, paired it with modern comfort, and expanded into a wide variety of casual footwear products including sandals—wedges, flips, and slides—that meet the needs of the whole family. Our mission of “everyone comfortable in their own shoes” continued in 2021 as we continued to bring to our consumers new silhouettes, compelling collaborations, trend-right colors and graphics, Crocs socks, and increased personalization through our Jibbitz™ charms accessories.
We offer a broad portfolio of all-season products, while remaining true to our core molded footwear heritage. The vast majority of Crocs™ shoes feature Croslite™ material, a proprietary, revolutionary technology that gives each pair of shoes the soft, comfortable, lightweight, non-marking, and odor-resistant qualities that our fans know and love. We also use Croslite™ material formulations in connection with material technologies used in our visible comfort collections, such as our LiteRide™ products. LiteRide™ features comfort-focused, proprietary foam insoles which are soft, lightweight, and resilient.
At the heart of our brand’s DNA are our clogs, sandals, and Jibbitz™ charms — key product pillars that we believe will drive the majority of our long-term growth.
Clogs
The Classic Clog, our most iconic style for adults and children, embodies our innovation in molding, simplicity of design, and all-day comfort. The clog product silhouette is comfortable, versatile, and accessible. It provides a blank canvas for self-expression, while naturally lending itself to innovation, including the silhouette’s expansion into height, sport, adventure, and enhanced visible comfort technologies. Our product innovation and marketing over the past several years has driven clog relevance, which in turn has created brand relevance to consumers and led to increased sales. On-trend color and prints create highly compelling newness, allowing us to highlight the latest trends in our seasonal launches. Additionally, we have made our clog a year-round silhouette via innovations such as fuzz, used in our lined footwear collection.
We anticipate the clog market will continue to expand as many new brands enter the category in the luxury, sports, and fashion spaces, and that we will continue to increase our consumer base through product design and marketing activations. We intend to continue to drive future clog growth and relevance around the world.
Sandals
We believe sandals are a natural extension of our brand, leveraging our signature molding technology to provide casual, comfortable footwear for a variety of wearing occasions. The sandals silhouette category allows us to access new consumers and broader wearing occasions as well as convert our existing clog consumers. The current sandals market is fragmented with no single dominant player, which we believe offers us the opportunity to expand. Unlike clogs where our focus is on driving relevance, with sandals, our focus is on and opportunity lies with driving awareness and consideration.
Our expectation for the potential future growth of sandals is driven by several factors. First, clog relevance with consumers has converted to interest in sandals. Our recent brand metric studies show high levels of sandal consideration from consumers, matching clog consideration in many markets. This has been driven through marketing investments which have focused advertising campaigns and collaborations on the sandal silhouette and sandal product design that incorporates personalization. Additionally, while sandals are more seasonal than clogs, they still represent a year-round opportunity, particularly in the digital channel and our warmer markets.
Personalization
Personalization has been part of our culture since the very first pair of Crocs was created. Jibbitz™ charms enhance the consumer experience by providing an outlet for customization and self-expression, driving overall consumer engagement and retention, and heightening our message of “Come As You Are™” in all channels and regions. Personalization is a unique selling proposition and is an important part of our brand. Jibbitz™ drive high levels of engagement and purchase frequency. We intend to continue to position personalization at the heart of our brand experience, and expect it will continue to be a strong driver of sales in both the clog and sandal categories.
Our products also meet the needs of the entire family. We enjoy licensing partnerships with Disney, including Marvel and Lucasfilm, Warner Bros., Nintendo, and Nickelodeon, among others, which allow us to bring popular global franchises and characters to life on our product in a fun, exciting way.
Marketing
We concentrate our marketing efforts on our five core markets to increase customer awareness of both our brand and our full product range. Each season, we focus on presenting a compelling brand story and experience for our new product introductions as well as our on-going core products. We employ social and digital marketing centered on showcasing our clog and sandal silhouettes and our Jibbitz™ charms. We are growing our clog silhouette with new colors, graphics, licensed images, embellishments, and accessories, such as Jibbitz™ charms, that allow for personalization. We continue to invest in globally integrated advertising campaigns, as well as designer, celebrity and influencer, and brand partnerships, ranging from popular artists like Justin Bieber to a wide range of well-known brands such as Balenciaga and Hidden Valley Ranch. Innovation is not only core to our brand values; it is at the forefront of how we drive consumer acquisition and engagement. We strive to listen and respond quickly to our fans to give them new and innovative reasons to continue to choose Crocs. See Note 1 — Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II - Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for information on total marketing costs for the year.
HEYDUDE Acquisition
On December 22, 2021, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire the HEYDUDE brand (the “HEYDUDE Acquisition”), a privately-owned casual footwear brand, pursuant to a Securities Purchase Agreement (the “Securities Purchase Agreement”).
The HEYDUDE Acquisition will further diversify our product portfolio under two brands. The HEYDUDE brand provides an ultra-light and comfortable casual footwear product that aligns with our vision. The Securities Purchase Agreement provides that we will purchase all of the issued and outstanding equity securities of HEYDUDE for a purchase price of $2.05 billion in cash (the “Cash Consideration”) and 2,852,280 in Crocs shares to be issued to one of the sellers (the “Equity Consideration Shares”). The Equity Consideration Shares will be subject to a lock-up period beginning on the closing date (the “Closing Date”) of the HEYDUDE Acquisition and continuing to, and including, the date that is 12 months after the Closing Date, provided that (a) on the date that is six months after the Closing Date, 50% of the Equity Consideration Shares will be released from the lock-up, and (b) on the date that is twelve months after the Closing Date, the remaining 50% of the Equity Consideration Shares will be released from the lock-up. The Cash Consideration is subject to adjustment based on, among other things, the cash, indebtedness, transaction expenses, and working capital of HEYDUDE as of the closing of the HEYDUDE Acquisition. We expect to finance the Cash Consideration by entering into the $2.0 billion Term Loan B Facility (as defined herein) and borrowing $50.0 million under the Revolving Facility (as defined herein).
The HEYDUDE Acquisition is expected to close in February 2022, subject to customary closing conditions.
The foregoing description of the Securities Purchase Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby do not purport to be complete and are subject to, and qualified in their entirety by, the full text of the Securities Purchase Agreement, a copy of which is attached as Exhibit 2.1 to our Current Report on Form 8-K, filed on December 23, 2021.
Environmental, Social, and Governance (“ESG”) Initiatives
As one of the world’s largest footwear companies, we strive to make a positive impact on the global footwear industry and our planet by committing to transparent, socially conscious, and sustainable business practices. All information in the below ESG discussion pertains to the Crocs brand as of December 31, 2021.
Through our established ESG Program, we intend to continuously advance our sustainable business practices with the goal of consistently delivering products that exceed customer and consumer expectations. We believe the progress of our ESG efforts is best served by disclosing goals and relevant metrics, and, to this end, we have aligned our program with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (“SDGs”) and the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (“SASB”) framework for reporting and disclosure guidance in order to share our ESG progress. Our ESG initiatives complement our “Green Comes in Every Color” campaign, which is focused on providing Comfort Without Carbon, Comfort for our Communities, and Comfort for all People.
Additional information related to our ESG initiatives and achievements will be published in our fiscal year 2021 ESG Report in the first half of 2022, which will be available on the Investor Relations section of our website located at www.crocs.com. The content provided in our ESG Report or accessible through our website is not incorporated by reference as part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Environmental
We are committed to reducing our impact on the environment by focusing on sustainability initiatives in our operations and throughout our supply chain and product lifecycle.
In 2021, we established our ambition of becoming a Net Zero brand by 2030. We also identified four areas of focus for our sustainability strategy: (i) transitioning to more sustainable product ingredients; (ii) responsible resource use; (iii) implementing more environmentally friendly packaging; and (iv) exploring sustainable solutions for product end of life.
Our transition to more sustainable ingredients was highlighted by our announcement of production on our “shoe of the future” powered by a new bio-based Croslite. This more sustainable Croslite incorporates Dow’s new ECOLIBRIUMTM Technology that transforms sustainably-sourced waste and by-products from other industries into a shoe that has all the comfort you expect from Crocs but with a lower environmental impact than other materials. During 2021, we also eliminated leather from our product line to become a 100% vegan brand.
To keep shoes on feet and out of landfills, we donated thousands of unsold Crocs to those in need around the world. We also announced our partnership with ThredUP to give previously used items a second life and help create a more comfortable world.
We remain a member of the Sustainable Apparel Coalition to ensure our efforts are aligned with industry guidance and best practices. We also continue to leverage the Higg Index suite of tools for baselining and establishing goals across emissions, energy and water use, and waste reduction/disposal for both our internal brand activities as well as our factory partners. We continue working to align with Science-Based Targets for the purpose of developing meaningful GHG emissions reduction goals that support the prevention of climate change.
Social
Human Capital
At Crocs, our vision to make “everyone comfortable in their own shoes” starts with our people. As of December 31, 2021, we employed approximately 5,770 employees in the Americas, EMEA, and Asia Pacific. This includes approximately 3,300 employees in our retail stores, 1,400 employees at our corporate/regional offices, and 1,000 employees at our distribution centers.
We are committed to the health and safety of our employees and customers. In response to COVID-19, our corporate offices, retail stores, and distribution centers have maintained various elevated safety protocols, in accordance with local guidelines and regulations. To support our workforce, we also implemented a supplemental sick policy in 2020 for our U.S. workforce with additional hours available for paid time off related to COVID-19, which we continued for 2021 and 2022.
To ensure that we remain an employer of choice for what we believe is the most talented workforce in the footwear industry, we have implemented initiatives across our business and geographies to develop leadership capabilities, enable meaningful professional experiences, offer a compelling employee value proposition, and create a transparent, collaborative culture that “celebrates one-of-a-kinds and stands together with all different kinds.” We are also committed to an equitable total rewards philosophy as well as pay transparency in all regions.
We are proud of our culture of inclusion, which encompasses regular employee listening, employee-led inclusivity councils, and diversity at all levels. Crocs strives to create a culture of inclusion while creating a comfortable workplace through progressive people-practices where employees can freely contribute equally regardless of gender, age, race, ethnicity, national origin, disability, religion, immigration status, or sexual orientation, gender identity or expressions. Our Code of Ethics codifies these values. Crocs is also a premier partner of the UN Foundation’s #EqualEverywhere: Champions for Change Campaign promoting their global push for gender equality.
Investing in talent is a key component of our human capital strategy. Crocs is committed to identifying and developing the next generation of leadership. We conduct an annual talent and succession review with our CEO and Board of Directors (“Board”) 
with a focus on accelerating talent development, strengthening succession pipelines, and advancing diversity representation for our most critical roles.
We continue to emphasize employee development and training. We have established a culture of learning and development, with robust training at all levels on a wide range of topics from Cultivating a Sense of Belonging, Thriving through Adversity (for instance, during the COVID-19 pandemic), Guiding Dynamic Decision Making, and Facilitating Team Communication.
Crocs is committed to providing an employee value proposition that is compelling, market-competitive, and performance-based. Our compensation programs, practices, and policies reflect our commitment. We aim to generally position total direct compensation within a competitive range of the market median, with differentiation based on tenure, skills, proficiency, and performance to attract and retain key talent, and have taken aggressive steps to advance hourly wages for our workforce across the globe, including increasing our hourly workers’ average wage above $15 per hour in the U.S. and Puerto Rico as of December 31, 2021. Additionally, all full- and part-time employees based in North America are eligible for sick leave accrual based on hours worked, and we follow all applicable illness and leave requirements globally.
Our regular employee engagement surveys reflect a highly engaged global workforce, with, among others, high scores returned by employees recommending “Crocs as a great place to work” and saying “it is easy for people with diverse backgrounds to be accepted.”
Social Capital
At Crocs, we strive to ensure our products are sourced, produced, and delivered to our customers in a manner that upholds international labor and human rights standards. To this end, we have implemented measures to ensure our supply chain complies with these standards, including utilizing internal and external parties to conduct both scheduled and unannounced social compliance reviews. We also maintain a factory Social Compliance Code of Conduct and a certification process – our contracted factories and direct suppliers sign an annual Statement of Compliance, verifying that their operations are in compliance with all local laws and customs regarding hiring practices, wages, and working conditions, as well as our Code of Conduct. We recently joined the Fair Labor Association in an effort to provide further resources and transparency for protecting worker rights throughout our supply chain.
We also monitor chemicals and substances in our supply chain for compliance with legal and regulatory requirements consistent with our Restricted Substances Policy and expect our contracted factories and suppliers to take a proactive stance in eliminating any hazardous chemicals or substances in the manufacture of Crocs products. We recently joined the Apparel & Footwear International RSL Management Working Group to help reduce the use and impact of harmful substances in our supply chain.
Community
Giving back to the community is extremely important to us. Through our global “Crocs Cares” program, we focus on providing shoes, funds, and employee time to address timely human needs, to support social inclusion and equality, and to enable our employees to collaborate and give back within their local communities. In the past two years alone, we have donated over one million pairs of shoes, including our donation in 2020 of over 860,000 pairs of shoes to frontline healthcare workers and other organizations around the world as part of our “A Free Pair for Healthcare” program and additional donations in 2021 of 150,000 pairs of shoes across multiple organizations. Additionally, thanks to the generosity of our consumers in 2021, we also raised nearly $2.5 million for Feeding America, enabling over 25 million meals for those in need.
Governance
At Crocs, we have strong corporate governance mechanisms in place, along with robust internal controls over our financial reporting framework. We also have Enterprise Risk Management and Ethics & Compliance program frameworks, with regular updates provided to our Board and its committees. For our ESG efforts, Crocs has established an ESG/sustainability management and oversight framework under the direction of our Executive Vice President, Chief Legal and Risk Officer. The Governance and Nominating Committee of our Board, comprised of three independent directors, oversees our ESG efforts and receives quarterly updates on the progress of our ESG program.
Our commitment to diversity and inclusion is reflected in our Board, consisting of 38% female representation and 13% racial/ethnic minority representation as of December 31, 2021.
We also continue to conduct annual in-person and online compliance training for all corporate employees as well as retail and distribution center management and maintain a global ethics hotline, which is administered by our Legal department. 
Distribution Channels
The broad appeal of our footwear has allowed us to market our products in more than 85 countries through two distribution channels: wholesale and direct-to-consumer (“DTC”). Our wholesale channel includes domestic and international multi-brand retailers, mono-branded partner stores, e-tailers, and distributors; our DTC channel includes retail, in which we sell through company-operated stores, and e-commerce, in which we sell through company-operated e-commerce sites and third-party marketplaces.
Wholesale Channel
During the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, 50.8%, 50.0%, and 53.3% of revenues, respectively, were derived through our wholesale channel. Our wholesale channel includes domestic and international, multi-brand, brick-and-mortar retailers, e-tailers, and distributors in certain countries, including partner store operators. Brick-and-mortar customers typically include family footwear retailers, national and regional retail chains, sporting goods stores, and independent footwear retailers.
Outside the U.S., we use distributors when we believe such arrangements are economically preferable to direct sales. Distributors purchase products pursuant to a price list and are granted the right to resell those products in a defined territory, usually a country or group of countries. Our typical distribution agreements have terms of one to five years and can be terminated or renegotiated if minimum requirements or other terms are not met.
No single wholesale customer accounted for 10% or more of our total revenues for any of the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019.
Direct-to-Consumer Channel
During the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, 49.2%, 50.0%, and 46.7%, respectively, of our revenues were derived through our DTC channel.
Retail
During 2020, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, our global retail stores were closed for a portion of the year. However, the vast majority of our stores were open throughout 2021. We operate our retail channel through three platforms: company-operated full-price retail stores, outlet stores, and kiosks/store-in-store locations. With the continued worldwide consumer shift toward e-commerce, we are carefully managing our retail fleet, especially full-priced retail stores. As of December 31, 2021, we had 373 company-operated stores. See Part II - Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for information on store locations by platform.
Our company-operated full-price retail stores allow us to effectively showcase the full extent of our product range to consumers and provide us with the opportunity to interact with those consumers directly. As of December 31, 2021, we had 107 full-price retail stores.
Our company-operated outlet stores allow us to sell discontinued and overstocked merchandise directly to consumers at discounted prices. We also sell full-priced products in certain of our outlet stores as well as built-for-outlet products. As of December 31, 2021, we had 193 outlet stores.
Our company-operated kiosks and store-in-store locations allow us to market specific product lines, with flexibility to tailor products to consumer preferences in shopping malls and other high foot-traffic areas. With efficient use of retail space and limited fixed cost and capital investment we believe kiosks and store-in-store locations can be effective vehicles for selling our products in certain geographic areas. As of December 31, 2021, we had 73 kiosks and store-in-store locations.
The following table illustrates the net change during 2021 in the number of our company-operated retail stores by reportable operating segment and country:

 | December 31, 2020 | Opened | | Closed | December 31, 2021
Americas | | | | | 
United States | 154 | | 9 | | 1 | 162

Total EMEA | 49 | | 1 | | 3 | 47 
Total | 351 | | 33 | | 11 | 373

E-commerce
As of December 31, 2021, we offered our products through 14 company-operated e-commerce sites worldwide and also on third-party marketplaces. Our e-commerce presence facilitates a greater connection with our consumers and provides us with an opportunity to educate them about our products and brand. We continue to leverage increasingly sophisticated digital marketing activities to enhance the consumer experience and drive sales, thereby benefiting from the continued migration of consumers to online shopping.
Business Segments and Geographic Information
We have three reportable operating segments based on the geographic nature of our operations: the Americas, Asia Pacific, and EMEA. See Part II - Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Note 16 — Operating Segments and Geographic Information in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II - Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for financial information related to our operating segments.
Raw Materials
Croslite™, our proprietary closed-cell resin brand, incorporates the primary material formulations used in the vast majority of our footwear and some of our accessories. Our Croslite™ materials are formulated to create soft, comfortable, lightweight, non-marking, and odor-resistant footwear. We continue to invest in research and development to refine our materials to enhance these properties, develop new properties for specific applications, as well as reduce our environmental impact through various ESG initiatives described in the previous section.
Croslite™ is produced by compounding elastomer resins purchased from major chemical manufacturers, together with certain other production inputs such as color dyes. Multiple suppliers produce the elastomer resins used in the Croslite™ material. In the future, we may identify and utilize materials produced by other suppliers as an alternative to, or in addition to, those elastomer resins. All of the other raw materials that we use to produce the Croslite™ formulations are readily available for purchase from multiple suppliers.
Some of the products we offer are constructed using textile fabrics or other material formulations, such as those we brand LiteRide™. These materials are obtained from a number of third-party sources, and we believe these materials are also broadly available.
Sourcing, Distribution, and Logistics
Our sourcing strategy is to maintain a flexible, globally-diversified, cost-efficient third-party manufacturing base. We source our inventory production from multiple third-party manufacturers, primarily in Vietnam and China. In response to production delays in 2021 associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly in Vietnam, we have further diversified our manufacturers. These delays are further described in the risk factor under “Risks Related to Our Supply Chain — Supply chain disruptions could interrupt product manufacturing and global logistics and increase product costs” included in Item 1A. Risk Factors of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
During the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, approximately 56%, 75%, and 61%, respectively, of our production was in Vietnam, while our largest third-party manufacturer, operating in both Vietnam and China, produced approximately 34%, 46%, and 38%, respectively, and our second largest third-party manufacturer, primarily operating in both Vietnam and China, produced approximately 30%, 22%, and 17%, respectively, of our footwear unit volume. We believe any potential concentration risk is mitigated by the fact that the manufacturing capabilities required to produce our footwear are broadly available. Additionally, we began to further diversify our manufacturers in 2021 to add capacity in other countries, particularly China and Indonesia, in response to Vietnam factory closures as a result of COVID-19. See the risk factor under “Risks Related to Our Supply Chain — We depend solely on third-party manufacturers located outside of the U.S.” included in Item 1A. Risk Factors of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for information on risks associated with sourcing.
We strive to enhance our distribution and logistics network to further streamline our supply chain, increase our speed to market, and lower operating costs. As of December 31, 2021, we principally stored our finished goods inventory in company-operated warehouses and distribution and logistics facilities located in the U.S. and the Netherlands. During 2021, we opened a new EMEA distribution center in the Netherlands and began further expansion of our U.S. distribution center in Ohio to increase distribution capacity and increase automation, which we expect will maximize throughput and support our anticipated growth. We also utilized third-party operated distribution centers located in Japan, China, Australia, Korea, Singapore, India, Russia, and Brazil. As of December 31, 2021, our company-operated warehouse and distribution facilities provided us with 1.6 million square feet, and our third-party operated distribution facilities provided us with 0.5 million square feet, with additional area available based on inventory levels. We also ship directly to certain of our wholesale customers from our third-party manufacturers, and certain distributors pick up orders directly from our third-party manufacturers.
As a result of global industry-wide logistics challenges in 2021, we implemented several mitigating measures including: (i) prioritizing top-selling products and narrowing product assortment, which has and will continue to improve factory throughput, (ii) maintaining flexibility by leveraging air freight and reducing our dependency on congested West Coast ports in the United States by adding East Coast trans-shipment capabilities, and (iii) strategically allocating units and prioritizing our key growth initiatives. With the actions taken to date and our future plans, we believe Crocs is well-positioned to withstand these supply challenges. See the risk factor under “Risks Related to Our Supply Chain — Supply chain disruptions could interrupt product manufacturing and global logistics and increase product costs” included in Item 1A. Risk Factors of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for information on risks associated with sourcing.
Intellectual Property and Trademarks
We rely on a combination of trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, trade dress, and patent protections to establish, protect, and enforce our intellectual property rights in our product designs, brands, materials, and research and development efforts, although no such methods can afford complete protection. We own or license the material trademarks used in connection with the marketing, distribution, and sale of all of our products, both domestically and internationally, in most countries where our products are currently either sold or manufactured. Our major trademarks include the Crocs logo and the Crocs word mark, both of which are registered or pending registration in the U.S., the European Union, Japan, Taiwan, China, and Canada, among other countries. We also have registrations or pending trademark applications for other marks and logos in various countries around the world.
In the U.S., our patents are generally in effect for up to 20 years from the date of filing the patent application. Our trademarks registered within and outside of the U.S. are generally valid as long as they are in use and their registrations are properly maintained and have not been found to have become generic. We believe our trademarks and patents are crucial to the successful marketing and sale of our products. We strategically register, both domestically and internationally, the trademarks and patents covering certain product designs and branding that we utilize today. We aggressively police our patents, 
trademarks, and copyrights and pursue those who infringe upon them, both domestically and internationally, though litigation and otherwise as we deem necessary.
We consider the formulations of the materials used to produce our footwear covered by our trademark Croslite™ and LiteRide™, among others, valuable trade secrets. The material formulations are manufactured through a process that combines a number of components in various proportions to achieve the properties for which our products are known. We use multiple suppliers to source these components but protect the formulations by using an exclusive supply agreement for key components, confidentiality agreements with our third-party processors, and by requiring our employees to execute confidentiality agreements concerning the protection of our confidential information. Other than our third-party processors, we are unaware of any third-party using our formulations in the production of footwear. We believe the comfort and utility of our products depend on the properties achieved from the compounding of the Croslite™ and LiteRide™ materials, which constitutes a key competitive advantage for us, and we intend to continue to vigorously protect these trade secrets.
We also actively combat counterfeiting and other infringements of our brand by monitoring the global marketplace. We use our employees, sales representatives, distributors, and retailers, as well as outside investigators, attorneys, and customs agents, to police against infringing products by encouraging them to notify us of any suspect products and to assist law enforcement agencies. Our sales representatives and distributors are also educated on our patents, pending patents, trademarks, and trade dress to assist in preventing potentially infringing products from obtaining retail shelf space. The laws of certain countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent or in the same manner as do the laws of the U.S., and, therefore, we may have difficulty obtaining legal protection for our intellectual property in certain foreign jurisdictions.
Competition
The global casual, athletic, and fashion footwear markets are highly competitive. Although we do not believe that we compete directly with any single company with respect to the entire spectrum of our products, we believe portions of our wholesale, retail, and e-commerce businesses compete with companies including, but not limited to: NIKE, Inc., adidas AG, Deckers Outdoor Corporation, Skechers USA, Inc., Steven Madden, Ltd., Wolverine World Wide, Inc., and VF Corporation. Our company-operated retail locations and e-commerce sites also compete with some of our wholesale partners.
The principal elements of competition in these markets include brand awareness, product functionality, design, comfort, quality, price, customer service, and marketing and distribution. We believe that our unique footwear designs, material formulations, prices, product line, and distribution network position us well in the marketplace. However, a number of companies in the casual footwear industry have greater financial resources, more comprehensive product lines, broader market presence, longer standing relationships with wholesalers, longer operating histories, greater distribution capabilities, stronger brand recognition, and greater marketing resources than we have. See the risk factor under “Risks Related to our Products — We face significant competition” included in Item 1A. Risk Factors of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information.
