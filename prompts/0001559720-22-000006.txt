Item 1. Business
Overview
We are a community based on connection and belonging—a community that was born in 2007 when two Hosts welcomed three guests to their San Francisco home, and has since grown to over 4 million Hosts who have welcomed over 1 billion guest arrivals to over 100,000 cities and towns in almost every country and region across the globe with 85% of Hosts located outside of the United States. Hosts on Airbnb are everyday people who share their worlds to provide guests with the feeling of connection and being at home. We strive to connect people and places. 
Airbnb has five stakeholders and is designed with all of them in mind. Along with employees and shareholders, we serve Hosts, guests, and the communities in which they live. We intend to make long-term decisions considering all of our stakeholders because their collective success is key for our business to thrive. 
Hosting is at the Center 
Our Hosts are the foundation of our community and business. Stays are made possible by Hosts. It is their individuality that makes Airbnb unique. From schoolteachers to artists, our Hosts span more than 220 countries and regions. 
We enable Hosts to provide guests access to a vast world of unique homes and experiences that were previously inaccessible, or even undiscovered. The role of the Host is about more than opening their door. A great Host enables guests to find a deeper connection to the places they visit and the people who live there.
Our community of Hosts started by sharing their spare bedrooms on Airbnb in a few large cities. Soon, Hosts listed entire homes, cabins, treehouses, boats, castles, and luxury villas — practically any space that you could think of — in big cities, small towns, and rural communities in nearly every corner of the world. Our Hosts generally fall into two categories: individual and professional. Individual Hosts are those who activate their listings directly on Airbnb through our website or mobile apps. Individual Hosts are the core of our Host community. They come from all walks of life and list their spaces, including private rooms, primary homes, or vacation homes on Airbnb. Professional Hosts are often those who run property management or hospitality businesses and generally use application programming interfaces to list their properties on our platform. These Hosts expand the types of listings available to our guests.
Once there were millions of homes on Airbnb, we recognized that Hosts could share not only their homes but also their interests and talents. From exploring graffiti art in New York City to finding hidden jazz clubs in London, Airbnb Experiences offer authentic activities in over 5,000 cities around the world. 
We believe that we have just scratched the surface of the opportunities that hosting provides. There are many more ways people will want to connect with each other and the world around them, and so we will continue to design and enable new ways to host. No matter what form it takes, hosting will be at the center of Airbnb.
Host Endowment Fund 
In October 2020, we established a Host Endowment Fund that is designed to allow Hosts to share in the success of our business. The Host Endowment Fund was funded with 9.2 million shares of our Class H common stock and is intended to be a long-term investment in the future of the Host community, to be shaped by Hosts for Hosts. The goal of the Host Endowment Fund is to support and benefit the Host community through a variety of potential programs, initiatives, and grants. We want Hosts to share in our success, not merely for a single moment in time, but for as long as Airbnb exists in the world. 
In December 2020, we launched the Airbnb Host Advisory Board. The 2021 Host Advisory Board comprised 18 Hosts from 15 countries. The Host Advisory Board is intended to give voices to Hosts to help present ideas, inform Airbnb policies, and shape investments in the Host community from the Host Endowment Fund. 
Guests are Members of Our Community 
Our Hosts have welcomed more than one billion guest arrivals through Airbnb. Guest arrivals represent an individual and all co-travelers included on a reservation for a stay for completed check-ins during a given period. Our guests are not transactions — they are engaged, contributing members of our community. From young people to retirees, our guests come from a range of cultures and places. They seek everything from budget stays to luxury accommodations in large cities to remote villages. What they often have in common is a curiosity about the world and open-mindedness to other people and cultures. While Airbnb is popular across people of all ages, we are particularly strong with younger travelers: as of December 31, 2021, the majority of our guests who have ever made a booking on Airbnb were between the ages of 18 and 34. We are seeing three fundamental shifts in travel as people become less tethered from the need to be in an office and more flexible; people can travel anytime, they are traveling to more places and they are staying longer as the lines between travel, living and working are blurring.
Once they become a part of Airbnb, guests actively participate in our community, many return regularly to our platform to book again, and recommend Airbnb to others who then join themselves. This demand encourages new Hosts to join, which in turn attracts even more guests. It is a virtuous cycle — guests attract Hosts, and Hosts attract guests. 
A Resilient Model 
While COVID-19, including new strains of variants, continues to disrupt travel across the world, we have seen continued resiliency in not only our guests' travel behavior, but in our business model and its ability to adapt to the changing needs of our guests. In early 2020, as COVID-19 disrupted travel across the world, Airbnb’s business declined significantly. But within two months, our business model started to rebound even with limited international travel, demonstrating its resilience. People wanted to get out of their homes and yearned to travel, but they did not want to go far or to be in crowded hotel lobbies. Domestic travel quickly rebounded on Airbnb around the world as millions of guests took trips closer to home. Stays of longer than a few days started increasing as work-from-home became work-from-any-home on Airbnb. We believe that the lines between travel and living are blurring, and the global pandemic has accelerated the ability to live anywhere. Our platform is suited to and has proven adaptable to serve these new ways of traveling. From long weekends to monthly stays, Airbnb allows you to book any home, anywhere, for any duration—and ultimately, to live and work anywhere on Airbnb. We believe this trend towards more flexibility will only accelerate. In 2021, some of the largest companies in the world announced increased flexibility for employees to work remotely, and we expect more companies to follow their lead.
Our Long-Term Growth Strategy 
Our strategy is to continue to invest in our key strengths: 
•Unlock more hosting. In order to have enough selection for guests booking on our platform, we will continue to invest in growing the size and quality of our Host community. We plan to attract more Hosts globally and expand use cases such as long-term stays of 28 days or more. We will support emerging travel trends, such as local travel and remote working, and design new ways to host. Finally, we will continue to increase the support we provide our Hosts to deliver high-quality stays and experiences for guests. We plan to design new tools and services and to offer comprehensive Host education, partnering with Hosts to teach the art and science of great hosting. We believe that we have just scratched the surface of the opportunities that hosting can provide. 
•Grow and engage our guest community. We intend to attract new guests to Airbnb and convert more of them into brand advocates. We will continue to focus on engaging our existing guests to return to book and to use Airbnb with more frequency. With new behaviors developed during the COVID-19 pandemic, we believe the way that people approach work, living, and travel have fundamentally changed. We believe there will be further opportunities to create products based on these new behaviors and attract more guests to our platform. Finally, we plan to develop new ways for our guests to connect with each other and to contribute back to Airbnb. 
•Invest in our brand. We intend to continue to invest more deeply in our brand, including the expansion of our Made possible by Hosts campaign, to educate new Hosts and guests on the benefits of Airbnb and the uniqueness of our offering. We also intend to leverage our brand by creating a cohesive and integrated marketing strategy punctuated by product launches, such as those announced in May and November of 2021, that introduce new features to our community and prospective Hosts and guests. 
•Expand our global network. We plan to expand our global network and partner with communities to update laws and regulations for short-term rentals to allow more Hosts to participate. As we attract more Hosts, even more guests are likely to come to Airbnb, attracting even more Hosts. 
•Innovate on our platform. We will continue to innovate both the online and in-person experiences for our Hosts and our guests. Our innovations will be focused on improving our Host and guest experiences, making Airbnb more accessible and appealing for new Hosts and guests and driving increased engagement and loyalty with our existing community. For example, we have designed over
150 upgrades to our platform throughout 2021 to improve every aspect of the Airbnb experience. We made it easier for anyone to become a Host, added new features that gave guests more flexibility when planning their travel, and made it even easier to host and support the ongoing travel revolution. 
•Design new products and offerings. We will continue to design new opportunities for connection. As the world continues to change, we will continue to bring together new technologies with our design expertise to expand possibilities for our Hosts and offer new experiences for our guests. We will continue to increase the capabilities of our website and mobile apps while bringing an innovative approach to designing Host and guest interfaces in our products. 
Our Strategy for Adapting to COVID-19 
Many of our Hosts have been severely impacted by COVID-19, with increased cancellations and a drop in bookings, particularly in 2020. Despite the impact of COVID-19, active listings increased 6% to 6.0 million as of December 31, 2021, as compared to 5.6 million at the end of 2020. We count the number of Hosts on our platform based on the number of users with available listings, defined as accommodations and experiences that are viewable on a certain date on our platform (excluding Hotel Tonight), as of a certain date and we consider a listing of a home or an experience to be an “active listing” if it is viewable on Airbnb and has been previously booked at least once on Airbnb (excluding Hotel Tonight). In addition, many of our guests have been unable to travel during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, with increased vaccination rates and certain travel restrictions lifted in 2021, we have seen the world undergo a revolution in how guests live and travel. The pandemic suddenly untethered many people from the need to work in specific places at specific times and now, many guests can work from anywhere, travel any time, and stay longer. Since the pandemic started in 2020 and throughout 2021, we have seen guests turn to Airbnb for new use cases, such as living closer to family, living nomadically, and working remotely.
We believe that the COVID-19 pandemic reinforced that travel is an enduring human desire, even in the face of challenges. While we continue to see the positive effect of travel restrictions being lifted, particularly on cross-border travel, people have increasingly sought travel options closer to home during COVID-19, and Airbnb’s offerings are well suited to adapt to this changing dynamic. We offer all types of accommodations, allowing guests to find spaces suited to their individual needs under these circumstances. We have worked closely with 
our Hosts, guests, and communities to prioritize and support safe and responsible travel during these challenging times and have adapted our offerings for changing trends in travel and experiences. 
Specifically, based on the increase in domestic and short-distance travel, we updated our website and mobile apps to actively promote available local and non-urban stays so guests can find something that fits their unique needs for location and desired length of time. In early 2021, we introduced I'm Flexible, a whole new way to search on Airbnb when guests are flexible about when or where they travel. Consequently, we have seen hundreds of millions of searches using I'm Flexible.
Our Platform 
Our Platform for Hosts 
Hosts have a variety of needs, and we are focused on designing solutions to serve them. We built our platform to seamlessly onboard new Hosts, especially those who previously had not considered hosting, and further simplified the sign-up process for Hosts in 2021. We partner with Hosts throughout the process of setting up their listing and provide them with a robust suite of tools to successfully manage their listings, including scheduling, merchandising, integrated payments, community support, Host protections, pricing recommendations, and feedback from reviews. We offer top-to-bottom protection for our Hosts through AirCover, which includes, but is not limited to, property damage protection of up to $1 million for every listing, liability coverage to Hosts of up to $1 million per occurrence in the event of third-party claims of personal injury or property damage, deep cleaning protection, and pet damage protection. We are constantly innovating our platform to deliver new tools and services to make hosting easier and empower Hosts to earn income doing what they love. 
Our Platform for Guests 
Our website and mobile apps provide our guests with an engaging way to explore a wide variety of unique homes and experiences and an easy way to book them. To better meet the needs of our guests, in 2021, we launched a whole new way to search on Airbnb when guests are flexible about when or where they travel with I'm Flexible. Whichever way our guests search, our homepage showcases inspiring, browsable content that highlights the product’s range and shows off the best of our inventory. The listing for each stay or experience tells potential guests everything they need to know through photos, reviews from past guests, and detailed descriptions. At checkout, guests can review trip details and pay all on one simplified screen. Everything a guest needs to know before, during, or after their trip is stored on one clear, easy-to-follow page. We enable customizable wishlists for guests in the planning stage of travel, in-app guest-to-Host messaging before, during, and after a trip, and an easy way to leave reviews that contribute back to the Airbnb community.
Our System of Trust 
One of our core innovations has been the design of a system that allows millions of strangers to trust one another. Hosts and guests have the ability to communicate before booking, pay through our secure payments platform, and post reviews after their stays or experiences. Our trust team works to help protect our community by deploying risk scoring, fraud detection, screening, verification, and other technologies and processes that vary depending on the region. Our trained safety agents are available should our Hosts and guests need to reach us. We offer additional support to our community through AirCover, which includes, but is not limited to, our Host Damage Protection program, which protects Hosts against property damage of up to $1 million, and our Host Liability Insurance and Experiences Liability Insurance, which provide liability insurance of up to $1 million to protect our Hosts against qualifying third-party claims for personal injury or property damage. Through our trust innovations, our goal is to help make Airbnb stays and experiences safe for Hosts, guests, and communities. 
The system for trust that we have designed includes the following components: Host and guest reviews, secure messaging and account protection, risk scoring, secure payments, watchlist and background checks in certain jurisdictions, cleanliness, fraud and scam prevention, insurance and protections, booking restrictions, an urgent safety line, 24/7 neighborhood support line, and a guest refund policy. 
In addition to these components, we have new initiatives in the pipeline and will continue to create additional features to strengthen the trust and safety on our platform. Designing for trust has been a core principle from the very beginning, and as we innovate new ways for strangers to trust one another, we make it possible for more connections to be made. 
Our Technology 
Our technology platform powers our two-sided marketplace and enables our global network of Hosts and guests. As of December 31, 2021, we had 1,675 engineers within our product development organization. Given the nature of the business, our technology platform has broad and complex requirements: 
•Our core platform supports global payment capabilities; multilingual, real-time, community safety and support; city-specific regulatory support; and sophisticated anti-fraud and anti-money-laundering measures. 
•It delivers deep business intelligence insights to manage our marketplace, including pricing insights and occupancy optimization for our Hosts. 
•It incorporates sophisticated machine learning to power key areas, from fraud detection, to enabling customized and real-time community support. 
•We operate a microservices architecture and are evolving our foundational components to enable us to move rapidly in response to evolving customer needs without sacrificing correctness or stability.
 As we continue to evolve our foundational technology we are focused on the following broad capabilities: 
•Data management systems that continue to support user privacy, analytics, machine learning, and business insights. 
•Service reliability leading to best-in-class performance centered on availability, latency, disaster recovery and business continuity, security, testability, observability, operability, and agility. 
•Cloud support focusing on robust capabilities for granular attribution and usage patterns to realize efficiency gains. We currently rely primarily on Amazon Web Services to provide cloud computing services. 
These continued technology investments aim to ensure we have a robust platform that allows us to more quickly adapt to the needs of our Hosts and guests around the world and increase the productivity of our product development organization. 
Our Marketing 
Our marketing strategy includes brand marketing, communications, and performance marketing. Brand marketing increases awareness among potential Hosts and guests, helping them understand the benefits of hosting and booking stays and experiences and what makes these stays and experiences distinctly Airbnb. Our communications team works across press, policy, and influencers to share timely and important news about Airbnb. They also oversee the execution of a global consumer, product, corporate, and policy-communications plan that supports our brand strategy and generates considerable press and social media coverage. While performance marketing drives additional traffic from high-intent prospective guests, the strength of the Airbnb brand and our communications strategy allows us to be less reliant on performance marketing. 
Human Capital
Our Employees 
We consider the management of our global talent to be essential to the ongoing success of our business. As of December 31, 2021, we had 6,132 employees in 27 cities around the world. 
As of December 31, 2021, we relied on a network of approximately 8,700 third-party partners that are spread across 23 sites, and individuals who work from home around the world to handle the vast majority of our community support contacts. Our internal community support employees are comprised of operations teams who handle complex and sensitive issues and enablement teams who support all community-facing teams, including our partners. We are proud of our approach to working with partners and our deep relationships with them.
Attracting, recruiting, developing, and retaining diverse talent enables us to provide our Hosts and guests with innovative products and services as well as serve our other stakeholders. We are focused on supporting our employees across the full employee lifecycle from recruitment to onboarding to ongoing development, and have implemented programs designed to promote their total wellness, particularly during difficult times such as the COVID-19 pandemic. For example, we continue to prioritize flexibility for our employees that incorporate compassion and understanding for the issues that many are facing as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. We continue to explore flexible ways of working that can be adopted for the long term, well beyond the COVID-19 pandemic, and in April 2021, we announced that we would extend the option to work from home through September 1, 2022. This extension applies globally and across functions, with the exception of China, which operates under its own guidelines. 
Our Culture 
The most defining part of working at Airbnb is our culture. Our culture is optimistic, with people who are passionate about our mission, caring about others, and curious about the world. We took the unique characteristics of the people at Airbnb and distilled them to four values: 
•Champion the mission. Our employees are deeply passionate about connection and belonging, and the product that we make to deliver this. In fact, many of our employees are people from our Host and guest community whom we hired. 
•Be a Host. Our employees are the kind of people who like caring for others and making them feel like they belong, just like the Hosts in our community. 
•Embrace the adventure. Our employees are curious and optimistic — you have to be an optimistic person to believe that the idea of Airbnb is a good one, and you have to be curious about other people and cultures to want to connect with them. 
•Be a cereal entrepreneur. Our employees are bold and resourceful.
We believe that every person who joins Airbnb, from board members and executives to college new hires, should share these four attributes. Most importantly, we believe that whatever we want to happen outside the walls of Airbnb should first start inside Airbnb. This starts with our own employees. In this way, our culture is the source of all future innovation, and a North Star for how people in our community should treat each other. 
Diversity and Belonging 
At Airbnb, diversity and belonging is more than a corporate responsibility — it is central to what we stand for. We attract a diverse group of people and welcome their varied knowledge, experiences, and backgrounds. Through our hiring process, we commit to encouraging diversity and eliminating bias, and we publish the changing demographic makeup of our workforce to hold ourselves accountable. 
As of December 31, 2021, under-represented minority populations represented 14% of our U.S.-based employees and those who identify in the gender binary as women made up 48% of our global employees. We have set a goal for ourselves by the end of 2025 to have 20% of our product development and information technology employees be under-represented minorities at all levels, 20% of our U.S. employees be under-represented minorities, and 50% of employees at all levels be women, using the gender binary.
Reducing the Incidents of Bias on Airbnb
We are centered around belonging, and discrimination is a central obstacle to it. Just as discrimination exists in society, it exists in the Airbnb community, and we are committed to combating it. In 2016, we began taking steps to address discrimination on Airbnb. 
First, we created the Airbnb Nondiscrimination Policy and Community Commitment, which we required every Host and guest to agree to in order to use Airbnb. If a Host or guest does not agree to the policy, they are removed from our platform. 
Next, we created an anti-discrimination team of technical professionals that work to fight bias and discrimination, changed the way we show profile photos so Hosts only see a guest’s photo after a reservation is confirmed, and distributed an antiracism guide to our Hosts and guests in the United States. 
In June 2020, we launched Project Lighthouse, a groundbreaking project launched in partnership with Color of Change, the nation’s largest online racial justice organization, along with guidance from civil rights groups and privacy rights organizations. Project Lighthouse allows us to measure discrimination on Airbnb based on perception. These perceptions are aggregated and used to identify and measure discrepancies in people’s experiences that could be the result of discrimination. We are using the findings from Project Lighthouse to inform and design our products and policies to combat racial discrimination that Black guests and other people of color face when using Airbnb. 
Climate Change
In November 2021, we announced our commitment to operating as a Net Zero company by 2030. To meet our goal, we have committed to a number of steps, including reducing carbon and other greenhouse gas emissions associated with our global corporate operations, and investing in quality nature-based solutions to offset residual emissions. This commitment is the latest step we are taking to help address the climate crisis. In 2020, we made a commitment to achieve 100-percent renewable electricity use for our corporate operations, and in early 2021, we became a founding participant in the Lowering Emissions by Accelerating Forest finance (LEAF) Coalition, a new public-private initiative that has mobilized $1 billion to fight tropical deforestation. 
Regulations
We are subject to laws, regulations, and rules that affect the short-term rental and home sharing business at city, state, country and regional levels. While a number of cities and countries have implemented legislation to address short-term rentals, there are many others that are not yet explicitly addressing or enforcing short-term rental laws, and could follow suit and enact regulations. New laws, regulations, government policies, or changes in their interpretations in the over 100,000 cities and towns where we operate entail significant challenges and uncertainties. In the event of any such changes, pre-existing bookings may not be honored and current and future listings and bookings could decline significantly, and our relationship with our Hosts and guests could be negatively impacted. We seek to work with governments to establish clear, fair, and workable home sharing rules to create clarity for our Hosts.
No single city represented more than 1.0% of our revenue before adjustments for incentives and refunds during the year ended December 31, 2021 or 1.1% of our active listings as of December 31, 2021. Incentives include our referral programs and marketing promotions to encourage the use of our platform and attract new customers, while our refunds to customers are part of our customer support activities. We do not believe that the current regulations in our top 10 cities, in the aggregate, have had or are expected to have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition. We will continue to collaborate with policymakers to implement sensible legislation around the world. 
In addition to laws, regulations, and rules directly applicable to the short-term rental and home sharing business, we are subject to a wide variety of laws, regulations and rules governing our business practices, the Internet, e-commerce, and electronic devices, including those relating to taxation, privacy, data protection, pricing, content, advertising, discrimination, consumer protection, protection of minors, copyrights, distribution, messaging, mobile communications, electronic device certification, electronic waste, electronic contracts, communications, Internet access, competition, and unfair commercial practices. We are also subject to laws, regulations, and rules governing the provision of online payment services, the design and operation of our platform, and the operations, characteristics, and quality of our platform and services.
Our payments platform is subject to various laws, rules, regulations, policies, legal interpretations, and regulatory guidance, including those governing: cross-border and domestic money transmission and funds transfers; stored value and prepaid access; foreign exchange; privacy, data protection, and cybersecurity; banking secrecy; payment services (including payment processing and settlement services); consumer protection; economic and trade sanctions; anti-corruption and anti-bribery; and anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing.
We are subject to a variety of taxes and tax collection obligations in the United States (federal, state, and local) and numerous foreign jurisdictions. We have received communications from numerous foreign, federal, state, and local governments regarding the application of tax laws or regulations to our business or demanding data about our Hosts and guests to aid in threatened or actual enforcement actions against our Hosts and guests. In many jurisdictions where applicable, we have agreed to collect and remit various taxes on behalf of our Hosts. We have been subject to complaints by, and are involved in a number of lawsuits brought by, certain government entities for alleged responsibility for direct or indirect taxes. In some jurisdictions we are in disputes with respect to past and future taxes. A number of jurisdictions have proposed or implemented new tax laws or interpreted existing laws to explicitly apply various types of taxes to businesses like ours. Laws and regulations relating to taxes as applied to our platform, and to our Hosts and guests, vary greatly among jurisdictions, and it is difficult or impossible to predict how such laws and regulations will be applied.
As we continue to expand the reach of our brand into additional markets, we will be increasingly subject to additional laws, regulations, and rules. These laws, regulations, and rules are complex and constantly evolving and can be subject to significant change. Some of these laws, regulations, and rules are inconsistent and ambiguous and are being tested in courts, and could be interpreted by regulators and courts in 
ways that could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Moreover, certain laws, regulations, and rules have not historically been applied in the context of the short-term rental and home sharing business, so the application and interpretation of these requirements are often uncertain.
For additional information regarding these and other laws, regulations, and rules that affect us and our business, see Note 12, Commitments and Contingencies – Legal and Regulatory Matters – Regulatory Matters to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Seasonality
Our business is seasonal, reflecting typical travel behavior patterns over the course of the calendar year. In a typical year, the first, second, and third quarters have higher Nights and Experiences Booked than the fourth quarter, as guests plan for travel during the peak travel season, which is in the third quarter for North America and Europe, the Middle East, and Africa (“EMEA”). Nights and Experiences Booked on our platform in a period represents the sum of the total number of nights booked for stays and the total number of seats booked for experiences, net of cancellations and alterations that occurred in that period.
Our business metrics including Gross Booking Value (“GBV”) and Adjusted EBITDA can also be impacted by the timing of holidays and other events. GBV represents the dollar value of bookings on our platform in a period and is inclusive of Host earnings, service fees, cleaning fees, and taxes, net of cancellations and alterations that occurred during that period. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income or loss adjusted for (i) provision for (benefit from) income taxes; (ii) interest income, interest expense, and other income (expense), net; (iii) depreciation and amortization; (iv) stock-based compensation expense and stock-settlement obligations related to the initial public offering (“IPO”); (v) acquisition-related impacts consisting of gains (losses) recognized on changes in the fair value of contingent consideration arrangements; (vi) net changes to the reserves for lodging taxes for which management believes it is probable that we may be held jointly liable with Hosts for collecting and remitting such taxes; and (vii) restructuring charges. 
We experience seasonality in our GBV that is generally consistent with the seasonality of Nights and Experiences Booked. Revenue, which consists of service fees, net of incentives and refunds, charged to our customers, and Adjusted EBITDA have historically been, and are expected to continue to be, highest in the third quarter when we have the most check-ins, which is the point at which we recognize revenue. Seasonal trends in our GBV impact Free Cash Flow for any given quarter. Our costs are relatively fixed across quarters or vary in line with the volume of transactions, and we historically achieve our highest GBV in the first and second quarters of the year with comparatively lower check-ins. As a result, increases in unearned fees make our Free Cash Flow and Free Cash Flow as a percentage of revenue the highest in the first two quarters of the year. We typically see a slight decline in GBV and a peak in check-ins in the third quarter, which results in a decrease in unearned fees and lower sequential level of Free Cash Flow, and a greater decline in GBV in the fourth quarter, where Free Cash
Flow is typically negative. Free Cash Flow represents net cash provided by (used in) operating activities less purchases of property and equipment. As our business matures, other seasonal trends may develop, or these existing seasonal trends may become more extreme.
While we have seen COVID-19 distort the historical patterns of seasonality in 2020 for our GBV, revenue, Adjusted EBITDA, and Free Cash Flow as a result of travel restrictions and changing travel preferences relating to the COVID-19 pandemic, we saw some pre-COVID-19 patterns of seasonality return in the second half of 2021 with the third quarter having the strongest revenue and Adjusted EBITDA. We expect some impact on seasonality to continue as long as COVID-19, including the new strains of variants, are impacting travel patterns globally.
Data Protection and Privacy 
Our business uses, collects, and processes the personal data of individuals in more than 220 countries and regions. As a result, compliance with laws on data protection and privacy regulating the storage, sharing, use, processing, transfer, disclosure, and protection of personal data is core to our strategy and integral to the creation of trust in our platform. We take a variety of technical and organizational security measures and other procedures and protocols to protect data, including data pertaining to Hosts, guests, employees, and others. Despite measures we put in place, we may be unable to anticipate or prevent unauthorized access to such data.
Legal requirements relating to the collection, storage, handling, use, disclosure, transfer, and security of personal data continue to evolve, and regulatory scrutiny in this area is increasing around the world. This increases the complexity of compliance requirements, may limit offerings, result in additional expenses while also diverting attention and resources from other projects.
Regulators around the world continue to propose more stringent data protection and privacy laws, and these laws are rapidly increasing in number, complexity, enforcement, fines, and penalties. For example, the European General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679 (“GDPR”) became effective on May 25, 2018 and has resulted and will continue to result in significantly greater compliance burdens and costs for companies with users and operations in the European Union and European Economic Area. The GDPR regulates a broad array of personal data that can directly or indirectly identify an individual and imposes stringent data protection requirements with significant penalties for noncompliance. Also, in July 2020, the Court of Justice of the European Union (“CJEU”) ruled to invalidate the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield, a legal framework that allowed participating companies to transfer personal data from EU member states to the United States. Many large geographies in which we operate, including Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, and India, have passed or are in the process of passing comparable or stricter data privacy legislation or regulations. 
In the United States, the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Commerce continue to call for greater regulation of the processing of personal data, as well as restrictions for certain targeted advertising practices. Numerous states have enacted or are in the process of enacting state level data privacy laws and regulations governing the collection, use, and processing of state residents’ personal data. For example, the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”) went into effect in California on January 1, 2020. The CCPA establishes a new privacy framework for covered businesses such as ours and requires us to modify our data processing practices and policies and incur compliance related costs and expenses. In November 2020, California voters passed the California Privacy Rights and Enforcement Act of 2020, which further expands the CCPA with additional data privacy compliance requirements and establishes a regulatory agency 
dedicated to enforcing those requirements. Virginia and Colorado have also passed privacy laws, which will become effective in 2023. There is a strong possibility that additional U.S. states will implement privacy laws that provide more stringent requirements than the CCPA or otherwise conflict with the CCPA’s provisions. Additionally, there are U.S. state laws and regulations governing the collection and use of biometric information, such as fingerprints and facial biometric templates. For example, the Illinois Biometric Information Privacy Act regulates the collection, use, safeguarding, and storage of “biometric identifiers” and “biometric information” by private entities and provides a private right of action for persons who are aggrieved by violations of the law. Under the GDPR and other regimes this is treated as sensitive personal data and requires additional protection, and there are much more limited set of grounds on which it can be processed, which means in practice consent is usually needed.
These and other data protection and privacy laws and their interpretations continue to develop and may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Non-compliance with these and other laws could result in penalties or significant legal liability. Although we take steps to comply with applicable laws and regulations, we cannot assure that we will not be subject to regulatory or private action, including fines for non-compliance of data protection and privacy laws, including in the event of an incident. We could be adversely affected if legislation or regulations are expanded to require changes in our or our third-party service providers’ business practices or if governing jurisdictions interpret or implement their legislation or regulations in ways that negatively affect our or our third-party service providers’ business, results of operations, or financial condition. 
Competition 
We operate in a highly competitive environment. As we seek to expand our community globally, we face competition in attracting Hosts and guests. 
Competition for Hosts 
We compete to attract and retain Hosts to and on our platform to list their homes and experiences, as Hosts have a range of options for doing so. We compete for Hosts based on many factors including the volume of bookings generated by guests, ease of use of our platform, the service fees we charge, Host protections, such as those included in AirCover, and our brand. We believe that Hosts can earn more per night on Airbnb than other travel platforms due to our guest demand, our Host tools that empower Hosts to be successful, and our community built on trust and human interaction. 
Competition for Guests 
We compete to attract and retain guests to and on our platform, as guests have a range of options to find and book accommodations and experiences. We compete for guests based on many factors, including unique inventory and availability of listings, the value and all-in cost of Host offerings on our platform relative to other options, our brand, ease of use of our platform, the trust and safety of our platform, and community support. Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, we have also competed based on the availability of inventory close to where guests live and in non-urban markets, as well as the perceived safety and cleanliness of listings on our platform. 
Our competitors include: 
•Online travel agencies (“OTAs”), such as Booking Holdings (including the brands Booking.com, KAYAK, Priceline.com, and Agoda.com); Expedia Group (including the brands Expedia, Vrbo, HomeAway, Hotels.com, Orbitz, and Travelocity); Trip.com Group (including the brands Ctrip.com, Trip.com, Qunar, Tongcheng-eLong, and SkyScanner); Hopper; Meituan Dianping; Fliggy (a subsidiary of Alibaba); Despegar; MakeMyTrip; and other regional OTAs; 
•Internet search engines, such as Google, including its travel search products; Baidu; and other regional search engines;
•Listing and meta search websites, such as TripAdvisor, Trivago, Mafengwo, AllTheRooms.com, Hometogo, Holidu, and Craigslist;
•Hotel chains, such as Marriott, Hilton, Accor, Wyndham, InterContinental, OYO, and Huazhu, as well as boutique hotel chains and independent hotels;
•Property management companies, such as Vacasa, Sonder, Inspirato, Evolve, Awaze, and other regional property management companies;
•Chinese short-term rental competitors, such as Tujia, Meituan B&B, and Xiaozhu; and
•Online platforms offering experiences, such as Viator, GetYourGuide, Klook, Traveloka, and KKDay.
We believe we compete favorably based on multiple factors, including the differentiated breadth and depth of stays and experiences offered on Airbnb, our global scale and geographic reach, the strength and loyalty of our Host and guest community, our brand, organic traffic, our platform functionality, including community support, payments, and Host protections, and the extensibility of our platform. 
Our Intellectual Property 
Our intellectual property is an important component of our business. To establish and protect our proprietary rights, we rely on a combination of patents, trademarks, copyrights, domain names, social media handles, know-how, license agreements, confidentiality procedures, non-disclosure agreements with third parties, employee disclosure and invention assignment agreements, and other intellectual property and contractual rights. 
As of December 31, 2021, we had a substantial patent portfolio, consisting of issued patents and pending patent applications from the United States and multiple foreign jurisdictions. The portfolio includes both organically grown patent assets and a large number of assets acquired from IBM as part of a 2020 patent litigation settlement. We own a trademark portfolio with protections in more than 170 countries in which we currently operate for our primary brands — AIRBNB and our Bélo logo. Additionally, we own trademark protections around the world for other brands or protectable brand elements important to our business, including but not limited to Rausch, our primary corporate color; localizations, translations, and transliterations of our primary brands, and brands associated with businesses we have acquired. 
We have registered domain names that we use in or relate to our business, such as the airbnb.com domain name and country code top level domain name equivalents.
