ITEM 1. BUSINESS 
General
Founded in 2005, Greenlane is the premier global platform for the development and distribution of premium cannabis accessories, child-resistant packaging, vape solutions, and lifestyle products. In August 2021, we completed our transformational merger with KushCo Holdings, Inc. ("KushCo"), creating the leading ancillary cannabis company and house of brands. The combined company serves a diverse and expansive customer base with more than 8,500 retail locations, which includes many of the leading multi-state-operators ("MSOs") and licensed producers ("LPs"), the top smoke shops in the United States, and millions of consumers globally. In addition to enhancing our financial size and scale, along with creating an optimized platform with significant potential revenue and cost saving synergies, the merger strengthened our best-in-class proprietary owned brands and exclusive third-party brand offerings.
We have been developing a world-class portfolio of our own proprietary brands (the "Greenlane Brands") that we believe will, over time, deliver higher margins and create long-term value for our customers and shareholders. Our Greenlane Brands are comprised of child-resistant packaging innovator Pollen Gear; EYCE silicone pipes; DaVinci vaporizers; VIBES rolling papers; the Marley Natural accessory line; the K.Haring Glass Collection accessory line; Aerospaced & Groove grinders; and Higher Standards, which is both an upscale product line and an innovative retail experience with flagship stores at New York City’s famed Chelsea Market and the iconic Malibu Village in California. We also own and operate several industry-leading e-commerce platforms, including Vapor.com, Higherstandards.com, Aerospaced.com, DaVincivaporizer.com, Harringglass.com, Eycemolds.com, Canada.Vapor.com, Vaposhop.com, and recently-acquired Puffitup.com. These e-commerce platforms offer convenient, flexible shopping solutions directly to consumers.
During 2021, we took significant strides to grow our Greenlane Brands portfolio including with the March acquisition of substantially all of the assets of Eyce LLC ("Eyce") and more recently, in November 2021, the acquisition of substantially all of the assets of Organicix, LLC (d/b/a and hereinafter referred to as "DaVinci"). Furthermore, as a pioneer in the ancillary cannabis space, Greenlane is the partner of choice for many of the industry's leading MSOs, LPs, and brands, including PAX Labs, Grenco Science, Storz & Bickel, Firefly, Santa Cruz Shredder, Cookies, and CCELL.
We merchandise vaporizers, packaging, and other products in the United States, Canada and Europe and we distribute to retailers through wholesale operations and to consumers through e-commerce activities and our retail stores. We operate distribution centers in the United States, Canada, and Europe. With the completion of the distribution center consolidation and the merger with KushCo, we have established a lean and scalable distribution network that leverages a mix of leased warehoused spaces in California and Massachusetts along with third-party logistics ("3PL") locations in the United States, Canada, and Europe.
Following the successful completion of the KushCo merger, we have been reorganizing our business into two different, but complementary, business segments. The first is the Consumer Goods segment, which focuses on serving consumers across wholesale, retail and e-commerce operations—through both our proprietary brands, including Eyce, DaVinci, VIBES, Marley Natural, Keith Haring, and Higher Standards, as well as lifestyle products and accessories from leading brands, like PAX, Storz and Bickel, Grenco Science, and many more. The Consumer Goods segment forms a central part of our growth strategy, especially as it relates to scaling our own portfolio of higher-margin proprietary owned brands. In addition to our Consumer Goods segment, we have our Industrial Goods segment, which focuses on serving the premier brands, operators, and retailers through our wholesale operations by providing ancillary products essential to their growth, such as customizable packaging and vaporization solutions, including our Greenlane Brand Pollen Gear. Refer to "Note 11— Segment Reporting" within Item 8 to this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information on our reportable segments.
Organization
Greenlane Holdings, Inc. (“Greenlane” and, collectively with the Operating Company (as defined below) and its consolidated subsidiaries, the “Company”, "we", "us" and "our") was formed as a Delaware corporation on May 2, 2018. We are a holding company that was formed for the purpose of completing an underwritten initial public offering (“IPO”) of shares of our Class A common stock on April 23, 2019 and other related transactions in order to carry on the business of Greenlane Holdings, LLC (the “Operating Company”). The Operating Company was organized under the laws of the state of Delaware on September 1, 2015, and is based in Boca Raton, Florida. Refer to "Note 1—Business Operations and Organization" within Item 8 for further information on the Company's organization and the IPO and related transactions. We are the sole manager of the Operating Company and, as of December 31, 2021, owned a 79.7% interest in the Operating Company.
Our Business Relating to the Cannabis Industry
The information included below is based on the most recent information available to the Company and, except as expressly stated below, does not give effect to the continued impact of the COVID-19 pandemic; the long-term impacts of which remain uncertain as of the date of this Form 10-K. 
While we do not cultivate, distribute or dispense marijuana as that term is defined by the Controlled Substances Act, several of the products we distribute, such as vaporizers, pipes, rolling papers and storage solutions, can be used with marijuana or marijuana derivatives, as well as several other legal substances.
We believe the global cannabis industry is experiencing a transformation from a state of prohibition toward a state of legalization. We expect the number of states, countries and other jurisdictions legalizing cannabis for medical and adult use will continue to increase, which will create numerous and sizable opportunities for market participants, including us. 
U.S. Cannabis Landscape
A January 2022 report of Cowen and Company, one of the leading investment banks and equity research firms serving the cannabis industry, estimated that spending in the U.S. legal cannabis market was approximately $18.9 billion in 2020 and reached approximately $25.3 billion in 2021, representing growth of approximately 33.9%. The report projects that by 2030, 
spending in the U.S. legal cannabis market will reach $64.9 billion, representing a compounded annual growth rate of approximately 11% over the nine-year period from 2021. Our experience and awareness of the markets in which we operate lead us to believe that demand for the types of products we distribute will grow in tandem with the industry.
The North American Cannabis Landscape
United States and Territories.  Eighteen states, and the District of Columbia, have legalized cannabis for non-medical adult use with additional states, such as Oklahoma and Pennsylvania, actively considering the legalization of cannabis for non-medical adult use. An additional twenty-six states have legalized medical cannabis in some form, with certain of those states permitting only low tetrahydrocannabinol ("THC") oils for a limited class of patients. Only six states continue to prohibit cannabis entirely. Notwithstanding the continued trend toward further state legalization, cannabis continues to be categorized as a Schedule I controlled substance under the Federal Controlled Substances Act (the “CSA”) and, accordingly, the cultivation, processing, distribution, sale and possession of cannabis violate federal law in the United States as discussed further in Item 1A under the heading "Risk Factors." Our business depends partly on continued purchases by businesses and individuals selling or using cannabis pursuant to state laws in the United States or Canadian and provincial laws.
We believe support for cannabis legalization in the United States is gaining momentum. According to a November 2021 poll by Gallup, public support for the legalization of cannabis in the United States has increased from approximately 12% in 1969 to approximately 68% in 2021. In 2020, five states passed ballot initiatives legalizing either adult use or medical cannabis. In 2021, Connecticut, New Mexico and Virginia legalized adult use cannabis, in addition to several more states legalizing medical cannabis, further evidencing the continued momentum of state legalization initiatives, as well as the public's support for cannabis legalization. 
The following map from the National Cannabis Industry Association illustrates the states that have fully legalized adult-use cannabis (for medical and recreational purposes), states that have partially legalized cannabis (for medical purposes only), and states that have legalized cannabis use in a limited capacity (as of February 17, 2022). 
Canada.
Legal access to dried cannabis for medical purposes was first allowed in Canada in 1999. The Cannabis Act (the “Cannabis Act”) currently governs the production, sale and distribution of medical cannabis and related oil extracts in Canada.
On April 13, 2017, the Government of Canada introduced Bill C-45, which proposed the enactment of the Cannabis Act to legalize and regulate access to cannabis. The Cannabis Act proposed a strict legal framework for controlling the production, distribution, sale and possession of medical and recreational adult-use cannabis in Canada. On June 21, 2018, the Government of Canada announced that Bill C-45 received Royal Assent. On July 11, 2018, the Government of Canada published the Cannabis Regulations under the Cannabis Act. The Cannabis Regulations provide more detail on the medical and recreational regulatory regimes for cannabis, including regarding licensing, security clearances and physical security requirements, product practices, outdoor growing, packaging and labelling, cannabis-containing drugs, document retention requirements, reporting and disclosure requirements, the new access to cannabis for medical purposes regime and industrial hemp. The majority of the Cannabis Act and the Cannabis Regulations came into force on October 17, 2018, with additional Cannabis regulations coming into effect on October 17, 2019.
While the Cannabis Act provides for the regulation by the federal government of, among other things, the commercial cultivation and processing of cannabis for recreational purposes, it provides the provinces and territories of Canada with the authority to regulate in respect of the other aspects of recreational cannabis, such as distribution, sale, minimum age requirements, places where cannabis can be consumed, and a range of other matters.
The governments of every Canadian province and territory have implemented regulatory regimes for the distribution and sale of cannabis for recreational purposes. Most provinces and territories have announced a minimum age of 19 years old, except for Québec and Alberta, where the minimum age will be 18. Certain provinces, such as Ontario, have legislation in place that restricts the packaging of vapor products and the manner in which vapor products are displayed or promoted in stores.
The European Cannabis Landscape
Europe’s population is larger than that of the U.S. and Canadian markets combined, suggesting the potential of a very significant market. The changes in regulations for cannabis products across Europe are expected to result in a market growth of approximately $37.0 billion in annual sales by 2027, a significant growth from approximately $3.5 billion in 2020.
Currently, Germany, Italy, Austria, Czech Republic, Finland, Portugal, Spain, the Netherlands, Denmark, Greece, Croatia, North Macedonia, Poland, Turkey, Malta, Romania, Belgium, Estonia, Lithuania, Moldova, Norway, San Marino, Sweden, Switzerland, Luxembourg, Cyprus, France, the U.K and Ireland allow limited cannabis use for medicinal purposes, with some of those countries operating pilot programs. It has been widely reported that other countries are considering following suit. Additionally, certain countries in Europe, including Germany, are considering the adoption of laws that would legalize cannabis for adult use. 
Product Information
Consumers of cannabis, herbs, flavored compounds, aromatherapy oils and nicotine require the types of products we distribute, including vaporizers, pipes, rolling papers and packaging. Producers of cannabis products are able to source compliant packaging, vape hardware and other products needed in the manufacturing and distribution stages of the supply chain. We believe we distribute the “picks & shovels” for these rapidly-growing industries and producers. As the world of cannabis and its respective aesthetic continues to expand, we strive to keep our product mix relevant, popular, and innovative; offering an array of products from vaporizers, grinders, to rolling papers and apparel lines. As our product offerings continue to develop and expand, we expect our revenue by categories to increase accordingly.
Inhalation Delivery Methods
There are two prevalent types of inhalation methods for cannabis and nicotine: combustion and vaporization. Vaporizers are devices that heat materials to temperatures below the point of combustion, extracting the flavors, aromas and effects of dry herbs and concentrates in the form of vapor. Measured by revenue, vaporizers are our largest product category. 
The Science and Popularity of Vaporization
Vaporizers have elements that are designed to quickly heat material, causing vaporization to occur without the carbon dioxide that is typically generated through any combustion. The vapor byproduct is then immediately inhaled through the mouthpiece on the device itself, or through a hose or an inflatable bag. Vaporizers can heat a variety of dry materials, viscous liquids and waxes, and provide a convenient way for users to consume the active ingredients. Common ingredients used in vaporizers include tobacco, nicotine extracts, legal herbs, hemp-derived CBD, aromatherapy oils, cannabis and propylene glycol and glycerin blends.
Vaporization Technology. Consumers have a wide array of vaporization devices at their disposal, which can be broadly categorized into two primary categories: desktop and portable vaporizers. Our vaporizer offering spans over 230 distinct products across 30 brands.
Desktop Vaporizers.  Vaporizers were first developed as desktop models that were powered through traditional electric power sources. Desktop vaporizers are capable of heating the material to a more precise temperature choice determined by the consumer or as advised by a health practitioner.
Portable Vaporizers. With the development of lithium batteries, vaporizers have now become portable. Technological advances are resulting in lighter, sleeker and more visually-appealing units that are capable of quickly heating the material to the user’s desired temperature setting. Portable vaporizers, of which pens are a sub-set, are differentiated by many features, including output, battery life, recharge time, material, capacity and design.
Other Methods of Consumption.  In addition to vaporizers, consumers have a wide array of methods of consumption at their disposal, including, among others, hand pipes, water pipes, rolling papers, and oral and topical delivery methods.
Hand and Water Pipes. We offer a diverse portfolio of over 200 hand and water pipes across 27 brands, including our own proprietary Higher Standards, Marley Natural and K. Haring Glass brands. Many display iconic, licensed logos and artwork, as pipes have grown into an artistic expression and are available in countless creative forms and functionality. Hand pipes are small, portable and simple to use, and function by trapping the smoke produced from burning materials, which is then inhaled by the user. Water pipes include large table-top models, bubblers and rigs, and are more complex because they incorporate the cooling effects of water to the burning materials before inhalation.
Rolling Papers.  Rolling papers are a traditional consumption method used to smoke dried plant material in a "roll-your-own" application. These include papers, cones and wraps. Our rolling papers category is comprised of over 100 products across 17 brands, inclusive of Greenlane Brand's own Vibes Rolling Papers brand, not including accessories such as rolling trays or tips. 
Our Competitive Strengths
We attribute our success to the following competitive strengths:
A Clear Market Leader in an Attractive Industry.
We are a leading global platform for the development and distribution of premium cannabis accessories, packaging, vape solutions, and lifestyle products, reaching over 8,500 retail locations, including, licensed cannabis dispensaries, smoke shops, and specialty retailers. We also own and operate one of the industry’s most visited North American direct-to-consumer e-commerce websites, Vapor.com, as well as several industry-leading e-commerce platforms, including Higherstandards.com, Aerospaced.com, DaVincivaporizer.com, Vaposhop.com, and Eycemolds.com.
Market Knowledge and Understanding.
Because of our experience and our extensive, long-term industry relationships, we believe we have a deep understanding of customer needs and desires in our Industrial Goods and Consumer Goods business segments. This allows us to influence customer demand and the pipeline between product manufacturers, suppliers, advertisers and the marketplace. 
Comprehensive and Best-in-Class Product Offering.
We offer a curated portfolio of products and accessories across all major categories with diverse, best-in-class offerings that cater to our customers' needs. This comprehensive and best-in-class product offering creates a “one-stop shop" for many of our customers and positively distinguishes us from our competitors. In addition, we have carefully cultivated a portfolio of well-known brands and premium products and have helped many of the brands we distribute to become established names in the industry.
Entrepreneurial Culture.
We believe our entrepreneurial, results-driven culture fosters highly-dedicated employees who provide our customers with superior service. We invest in our talent by providing every sales representative with an extensive and ongoing education, and have successfully developed programs that provide comprehensive product knowledge and the tools needed to have a unique understanding of our customers’ personalities and decision-making processes.
Customers. We believe we offer superior services and solutions due to our comprehensive product offering, proprietary industry data and analytics, product expertise and quality of service. We deliver products to our customers in a precise, safe and timely manner with complementary support from our dedicated sales and service teams.
Suppliers. Our industry knowledge, market reach and resources allow us to establish trusted professional relationships with many of our product suppliers. We generate substantially all of our net sales from products manufactured by others. We have strong relationships with many large, well-established suppliers, and seek to establish distribution relationships with smaller or more recently established manufacturers in our industry. While we purchase our products from over 300 suppliers, a significant percentage of our net sales is dependent on sales of products from a small number of key suppliers. We believe there is a trend of suppliers in our industry to consolidate their relationships to do more business with fewer distributors. We believe our ability to help maximize the value and extend the distribution of our suppliers’ products has allowed us to benefit from this trend. The efforts of our senior management team have been integral to our relationships with our suppliers.
Employees. We provide our employees with an entrepreneurial culture, a safe work environment, financial incentives and career development opportunities.
Experienced and Proven Management Team Driving Organic and Acquisition Growth. 
We believe our management team is among the most experienced in the industry. Our senior management team brings experience in cannabis, accounting, mergers and acquisitions, financial services, consumer-packaged goods, retail operations, third-party logistics, information technology, product development and specialty retail, and an understanding of the cultural nuances of the industry that we serve.
Our Operating Strategies
We intend to leverage our competitive strengths to increase shareholder value through the following core strategies:
2022 Plan to Accelerate Path to Profitability and Capitalize the Business
In March 2022, we implemented a new strategic plan (the "2022 Plan") to accelerate our path to profitability and capitalize the business in a non-dilutive manner by reducing our headcount and facility footprint, selling the Company's headquarters, disposing non-core assets, discontinuing and selling lower-margin third-party brands, and securing an asset based loan to support the Company's long-term working capital needs. 
Management believes that the 2022 Plan will significantly reduce costs, help accelerate the Company's path to profitability, support the growth of the business in a non-dilutive manner, and allow the Company to reinvest capital into its highest margin and highest growth potential product lines, such as its Greenlane Brands.
Developing A World-Class Portfolio of Proprietary Brands. 
We intend to continue to develop a portfolio of our own proprietary brands, which over time has helped to improve our blended margins and create long-term value. Our brand development is based upon our proprietary industry intelligence that allows us to identify market opportunities for new brands and products. We leverage our distribution infrastructure and customer relationships to penetrate the market quickly with our proprietary brands and to gain placement in thousands of stores. Currently, we sell such products directly to consumers through our brand websites and our e-commerce properties. Our existing proprietary Greenlane Bands include VIBES Rolling Papers, Eyce silicone pipes, DaVinci vaporizers, Pollen Gear, the Marley Natural accessory line, Aerospaced & Groove grinders, Marley Natural, K. Haring Glass Collections, and Higher Standards.
In creating, acquiring, and expanding our proprietary brands, we intend to stay mindful of our key supplier relationships and to identify opportunities within our product portfolio and in the market where we can introduce or acquire compelling products that do not directly compete with the products of our core suppliers.
Enhance Our Operating Margins. 
We expect to enhance our operating margins as our business expands through a combination of additional product purchasing discounts, reduced inbound and outbound shipping and handling rates, reduced transaction processing fees, increased operating efficiencies and realization of benefits through leveraging our existing assets and distribution facilities. Additionally, we expect that our operating margins will increase as our product mix continues to evolve to include a greater portion of our proprietary branded products. We are committed to supporting our proprietary brands, such as DaVinci, Eyce, Higher Standards, VIBES and Pollen Gear, which offer significantly higher gross margins than supplier-branded products.
Build Upon Strong Customer and Supplier Relationships to Expand Organically.
Our North American footprint and broad supplier relationships, combined with our regular interaction with our large and diverse customer base, provides us key insights and positions us to be a critical link in the supply chain for premium vaporization products and consumption accessories. Our suppliers benefit from access to more than 8,500 brick and mortar retail locations as we are a single point of contact for improved production, planning and efficiency. Our customers, in turn, benefit from our market leadership, talented sales associates, broad product offerings, high inventory availability, timely delivery and exceptional customer services. We believe our strong customer and supplier relationships will enable us to expand and broaden our market share in the premium vaporization products and consumption accessories marketplace and expand into new categories.
Execute on Identified Operational Initiatives. 
We continue to evaluate operational initiatives to improve our profitability, enhance our supply chain efficiency, strengthen our pricing and category management capabilities, streamline and refine our marketing process and invest in more sophisticated information technology systems and data analytics. In addition, we continue to further automate our distribution facilities and improve our logistical capabilities. We are also taking steps to transition to a more centralized model with fewer, larger, highly automated facilities. Prior to our merger with KushCo, KushCo made significant progress in 2021 towards this goal through closing two 3PL facilities and five self- managed warehouses (Washington, Michigan, and California), as well as consolidating into our new Moreno Valley, single-site California warehouse, which will streamline processes and further reduce operational costs going forward. We believe we will continue to benefit from these and other operational improvements.
Pursue Value-Enhancing Strategic Acquisitions.
Through our acquisitions of VaporNation (Better Life Holdings, LLC), Pollen Gear LLC, and Conscious Wholesale, we have added new markets within the United States and Europe, new product lines, talented employees and operational best 
practices. On March 2, 2021, we acquired substantially all the assets of Eyce, which further diversified our Greenlane Brand offerings through the integration of Eyce premium silicon smoking products and accessories. Effective November 30, 2021, we acquired DaVinci, which expanded our Greenlane Brands portfolio and intellectual property pipeline through the integration of DaVinci premium portable vaporizers. Given our current stock price level, we have decided to temporarily pause our acquisition activity. Once our stock price increases to a level that we believe is sufficient for accretive acquisitions, we intend to resume these strategic acquisitions to grow our market share and enhance leadership positions by taking advantage of our scale, operational experience and acquisition know-how to pursue and integrate attractive targets. We believe we have significant opportunities to add product categories through our knowledge of our industry and possible acquisition targets.
Be the Employer of Choice. 
We believe our employees are the key drivers of our success, and we aim to recruit, train, promote and retain the most talented and success-driven personnel in the industry. Our size and scale enable us to offer structured training and career path opportunities for our employees, while in our sales and marketing teams, we have built a vibrant and entrepreneurial culture that rewards performance. We are committed to being the employer of choice in our industry.
Business Seasonality
We have historically experienced only moderate seasonality in our Consumer Goods business, particularly during the fourth quarter, which coincides with Cyber Monday (the first Monday after Thanksgiving, when online retailers typically offer holiday discounts), and as our customers build up their inventories in anticipation of the holiday season and for which we have related promotional marketing campaigns. Our Industrial Goods business is generally not affected by seasonality. 
Human Capital Resources
As of March 15, 2022, we had 256 full-time employees. Approximately 200 were employed in the U.S., 2 were employed in Canada, and 54 were employed in Europe. None of our employees are represented by a labor union. We have never experienced a labor-related work stoppage.
As part of our 2022 Plan, we completed a reduction in force in March 2022, which we expect to result in approximately $8.0 million in annualized cash compensation cost savings. We believe our current headcount and resources are sufficient to execute our plan of achieving profitability in the near-term, while remaining flexible to scale our hiring as industry demand and our sales grow. 
As we mention in our core operating strategies, we aim to be the employer of choice, as our employees are the key drivers of our success. We aim to recruit, train, promote and retain the most talented and success-driven personnel in the industry. Our industry knowledge and scale provide opportunities for our employees to obtain structured training and career path opportunities across all departments and positions. We are a company that operates with three core values: never settle, never follow, and never disrespect. 
Employee Health and Safety during COVID-19
The health and safety of our employees is a top priority for us. During COVID-19, we were deemed an essential industry and as a result, we were very active in monitoring and tracking all relevant data, including guidance from local, national, and international health agencies. Our actions included:
•Allowing employees to work remotely where feasible;
•Implemented enhanced safety measures including mandatory face coverings, physical distance requirements, temperature checks, deep cleaning and disinfectant protocols, and hand sanitizing stations for employees continuing critical on-site work at all locations;
•Provide employee-wide training on COVID-19 safety measures;
•Restrict company travel to essential business travel that requires prior multi-level approvals.
Our Human Resources and Safety teams are continuing to communicate to our employees as more information is available and continues to evaluate our operations considering federal, state, and local guidance.
Culture and Engagement
Everything we do is powered by our vision and core values and our culture reflects that. As a result, we enjoy a highly motivated and skilled work force committed to our company. We send out regular employee engagement surveys, and in consultation with our employees we have addressed several opportunities to further improve our culture. By being open, honest, and transparent, our employees feel more actively engaged in our success. 
Total Rewards and Pay Equity
We strive to attract and retain diverse, high caliber employees who raise the talent bar by offering competitive compensation and benefit packages, regardless of their gender, race, or other personal characteristics. We regularly review and survey our compensation and benefit programs against the market to ensure we remain competitive in our hiring practices. We provide employee salaries that are competitive and consider factors such as an employee’s role and experience, the location of their job and their performance. In addition to our competitive salaries, to enhance our employees’ sense of participation in the company and to further align their interests with those of our stockholders, we offer equity packages to all employees.
Development and Retention
We strive to hire, develop, and retain talent that continuously raises the performance bar. We encourage, support, and compensate our employees based on our philosophy of recognizing and rewarding exceptional performance. We believe that performance and development is an ongoing process in which all employees should be active participants. Individual and company key performance goals are linked to employee compensation, and we have begun work on a Greenlane Learning and Development curriculum that will include a blended approach to both in person and virtual learning. 
Competition
Business-to-Business. We operate in an evolving industry in which the market and its participants remain highly fragmented. Although it is difficult to find reliable independent research, we believe there is a vast number of potential B2B customers in North America comprised of licensed cannabis dispensaries, smoke shops, and specialty retailers. We currently serve over 8,500 of these retail locations. Our B2B customers compete primarily on the basis of the breadth, style, quality, pricing and availability of merchandise, the level of customer service, brand recognition and loyalty. We successfully reach our B2B customers through our direct sales force and other marketing initiatives, and provide them with our strategically-curated mix of brands and products, merchandise planning strategies and exceptional customer service. Among vaporizer product distributors, we compete against both suppliers and other distributors. A number of suppliers choose to distribute directly in some sales channels and may also operate their own e-commerce platforms. We face competition from many small privately-owned regional distributors that carry a narrow range of products. We believe there are only a select few wholesale distributors carrying a complete line of premium vaporization products and consumption accessories.
Business-to-Consumer. A number of suppliers of vaporizers and specialized consumption products and accessories operate their own e-commerce websites through which they sell their items directly to end consumers. Additionally, there are hundreds of websites that sell products similar to those we offer in North America, Europe, Australia and other parts of the world. We believe we compete effectively with other e-commerce websites. Further, we provide fulfillment services to the owners of some of these websites as they do not carry their own inventory, are not able to ship as efficiently as we do and are unable to meet certain regulatory requirements, such as sales tax collection. Our competitors’ websites rank in many search categories below our primary e-commerce website, Vapor.com, which has its own dedicated design, social media and search engine optimization ("SEO") teams. We believe our market knowledge, large product selection, relationships with vaporizer brands, in-house search engine optimization teams, social media focus and distribution facilities will enable us to remain a market leader in e-commerce.
Trademarks
We own a number of registered trademarks and service marks, including without limitation, trademarks in the relevant classes of goods for Greenlane, Higher Standards, VIBES, Aerospaced, Groove, Pollen GearTM, Eyce, and most recently DaVinci. We also license certain trademarks and other intellectual property, most notably those associated with our Marley Natural and K. Haring Glass Collection brands. Solely for convenience, trademarks and trade names referred to in this Form 10-K may appear without the ® or TM symbols, but such references are not intended to indicate, in any way, that we will not assert, to the fullest extent under applicable law, our rights or the rights of the applicable licensor to these trademarks and trade names. In addition, this Form 10-K contains trade names, trademarks and service marks of other companies that we do not own. We do not intend our use or display of other companies’ trade names, trademarks or service marks to imply a relationship with, or endorsement or sponsorship of us by, these other companies. We believe our largest trademarks are widely recognized throughout the world and have considerable value. The duration of trademark registrations varies from country to country. However, trademarks are generally valid and may be renewed indefinitely as long as they are in use and/or their registrations are properly maintained. 
Regulatory Developments
Our operating results and prospects will be impacted, directly and indirectly, by regulatory developments at the local, state, and federal levels. Certain changes in local, state, national, and international laws and regulations, such as increased legalization of cannabis, create significant opportunities for our business. However, other changes to laws and regulations result in restrictions on which products we are permitted to sell and the manner in which we market our products, increased taxation of our products, and negative changes to the public perceptions of our products, among other effects.
We believe the continuing trend of states’ legalization of medicinal and adult-use cannabis is likely to contribute to an increase in the demand for many of our products. In the 2020 election, voters approved ballot initiatives legalizing adult-use cannabis in New Jersey, Arizona, Montana and South Dakota. Voters also approved initiatives legalizing medical marijuana in Mississippi and South Dakota. In 2021, Connecticut and Virginia passed measures legalizing adult-use cannabis. Other states appear likely to legalize either medical or adult-use cannabis in 2022 and beyond. However, we can provide no assurances that additional states will legalize cannabis.
Recently, the identification of many cases of e-cigarette or vaping product use associated lung injury (“EVALI”) has led to significant scrutiny of e-cigarette and other vaporization products. Additionally, certain academic studies and news reports have suggested that smoking or vaping may increase the risk of complications for individuals who contract COVID-19. EVALI, COVID-19 and other public health concerns could contribute to negative perceptions of vaping and smoking, which in turn could lead consumers to avoid certain of our products, which would materially and adversely affect our results of operations.
In response to health concerns and concerns about people under the age of eighteen using vaping products, several localities, states, and the federal government have enacted measures restricting the sale of certain types of vaping products. For example, on December 20, 2019, legislation was signed into law that raised the federal minimum age of sale for tobacco products from 18 to 21. Additionally, the federal government, as well as some state, provincial, and local governments have enacted or plan to enact laws and regulations that restrict the sale of certain types of vaping products. For example, several states and localities have implemented bans on certain flavored vaping products in an effort to reduce the appeal of such products to minors and some localities have banned the sale of nicotine vaping products entirely. Other states, including Arkansas, Maine, Utah, and Vermont have banned the sale of vaporizers direct to consumers through mail. Other laws banning certain vaping products or restricting the manner in which they may be sold have been adopted in Arkansas, Massachusetts, New York, New Jersey, Maryland, Rhode Island, Vermont, Utah and Maine among other jurisdictions. Taken together, these federal, state, and provincial restrictions on vaping products materially and adversely affect our revenues. The ultimate impact of these policy developments will depend upon, among other things, the types and quantities of products we sell that are encompassed by each ban, the success of legal challenges to the bans, our suppliers' actions to adapt to actual and potential regulatory changes, and our ability to provide alternative products.
In addition, 27 states and the District of Columbia have recently adopted laws imposing taxes on liquid nicotine. Additionally, at least eleven states have adopted laws imposing taxes on vaporizers. These taxes will result in increased prices to end consumers, which may adversely impact the demand for our products. We expect these taxes would impact our competitors similarly, assuming their compliance with applicable laws.
The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021, which was signed into law on December 27, 2020, contains provisions that prohibit the mailing of electronic nicotine delivery systems ("ENDS") through the United States Postal Service (“USPS”) and place certain regulatory requirements on shipment of ENDS through other carriers. Certain private carriers, including UPS and FedEx, also have policies restricting or prohibiting the shipment of many vaporization products we sell. On December 30, 2021, the USPS granted us an exception that permits Greenlane to continue shipping ENDS business to business via the USPS. This exception, combined with our use of alternative carriers, permits us to continue shipping almost all of our products to the vast majority of our customers, provided that we continue to meet all regulatory requirements. While we currently retain our ability to ship products to customers, additional legal or policy changes concerning the shipment of vaporizers could increase our costs materially and deprive us of our ability to timely deliver certain products to certain types of customers.
