Company Overview
Pillarstone Capital REIT (the “Company,” “Pillarstone,” “we,” “our,” or “us”) is a Maryland real estate investment trust engaged in investing in, owning and operating commercial properties. Future real estate investments may include (i) acquisition and development of retail, office, office warehouse, industrial, multifamily, hotel, and other commercial properties, (ii) acquisition of or merger with a real estate investment trust (“REIT”) or a real estate operating company and (iii) joint venture investments. Excess funds can be invested in cash equivalents depending on market conditions. 
The Company was formed on March 15, 1994 as a Maryland REIT. The Company operated as a traditional real estate investment trust by buying, selling, owning and operating commercial and residential properties through December 31, 1999. In 2000, the Company purchased a software technology company, resulting in the Company no longer meeting qualifications to be a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”). In 2002, the Company discontinued the operations of the technology segment.
From 2003 through 2006, we pursued a value-added business plan primarily focused on acquiring well located, under-performing multi-family residential properties, including affordable housing communities, and repositioning them through renovation, leasing, improved management and branding. In 2006, the Company did not complete a public offering for a portfolio acquisition due to market conditions, and consequently, was not able to meet the listing requirements of the former American Stock Exchange (“Amex”). Accordingly, Pillarstone’s common shares were delisted from the Amex and commenced being quoted on the Over-The-Counter Bulletin Board (“OTC Bulletin Board”) and on the pink sheets under the symbol “PRLE”.
From 2006 until December 2016, the Company continued its existence as a corporate shell filing its quarterly and annual reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") so that it could be used for future real estate transactions. During this time, the Company was funded by the trustees who contributed $500,000 in exchange for 125,000 Class C Convertible Preferred Shares and $197,780 in exchange for convertible notes payable. In 2016, the shareholders of Pillarstone approved changing the Company's name from Paragon Real Estate Equity and Investment Trust to Pillarstone Capital REIT.
Substantially all of our business is conducted through Pillarstone Capital REIT Operating Partnership LP, a Delaware limited partnership organized in 2016 (“Pillarstone OP”). We are the sole general partner of Pillarstone OP. As of December 31, 2018, we owned 18.6% of the outstanding equity in Pillarstone OP and fully consolidate it on our financial statements. 
On December 8, 2016, Pillarstone and Pillarstone OP entered into a Contribution Agreement (the “Contribution Agreement”) with Whitestone REIT Operating Partnership, L.P. (“Whitestone OP”), a subsidiary and the operating partnership of Whitestone REIT (“Whitestone”), both of which are related parties to Pillarstone and Pillarstone OP. Pursuant to the terms of the Contribution Agreement, Whitestone OP contributed to Pillarstone OP all of the equity interests in four of its wholly-owned subsidiaries: Whitestone CP Woodland Ph. 2, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“CP Woodland”); Whitestone Industrial-Office, LLC, a Texas limited liability company (“Industrial-Office”); Whitestone Offices, LLC, a Texas limited liability company (“Whitestone Offices”); and Whitestone Uptown Tower, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“Uptown Tower”, and together with CP Woodland, Industrial-Office and Whitestone Offices, the “Entities”) that owned 14 real estate assets (the “Real Estate Assets” and, together with the Entities, the “Property”) for aggregate consideration of approximately $84 million, consisting of (1) approximately $18.1 million of Class A units representing limited partnership interests in Pillarstone OP (“OP Units”), issued at a price of $1.331 per OP Unit; and (2) the assumption of approximately $65.9 million of liabilities by Pillarstone OP, consisting of (a) approximately $15.5 million of Whitestone OP’s liability under that certain Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, dated as of November 7, 2014, as amended, among the Bank of Montreal, as Administrative Agent (the “Agent”), the lenders party thereto, BMO Capital Markets, Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, and U.S. Bank, National Association, Whitestone OP, as borrower, and Whitestone and certain subsidiaries of Whitestone OP, as guarantors (as amended, the “Whitestone Credit Facility”); (b) an approximately $16.3 million promissory note (the “Whitestone Uptown Tower Promissory Note”) of Uptown Tower issued under that certain Loan Agreement, dated as of September 26, 2013, (as amended, the “Whitestone Uptown Tower Loan Agreement” and, together with the Whitestone Uptown Tower Promissory Note, the “Whitestone Uptown Tower Loan Documents”) between Uptown Tower, as borrower, and U.S. Bank National Association, as successor to Morgan Stanley Mortgage Capital Holdings LLC, as lender, and (c) an approximately $34.1 million promissory note (the “Whitestone Industrial-Office Promissory Note”) of Industrial-Office issued under that certain Loan Agreement, dated as of November 26,

2013 (the “Whitestone Industrial-Office Loan Agreement” and, together with the Whitestone Industrial-Office Promissory Note, the “Whitestone Industrial-Office Loan Documents”), between Industrial-Office, as borrower, and Jackson National Life Insurance Company, as lender (collectively, the “Acquisition”). During 2018, Pillarstone OP sold three of the Real Estate Assets. 
Pursuant to the Contribution Agreement, Pillarstone agreed to file with the SEC on or prior to June 8, 2018, a shelf registration statement to register for sale under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), the issuance of the common shares of beneficial interest in Pillarstone (the “Common Shares”) that may be issued upon redemption of the OP Units issued pursuant to each of the Contribution Agreement and that certain OP Unit Purchase Agreement dated December 8, 2016 between Pillarstone, Pillarstone OP and Whitestone OP (the "OP Unit Purchase Agreement") and the offer and resale of such Common Shares by the holders thereof. In addition, pursuant to the Contribution Agreement, in the event of a Change of Control (as defined therein) of Whitestone, Pillarstone OP shall have the right, but not the obligation, to repurchase the OP Units issued thereunder from Whitestone OP at their initial issue price of $1.331 per OP Unit. Pillarstone and Whitestone agreed to extend the filing of the shelf registration statement to a date not later than June 8, 2019, or the date that the Company closes a public equity offering. On December 8, 2018, the OP Unit Purchase Agreement and the offer and resale of common shares terminated pursuant to its terms. There was no issuance of our Common Shares during 2018.
In connection with the Acquisition, (1) with respect to each Real Estate Asset (other than the Real Property Asset owned by Uptown Tower), Whitestone TRS, Inc. (“Whitestone TRS”), a subsidiary of Whitestone, entered into a Management Agreement with the Entity that owns such Real Estate Asset and (2) with respect to Uptown Tower, Whitestone TRS entered into a Management Agreement with Pillarstone OP (collectively, the “Management Agreements”). Pursuant to the Management Agreements with respect to each Real Estate Asset (other than Uptown Tower), Whitestone TRS agreed to provide certain property management, leasing and day-to-day advisory and administrative services to such Real Estate Asset in exchange for (x) a monthly property management fee equal to 5.0% of the monthly revenues of such Real Estate Asset and (y) a monthly asset management fee equal to 0.125% of GAV (as defined in each Management Agreement as, generally, the purchase price of the respective Real Estate Asset based upon the purchase price allocations determined pursuant to the Contribution Agreement, excluding all indebtedness, liabilities or claims of any nature) of such Real Estate Asset. Pursuant to the Management Agreement with respect to Uptown Tower, Whitestone TRS agreed to provide certain property management, leasing and day-to-day advisory and administrative services to Pillarstone OP in exchange for (x) a monthly property management fee equal to 3.0% of the monthly revenues of Uptown Tower and (y) a monthly asset management fee equal to 0.125% of GAV of Uptown Tower.

As a result of the Acquisition, Whitestone OP owns approximately 81.4% and Pillarstone owns approximately 18.6% of the outstanding equity in Pillarstone OP, which is fully consolidated on Pillarstone's financial statements.
 Competition
We compete for the acquisition of properties with many entities, including, among others, publicly traded REITs, life insurance companies, pension funds, partnerships and individual investors. Many competitors have substantially greater financial resources than us. In addition, certain competitors may be willing to accept lower returns on their investments. If competitors prevent us from buying properties that may be targeted for acquisition, our capital appreciation and valuation may be impacted.
Employees

As of April 1, 2019, the Company has one full time employee, two part time employees and one full time independent contractor.
