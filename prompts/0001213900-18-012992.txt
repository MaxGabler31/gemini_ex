Overview
 
At HyperSolar, Inc., our goal is to replace all forms of energy on earth with renewable energy.
 
Inspired by the photosynthetic process that plants use to harness the power of the sun to create energy molecules, we are developing a novel solar-powered particle system that mimics photosynthesis to separate hydrogen from water.
 
Hydrogen is the lightest and most abundant chemical element, constituting roughly 75% of the universe’s chemical elemental mass (Palmer, D. (13 September 1997). “Hydrogen in the Universe.” NASA). In its purest form, hydrogen is a non-toxic colorless and odorless gas. However, naturally occurring elemental hydrogen is relatively rare on earth and hydrogen gas is most often produced using fossil fuels. Industrial production is mainly from the steam reforming of natural gas and is usually employed near its production site, with the two largest uses being crude oil processing (hydrocracking) and ammonia production, mostly for the fertilizer market. We are developing what we believe is a cleaner and greener way to produce this high value product.
 
Hydrogen (when used as a fuel), like electricity, is an energy carrier rather than an energy resource. We believe that if hydrogen was easily accessed from the earth and the world could depend on it for fuel, eliminating our reliance on fossil fuels such as oil, coal, and natural gas, our carbon footprint and global climate change issues would be erased.
 
Over 99% of hydrogen produced today is produced using a fossil fuel, methane (natural gas) in a method called steam reforming, SMR. Although commercially optimized over decades, the SMR process is capital intensive and will remain so due to the fundamental nature of the process which includes: (1) three separate reactors with different catalysts operating at different temperatures, (2) large amounts of heat transfer needed for the endothermic reforming and exothermic water gas shift, and (3) the need to remove all carbon oxides using capital and energy intensive methods. (source: Nikolaidis, P.; Poullikkas, A., A comparative overview of hydrogen production processes. Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews 2017, 67, 597-611.)
 
Besides being capital intensive, the SMR method releases harmful levels of carbon dioxide into the air further contributing to our global climate crisis.
 
Despite the current method of production, the benefits of hydrogen for transportation emissions are far better than other fossil fuel alternatives of oil and gas, as the only emission of hydrogen is pure water. This fact dictates that we look for another method of making hydrogen to make it the world’s premier fuel by producing it in a more sustainable green way.
 
Market Opportunity
 
We believe we are still in the early stages of the hydrogen fuel market development, and yet, this market continues to grow exponentially. One of the reasons for this growth is the adoption of hydrogen fuel technologies within an increased number of major industries and spanning many applications.

Market Growth 
 
According to Grandview Research Report released in June of 2018, the global hydrogen generation market size is predicted to be valued at USD 180.2 billion by 2025. It is expected to expand at a CAGR of 5.8% over the forecast period. Rising demand for renewable sources of energy and safe fuels is projected to boost market growth.
 
Increasing adoption of hydrogen and growing awareness of the importance of energy conservation are expected to boost the global market for hydrogen generation by 2025. Rising efforts to shift focus from fossil fuels to renewable fuels is expected to further propel market expansion. Numerous countries are introducing stringent regulations to significantly reduce indiscriminate use of conventional fuels responsible for excessive greenhouse gas emissions. Hydrogen is among the most abundantly available elements on earth and it plays an important role in agriculture, fertilizer and chemical manufacturing, and pharmaceutical production among others. Over the next two decades, hydrogen is expected to be on par with electricity as an effective energy carrier. It is safely derived from renewable sources of energy and is effective in reducing emissions. 
 
The merchant segment includes both small and large dealers, wholesalers, and companies deriving hydrogen as an excess byproduct. In terms of volume, captive hydrogen is the fastest growing segment with a CAGR of 9.2%. Captive is defined as on-site hydrogen generation, which eliminates numerous problems linked to conveyance and distribution of hydrogen. Therefore, the market is expected to grow substantially in future.  In terms of application, the steam methane reforming segment accounted for 68.8% of the global hydrogen generation market volume in 2016. In this method, methane containing raw material like natural gas is heated at a temperature between 700°C to 1,000°C, which produces hydrogen as a by-product. The coal gasification technology segment is anticipated to expand at a steady CAGR over the forecast period. Gasification of coal is one of the processes applied to produce liquid fuels, power, hydrogen, and chemicals. (Source: Grandview Research Report, June 2018)
 
It is within these industries that we believe our renewable hydrogen producing technology possesses significant market opportunity, especially as innovation and infrastructure continue to develop. This is further evidenced by studies that specifically address the fuel cell market, which was valued at $3.21 billion in 2015, but expected to reach nearly $25 billion by 2025 according to a Grand View Market report released in September 2018.
 
Hydrogen Fuel Cell Vehicles
 
One of the most recognized applications for hydrogen fuel technologies falls within the auto manufacturing and vehicles industries. The three leading manufacturers of hydrogen fuel cell vehicles (FCVs) are in order, Toyota, Hyundai, and Honda – three internationally recognized companies. Industry reports cite the need for increased infrastructure, such as fueling stations, for the industry to garner even greater market acceptance. However, the same report indicates there will be 22.2 million hydrogen fuel cell vehicles sold or leased by 2032, driving revenues upwards of $1.1 trillion. (https://www.researchandmarkets.com/reports/4200873/global-market-for-hydrogen-fuel-cell-vehicles)
Blending Hydrogen into Natural Gas Networks and Hydrogen Storage
 
One of the areas of greatest potential for hydrogen fuel is its ability to be successfully integrated into existing natural gas pipelines. It is well documented that hydrogen storage maintains energy for longer periods of time. We believe that, were it to be produced cost effectively, utilities could use hydrogen to store and deploy energy produced via solar and wind through existing natural gas plants and pipelines, without having such strong dependency on fossil fuels as a backup.

Our Technology
 
Technology for Making Renewable Hydrogen from Sunlight
 
Hydrogen (H2) is the third most abundant element on earth and cleanest fuel in the universe, (Dresselhaus, Mildred et al. (May 15, 2003). “Basic Research Needs for the Hydrogen Economy”). Unlike hydrocarbon fuels such as oil, coal and natural gas where carbon dioxide and other contaminants are released into the atmosphere when used, hydrogen fuel usage produces only pure water (H2O) as the byproduct. Unfortunately, pure hydrogen does not exist naturally on earth and therefore must be manufactured. Historically, the cost of manufacturing hydrogen as an alternative fuel has been higher than the cost of the energy used to make it. This is the dilemma of the hydrogen economy, and one that we aim to address.
 
For over a century, splitting water molecules into hydrogen and oxygen using electrolysis has been well known. This technology can be used to produce an unlimited amount of clean and renewable hydrogen fuel to power a carbon-free world. However, in practice, current commercial electrolysis technologies require (a) expensive electricity and (b) highly purified water to prevent fouling of system components. We believe these are the major barriers to affordable production of renewable hydrogen.
 
The Perfect and Sustainable Energy Cycle
 
As it turns out, Mother Nature has been making hydrogen using sunlight since the beginning of time by splitting water molecules (H2O) into its basic elements - hydrogen and oxygen. This is exactly what plant leaves do every day using photosynthesis. Since the produced hydrogen is immediately consumed inside the plant, we cannot simply grow trees to make hydrogen.
 
If technology can be developed to mimic photosynthesis to split water into hydrogen, we believe then a truly sustainable, low cost, and renewable energy cycle can be created to power the earth. However, cost has been the biggest barrier to realizing this vision.
 
Water Splitting
 
In the process of splitting a water molecule, input energy is transferred into the chemical bonds of the resulting hydrogen molecule. So in essence, manufactured hydrogen is simply a carrier or battery-like storage of the input energy. If the input energy is from fossil fuels, such as oil and gas, then carbon fossil fuel energy is simply transferred into hydrogen. If the input energy is renewable such as solar and wind, then new and clean energy is stored in hydrogen.
 
While the concept of water splitting is very appealing, the following challenges must be addressed for renewable hydrogen to be commercially viable:
 

● | Energy Inefficiency — Since hydrogen is an energy carrier, the most energy it can store is 100% of the input energy. However, conventional systems approach to electrolysis lose so much of the input energy in system components, wires and electrodes resulting in only a small portion of electricity making it into the hydrogen molecules. This translates to high production cost and is the fundamental problem with water splitting for hydrogen production. We intend to address this problem with our low cost and energy efficient particle technology. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Need for Clean Water — Conventional electrolysis requires highly purified clean water to prevent fouling of system components. This prevents current technology from using large quantities of available water from oceans, rivers, industrial waste and municipal waste as feedstock. Our technology is being designed to use any natural water or waste water for the unlimited production of renewable hydrogen. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Technology
 
Electrolysis water-splitting in its simplest form is the transfer of “input electrons” in the following chemical reactions:
 

● | Cathode (reduction): 2 H2O + 2e- -> H2 + 2 OH- 
--+---------------------------------------------------
● | Anode (oxidation): 4 OH- -> O2 + 2 H2O + 4 e- 

 
From these equations it can be deduced that if every input electron (e-) is put to work and not lost, then a maximum amount of input electrons (i.e. energy) is transferred and stored in the hydrogen molecules (H2). Additionally, if there were a very high number of cathode and anode reaction areas within a given volume of water, then a very high number of these reactions could happen simultaneously throughout the medium to split each water molecule into hydrogen wherever electrons are available.
 
HyperSolar H2Generator™
 
Since our particles are intended to mimic the natural room temperature conditions of photosynthesis, they can be housed in very low-cost reactors such as glass vessels or clear plastic bags. To facilitate the commercial use of our self-contained particle technology we are developing a modular system that will enable the onsite daily production and storage of hydrogen for any time use in electricity generation.

We refer to our technology as the HyperSolar H2Generator which is comprised of the following components:
 

1. | The Generator Housing - Novel (patent pending) is the first of its type to safely separate oxygen and hydrogen in the water splitting process without sacrificing efficiency. This device houses the water, the solar particles/cells and is designed with inlets and outlets for water and gasses. Utilizing a special membrane for separating the oxygen side from the hydrogen side, proton transport is increased which is the key to safely increasing solar-to-hydrogen efficiency. Our design can be scaled up and manufactured for commercial use. 
---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


2. | The NanoParticle or Solar Cell - Our patented nanoparticle consists of thousands of tiny solar cells that are electrodeposited into one tiny structure to provide the charge that splits the water molecule when the sun excites the electron. In the process of optimizing our nanoparticles to be efficient and only use earth abundant materials, (an ongoing process), we experimented with commercially available triple junction silicon solar cells to perform tests with our generator housing and other components. Through this experimentation, our discovery makes us believe we can bring a system to market utilizing these readily available cells while our nanoparticles are still being optimized. These solar cells also absorb the sunlight and produce the necessary charge for splitting the water molecule to produce the hydrogen and oxygen.

3. | Oxygen Evolution Catalyst - This proprietary catalyst developed at the University of Iowa lab is uniformly applied onto the solar cell or nanoparticle and efficiently collects holes to oxidize water molecule to generate oxygen gas. The oxygen evolution catalyst must be transparent to absorb the sun’s energy or light. It must be stable in alkaline, neutral and acidic environments. 
---+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


4. | Hydrogen Evolution Catalyst - Necessary for collecting electrons to reduce protons for generating hydrogen gas, we recently announced the successful integration of a low-cost hydrogen catalyst into our generator system successfully coating a triple junction solar cell with a catalyst comprised primarily of ruthenium, carbon and nitrogen that can function as well as platinum, the current catalyst used for hydrogen production, but at a 20x reduced cost. 
---+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


5. | Transparent Conductive Coating - A patent pending coating to protect our nanoparticles and solar cells from photo corrosion and efficiently transfer charges to catalysts for oxygen and hydrogen evolution reactions. 
---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


6. | A concentrator equal to two suns - This inexpensive Fresnel lens concentrator to increase sunlight to equal two suns reduces our necessary footprint for a 1000 KG per day system by 40%. 
---+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Our business and commercialization plan calls for two generations of our panels or generators. The first generation utilizes readily available commercial solar cells, coated with a stability polymer and catalysts, and inserted into our proprietary panels to efficiently and safely split water into hydrogen and oxygen to produce very pure and green hydrogen that can be piped off the panel, pressurized, and stored for use in a fuel cell to power anything electric.
 
The second generation of our panels will feature a nanoparticle based technology where billions of autonomous solar cells are electrodeposited onto porous alumina sheets and manufactured in a roll to roll process and inserted into our proprietary panels. For this generation, we have received multiple patents and it is estimated that it will produce hydrogen for less than $4 per kilogram before pressurization.
 
Our team at the University of Iowa led by our CTO Dr. Joun Lee, has reach a milestone of 300 consecutive hours of continuous hydrogen production utilizing completely immersed solar cells with no external biases achieving simulated production equal to one year. We believe this to be a record for completely immersed cells. Now ready to take our technology out of the lab, we are working with several vendors to commercialize and manufacturer our first generation of renewable hydrogen panels that use sunlight and water to generate hydrogen. We are currently working towards building a pilot plant in 2019 adjacent to a large company distribution or fulfillment center so they can power their fuel cell forklifts and materials handling equipment with completely renewable hydrogen vs. having to transport steam reformed hydrogen where the production process emits tons of harmful emissions and must be transported.

We anticipate that the HyperSolar H2Generator will be a self-contained renewable hydrogen production system that requires only sunlight and any source of water. As a result, it can be installed almost anywhere to produce hydrogen fuel at or near the point of distribution, for local use. We believe this model of hydrogen production addresses one of the biggest challenges of using clean hydrogen fuel on a large scale which is the transportation of hydrogen.
 
Each stage of the HyperSolar H2Generator can be scaled independently according to the hydrogen demands and length of storage required for a specific application. A small-scale system can be used to produce continuous renewable electricity for a small house, or a large scale system can be used to produce hydrogen to power a community.
 
Intellectual Property
 
On November 15, 2011 we filed a provisional patent application with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office to protect the intellectual property rights for “Photoelectrochemically Active Heterostructures, methods for their manufacture, and methods and systems for producing desired products.” On March 14, 2017, this patent was granted as United States Patent No. 9,593,053. The patent protects the Company’s proprietary design of a self-contained solar-to-hydrogen device made up of millions of solar powered water-splitting nanoparticles, per square centimeter. These nanoparticles are coated with a separate patent-pending protective coating that prevents corrosion during extended periods of hydrogen production. The aim of these nanoparticles is high conversion efficiency and low cost.
 
An important aspect of the patented technology is the integrated structures of high-density arrays of nano-sized solar cells as part of hydrogen production nanoparticles. The technology enables manufacturing of ultra-thin sheets for solar-to-hydrogen production, requiring substantially less material as compared to conventional solar cells used in rooftop power applications. 

In September of 2012, we jointly filed with the University of California, Santa Barbara (“UCSB”) an additional patent application to protect the intellectual property rights of our proprietary coating for protecting our semiconductor devices from corrosion in various types of water. This patent was titled: “Process and Systems for Stable Operation of Electroactive Devices”. We abandoned this patent late in 2017 for budgetary reasons and utilization of a different method in our research and development.

In March of 2015, we jointly filed a full utility patent application with UCSB for the “method of manufacture of multi-junction artificial photosynthetic cells.” The patent’s full coverage excludes others from making, using, or selling the technology process, and creates licensing opportunities. This patent was granted in Australia in June of 2018 and we have received notice of allowance from the US Patent Office.
 
On December 21, 2016, we filed jointly with the University of Iowa a patent for “Integrated Membrane Solar Fuel Assembly” to protect the intellectual property for our generator housing system that safely separates oxygen and hydrogen in the water splitting process without sacrificing efficiency. This device houses the water, the solar particles/cells and is designed with inlets and outlets for water and gasses. Utilizing a special membrane for separating the oxygen side from the hydrogen side, proton transport is increased which is the key to safely increasing solar-to-hydrogen efficiency. In December of 2017, we filed the utility patent for this important invention and prosecution is ongoing.
 
Strategic Partners
 
Effective September 19, 2018, we entered a one-year agreement with GreenTech Development Corporation. This consulting firm will advise the Company the development and commercialization of the Company’s technology, and the ongoing operations of the company. In addition, they will aid the Company in solicitation and acquisition of the financing for the development and commercialization of the company’s technology as well as help identify potential engineering and construction firms that are qualified to design and build a pilot plant to test and operate the Company’s technology in a steady state condition. This Agreement may be terminated by either party at any time, for any or no reason, by written notice to the other party not less than thirty (30) days prior to the effective date of termination. In the event of such termination, Company will be obligated to pay Consultant any outstanding fees and expenses due under this Agreement only for or in connection with such services actually completed by Consultant and reasonably acceptable to Company as of the date of termination notice . 


Competition
 
Currently, most hydrogen is produced by steam reforming of natural gas or methane. This production technology dominates due to easy availability and low prices of natural gas. Partial oxidation of petroleum oil is second in production capacity after steam reforming of natural gas. The third largest production technology in terms of production capacity is steam gasification of coal. The current industry is heavily dominated by large players such as Air Products and Chemicals Inc. and Air Liquide.
 
Green or Renewable hydrogen can be produced through electrolyzers if they are powered by solar or wind. There has been an emergence of these companies in the past few years. ITM Power in England and Proton Onsite in Norway are two of the largest companies in this industry. If not powered by solar panels or wind power, they require external electricity most likely created by coal, gas, or oil. We believe that our process when fully developed will offer a competitive advantage as it is completely green and renewable and utilizes no external power other than the sun.
