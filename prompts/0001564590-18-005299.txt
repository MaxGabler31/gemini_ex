Item 1. BUSINESS
Company Overview
 We design, manufacture and market the ViewRay MRIdian®, the only clinical MRI-guided radiation therapy system on the market. The MRIdian combines MRI and external-beam radiation therapy to simultaneously image and treat cancer patients. MRI is a broadly used imaging tool that has the ability to clearly differentiate between types of soft tissue. In contrast, X-ray or computed tomography (CT), the most commonly used imaging technologies in radiation therapy today, are often unable to distinguish soft tissues such as the tumor and critical organs. MRIdian integrates MRI technology, radiation delivery and our proprietary software to locate, target and track soft-tissue tumors, while radiation is delivered. These capabilities allow MRIdian to deliver radiation to the tumor more accurately, while reducing the radiation amount delivered to nearby healthy tissue, as compared to other radiation therapy treatments currently available. We believe this will lead to improved patient outcomes and reduced treatment-related side effects.
 There are two generations of the MRIdian: the first generation MRIdian with Cobalt-60 based radiation beams and the second generation MRIdian Linac, with more advanced linear accelerator or ‘linac’ based radiation beams. ViewRay’s first generation MRIdian was a breakthrough that integrated high quality radiation therapy with simultaneous magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).  
 ViewRay first-generation MRIdian System with radiation powered by Cobalt-60 was cleared by the FDA in May 2012. By the end of 2016, the Company had shipped nine of these first generation MRIdian Systems.  The MRIdian System demonstrated in clinical practice for the first time the benefits of MRI-guided radiation treatment for cancer, generating a large body of clinical evidence from its use in pancreatic, breast, lung, prostate and other cancers.
 ViewRay’s second-generation system, the MRIdian Linac (Linear Accelerator) system received the Conformité Européene, or CE Mark in September 2016 and FDA 510k clearance in February 2017.  The MRIdian Linac System has several advantages over the first generation MRIdian System. Linac-based radiation therapy delivery systems allow for higher dose, faster electronic variation of dose and very fast electronic beam activation and deactivation. Linear Accelerator technology obviates the need for the inspection, replacement, and disposal of Cobalt-60, and oversight from the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (or similar national agency in foreign countries).  ViewRay solved two major long-standing problems to integrate a linac beam compactly with an MRI system: 1) linac radiofrequency interference with the operation of the MRI and 2) MRI magnetic interference with the operation of the linac. 
  
• | Linacs utilize high-powered microwave generators similar to equipment used in radar at airports. These “radar stations” inside the linac create noise that can corrupt the delicate signals measured from the patient’s body to generate MR images. ViewRay solved this problem by introducing technology similar to that used in stealth aircraft. Stealth aircraft can hide from radar by using a coating that reflects and absorbs microwaves, thus preventing radar beams that strike the aircraft from bouncing back to the radar station. In a similar manner, ViewRay’s linac based system reflects and absorbs the output of the linac “radar station” to prevent it from interfering with the MRI, producing images as noise-free as MRI images with no integrated linac.

• | MRIs utilize high-powered superconducting magnets that are required to image the patient’s tissues. Many linac components will not operate properly when placed close to or inside these strong magnetic fields. Close placement is necessary to produce a compact system that can fit in existing radiation therapy vaults, as the MRIdian linac does. ViewRay overcame this challenge by creating magnetic shielding shells that create voids in the magnetic field without significantly disturbing the magnetic field used for imaging. This allows the linac to operate on the MRIdian linac gantry as if there were no magnetic field present. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 In addition, ViewRay has applied the same double-focused multi-leaf collimator technology, originally designed for the first generation MRIdian System, to ViewRay’s MRIdian linac technology.  This new high-resolution beam-shaping multi-leaf collimator (MLC), called the RayZR® MLC, when combined with the already sharp linac radiation source results in the sharpest linac beam commercially available in the industry. Therefore, we believe that ViewRay’s MRIdian linac technology could be transformative to the standard of care in radiation therapy. 
 Both generations of the MRIdian have received 510(k) marketing clearance from the US Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, and permission to affix the CE mark.  
  
• | We received initial 510(k) marketing clearance from the US Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, for our treatment planning and delivery software in January 2011.

• | We received 510(k) marketing clearance for MRIdian, with Cobalt-60 as the radiation source, in May 2012. We also received permission to affix the CE mark to MRIdian with Cobalt-60 in November 2014, allowing MRIdian with Cobalt-60 to be sold within the European Economic Area, or EEA. In August 2016, we received regulatory approval from the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare to market MRIdian with Cobalt-60 in Japan. In August 2016, we also received approval from the China Food and Drug Administration to market MRIdian with Cobalt-60 in China.

• | In September 2016, we received the CE mark for the second generation MRIdian Linac (with a linear accelerator as the radiation source) in the EEA. In February 2017, we received 510(k) clearance from the FDA to market MRIdian Linac. In June 2017, we received 510(k) clearance to market RayZR™, our high-resolution beam-shaping multi-leaf collimator, or MLC. We also received MRIdian Linac regulatory approval in Taiwan and Canada in August 2017, and in Israel in November 2017. We are also seeking required MRIdian Linac approvals in other countries such as Japan and China.

 Cancer is a leading cause of death globally and the second leading cause of death in the United States. Radiation therapy is a common method used to treat cancer that uses lethal doses of ionizing energy to damage genetic material in cells. Nearly two-thirds of all treated cancer patients in the United States will receive some form of radiation therapy during the course of their illness, according to estimates by the American Society for Radiation Oncology, or ASTRO. In 2016, IMV Medical Information Division, Inc., or IMV, reported that 97% of patients receiving radiation therapy in the United States were treated by a linear accelerator, or linac. The global linac market was estimated at approximately $4.6 billion in 2015 and was expected to grow to approximately $6.3 billion by 2020 according to a 2015 Markets and Markets report. IAEA Human Health Campus reported that there are over 11,500 linacs installed at over 7,800 centers worldwide. We currently estimate the annual market for linacs to be 1,000 units per year globally, the majority of which are replacement units. We believe the addressable market for MRIdian is the annual market for linacs due to MRIdian’s ability to treat a broad spectrum of disease sites. However, we believe that MRIdian may initially be used more frequently for complex cancer cases that may be difficult to treat on a standard linac due to the location of the tumor in relation to the surrounding organs at risk for radiation damage. 
 Despite the prevalence of MRI for diagnostic purposes and its ability to image soft tissue clearly, the radiation therapy industry has previously been unable to integrate MRI into external-beam radiation therapy systems
 successfully. Existing radiation therapy systems use X-ray-based imaging technologies, such as CT, which do not clearly differentiate between types of soft tissues 
or provide a fully accurate view of a tumor’s position in relation to critical organs. X-ray based imaging systems integrated into radiation delivery devices also often suffer from imaging artifacts caused by organ motion related to breathing, and artifacts related to air/fluid levels in the stomach and bowels. In addition, existing systems that offer imaging during the course of a treatment are limited by the rate at which they can image, due to the level of additional radiation to which they expose the patient. These constraints can make it difficult for a clinician to locate a soft tissue tumor accurately, track its motion in real-time or adapt treatment as internal anatomy changes. It is very difficult to both irradiate a tumor and minimize the amount of radiation exposure to critical organs, without the ability to see the exact location and shape of the tumor and 
 
5


surrounding critical organs. If a tumor is insufficiently irradiated, it may not respond to the treatment, resulting in a higher rate of local tumor recurrence and lower probability of overall survival for the patient. Excess radiation exposure to healthy organs and other healthy soft tissues can lead to severe side effects, including organ failure, secondary cancers and in the most serious cases, even death. We believe that the MRIdian’s ability to see the exact location and shape of the tumor and surrounding critical organs will lead to improved patient outcomes and reduced treatment related side effects.
 MRIdian is the first radiation therapy solution that enables simultaneous radiation treatment delivery and real-time MRI imaging of a patient’s internal anatomy.  It generates high-quality images that differentiate between the targeted tumor, surrounding soft tissue and nearby critical organs. MRIdian also records the level of radiation dose that the treatment area has received, enabling physicians to adapt the prescription between treatments, as needed. We believe this improved visualization and accurate dose recording will enable better treatment, improve patient outcomes and reduce side effects.  Key benefits to users and patients include: improved imaging and patient alignment; the ability to adapt the patient’s radiation treatments to changes while the patient is still on the treatment table, or “on-table adaptive treatment planning”; MRI-based motion management; and an accurate recording of the delivered radiation dose.  Physicians have already used MRIdian to treat a broad spectrum of radiation therapy patients with more than 45 different types of cancer, as well as patients for whom radiation therapy was previously not an option.
 We currently market MRIdian through a direct sales force in the United States and Canada and are developing a sales force to assist distributors in the rest of the world. At December 31, 2017, we had installed or delivered 15 MRIdian systems worldwide and had a backlog with total value of $203.6 million. We generated revenue of $34.0 million, $22.2 million, and $10.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. We had net losses of $72.2 million, $50.6 million and $45.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

 Cancer and Radiation Therapy Market
 Incidence of Cancer
 Cancer is a leading cause of death globally and the second leading cause of death in the United States behind cardiovascular disease. According to the American Cancer Society, nearly 1.7 million people were expected to be diagnosed with cancer in the United States during 2016 and approximately 0.6 million were expected to die from cancer, accounting for nearly one of every four deaths. As a result of a growing and aging population, the World Health Organization’s, or WHO, Global Initiative for Cancer Registry Development estimates that the number of new cancer cases worldwide will grow from 14.1 million in 2008 to 19.3 million in 2025.
 Cancer Therapy
 The primary goal of cancer therapy is to kill cancerous tissues, while minimizing damage to healthy tissues. There are three main ways to treat cancer: surgery, chemotherapy and radiation therapy.  Surgery attempts to remove the tumor from the body, while minimizing trauma to healthy tissue and preventing the spread or translocation of the disease to other parts of the body. Surgery is particularly effective because the surgeon can see the tumor and surrounding healthy tissue directly throughout the course of the procedure and can adapt his or her planned removal approach mid-procedure accordingly. Chemotherapy uses drugs to kill cancer cells. Unlike surgery, most forms of chemotherapy circulate throughout the patient’s body to reach cancer cells almost anywhere in the body systemically. Chemotherapy is most effective at destroying microscopic levels of disease. Radiation therapy is typically used as a local treatment, directed at a tumor and surrounding areas where microscopic cancerous cells are assumed to have spread. Radiation may be used as the primary treatment modality, or in combination with either chemotherapy or surgery or both. Radiation therapy works by damaging genetic material in cells and other cell components through interaction with ionizing energy. Effective radiation therapy balances destroying cancer cells with minimizing damage to normal cells. It can be used at high doses to ablate a tumor, an effect similar to surgery, or at moderate doses to target local microscopic disease, as is done with chemotherapy. Other, more recently developed ways of treating cancer, include hormone therapy and targeted therapy, such as immunotherapy.

Radiation Therapy
 Radiation therapy has become widespread, with nearly two-thirds of all treated cancer patients in the United States receiving some form of radiation therapy during the course of their cancer treatments, according to estimates by ASTRO. For most cancer types treated with radiation therapy, at least 75% of the patients are treated with the intent to cure the cancer. For lung and brain cancers, that number is somewhat lower, with 59% of lung cancer patients and 50% of brain cancer patients being treated with the goal of curing cancer. The remainder of cases are treated with palliative intent to relieve pain or other tumor related symptoms. The type of radiation therapy delivered by linac or Cobalt 60 based devices is a non-invasive outpatient procedure with little or no recovery time and can be used on patients who are unable to undergo conventional surgery. According to IMV, 97% of patients receiving radiation therapy in the United States are treated using a linac.
 Radiation is used to kill cancer cells primarily by damaging their DNA but can also kill healthy cells in the same way or cause them to become cancerous themselves. As a result, the goal of curative radiation therapy is to balance delivery of a sufficiently high dose of radiation to a tumor to kill the cancer cells while, at the same time, minimizing damage to healthy cells, particularly those in critical organs. Normal cells are better able to repair themselves after radiation than tumor cells, so doses of radiation are often fractionated, or delivered in separate sessions with rest periods in between. As a result, standard radiation therapy is often given once a day, five times a week, for one to nine weeks. According to a 2017 IMV report, patients made an estimated 20.2 million radiation therapy treatment visits in the United States from March 2016 to March 2017.
 Radiation Therapy Equipment Market
 According to a 2015 Markets and Markets report, the global linac market was estimated at approximately $4.6 billion in 2015 and was expected to grow to approximately $6.3 billion by 2020. According to IAEA Human Health Campus, there are more than 11,500 linacs installed at over 7,800 centers worldwide. In the United States, there are approximately 3,600 linacs installed at approximately 2,100 centers. The annual market for linacs is estimated to be 1,000 units per year globally, the majority of which are replacements for older machines.
 In the radiation therapy market, new technologies have historically been adopted at a rapid rate. According to IMV, the percentage of centers performing intensity modulated radiation therapy, or IMRT, grew from 30% in 2002 to 96% in 2012. The percentage of sites utilizing image-guided radiation therapy, or IGRT, grew even more quickly: from 15% in 2004 to 83% in 2012. The majority of IGRT procedures use on-board X-ray systems. As leading cancer centers adopt and study MRI-guided radiation therapy, we believe that our next-generation linac based MRI system will also follow a rapid adoption curve in the broader linac replacement market.
 Radiation Therapy Treatment Process
 Following diagnosis of the disease state, radiation treatment generally consists of the following steps:
  
• | Imaging and tumor contouring. To design the treatment plan, physicians obtain initial images of the tumor. This is done most commonly using a CT scan, often supplemented by an MRI, a positron emission tomography, or PET, scan, or both. These images, also known as simulation scans, are then imported into a treatment planning software system and aligned or “registered” to each other. Based on clinical experience, a physician will manually delineate, or “draw”, specific areas on the aligned images to define the location and extent of the tumor highlighting the following:
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Gross tumor volume, or GTV, a volumetric region encompassing the visible tumor.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Clinical target volume, or CTV, is the GTV plus a larger, surrounding area where cancer cells are already likely to have spread.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Planning target volume, or PTV, is the CTV plus a further enlarged area to allow for: inexact imaging; patient movement during treatment; tumor movement between planning and treatment; and organ motion caused by breathing. The PTV margin unavoidably includes only normal, healthy tissues and may be many times larger than the CTV. While the PTV margin is necessary to reduce the risk of local tumor recurrence, it does increase the risk of radiation damage to healthy tissue and critical organs. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

• | Treatment planning and dose prescription. Once the clinician has a three-dimensional map of the tumor, surrounding healthy tissues and nearby critical organs, a physician determines a treatment plan using one of the methods below. Creation of these plans typically takes days but can require up to several weeks. A typical curative radiation therapy treatment dose will be delivered over the course of several weeks with 10 to 43 radiation therapy sessions, referred to as fractions, lasting from a few minutes to an hour or more depending on the treatment plan.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | 3D-CRT planning. Using a method called three-dimensional conformal radiation therapy, or 3D-CRT, a clinician will choose both the beam angles and shapes the machine will use to direct the radiation beam towards the tumor, and the time period that each beam will be delivered. A computer will then calculate a prediction of the radiation dose delivered, and the radiation planning team will adjust the treatment plan on an iterative basis to arrive at a clinically acceptable radiation dose plan.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | IMRT planning. Using a method called intensity modulated radiation therapy, or IMRT, a physician will use computer software that calculates hundreds or even thousands of beamlets (small radiation beams) to optimize a treatment plan in order to achieve a more precise dose distribution than 3D-CRT. IMRT plans often allow better radiation coverage of tumors, while simultaneously sparing more healthy tissues from high radiation doses. In select cancers, IMRT has been shown to result in better patient outcomes than 3D-CRT.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | SRS and SBRT planning. Stereotactic radiosurgery, or SRS, and stereotactic body radiation therapy, or SBRT, are methods of delivery using 3D-CRT or IMRT, in a reduced number of sessions. SRS and SBRT deliver precisely targeted radiation in usually one to five fractions delivered in one treatment session on the same day. SRS is frequently used in brain and spine applications, while SBRT is used most often in the rest of the body, and has been shown to be particularly effective in early-stage lung cancer. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Alignment. Just prior to radiation delivery, clinicians typically take further images to assist with alignment of the patient’s tumor to the radiation beam. Most systems use a form of on-board CT, called “cone-beam CT” or “CBCT” to create this image and then move the patient so that the tumor’s location that day matches the prior planning position. However, cone beam CT may suffer from poor soft-tissue contrast, motion artifacts and may use a higher radiation dose than that available from the types of CT used for diagnosis purposes. Cumulatively, when applied every day prior to radiation delivery, the radiation exposure from CBCT (or other x-ray based image-guidance technologies) may increase the clinically relevant additional radiation dose delivered to the patient and may cause clinicians to adjust the intended radiation treatment plan. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 A less commonly used imaging technology is fluoroscopy, a real-time 2D X-ray system. However, fluoroscopy can expose a patient to even higher doses of radiation than does cone-beam CT. 
 Because of the limited soft tissue contrast of X-ray-based imaging, clinicians often use registration or fiducial markers to assist with alignment of the patient’s tumor to the treatment beams, such as the patient’s visible bone structures near the tumor or surgically implanted markers which identify the tumor’s location.  To minimize motion due to breathing or other normal body activity, patients may also be immobilized by restraining devices, such as abdominal compression or by “respiratory control,” techniques such as cameras that monitory a patient’s breathing during treatments or by asking the patient not to breathe at certain intervals during the treatment delivery.  To account for breathing and other body motions during treatment, specific trackers may be used, through a technique known as “4D radiation therapy.
  
• | Delivery. Following an assessment of the tumor location relative to the radiation beam geometry, treatment is initiated, and radiation is delivered to the patient. In some cases, additional 2D X-ray images are taken intermittently or registration makers are monitored during treatment to try to account for tumor movement. However, there is no ability for physicians or other clinicians to see the tumor’s location throughout the entire radiation treatment delivery with traditional linacs. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

• | Review. After a treatment session, the physician will review data gathered from the linac system to validate that the treatment it is proceeding according to his or her treatment plan. But, traditional linac systems have no ability to record the actual dose that was delivered to the tumor and nearby critical structures. In certain rare types of cancers, where the tumor is visible simply by looking at the patient without imaging equipment, the physician may decide to adjust the treatment plan during the course of the patient’s overall treatment. However, revising a treatment plan may take several days and will delay completion of the patient’s overall treatment. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Limitations of Traditional Radiation Therapy
 Limitations with traditional radiation therapy result from imaging technologies that make accurate visualization of a tumor and its relation to critical organs difficult or impossible during the treatment delivery.  Most current traditional systems take images of the tumor before and after treatments, but, none do so continuously during the treatments in real time.  As a result, treatments may not be delivered with the precision assumed by the physician and may not result in the necessary efficacy or reduction in local tumor recurrence.  Also, healthy tissues may be exposed to radiation levels different from those predicted by the planning system and can result in patient injury. 

• | Inability to accurately locate a tumor for treatment alignment. To locate a tumor, current radiation therapy systems rely on CT scans taken while the patient is on the delivery unit treatment table, or “on-table.” Because it is difficult for differentiate between the tumor and nearby soft tissues with CT images, clinicians use surrogate registration markers, including existing bone structures, external marks and surgically implanted fiducials, to align a patient’s tumor to the treatment beams prior to commencing treatment.

However, the spatial relationship between tumors and the registration markers used to locate them often changes between the time of the patient’s initial imaging and the time of his or her first treatment session. This is particularly true for tumors which are located in soft tissue.  By relying on a marker as a proxy for the tumor location, rather than on the tumor itself, clinicians risk missing the tumor when they deliver radiation beams into the patient’s body. In addition, placement of surgically implanted fiducial markers comes with inherent risks: the procedures are invasive; there is a risk of pain, infection, bleeding and lung collapse; and fiducials may change location and even migrate inside the body. Despite placement of fiducials, physicians are often unable to track changes in tumor shape. Also, fiducials made of dense metals, such as gold, may cause artifacts which interfere with imaging.
 
 
• | Inability to adapt treatment on-table. A physician designs a treatment plan and dose prescription based on images that are captured days or even weeks prior to initiation of radiation therapy. Creating a treatment plan can take up to several weeks in complex cases, and treatment itself can take up to nine weeks. However, during the course of therapy, tumors often change size, orientation or shape, and patient anatomy can change for reasons such as weight loss or gain. These changes can alter the planned radiation exposure to both the targeted regions and nearby healthy organs; this has the potential to increase the risk of local tumor recurrence and to reduce the safety of the radiation delivery. Adjusting for these changes on conventional delivery units requires re-planning, which includes getting new patient images needed to create a new treatment plan. This process may take several days and is highly resource intensive. As a result of these limitations, re-planning is infrequently performed.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Due to limitations in imaging technologies, physicians may actually be unaware of changes in the tumor and surrounding anatomy.  Consequently, they may continue to administer radiation dose according to the original treatment plan, without realizing its potential to reduce the effectiveness of the tumor treatment and to increase the risk of patient injury.
  
• | Inability to track tumor and organ motion accurately. In addition to the difficulty of locating a tumor accurately in a patient’s body at the time treatment begins, a further challenge is accounting for ongoing tumor movement that takes place during treatment. Tumors have been shown to move multiple centimeters relative to surrogate registration markers over the course of only a few seconds. Breathing and other normal bodily functions, such as changes in the bladder or bowel during treatment, can cause significant tumor motion. Although physicians use internal markers, external cameras and blocks placed on the patients’ body to track respiratory and other motion, they are typically unable to track the tumor itself. As a result, physicians usually enlarge the total region to be irradiated. This limitation increases the probability of missing the targeted treatment area and exposing healthy tissues to unnecessary radiation.

• | Inability to record cumulative radiation delivered. In order to determine treatment effectiveness, it is important to track how much radiation has been delivered to a tumor and its surrounding healthy tissue. Currently, there are no methods to record the actual dose of radiation that was delivered to the tumor and nearby critical structures. Therefore, physicians must assume that the radiation is delivered according to plan, rather than making decisions based on actual radiation dose delivered.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Each of these limitations increases the risk of missing a tumor and hitting healthy tissue during treatment. If a tumor is insufficiently irradiated, it may not respond to treatment, resulting in a greater probability of local tumor recurrence and reduced overall survival for the patient. The ability to avoid irradiating healthy tissue has been shown to reduce side effects. If healthy tissues, particularly critical organs, are irradiated, the side effects can be severe, including: scarring of lung tissue; fibrosis and cardiotoxicity in lung and breast cancers; incontinence and sexual dysfunction in pelvic and prostate cancers; infertility in pediatric cancers; memory loss, seizures and necrosis in brain cancer; secondary cancers, and in serious cases, death.
 Although MR technology is an imaging tool broadly used to differentiate between types of soft tissue in diagnostic settings, MR technology had not been available in the radiation treatment delivery room before the launch of ViewRay’s MRIdian System.  In the past, MR was not used with radiation therapy because the technologies interfered with each other: the magnetic field generated by an MRI interfered with the linac beam, while the radiofrequencies produced by the linac distorted the MR images. Current forms of CT have improved over time, but issues with radiation dose and image quality limit the utility of these technologies. Fluoroscopy and cone-beam CT

involve the use of X-rays, a form of ionizing radiation, and pose an increased risk of radiation-induced cancer to the patient.
 Our Solution
 We developed MRIdian to address the key limitations of existing external-beam radiation therapy technologies. MRIdian employs MRI-based technology to provide real-time imaging that clearly defines the targeted tumor from the surrounding soft tissue and other critical organs, both before and during radiation treatment delivery. MRIdian also allows physicians to record the level of radiation exposure that the tumor has received and adapt the prescription between treatment fractions as needed. We believe this combination of enhanced visualization and accurate dose recording will significantly improve the safety and efficacy of radiation therapy, leading to better outcomes for patients suffering from cancer. 
 We believe that MRIdian provides the following clinical and commercial benefits to physicians, hospitals and patients:
  
• | Improved tumor visibility and patient alignment. The soft-tissue contrast of MRIdian’s on-board MRI enables clinicians to locate, target and track the tumor and healthy tissues and more accurately align a patient to the treatment beams without the use of X-ray, CT or surrogate registration markers. If the clinician prefers, the software has the ability to map the patient’s soft tissue anatomy each treatment session in less than one minute, and clinicians can use that information to align the patient.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | On-table adaptive planning. Due to changes in tumor shape or the patient’s internal anatomy, the clinician may be unable to obtain an optimal setup of the target location during image-guidance using CT-based systems while a patient is on the treatment table. Further, a nearby organ at risk for radiation damage may be exposed to higher radiation doses than anticipated. Using an MR image captured at the beginning of each therapy session, MRIdian software enables clinicians to map each patient’s soft tissue anatomy in 3D. The software also allows for the calculation of the dose that would be delivered to the radiation target and organs at risk using the current treatment plan. If the predicted radiation exposure is not clinically acceptable to the physician, the system provides software tools for tumor and organ at risk re-contouring based on the setup MR-images. The MRIdian system also provides the ability to recalculate the intended radiation dose and adapt the plan to the changed tumor shape or location, and overall anatomy for the respective day of treatment. Utilizing our proprietary algorithm and software, adaptive re-planning can be done with the patient still “on table”. Also, integral to the adaptive planning process are quality assurance protocols, or QA, to enhance the safety of adapted radiation dose delivery. Users in the United States are currently generally reimbursed for the additional time and effort spent by their physicians, medical physicists, dosimetrists and therapists for on-table adaptive planning. When medically necessary, we believe hospitals and physicians will continue to receive additional reimbursement when they perform adaptive radiation therapy. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Ability to track tumors and manage patient motion. MRIdian can capture dedicated or multiple soft-tissue imaging planes concurrently during the radiation treatment delivery, refreshing the image multiple times per second. This real-time imaging enables physicians to see, watch and track the movement of the tumor and its surrounding healthy tissue directly; they do not need to rely on proxies such as registration markers, existing bones or surgically implanted fiducials. If a tumor or critical organ moves beyond a physician’s defined boundary or allowable range of motion (as individually defined in our dedicated tracking and gating software), MRIdian will automatically detect this and pause the treatment beam. This automatic beam control becomes especially important in the situations where a tumor may be in close proximity to a critical organ, such as the heart during lung and breast cancer treatments, or the rectum during prostate cancer treatments. This ability to actually see the tumor location continuously throughout radiation delivery has enabled physicians to treat patients with greater confidence, including patients who would not have been given radiation therapy for their cancers previously.

• | Record and evaluate the delivered dose. Using our proprietary algorithm and advanced MR imaging, MRIdian calculates the dose delivered after each treatment, enabling the physician to review and re-optimize the patient’s treatment session, if needed. In addition, MRIdian can utilize diagnostic CT images that are fused with the MR images at each treatment in order to more accurately calculate dose. MRIdian also captures and records a video, known as a MRIdian Movie™, of the delivered treatments, which can be evaluated by the physician or shared with patients.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Fits into existing treatment paradigms and workflow. MRIdian can treat a broad spectrum of radiation therapy indications and disease sites, because it can perform 3D-CRT, IMRT, IGRT, SBRT and SRS. MRIdian treatments are supported by existing radiation therapy reimbursement codes. In addition, MRIdian fits inside most standard radiation therapy vaults without the need for significant construction costs such as wall or ceiling removal to enable it to be placed inside. In addition, we believe MRIdian’s increased tumor target accuracy will allow physicians to treat patients with higher radiation doses over fewer treatment fractions; this potentially enables the clinic to treat more patients each day and with greater overall efficiency, or patient throughput. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We believe the ability to image with MRI and treat cancer patients with radiation simultaneously will lead to improved patient outcomes.
 Our Strategy
 Our objective is to make MRI-guided radiation delivery the standard of care for radiation therapy. To achieve this goal, we intend to do the following:
  
• | Invest in Commercialization of the MRIdian Linac. The public response to the clinical release of the second generation MRIdian Linac has been positive as it builds upon and improves the capabilities of the first generation MRIdian. We believe the MRIdian Linac has the potential to broaden our addressable market, accelerate our sales cycle, reduce our backlog conversion time and improve our gross margins. We intend to: 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Broaden awareness of MRIdian’s capabilities and clinical benefits to expand our share of the radiation therapy market. We intend to continue to educate radiation oncologists, medical physicists and radiation oncology administrators about the capabilities and resulting benefits of MRIdian over traditional radiation therapy systems. In order to drive awareness and adoption, we also intend to support the publication of clinical and scientific data and analysis, work with key opinion leaders, present at leading academic conferences and engage in outreach at leading hospitals worldwide. We also plan to leverage our existing customer network as a reference for new potential users to experience our technology in-use in the clinical setting.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Target top-tier hospitals in initial global sales efforts, followed by their community practice networks. We intend to market MRIdian to a broad range of customers worldwide, including university research and teaching hospitals, private practices, community hospitals, government institutions and freestanding cancer centers. We are focusing initially on the leading hospitals worldwide which are typically early adopters of best-in-class technology, such as MRIdian, and are able to influence and promote adoption by other centers both locally and globally. We plan to continue to work with these institutions to promote broader market awareness of the benefits of MRI-guided radiation therapy and then expand into the community practice networks that many of these leading centers have developed.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Commercialize MRIdian with a targeted sales force in the United States and through a sales force-assisted distribution network in international markets. We market MRIdian through a combination of direct sales and distributors. We are expanding our sales force for the United States and Canada and are developing a sales force to assist distributors in international markets. We intend to continue to expand our presence in key markets to capitalize on the growing international opportunity for MRIdian.

 At the inaugural meeting of the C2T2 on September 23, 2017, participants formalized the group's first key initiative – a multi-center, prospective, single-arm clinical trial focused on locally advanced unresectable pancreatic cancer. Pancreatic cancer presents considerable radiation targeting challenges given the known limitations of conventional CT image guidance. The novel abilities provided by live MRI guidance combined with daily online treatment adaptation have enabled a new approach in pancreatic cancer therapy. Through this trial the group looks to explore new opportunities to improve survival and quality of life for this deadly disease.
  
• | Maintain our competitive lead in MRI-guided radiation therapy through continued innovation. We plan to continue to invest in our technology to maintain our leadership position in the emerging MRI-guided radiation therapy market. We intend to develop and introduce enhancements to the system and software to provide improved capabilities for MRIdian users and patients. In addition, we plan to explore potential benefits of integrating our MRI technology with alternative beam technologies. We believe we have a strong intellectual property portfolio that covers the MRIdian, as well as its critical design elements and key aspects of its subsystem and components.

The MRIdian System
 The MRIdian is comprised of four major components, (i) the MRI system, (ii) the radiation delivery system, (iii) integrated treatment planning and delivery software and (iv) a safety and control system.
 
 
MRIdian Cobalt-60 | MRIdian Linac

 MRI System
 The MRI system is the component of MRIdian that captures soft tissue images of the patient’s body. To address the technical complications that arise from combining an MRI with an external-beam radiation delivery unit, we have designed a proprietary split superconducting magnet that will allow radiation doses to be delivered through a central gap, which eliminates MRI components from the path of the beam. Our MRI system captures and displays live, high-quality images in one plane, four times per second or in three planes, two times per second. These real-time images automatically track selected structures and control radiation treatment beam delivery.
 We have engineered our MRI system to be able to produce clear images using a mid-field strength 0.35 Tesla magnet, which enables us to avoid image and radiation dose distortions that result when higher field strength magnets are used. In addition, MRIdian’s 0.35 Tesla field strength prevents over-heating of the patient during uninterrupted imaging, which could occur when a higher field strength magnet is used for fast imaging during radiation delivery.  Over-heating can require interruption or termination of the imaging or of the overall treatment.

MRI System
 
MRIdian Radiation Delivery System
 In the first-generation MRIdian, radiation is delivered from three Cobalt-60 radiation therapy heads symmetrically mounted on a rotating ring gantry, providing full 360-degree coverage and simultaneous dose delivery. Each head is equipped with a double-focused multi-leaf collimator designed to overcome the wide-beam edge of previous-generation Cobalt-60 systems and to shape the beam for precision radiation therapy treatments. It allows the delivery of treatment plans for 3D-CRT, IMRT and SBRT that are clinically equivalent to those produced on the most advanced linear accelerators available today. Stereotactic procedures are possible with a positioning accuracy of less than one millimeter. Cobalt-60 was used in the first-generation devices because it does not create any radio frequency, which interferes with the MRI.
MRIdian Linear Accelerator Technology Radiation Delivery System
 In the second generation MRIdian Linac, we developed solutions to two long-standing problems that had prevented compact integration of a linac beam with an MRI system: 1) linac radiofrequency interference with the operation of the MRI; and 2) MRI magnetic interference with the operation of the linac.  First, linacs utilize high-powered microwave generators similar to equipment used in radar at airports.  These “radar stations” inside the linac create radiofrequency emissions, or “noise” that can corrupt the delicate signals measured from the patient’s body to generate MR images.  ViewRay solved this problem by introducing technology similar to that used in stealth aircraft.  Airplanes built with stealth technology can hide from radar by using a coating that absorbs microwaves, thus preventing radar beams that strike the aircraft from bouncing back to the radar station.  In a similar manner, we absorb the output of the linac “radar station” to hide it from the MRI, producing images as noise-free as those created without an integrated linac.  
 Second, MRIs utilize high-powered superconducting magnets required to image the patient’s tissues that must be placed close to the linac components used for radiation therapy.  But many linac components will not operate properly when placed close to or inside these strong magnetic fields. ViewRay overcame this challenge by creating magnetic shielding shells that create voids in the magnetic field, without significantly disturbing the magnetic field used for imaging.  This allows the linac to operate on the MRIdian gantry as if there were no magnetic field present. MRIdian Linac uses the same split-magnet MRI system used in the first generation MRIdian system.  It is specifically designed to fit in standard radiotherapy vaults so that customers do not need to build new vaults in order to replace an X-ray guided linear accelerator with a MRIdian. Existing MRIdian systems currently in use can be upgraded to the MRIdian Linac in the field.
 Both MRIdian and MRIdian Linac can provide continuous MR based soft-tissue imaging during radiation beam delivery.  Being able to constantly see both the tumor and surrounding organs means physicians can accurately align the tumor to the treatment beams, adapt or reshape the treatment volume to accommodate changes in the shape and 
 
17


location of the tumor and healthy tissues, and track soft tissues in real time to avoid missing a moving tumor or irradiating sensitive internal structures.
 Integrated Treatment Planning and Delivery Software
 Our proprietary treatment planning and delivery software can create treatment plans and manage the treatment delivery process. It is designed to create optimized 3D-CRT, IMRT, IGRT, SBRT and SRS plans for delivery by MRIdian. Using this software, the on-table adaptive planning process typically takes fifteen additional minutes on average, depending on the treatment plan and includes: auto-contouring, dose prediction and adaptive treatment plan optimization. For contouring, the software will automatically contour the outline of the tumor and nearby organs by matching the MR images with the images used in the original treatment plan. The physician will then make refinements as necessary. Dose prediction can be calculated immediately before treatment, allowing the current state of the patient’s anatomy to be taken into account. If dose parameters for the radiation target or organs at risk no longer meet goals or safety criteria, the software can then generate an optimized adaptive treatment plan, while the patient is on the treatment table. Following physician review and approval, as well as medical physics quality assurance assessment, the adapted plan can be delivered to provide a more accurate treatment.
 Independent of the ability to create an adapted treatment plan, the MRIdian system has the ability to use a soft-tissue tracking beam to control or “gate” the radiation beam, by turning it on and off. While the radiation dose is being delivered, our software analyzes images of the patient’s tumor and surrounding anatomy; it can use them to determine tumor or organ location relative to tolerances set by the physician. If the targeted tumor or a critical organ moves beyond a physician-defined boundary, the treatment beams will automatically pause. When the tumor moves back into the target zone, the treatment will automatically resume. Physicians can set both spatial and time thresholds for pausing radiation beam delivery. This enables the system to account for tumor and patient motion during treatment.
 The software archives all the information generated during treatment and builds a database of patient-specific planning, delivery and imaging data. It also includes a review tool which provides clinicians with a visual comparison of the delivered treatment versus the treatment as originally planned. At the end of each treatment, the software determines the delivered dose by combining the recorded actions of the radiation delivery system with the daily image and auto-contouring of the patient. With this information, clinicians can fine-tune prescriptions based on the actual dose delivered, rather than estimates. In addition, it provides a MRIdian Movie™ of each delivered treatment, which can be evaluated by the physician or exported and then shared with the patients or their families. 
 Safety and Control System for MRIdian with Cobalt-60 
 In addition to complying with the applicable FDA and Nuclear Regulatory Commission, or NRC, requirements, the Cobalt-60 radiation delivery subsystem also meets a double fault tolerant design standard and has redundant safety systems. If any two components in the Cobalt-60 radiation delivery subsystem fail simultaneously, such as power and pneumatics, the system reverts to a safe state. MRIdian also contains redundant computer control for safety and system logging and double encoders on all axes of motion for safety. The control system continuously monitors performance to ensure systems are performing and communicating appropriately.
 Installed Base and Clinical Use
 At December 31, 2017, we had installed six units at five leading cancer centers in the United States and installed five units outside the United States. One MRIdian with Cobalt-60 has been delivered and is expected to be installed in early 2018 at Edogawa Hospital in Japan. Three MRIdian Linacs have been delivered and are expected to be installed in 2018 at hospitals in Israel, Korea and China.
 In January 2014, Washington University in St. Louis, a National Cancer Institute Designated Comprehensive Cancer Center, became the first center to treat patients with MRIdian with Cobalt-60. Washington University in St. Louis has since scaled up its use of MRIdian in its clinical practice. In September 2014, Washington University in St. Louis used MRIdian to perform the first on-table adaptive treatments as part of an ongoing clinical service. Also, in September 2014, the University of Wisconsin–Madison treated its first patients with MRIdian with Cobalt-60 and became the first center to employ the soft-tissue tracking and beam gating control capability unique to MRIdian. In 
 
18


July 2017, Henry Ford Health System in Detroit treated the first cancer patients using the second generation MRIdian Linac. We are working with each of these centers to determine how best to refine and improve MRIdian’s features, optimize workflow and maximize patient throughput.
 As of December 31, 2017, over 2,000 patients with over 3000 on-table adapted fractions have been treated by MRIdian systems. These included cancers of the prostate, breast, lung, colorectal and bladder, which are among the most prevalent types of cancer in the United States, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, or CDC.  MRIdian has also been used to treat liver, stomach, esophagus and pancreatic cancer.
 New Orders and Backlog
 New orders are defined as the sum of gross product orders, representing MRIdian contract price, recorded during the period. Backlog is the accumulation of all orders for which revenue has not been recognized and which we consider valid. Backlog includes customer deposits or letters of credit, except when the sale is to a customer where a deposit is not deemed necessary or customary. Deposits received are recorded as a liability on the balance sheet. Orders may be revised or cancelled according to their terms or upon mutual agreement between the parties. Therefore, it is difficult to predict with certainty the amount of backlog that will ultimately result in revenue. The determination of backlog includes objective and subjective judgment about the likelihood of an order contract becoming revenue. We perform a quarterly review of backlog to verify that outstanding orders in backlog remain valid, and based upon this review, orders that are no longer expected to result in revenue are removed from backlog. Among other criteria we use to determine whether a transaction to be in backlog, we must possess both an outstanding and effective written agreement for the delivery of a MRIdian signed by a customer with a minimum customer deposit or a letter of credit requirement, except when the sale is to a customer where a deposit is not deemed necessary or customary (i.e. sale to a government entity, a large hospital, group of hospitals or cancer care group that has sufficient credit, sales via tender awards, or indirect channel sales that have signed contracts with end-customers). We decide whether to remove an order from our backlog by evaluating the following criteria: changes in customer or distributor plans or financial conditions; the customer’s or distributor’s continued intent and ability to fulfill the order contract; changes to regulatory requirements; the status of regulatory approval required in the customer’s jurisdiction, if any; and other reasons for potential cancellation of order contracts.
 We received new orders for MRIdian systems, totaling $113.6 million, $77.0 million and $40.1 million for fiscal years 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. We have two cancellations for fiscal year 2017. At December 31, 2017, we had a backlog with a total value of $203.6 million. There can be no assurance that backlog will result in revenue in any particular time period or at all.
 Installation Process
 Following execution of a contract, it generally takes nine to 12 months for a customer to prepare an existing facility or construct a new vault, although in some cases customers may request installation for a date later in the future to meet their own clinical or business requirements. After the customer completes its vault customization, it typically takes approximately ninety days to complete the installation and on-site testing of the system, including the completion of acceptance test procedures. MRIdian is designed to fit into a typical radiation therapy vault, similar to other replacement linear accelerators. MRIdian’s components all fit through standard hospital vault entrances for assembly. On-site training takes approximately one week and can be conducted concurrent with installation and acceptance testing.
 Our customers are responsible for removing any outgoing linear accelerator and preparing the mounting pad, power and support system connections. Additional room modifications required are consistent with those generally required for MRI systems, such as radio frequency shielding of the room and additional power.
 Clinical Development
 To date, we have primarily relied on clinical symposia and case studies presented at ASTRO and the European Society for Radiotherapy and Oncology, or ESTRO, to raise awareness of MRI-guided radiation therapy and to market MRIdian to leading cancer centers. In order to promote broader adoption rates at other cancer centers and 
 
19


hospitals, we plan to work with our customers to collect and publish data on clinical efficacy, treatment times and clinical results for patients who have been treated on a MRIdian. Outcomes data presented at the 2017 Annual Meeting of ASTRO highlighted compelling early results using the Company's MRIdian system for the treatment of inoperable, locally advanced pancreatic cancer. These early clinical data suggested nearly 2X prolonged median survival with reduced toxicity for inoperable, locally advanced pancreatic cancer. These results will be tested in a multi-center, prospective, single-arm clinical trial for inoperable, locally advanced or borderline resectable pancreatic cancer. The trial will be conducted by ViewRay's Clinical Cooperative Think Tank (C2T2), a group of MRIdian medical institutions focused on evidence gathering to support MRI-guided radiation therapy. Additionally, Washington University has published a prospective study on Magnetic Resonance Image Guided Radiation Therapy for External Beam Accelerated Partial-Breast Irradiation using a one-week course of treatment. This study demonstrated that on-board MR image-guidance allowed for a greater than 50% reduction of margins while maintaining the same dose to the tumor with patients reporting 100% Excellent/Good Cosmesis. 
 While we do not currently have statistically significant, prospective evidence that MRIdian improves patient outcomes or decreases healthcare costs relative to CT-based radiotherapy, we believe supporting studies will demonstrate the benefits of MRI-guided radiation therapy and adaptive treatment planning. As data accumulate from the use of MRIdian, we plan to work with professional healthcare organizations to support further global marketing efforts, additional product clearances, approvals and/or registrations and potential improvements in reimbursement.
 Selling and Marketing
 We currently market MRIdian through a direct sales force in the United States and Canada and are developing a sales force to assist distributors in the rest of the world. We market MRIdian to a broad range of worldwide customers, including university research and teaching hospitals, community hospitals, private practices, government institutions and freestanding cancer centers. As with the traditional linac market, our sales and revenue cycle varies based on the particular customer and can be lengthy, sometimes lasting up to 18 to 24 months (or more) from initial customer contact to order contract execution.
 To sell MRIdian globally, we use a combination of sales executives, sales directors and a network of international third-party distributors with internal support from sales operations, product management and application specialists. A targeted group of eight senior sales directors are responsible for selling MRIdian within the United States and Canada. Our product management function helps market MRIdian and works with our engineering group to identify and develop upgrades and enhancements. We also have a team of application specialists who provide post-sales support.
 We engage in various physician-targeted advertising efforts, and our selling and marketing practices include participating in trade shows and symposia.
 Competition
 We compete directly with companies marketing IGRT devices for the treatment of cancer using CT, ultrasound, optical tracking and X-ray imaging. We also compete with companies developing next-generation IGRT devices, specifically those developing MRI-guided devices, amongst others. We expect the following to drive worldwide competitive market dynamics: technological advances, including the ability to provide real-time imaging; clinical outcomes; system size, price, and operational complexity; and operational efficiency.
 Our major competitors with devices approved for distribution in the United States or globally include Varian Medical Systems, Inc., or Varian, Elekta AB, or Elekta, and Accuray Incorporated, or Accuray. Many of our direct competitors have greater financial, sales and marketing, service infrastructure and research and development capabilities than we do, as well as more established reputations and current market share. The main limitations of currently approved devices are the lack of real-time, clear images before and during the treatment, as well as the ability to perform on-table adaptive planning.
 We are also aware of one commercial and two academic ongoing research efforts to develop radiation therapy systems incorporating MRI.  Elekta and Royal Philips have formed a consortium to develop a commercial Elekta-Philips MRI-linac. The University of Sydney, Ingham Institute and the University of Queensland have formed a 
 
20


partnership to develop an MRI-linac and the University of Alberta’s Cross Cancer Institute is working on a MRI-linac as well. Although these academic research centers may not compete directly with us commercially, if they were to form a partnership or other relationship with one of our competitors, it could impact our sales negatively. Of these three, we believe the Elekta-Philips MRI-linac is the most advanced in development, although we believe this combined system may not be commercially available for some time because it has not been cleared or approved by regulatory authorities for patient treatments anywhere in the world.  MRIdian is the first and only commercially available MRI-guided radiation therapy device to image and treat cancer patients simultaneously.
 The limited capital expenditure budgets of our customers result in all suppliers to these entities competing for a limited pool of funds. Our customers may be required to select between two items of capital equipment. For example, some of our potential customers are considering expensive proton therapy systems, which could consume a significant portion of their capital expenditure budgets.
 Manufacturing
 We have adopted a model in which we rely on subsystem manufacturing, assembly and testing by our key suppliers. The MRIdian subsystems are then fully integrated at the customer site. Through this approach, we avoid the majority of the fixed cost structure of manufacturing facilities. We purchase major components and subsystems for MRIdian from national and international third-party original equipment manufacturers, or OEM, suppliers and contract manufacturers. These major components include the magnet, MRI electronics, ring gantry, radiation therapy heads, Cobalt-60 sources, linear accelerator, multi-leaf collimators, patient-treatment table and computers. We also purchase minor components and parts directly ourselves. For sales for which we are responsible for installation, we assemble and integrate these components with our proprietary software and perform multiple levels of testing and qualification at the customer site. The system undergoes a final acceptance test, which is performed in conjunction with the customer.
 Many of the major subsystems and components of MRIdian are currently procured through single and sole source suppliers. Among these are the magnet, MRI electronics, MRI coils, ring gantry, Cobalt-60 sources, linear accelerator and the patient-treatment table. We have entered into multi-year supply agreements for most of our major components and subsystems. Except for the MRI power, control and image reconstruction subsystem, we own the design of all other major subsystems and components.
 We manage our supplier relationships with scheduled business reviews and periodic program updates. We closely monitor supplier quality and delivery performance to ensure compliance with all MRIdian system specifications. We believe our supply chain has adequate capacity to meet our projected sales over the next several years.
 Intellectual Property
 The proprietary nature of, and protection for, MRIdian components, new technologies, processes and know-how are important to our business. Our policy is to seek patent protection in the United States and in certain foreign jurisdictions for our MRIdian systems and other technology where available and when appropriate. We also in-license technology, inventions and improvements we consider important to the development of our business.
 We hold a license to four issued U.S. patents, 19 issued foreign patents (eight of which were issued in Great Britain, Germany, France and the Netherlands as a result of two patent applications filed and allowed through the European Patent Office), one pending U.S. application and five pending foreign applications as of January 15, 2018. We own an additional 20 issued U.S. patents, 36 issued foreign patents (13 of which were issued in Great Britain, Germany, France, Italy and the Netherlands as a result of three patent applications filed and allowed through the European Patent Office), 24 pending U.S. applications and 85 pending foreign applications as of January 15, 2018. Assuming all required fees are paid, individual patents or patent applications owned or licensed by us will expire between 2021 and 2037. We also have a joint ownership interest with Case Western Reserve University in one issued patent and one U.S. application.
 Our portfolio includes patents and patent applications directed to system-wide aspects of MRIdian and to key aspects of its subsystems and components. The initial licensed patents for our core technology broadly cover the 
 
21


simultaneous use of MR imaging and isotopic external-beam radiation therapy. These patents have been granted in the United States, Europe, Hong Kong, Australia, China and Japan, and additional related patent applications remain pending in Canada, the United States, Australia and Japan. We have issued U.S. and foreign patents and pending continuation applications of the licensed patents that extend this core technology to alternate beam technologies. Additionally, we have patents and patent applications that cover critical design elements including, among others, our approach to Cobalt IMRT, our methods for integrating MRI with the radiation delivery system, and the design of our disassemblable, or “pop apart,” magnet which enables the MRI sub-system to fit into most standard radiation therapy vaults. The U.S. patent application on our approach to Cobalt IMRT has been issued, the patent application on our split gradient coil has been issued in the United States, Japan, Australia and China and numerous applications on other design elements are pending in the United States and foreign jurisdictions. In addition, we have U.S., Chinese, European and Australian patents and U.S. and foreign patent applications that cover the use of MR- imaging at a frequency sufficient to account for real-time organ motion to provide video-rate tissue tracking in disciplines outside of radiation therapy. Many of the patents and applications in our portfolio covering aspects of the MRIdian with Cobalt-60 system also cover the MRIdian Linac. In addition, we have patents issued in the U.S., Europe, Australia, Japan and China, and additional applications pending in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions, specifically directed to technology enabling the MRIdian Linac combination of MRI and linear accelerator technology.  
 We continue to review new technological developments in our system and in the field as a whole, in order to make decisions about what filings would be most appropriate for us. An additional key component of our intellectual property is our proprietary software used in planning and delivering MRIdian’s therapeutic radiation dose.
 In December 2004, we entered into a licensing agreement with the University of Florida Research Foundation, Inc., or UFRF, whereby UFRF granted us a worldwide exclusive license to certain of UFRF’s patents in exchange for 33,653 shares of common stock and a royalty from sales of products developed and sold by us utilizing the licensed patents. We were obligated to meet certain product development and commercialization milestones by various dates through December 31, 2014. The significant milestones met prior to December 31, 2013 included: (i) completion of a business plan and Small Business Technology Transfer grant application; (ii) securing a minimum of $20.0 million venture financing; (iii) successful relocation and build out of our headquarters; (iv) receipt of the first magnet from an OEM partner; (v) hiring of a chief executive officer with industry experience in developing and commercializing similar products; and (vi) filing for FDA approval. The final milestone, which required us to recognize the first commercial sale of the MRIdian system to retail customers by December 31, 2014, was met during the year ended December 31, 2013. If these milestones had not been accomplished, UFRF would have had the right to terminate the licensing agreement. Royalty payments are based on 1% of net sales, defined as the amount collected on sales of licensed products and/or licensed processes after deducting trade and/or quantity discounts, credits on returns and allowances, outbound transportation costs paid and sales tax. Minimum quarterly royalty payments of $50,000 commenced with the quarter ended March 31, 2014 and are payable in advance. Minimum royalties paid in any calendar year will be credited against earned royalties for that calendar year. The royalty payments continue until the earlier of (i) the date that no licensed patents remain enforceable; or (ii) the payment of earned royalties, once begun in 2014, cease for more than four consecutive calendar quarters.
 In addition to our patents, we also rely upon trade secrets, know-how, trademarks, copyright protection and continuing technological and licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our competitive position. We have periodically monitored and continue to monitor the activities of our competitors and other third parties with respect to their use of intellectual property. We require our employees, consultants and outside scientific collaborators to execute confidentiality and invention assignment agreements upon commencing employment or consulting relationships with us. Despite these safeguards, any of our know-how or trade secrets not protected by a patent could be disclosed to, or independently developed by, a competitor.
 Coverage and Reimbursement
 We believe that reimbursement rates in the United States have generally supported a favorable return on investment for the purchase of new radiotherapy equipment, including MRIdian. Payments for standard radiation therapy treatments using MRIdian, including 3D-CRT, IMRT and SBRT, are generally covered and reimbursed under existing Current Procedural Terminology, or CPT, codes and coverage policies currently in place. User experience 
 
22


to date indicates that our initial customers have treated a wide spectrum of different patients and treatment modalities using MRIdian. Physicians use the MRIdian system’s on-board MRI for distinct procedures which can be billed by physicians using existing CPT codes, including: complex simulation weekly IMRT or daily for SBRT; special physics consult; and adaptive re-planning. Each of these are distinct procedures which can be billed by physicians using existing CPT codes, so long as these procedures are reimbursed, so long as they meet medical necessity and other documentation and coverage criteria established by government or other third-party payors.
 Third-party payors, including governmental healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid, establish coverage policies and reimbursement rates for diagnostic examinations and therapeutic procedures performed by physicians in hospitals and free-standing clinics. Private insurers often model their payment rates and coverage policies based on those established by the government. The U.S. Congress from time to time considers various Medicare and other healthcare reform proposals that could affect both private and public third-party payor coverage and reimbursement for healthcare services provided in hospitals and clinics. In addition, third-party payors regularly update reimbursement amounts, including annual updates to payments to physicians, hospitals and clinics for medical procedures, including radiation treatments using MRIdian.
 By way of example, the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015, or MACRA, ended the use of the statutory formula, and provided for a 0.5% annual increase in payment rates under the Medicare Physician Fee Schedule through 2019, but with no annual update from 2020 through 2025. MACRA also introduced a quality payment program under which individual providers with Medicare billings of $30,000 or 100 patient visits per year will be subject to certain incentives or penalties based on new program quality standards.  The quality payment program has two tracks, one known as the “merit-based incentive payment system” for providers in the fee-for service Medicare program, and the advanced alternative payment model for providers in specific care models, such as accountable care organizations.  Payment adjustments for the Medicare quality payment program will begin in 2019.
 The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, also publishes annual updates to the hospital outpatient prospective payment system, or HOPPS. These payments are bundled amounts received by our hospital customers for hospital outpatient services, including conventional radiation therapy and IMRT, which may result in lower reimbursement to our customers for procedures performed using MRIdian.
 We plan to work with our customers to collect and publish data on clinical results for patients who have undergone procedures on MRIdian. We will support a multi-center, prospective, single-arm clinical trial for inoperable, locally advanced or borderline resectable pancreatic cancer. We plan to continue to support this and further studies to demonstrate the benefits of MRI-guided radiation therapy and adaptive treatment planning. As data accumulate from the use of our system, we plan to work with professional healthcare organizations to further support global marketing efforts, additional product clearances, approvals and/or registrations and potential improvements in reimbursement. Additionally, we currently provide reimbursement support to our customers through a third-party vendor.
 Foreign Reimbursement Regulations
 Internationally, reimbursement and healthcare payment systems vary from country to country and include single-payor, and government managed systems as well as systems in which private payors and government-managed systems exist side-by-side. In general, the process of obtaining coverage approvals is slower outside of the United States. Our ability to achieve adoption of MRIdian, as well as significant sales volume in international markets we enter will depend in part on the availability of reimbursement for procedures performed using MRIdian.
 Research and Development  
 Continued innovation and development of advanced technologies is critical to our goal of making MRI-guided radiation therapy the standard of care for cancer treatment. Our current development activities include improvements in and expansion of product capabilities, continued clinical workflow refinements, design improvements to reduce system costs and improvements in reliability.

The modular design of MRIdian enables the development of new capabilities and performance enhancements by generally allowing each subsystem to evolve within the overall platform design. Access to regular MRIdian upgrades protects customer investment in MRIdian and facilitates the adoption of new features and capabilities among existing installed base customers. 
 In March 2016, we announced the development of a linear accelerator version of our MRIdian technology. This technology has been used to treat patients at Henry Ford Hospital in Detroit since July 2017 and is being readied for treatment in several other sites. Significant technology incorporated into the MRIdian Linac includes radio frequency “cloaking” technology to preserve the integrity of the MR image quality in the presence of radio frequencies emitted by the linear accelerator, magnetic shielding technology to enable undistorted delivery of radiation, double- focused multi-leaf collimator technology for the delivery of sharp radiation beams and incorporation of the existing MRIdian proprietary “pop-apart” magnet design.  
 We have designed the linac technology such that our MRIdian with Cobalt-60 systems are able to be modified to incorporate the linac technology. In September 2016, we received CE mark approval in the European Union, and in February 2017, we received 510(k) clearance from the FDA to market the MRIdian Linac system in the United States. MRIdian Linac is now commercially available in the key markets of the EU and the United States.
 We believe the MRIdian Linac will broaden our addressable market, accelerate our sales cycle, reduce our backlog conversion time and improve our gross margins.
 In addition, we believe our existing and expanding IP portfolio will enable us to continuously develop innovative technologies to further strengthen the differentiation of MRIdian in the marketplace. Magnetic resonance imaging is a powerful and versatile measurement technique and is widely used throughout radiology and medicine because of its ability to generate information about tissues and disease states.
 At December 31, 2017, we had a total of 41 employees in our research and development departments. Research and development expenses were $14.7 million, $11.4 million and $10.4 million during the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. We plan to continue to increase our investment in research and development in future periods.
 Government Regulation
 U.S. Medical Device Regulation and Nuclear Materials Regulation
 As a manufacturer and seller of medical devices and devices that deliver radiation, we and some of our suppliers and distributors are subject to extensive and rigorous regulation by the FDA, the NRC, other federal, state and local authorities in the United States and foreign regulatory authorities. Regulations promulgated by the FDA relating to medical devices and radiation-producing devices govern, among other things, the following activities that we perform or that are performed on our behalf, and that we will continue to perform or have performed on our behalf:
  
• | product design, development and testing;
--+-----------------------------------------


• | manufacturing;

--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 FDA Clearance and Approval of Medical Devices
 The FDA regulates the research, testing, manufacturing, safety, labeling, storage, recordkeeping, promotion, distribution, and production of medical devices in the United States to ensure that medical products distributed domestically are safe and effective for their intended uses. Unless an exemption applies, the FDA requires that all new medical devices and all marketed medical devices that have been significantly changed, or that will be marketed with a new indication for use, obtain either clearance via a 510(k) pre-market notification or approval via a Premarket Approval, or PMA, application before the manufacturer may commercially distribute the product in the United States. The type of marketing authorization necessary is generally linked to the classification of the device. The FDA classifies medical devices into one of three classes. Devices deemed to pose the lowest risk are placed in Class I, and most Class I devices are exempt from premarket notification requirements. Class I devices are those for which safety and effectiveness can be reasonably assured by adherence to a set of regulations referred to as General Controls, which require compliance with the applicable portions of the FDA’s Quality System Regulation, or QSR, and regulations regarding facility registration and product listing, reporting of adverse events and malfunctions, and appropriate, truthful and non-misleading labeling and promotional materials. However, some Class I devices, called Class I reserved devices, also require premarket clearance by the FDA through the 510(k) premarket notification process described below.
 Moderate risk devices are placed in Class II and are subject to General Controls as well as Special Controls, which can include performance standards, guidelines and post-market surveillance. Most Class II devices are subject to premarket review and clearance by the FDA pursuant to Section 510(k) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA.
 Devices deemed by the FDA to pose the greatest risk, such as life-sustaining, life-supporting or implantable devices, or devices deemed not substantially equivalent to a previously cleared 510(k) devices are placed in Class III. Class III devices require FDA approval of a PMA prior to marketing.
 Both generations of the MRIdian System have been classified as Class II medical devices subject to the 510(k) clearance process. 
 510(k) clearance process. Most Class II devices are subject to premarket review and clearance by the FDA. Premarket review and clearance by the FDA for Class II devices is accomplished through the 510(k) premarket notification process. Under the 510(k) process, the manufacturer must submit to the FDA a premarket notification, demonstrating that the device is “substantially equivalent” to either
  
• | a device that was legally marketed prior to May 28, 1976, the date upon which the Medical Device Amendments of 1976 were enacted; or
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | another commercially available, similar device that was cleared through the 510(k) process.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 To be “substantially equivalent,” the proposed device must have the same intended use as the predicate device and either have the same technological characteristics as the predicate device or have different technological characteristics and not raise different questions of safety or effectiveness than the predicate device. Clinical data are sometimes required to support substantial equivalence.
 The process of obtaining 510(k) clearance usually takes from three to 12 months from the date the application is filed and generally requires submitting supporting design and test data, which can be extensive and can prolong the process for a considerable period of time. If the FDA agrees that the device is substantially equivalent, it will grant clearance to commercially market the device. We received 510(k) clearances for the treatment planning and delivery software system in January 2011 and for MRIdian in May 2012.
 After a device receives 510(k) clearance, any modification that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a new or major change in the intended use of the device, may require a new 510(k) 
 
25


clearance or, depending on the modification, could require approval of a PMA. The FDA requires each manufacturer to make this determination in the first instance, but the FDA can review any such decision. If the FDA disagrees with the manufacturer’s decision, it may retroactively require the manufacturer to submit a request for 510(k) clearance or PMA approval and can require the manufacturer to cease marketing and/or recall the product until 510(k) clearance or PMA approval is obtained. Since obtaining 510(k) clearances in 2011 and 2012, we have made changes to MRIdian that we believe do not require new 510(k) clearance.
 In the fall of 2016, we submitted an application for 510(k) clearance by the FDA for MRIdian Linac, and in February 2017, we received 510(k) clearance from the FDA to market the MRIdian Linac system.  An additional 510(k) clearance application for a modification of the MRIdian Linac system was submitted in March 2017, and we received 510(k) clearance from the FDA for that modification in June 2017.
 Premarket application approval process. Submission and approval of a PMA is required before marketing of a Class III product may proceed. Under the PMA application process, the applicant must generally conduct at least one clinical investigation and submit extensive data and clinical information demonstrating reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of the device for its intended use to the FDA’s satisfaction. Accordingly, a PMA application typically includes, but is not limited to, extensive technical information regarding device design and development, pre-clinical and clinical trial data, manufacturing information, labeling and financial disclosure information for the clinical investigators in device studies. The PMA process is much more demanding than the 510(k) premarket notification process.
 Following receipt of a PMA application, the FDA conducts an administrative review to determine whether the application is sufficiently complete to permit a substantive review. If it is not, the agency will refuse to file the PMA. If it is, the FDA will accept the application for filing and begin the review. The FDA, by statute and by regulation, has 180 days to review a filed PMA application, although the review of an application more often occurs over a significantly longer period of time. During this review period, the FDA may request additional information or clarification of information already provided, and the FDA may issue a major deficiency letter to the applicant, requesting the applicant’s response to deficiencies communicated by the FDA. Before approving or denying a PMA, an FDA advisory committee may review the PMA at a public meeting and provide the FDA with the committee’s recommendation on whether the FDA should approve the submission, approve it with specific conditions, or not approve it. Overall, the PMA application process typically takes between one to three years, but may take significantly longer. The FDA may approve a PMA application with post-approval conditions intended to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device including, among other things, restrictions on labeling, user training requirements, restrictions on promotion, sale and distribution, and requirements for the collection of long-term follow-up data.
 None of our products have been subject to the PMA approval process, and we have no plans for any indication, system improvements or extensions that we believe would require a PMA.
 Clinical trials. Clinical trials are generally required to support a PMA application and are sometimes required for 510(k) clearance. Such trials require submission of an investigational device exemption, or IDE, application to the FDA for a specified number of patients and study sites (unless the product is deemed a non-significant risk device eligible for more abbreviated IDE requirements). If an IDE is required, the FDA and the appropriate institutional review boards, or IRBs, at the clinical sites must approve the study before clinical trials may begin. If the device is considered a non-significant risk device, IDE submission to FDA is not required. Instead, only approval from the IRB overseeing the clinical trial is required. Clinical trials are subject to extensive monitoring, record keeping and reporting requirements. Clinical trials must be conducted under the oversight of an IRB for the relevant clinical trial sites and must comply with FDA regulations, including but not limited to those relating to good clinical practices. To conduct a clinical trial, the patient’s informed consent must be obtained in form and substance that complies with both FDA requirements and state and federal privacy and human subject protection regulations.  
 The clinical trial sponsor, the FDA or the IRB could suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time for various reasons, including a belief that the subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Even if a trial is completed, the results of clinical testing may not adequately demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of the device or may otherwise not be sufficient to obtain FDA clearance or approval to market the product.
 
26


Continuing FDA regulation. Any devices we manufacture or distribute pursuant to 510(k) clearance or PMA approval by the FDA are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA and certain state agencies. These include product listing and establishment registration requirements, which help facilitate FDA inspections and other regulatory actions.
 In addition, our manufacturing operations for medical devices and those of our suppliers must comply with the FDA’s Quality System Regulations, or QSR. The QSR requires that each manufacturer, including third party manufacturers, establish and implement a quality system by which the manufacturer monitors the manufacturing process and maintains records that show compliance with FDA regulations and the manufacturer’s written specifications and procedures. Among other things, the QSR requires that manufacturers establish performance requirements before production and follow stringent requirements applicable to the device design, testing, production, control, record keeping, documentation, labeling and installation, as well as supplier/contractor selection, complaint handling and other quality assurance procedures during all aspects of the manufacturing process. Compliance with the QSR is necessary to be able to continue to market medical devices that have received FDA approval or clearance, and to receive FDA clearance or approval to market new or significantly modified medical devices. The FDA makes announced and unannounced inspections of medical device manufacturers, and these inspections may include the manufacturing facilities of subcontractors. Following an inspection, the FDA may issue reports, known as FDA Form 483 reports, listing the investigator’s observations of conditions or practices which indicate the possibility that an FDA-regulated product may be in violation of FDA’s requirements. FDA may also issue warning letters documenting regulatory violations observed during an inspection. The manufacturer’s failure to adequately respond to such reports or warning letters may result in FDA enforcement action against the manufacturer and related consequences, including, among other things, fines, injunctions, civil penalties, recalls or seizures of products, total or partial suspension of production, FDA refusal to grant 510(k) clearance or PMA approval to new devices, withdrawal of existing clearances or approvals, and criminal prosecution.
 Manufacturers must also comply with post-market surveillance regulations, including medical device reporting regulations, which require that manufacturers review and report to the FDA any incident in which their device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury, or malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if it were to recur. In addition, corrections and removal reporting regulations require that manufacturers report to the FDA field corrections and product recalls or removals if undertaken to reduce a risk to health posed by the device or to remedy a violation of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act that may present a risk to health. The FDA may also order a mandatory recall if there is a reasonable probability that the device would cause serious adverse health consequences or death.
 The FDA and the Federal Trade Commission, or FTC, also regulate the promotion and advertising of MRIdian. In general, we may not promote or advertise MRIdian for uses not within the scope of our clearances or approvals or make unsupported safety and effectiveness claims.
 Failure to comply with applicable FDA requirements, including delays in or failures to report incidents to the FDA or off-label promotion, can result in enforcement action by the FDA, which can include any of the following sanctions:
  
• | warning letters, untitled letters, fines, injunctions, consent decrees and civil penalties;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | customer notifications or repair, replacement, refunds, recall, administrative detention or seizure of our MRIdian systems;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | operating restrictions or partial suspension or total shutdown of production;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | refusing or delaying requests for 510(k) clearance or PMA approval of new or modified products;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | withdrawing 510(k) clearances or PMA approvals that have already been granted;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | refusal to grant export approval for products; or
--+--------------------------------------------------


• | criminal prosecution.
--+----------------------

 Radiological health. We are also regulated by the FDA under the Electronic Product Radiation Control provisions of the FDCA because MRIdian contains radiation producing components, and because we assemble these 
 
27


components during manufacturing and service activities. The Electronic Product Radiation Control provisions require radiation producing products to comply with certain regulations and applicable performance standards. Manufacturers are required to certify in product labeling and reports to the FDA that their products comply with all necessary standards as well as maintain manufacturing, testing and sales records for their products. The Electronic Product Radiation Control provisions also require manufacturers to report product defects and affix appropriate labeling to covered products. Failure to comply with these requirements could result in enforcement action by the FDA, which can include any of the sanctions described above.
 Nuclear Regulatory Commission and U.S. State Agencies
 In the United States, as a manufacturer of medical devices and devices utilizing radioactive byproduct material (i.e. depleted uranium shielding and Cobalt-60 sources), we are subject to extensive regulation by not only federal governmental authorities, such as the NRC, but also by state and local governmental authorities, such as the Ohio Department of Health, to ensure such devices are safe and effective. In Ohio, the Department of Health, by agreement with the NRC, regulates the possession, use, and disposal of radioactive byproduct material as well as the manufacture of devices containing radioactive sealed sources to ensure compliance with state and federal laws and regulations. We have received sealed source device approval from the Ohio Department of Health for MRIdian and have entered into a standby letter of credit with PNC for $103,000 to provide certification of financial assurance for decommissioning Cobalt-60 radioactive materials in accordance with Ohio Department of Health regulations. We and/or our supplier of radiation sources must also comply with NRC and U.S. Department of Transportation regulations on the labeling and packaging requirements for shipment of radiation sources to hospitals or other users of MRIdian. Compliance with NRC, state and local requirements is required for distribution, installation, use and service within each state that we intend to install MRIdian systems.
 Existing radiation therapy facilities practicing nuclear medicine, brachytherapy or Gamma Knife therapy are already required to have necessary NRC and/or state licenses and a radiation safety program requiring compliance to various provisions under NRC regulations at Part 35 of Title 10 of the Code of Federal Regulations (“Medical uses of byproduct material”). Use of MRIdian is regulated under Section 35.1000 of the NRC’s regulations (“Other medical uses of byproduct material or radiation from byproduct material”). In 2013, the NRC released licensing guidance under its regulations to guide our customers in the NRC requirements applicable to the use of MRIdian. We believe that this guidance is favorable in that it is consistent with clinical use of existing image-guided radiation therapy devices.
 Moreover, our use, management, and disposal of certain radioactive substances and wastes are subject to regulation by several federal and state agencies depending on the nature of the substance or waste material. We believe that we are in compliance with all federal and state regulations for this purpose.
 Outside the United States, various laws apply to the import, distribution, installation and use of MRIdian, in consideration of the nuclear materials within MRIdian. Upon 510(k) clearance and commercialization, we do not expect that the MRIdian Linac would fall under this regulation.
 U.S. Privacy and Security Laws
 We may also be subject to data privacy and security regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, and their respective implementing regulations, including the final omnibus rule published on January 25, 2013, imposes specified requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. Further, “business associates,” defined as independent contractors or agents of covered entities that create, receive, maintain or transmit protected health information in connection with providing a service for or on behalf of a covered entity are also subject to certain HIPAA privacy and security standards. HITECH also increased the civil and criminal penalties that may be imposed against covered entities, business associates and possibly other persons, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorney’s fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. In addition, state laws govern the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many 
 
28


of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts.
 U.S. Fraud and Abuse Laws and Regulations
 The healthcare industry is also subject to a number of fraud and abuse laws and regulations, including physician anti-kickback, false claims and physician payment transparency laws. Violations of these laws can lead to civil and criminal penalties, including exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs and significant monetary penalties, among others. These laws, among other things, constrain the sales, marketing and other promotional activities of manufacturers of medical products, such as us, by limiting the kinds of financial arrangements we may have with hospitals, physicians and other potential purchasers of medical products who may seek reimbursement from a federal or state health care program such as Medicare or Medicaid.
 Anti-kickback laws. The federal Anti-Kickback Statute makes it a criminal offense to knowingly and willfully solicit, offer, receive or pay any remuneration in exchange for, or to induce, the referral of business, including the purchase, order, lease of any good, facility, item or service, that are reimbursable by a state or federal health care program, such as Medicare or Medicaid. The term “remuneration” has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value. The Anti-Kickback Statute has been interpreted to apply to the purchase of medical devices from a particular manufacturer or the referral of patients to a particular supplier of diagnostic services utilizing such devices. Although, there are established statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors that define certain financial transactions and practices that are not subject to the Anti-Kickback Statute, the exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly. Failure to meet all of the requirements of a particular applicable statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor does not make the conduct per se illegal under the Anti-Kickback Statute. Instead, the legality of the arrangement will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis based on a cumulative review of all its facts and circumstances.
 Generally, courts have taken a broad interpretation of the scope of the Anti-Kickback Statute, holding that the statute may be violated if merely one purpose of a payment arrangement is to induce referrals or purchases. Further, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation.
 Violations of this law are punishable by up to five years in prison, and can also result in criminal fines, administrative civil money penalties and exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs. In addition, a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal False Claims Act. Many states have also adopted statutes similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, some of which apply to payments in connection with the referral of patients for healthcare items or services reimbursed by any source, not only governmental payor programs.
 False Claims Act. The federal civil False Claims Act prohibits anyone from knowingly and willfully presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment, that are false or fraudulent, for services not provided as claimed. In addition to actions initiated by the government itself, the statute authorizes actions to be brought on behalf of the federal government by a private party having knowledge of the alleged fraud. Because the complaint is initially filed under seal, the action may be pending for some time before the defendant is even aware of the action. If the government is ultimately successful in obtaining redress in the matter or if the plaintiff succeeds in obtaining redress without the government’s involvement, then the plaintiff will receive a percentage of the recovery. When an entity is determined to have violated the False Claims Act, it may be required to pay up to three times the actual damages sustained by the government, plus civil penalties ranging from $10,781 to $21,563 for each separate false claim, and may be excluded from participation in federal health care programs, and, although the federal False Claims Act is a civil statute, violations may also implicate various federal criminal statutes. Several states have also adopted comparable state false claims act, some of which apply to all payors.
 Civil monetary penalties laws. The civil monetary penalties statute imposes penalties against any person or entity that, among other things, is determined to have presented or caused to be presented a claim to a federal health program that the person knows or should know is for an item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent.
 
29


Other fraud and abuse laws. HIPAA also created new federal criminal statutes that prohibit among other actions, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors, knowingly and willfully embezzling or stealing from a healthcare benefit program, willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a healthcare offense, and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Like the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, the intent standard for certain healthcare fraud statutes under HIPAA was amended by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, or collectively, the Affordable Care Act, such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation.
 Physician payment transparency laws. There has been a recent trend of increased federal and state regulation of payments made to physicians and other healthcare providers and entities. The Affordable Care Act, among other things, imposed new reporting requirements on certain manufacturers, including certain device manufacturers, for payments provided to physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Failure to submit timely, accurately, and completely the required information may result in civil monetary penalties of up to an aggregate of $165,786 per year and up to an aggregate of $1,105,241 per year for “knowing failures.” Device manufacturers must submit reports by the 90th day of each calendar year. 
 Certain states also mandate implementation of compliance programs, impose restrictions on device manufacturer marketing practices and/or require the tracking and reporting of gifts, compensation and other remuneration to healthcare providers and entities.
 The laws and regulations and their enforcement are constantly undergoing change, and we cannot predict what effect, if any, changes may have on our business. In addition, new laws and regulations may be adopted which adversely affect our business. There has been a trend in recent years, both in the United States and internationally, toward more stringent regulation and enforcement of requirements applicable to medical device manufacturers and requirements regarding protection and confidentiality of personal data.
 State Certificate of Need Laws
 In some states, a certificate of need, or CON, or similar regulatory approval is required by hospitals and other healthcare providers prior to the acquisition of high-cost capital items, including MRIdian, or the provision of new services. These laws generally require appropriate state agency determination of public need and approval prior to the acquisition of such capital items or addition of new services. CON requirements may preclude our customers from acquiring, or significantly delay acquisition of, MRIdian and/or from performing treatments using MRIdian. CON laws are the subject of ongoing legislative activity, and a significant increase in the number of states regulating the offering and use of MRIdian through CON or similar requirements could adversely affect us.
 Healthcare Reform
 In the United States and foreign jurisdictions, there have been, and we expect there will continue to be, a number of legislative and regulatory changes to the healthcare system seeking, among other things, to reduce healthcare costs that could affect our results of operations.

By way of example, in the United States, the Affordable Care Act was signed into law in March 2010, which is expected to substantially change the way healthcare is delivered and financed by both governmental and private insurers. Among other things, the Affordable Care Act:
  
• | imposed an annual excise tax of 2.3% on any entity that manufactures or imports medical devices offered for sale in the United States which, due to subsequent legislative amendments, was suspended from January 1, 2016 to December 31, 2017. This exercise tax was suspended for another two years after the stopgap bill was signed by the President in January 2018;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | established a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee and identify priorities in comparative clinical effectiveness research in an effort to coordinate and develop such research;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | implemented payment system reforms including a national pilot program on payment bundling to encourage hospitals, physicians and other providers to improve the coordination, quality and efficiency of certain healthcare services through bundled payment models; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | created an independent payment advisory board that will submit recommendations to reduce Medicare spending if projected Medicare spending exceeds a specified growth rate.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We expect that the new presidential administration and U.S. Congress will seek to modify, repeal, or otherwise invalidate all or certain provisions of, the Affordable Care Act. Since taking office, President Trump has continued to support the repeal of all or portions of the Affordable Care Act. In January 2017, the House and Senate passed a budget resolution that authorizes congressional committees to draft legislation to repeal all or portions of the Affordable Care Act and permits such legislation to pass with a majority vote in the Senate. President Trump also issued an executive order in which he stated that it is his administration’s policy to seek the prompt repeal of the Affordable Care Act and directed executive departments and federal agencies to waive, defer, grant exemptions from, or delay the implementation of the provisions of the Affordable Care Act to the maximum extent permitted by law. There is still uncertainty with respect to the impact President Trump’s administration and the U.S. Congress may have, if any, and any changes will likely take time to unfold, and could have an impact on coverage and reimbursement for healthcare items and services covered by plans that were authorized by the Affordable Care Act.
 In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the Affordable Care Act was enacted. These changes include the Budget Control Act of 2011, which resulted in reductions to Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect on April 1, 2013 and will stay in effect through 2025 unless additional Congressional action is taken, as well as, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several types of providers, including hospitals and imaging centers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years.
 We expect that additional state and federal healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services, which could result in reduced demand for MRIdian or additional pricing pressure.
 Foreign Regulation of Medical Devices
 Our activities outside the United States are subject to regulatory requirements that vary from country to country and frequently differ significantly from those in the United States. Failure to obtain and maintain regulatory approval or clearance in any foreign country in which we market or plan to market MRIdian and MRIdian Linac may have a negative effect on our ability to generate revenue and harm our business.
 In general, MRIdian and MRIdian Linac are regulated outside the United States as medical devices by foreign governmental agencies similar to the FDA and the FTC. In addition, in foreign countries where we have operations or sell MRIdian, we are subject to laws and regulations applicable to manufacturers of medical devices, radiation producing devices and to the healthcare industry, and laws and regulation of general applicability relating to environmental protection, safe working conditions, manufacturing practices and other matters. These laws and regulations are often comparable to, or more stringent than U.S. laws and regulations. Our sales of MRIdian in foreign countries are also subject to regulation of matters such as product standards, packaging requirements,

labeling requirements, import restrictions, tariff regulations, duties and tax requirements. We rely in some countries on our foreign distributors to assist us in complying with applicable regulatory requirements.
 Regulation in the EU
 In the European Union, or EU, we are required under the European Medical Device Directive (Council Directive 93/42/EEC) to affix the CE mark to our MRIdian systems in order to sell the MRIdian systems in member countries of the EU. The CE mark is an international symbol that represents adherence to certain essential principles of safety and effectiveness mandated in the European Medical Device Directive (the so-called “essential requirements”). Once affixed, the CE mark enables a product to be sold within the EEA, which is composed of the 28 Member States of the EU plus Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein.
 To demonstrate compliance with the essential requirements, we must undergo a conformity assessment procedure which varies according to the type of medical device and its classification. Except for certain low risk medical devices where the manufacturer can issue an EC Declaration of Conformity based on a self-assessment of the conformity of its products with the essential requirements of the Medical Devices Directive, a conformity assessment procedure requires the intervention of an organization accredited by a Member State of the EEA to conduct conformity assessments, or a Notified Body. Depending on the relevant conformity assessment procedure, the Notified Body would typically audit and examine the technical file and the quality system for the manufacture, design and final inspection of our devices. The Notified Body issues a CE Certificate of Conformity following successful completion of a conformity assessment procedure conducted in relation to the medical device and its manufacturer and their conformity with the essential requirements. This Certificate entitles the manufacturer to affix the CE mark to its medical devices after having prepared and signed a related EC Declaration of Conformity.
 We received the CE Certificate of Conformity from our Notified Body in November 2014, allowing us to affix the CE mark to MRIdian in order to sell it throughout the EEA. In September 2016, we received approval for CE mark in the European Union for our MRIdian Linac.
 If we modify MRIdian we may need to undergo a new conformity assessment procedure to be able to affix the CE mark to the modified product. Additionally, we will need to undergo new conformity assessments for any new products that we may develop in the future before we are able to affix the CE mark to these new products. We cannot be certain that the outcome of these conformity assessments will be positive and that we will be able to affix the CE mark for modified or new products or that we will continue to meet the quality and safety standards required to maintain the CE marks that we already have or may have in the future. In addition, if we are unable to affix the CE mark to our future products, we would be unable to sell them in EU member countries. 
 In September 2012, the European Commission published proposals for the revision of the EU regulatory framework for medical devices. The proposals would replace the Medical Devices Directive and the Active Implantable Medical Devices Directive with two new regulations: the Medical Devices Regulation and the In-Vitro Diagnostic Medical Devices Regulation. Unlike directives, which must be implemented into the national laws of the EU Member States, the regulations would be directly applicable, i.e., without the need for adoption of EU Member State laws implementing them, in all EEA Member States and are intended to eliminate current differences in the regulation of medical devices among EEA Member States.
 The Medical Devices Regulation will apply to ViewRay starting on May 26, 2020.  Once applicable, the new regulation will among other things:
  
• | strengthen the rules on placing devices on the market and reinforce surveillance once they are available;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | establish explicit provisions on manufacturers' responsibilities for the follow-up of the quality, performance and safety of devices placed on the market;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | improve the traceability of medical devices throughout the supply chain to the end-user or patient through a unique identification number; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
32


 
• | set up a central database to provide patients, healthcare professionals and the public with comprehensive information on products available in the EU.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Regulation in Other Countries
 We will be subject to additional regulations in foreign countries in which we intend to market, sell and import MRIdian. We or our distributors must receive all necessary approvals or clearance prior to marketing and importing MRIdian in those international markets. We received a license and permission to import MRIdian into the United Arab Emirates in December 2014. We received regulatory approval for MRIdian with Cobalt-60 in Italy in January 2015, Korea in September 2015, as well as Japan and China in August 2016. We also received regulatory approval for MRIdian Linac in Israel in November 2017. We will seek approvals in other countries as may be required in the future.
 The International Standards Organization promulgates internationally recognized standards, including those for the requirements of quality systems. We are certified to the ISO 13485:2003 standard, which specify the quality system requirements for medical device manufacturers. To support our ISO certifications, we are subject to surveillance audits by a Notified Body yearly and recertification audits every three years that assess our continued compliance with the relevant ISO standards. Our most recent recertification audit occurred in March 2017.
 The ISO 13485:2003 standard is being replaced by a new version, the ISO 13485:2016 with a required conformance date of March 31, 2019.  We are modifying our quality system to meet the requirements of the 13485:2016 standard, undergo audits by the Notified Body and to meet the conformance date of March 31, 2019.
 Employees
 At December 31, 2017, we had 139 full-time employees. Within our workforce at December 31, 2017, 41 employees were engaged in research and development and 98 employees in business development, finance, human resources, facilities and general management and administration. We have no collective bargaining agreements with our employees, and we have not experienced any work stoppages. We consider our relations with our employees to be good.
