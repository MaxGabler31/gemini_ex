ITEM 1. BUSINESS.
Corporate History

Guskin Gold Corp. (fka Inspired Builders, Inc.), a Nevada Corporation (the “Company”, “Guskin”, “we”, and “us”), was incorporated in the State of Nevada in February 2010, as Inspired Builders, Inc. We previously focused on repairing and providing home improvements for homeowners and then acquiring, investing in, developing, and managing real estate properties and related investments. On August 15, 2017, pursuant to another change in control transaction we ceased all operations as a real estate company.

On January 16, 2020, Santa Alba, LLC, our former majority shareholder, sold 956,440 shares of common stock to Custodian Ventures, LLC for an aggregate purchase price of $145,000. At this point there was a change of control of the Company and Kai Ming Zhao resigned as President, Secretary, Treasurer and Director and David Lazar was appointed as President, Secretary, Treasurer and Director.

On April 30, 2020, Custodian Ventures, LLC, a Wyoming limited liability company (“CVL”) and the Company entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement (“Agreement”) with U Green Enterprise, a Ghana corporation (the “Purchaser”). The Agreement closed upon execution on April 30, 2020. Pursuant to the Agreement, CVL agreed to sell and Purchaser agreed to purchase 956,440 restricted common stock shares of the Company (the “Shares”), representing approximately 94.6% of the Company’s outstanding shares of common stock. The Agreement resulted in a change of control of the Company and David Lazar resigned effective immediately as the Company’s Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, President, Secretary, Treasurer and sole director and Edward Somuah was appointed as the Company’s Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, President, Secretary, Treasurer and sole director.

On September 3, 2020, the Company entered into a Share Exchange Agreement (the “Share Exchange Agreement”) with Guskin Gold Corporation, a Nevada limited liability company (“GGC”), and the controlling stockholders of GGC (the “GGC Shareholders”). Pursuant to the Share Exchange Agreement, the Company acquired One Hundred Percent (100%) the issued and outstanding equity interest of GGC from the GGC Shareholders (the “GGC Shares”) and in exchange the Company issued to GGC an aggregate of Twenty-Eight Million Two Hundred Thousand (28,200,000) shares of restricted common stock of the Company. As a result of the Share Exchange Agreement, GGC become a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. The Share Exchange Agreement contains customary representations and warranties. Further, the Share Exchange Agreement contains the following conditions to closing and the closing of the Share Exchange shall only occur once the following conditions have been satisfied: (i) approval from the Company’s shareholders; and, (ii) GGC provides the Company with audited financial statements, with such financial statements being prepared by an independent accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB).

As of September 22, 2020 (the “Closing Date”), the transactions contemplated by the Share Exchange Agreement have been satisfied, accordingly the Share Exchange Agreement is closed (“Closing”).

Concurrent with the Closing of the Share Exchange Agreement, the Company’s Board of Directors, having received the written consent of shareholders holding a majority of the Company’s outstanding shares of common stock, approved: (i) an amendment to the Company’s Articles of Incorporation to change the Company’s name from Inspired Builders, Inc. to Guskin Gold Corp. (the “Corporate Name Change”); and (ii) a change to the Company’s OTC trading symbol from ISRB to GUSK, or if unavailable to GGCO or GKIN (the “Symbol Change”). Nevada corporate law permits holders of a majority of the voting power to take shareholder action by written consent. Accordingly, the Company did not hold a meeting of its shareholders to consider or vote upon the Corporate Name Change or Symbol Change. The Corporate Name Change and Symbol Change (to GKIN) became effective December 4, 2020. 

The Share Exchange Agreement is qualified in its entirety by the complete copy of the Share Exchange Agreement, which was filed with the SEC on September 8, 2020, as part of our Current Report on Form 8-K as Item 10.01 and is incorporated by reference herein.

Our year end is September 30. We are a development stage enterprise. Accordingly, our current plan of operation consists of identifying, assessing, and vetting various gold and mineral properties, specifically focusing on gold properties and the exploration and potential development of small-scale gold mining operations in Africa, as discussed in detail below.

We will intend to establish, maintain, and evolve our risk management frameworks, systems, policies, standards and procedures to effectively manage financial, health, safety, environment, community and other operational risks and where those risks could have a material impact on the Company’s businesses and operations, formulating strategies for mitigating these risks for consideration by the Board.

Current Operations – Ghana, West Africa 

Our business activity is the early-stage development of a business focusing on the acquisition of gold properties, and the exploration and potential development of gold mining operations in Africa, specifically focused currently in the Republic of Ghana, West Africa. Ms. Asante, our new CEO has travelled to Ghana four times over the past 18 months, for the purpose of meeting with geologist, attorneys, and other qualified individuals in furtherance of identifying potential acquisition properties in Ghana and the subsequent exploration of these projects, if any, and the further development of these projects with the potential goal of attaining production of gold in Ghana. Ghana is a well-known mining jurisdiction with a long history of gold production and a highly trained workforce. The mining tenure, royalty and tax laws are stable and well legislated. While the Company’s current focus is in Ghana, we are actively seeking out opportunities throughout the continent of Africa.

On June 1, 2021, the Company and Africa Exploration & Minerals Group Limited, a company incorporated in Ghana (the “AEMG”) entered into a Joint Venture & Partnership Agreement (the “JV Agreement”) setting forth the terms and conditions of a joint venture and partnership (the “Partnership”) between themselves relating to precious metal, minerals and mining exploration activities in the Country of Ghana. The initial project that the Parties were to undertake was an approximately 1 square km of the Shewn Edged Pink Concession (the “Concession”). In the beginning of November 2021, Company management, while visiting our operations in Ghana, noticed various accounting discrepancies and expenses irregularities relating to AEMG’s activities at the Concession. Additionally, during this time the Company was informed that, on information and belief, AEMG was not the rightful owner of the Concession and in fact had no legal right to enter the Partnership with the Company. Thereafter, the Company met with AEMG on several occasions seeking to resolve these matters in a manner that would be mutually agreeable to both parties. All attempts, as of the date of this report, to resolve the dispute amicably have been unsuccessful. The Company has retained Ghanaian counsel to represent and protect its interests relating to the disputed funds and our ongoing operation in Ghana. Also, on advice of counsel, the Company has turned all evidence of the foregoing over to the proper authorities and currently the matter is under review by the lead prosecutors in Accra, Ghana. The Company will continue to assist the authorities in any manner necessary and will continue to protect and preserve all remedies available to the Company at law, both in Ghana and in the United States, as necessary.

On January 24, 2022, Guskin Gold Corp., by and through a new wholly owned subsidiary, Guskin Gold Ghana #1 Limited., a company incorporated under the Laws of the Republic of Ghana (collectively, Guskin Gold Corp. and its subsidiary Guskin Gold Ghana Ltd. shall be referred to hereinafter as the “Company”) and Danampco Company Ltd., a company incorporated under the Laws of the Republic of Ghana (the “DCL”) entered into a Joint Venture & Partnership Agreement (the “JV Agreement”) which sets forth the terms and conditions of a joint venture and partnership (the “Partnership”) between themselves relating to precious metal, minerals and mining exploration activities in the Country of Ghana. Per the Agreement DCL granted the Company an exclusive seventy (70%) percent ownership interest in that certain project, located in the Country of Ghana in which DCL has an interest known as the Kukuom Shewn Edged Pink Concession (the “Kukuom Concession”). The Kukuom Concession covers a total surface area of one-hundred fifty-six (156) square kilometers and is located between the cities of Goaso and Bibiani in the Ahafo District of Ghana. The Parties intent this to be an unincorporated contractual joint venture in respect of the exploration, development, exploitation, and operation of the Concession. Each additional project relating to the Ghana Option Interest, and agreed to be made part of, and undertaken by the Partnership, shall be governed by individual “Operating Agreements” setting forth the terms and conditions relating to each project specifically. As consideration for the Partnership, the Company shall provide all financing (“Financing”), to be remitted in accordance with a work program and budget, necessary to begin exploration of the Kukuom Concession. Additionally, the Company shall issue DCL 500,000 restricted common shares the Company’s common stock, at a per share valuation of $1.00 per share, with such shares shall be issued based on certain milestones, which are fully sent forth in the JV Agreement and Operating Agreement. The foregoing description of the JV Agreement and Operating Agreement (as Schedule A to the JV Agreement) do not purport to be complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the full text of both documents which are attached hereto as Exhibit 10.4 (the Operating Agreement is Schedule A to the JV Agreement) and is incorporated herein by reference. 

In conducting due diligence on any potential property, the Company focuses on the following critical factors when evaluating each properties merit:


● | the historical exploration work completed to date, including but not limited to, all geological, geochemical, geophysical, drill and core samples, and exploration data(s) and maps, all technical data; and,
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | the legal, government, and or regulatory affairs of the business or property. 


The Company is seeking opportunities in the alluvial and or hard-rock gold sector. We believe these sectors will give us the best advantage in Ghana initially. By way of example and for clarity, there are two types of gold: alluvial gold that is often found in riverbeds and amalgam gold that is located in ore. In Ghana, both types of gold exist, however, initially we are focused on identification of properties where alluvial mining would be the method for extracting any gold deposits as we believe these will be more be financially beneficial to the Company and our shareholders.

A successful approach to gold exploration involves a variety of traditional exploration techniques coupled with modern technological advances utilized in close conjunction in a systematically outlined manner that adhere strictly to industry standards to produce acceptable results. An example of this approach is outlined as follows:

Field Mapping 

The foremost activity to be carried out in any new exploration would be field mapping. Here, field geologists and technicians will work hand in hand to assess the ground conditions and to evaluate the nature of current ground conditions. This among other things will reveal field intricacies included but not limited to artisanal workings for instance. The mapping team would be tasked to also locate the reported any old trenches and mark them out for follow up. They will carry out geological mapping such as mapping of outcrops. Another task to be carried out by the team would be to map out low lying areas which in turn will help in the future soil geochem planning.
Soil Sampling 

Obtaining and storing a small amount of soil for visual inspection and laboratory testing for the determination of the soil unit geological provenance, characteristics and geotechnical engineering design parameters
Trenching 

Trenching is going to be a major exploration technique on any property being explored by the Company. Trenches or pits may be dug by mechanical excavators as part of mineral exploration or mining permits. Trenches and pits may be dug when areas of earth containing minerals are shown to be present and need further testing. The trenching will be done in phases within the exploration campaign. Areas deemed as more prospective by virtue of the soil geochem results will be treated as high priority areas. Positive outcomes will warrant adjacent trenches to be opened along strike and that will be done when results are received from the laboratory.

7

Auger Drilling & Geophysical

In areas where trenching becomes a challenge, auger drilling would be the ideal approach to turn to. Such an approach is carefully followed through when there is a positive indication as to the continuation an anomaly. Geophysical surveys could also come in handy in confirming such scenarios but must be done with caution especially where there is limited geological evidence to prove such an occurrence. When there is great certainty of continuation of anomalous trends into alluvial terrains; such terrains will be auger drilled to verify the continuity of anomalies at depth.
Drilling 

If the foregoing approach indicates noteworthy gold targets, coupled with the geophysics, the next step will be to complete a preliminary drill program to evaluate the potential size and nature of the deposit (s) there is within the prospects.
Quality Assurance Quality Control (QAQC) 

A good Quality Control Quality Assurance program will identify problems in the sampling and analyses stream so that they may be fixed as soon as possible. QAQC will be designed and implemented to accompany all datasets during the exploration program especially during the drilling phase. The objective of the QAQC implementation is largely to ensure general sample quality as well as guaranteed results at all stages of drilling. It is a best practice that every drill database be accompanied by a sound QAQC program as a stamp of authority at all times. To this end, there is a huge responsibility to the technical (geological) team to ensure that human errors are reduced to the barest minimal and that will pave way to be able to monitor the laboratory in an effective manner.
Operations in Ghana

Ghana is situated on the west coast of Africa, approximately 600 kilometers (“km”) north of the Equator on the Gulf of Guinea. Accra, the capital city of Ghana, is located almost exactly on the Prime Meridian. The former British colony changed its name from the Gold Coast to Ghana upon achieving independence on March 6, 1957. Ghana is now a republic with a population of approximately 28 million people and a democratically elected government. English remains the official and commercial language.

Ghana is the fastest growing economy in the world according to the World Bank’s Ease of Doing Business Report 2019. It also has one of the best judicial systems in the world measured by rule of law, World Justice Projects (WJP) Rule of Law Index 2017-2018. In 2015, Ghana ranked 6th in Africa on the World Bank’s Ease of Doing Business barometer. It’s ranked as the most stable political environment in West Africa, with the most competitive economy, backed by a government committed to policies that reduce the cost of doing business and promoting investor confidence. Growth potential can be seen through improved taxes in Ghana. Ghana cut its corporate tax rate in 2016 and 2017 and has a mineral royalty to a sliding scale based on gold prices, from a 5 percent flat rate.

The Ghanaian legal system is generally modelled after and based on the British common law. The laws of Ghana include the Constitution, national laws passed by Parliament (or under authority granted by Parliament) and the common law of Ghana. The common law of Ghana includes customary rules which apply to particular communities in Ghana and which may or may not be consistent with the Constitution or a specific national law.

Ghana is a mining friendly country with two mining colleges and a large workforce trained in the disciplines of geology, exploration methods and mining engineering.

The Company is of the view that any risks associated with its corporate structure and its foreign operations are minimal and can be effectively managed by the Company without undue burden or associated costs.

Rights in Ghana 

The Constitution of Ghana vests title in every mineral in its natural state to the Government of Ghana. The exercise of any mineral right in the form of reconnaissance, exploration, or exploitation of any mineral in Ghana requires an appropriate license or mineral right to be issued by the Government of Ghana acting through the Minister responsible for Lands and Natural Resources. The Minister responsible for Lands and Natural Resources administers, promotes and regulates Ghana’s mineral wealth through the Minerals Commission, a governmental organization designed in accordance with the Minerals Commission Act 1993 (Act 450) and the Minerals and Mining Act 2006 (“2006 Mining Act”).

Pursuant to the 2006 Mining Act, a number of regulations were passed in 2012 to clarify and implement provisions of the 2006 Mining Act. These regulations relate to matters such as licensing, local content, technical issues, mineral right holding costs, mine support services and payment of compensation to persons impacted by mining operations. Once a license or mineral right is issued to an entity by the Government of Ghana, Ghanaian mining laws prevent that license or mineral right from being transferred, assigned, or mortgaged by the licensee or mineral right holder without the prior written approval of the Government of Ghana. The Ghana Minerals Commission is also required to maintain a public register of all applications, grants, variations, transfers, suspensions and cancellations of such licenses or mineral rights. Official searches may be conducted in the public register to obtain information regarding any license or mineral right granted by the Government of Ghana.

In order to confirm the Company’s title in its material mineral properties, the Company will, from time to time, obtain legal opinions from its local Ghanaian counsel regarding rights, title and interests in and to its material mineral properties.

Ghanaian law sets mineral royalties at a flat rate of 5% of mineral revenues.

Government Regulation

General

The Company’s activities are subject to extensive federal, state, and local laws governing the protection of the environment, prospecting, development, production, taxes, labor standards, occupational health, mine safety, toxic substances, and other matters. The costs to comply with such regulatory requirements are substantial and possible future legislation and regulations could cause additional expense, capital expenditures, restrictions and delays in the development and continued operation of the Company’s properties, the extent of which cannot be predicted. In the context of environmental permitting, including the approval of reclamation plans, the Company must comply with known standards and regulations which may entail significant costs and delays. Although the Company has been recognized for its commitment to environmental responsibility and believes it is in substantial compliance with applicable laws and regulations, amendments to current laws and regulations, more stringent application or interpretation of these laws and regulations through judicial review, or administrative action or the adoption of new laws could have a material adverse effect upon the Company and its results of operations.

Environmental matters in Ghana, including those related to mining, fall primarily under the oversight of the Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”), as well as the Minerals Commission and their Mines Inspectorate Division. The EPA has acts and regulations that govern, among other things, environmental and socioeconomic impact assessments and statements, environmental management plans, emissions to the environment, environmental auditing and review, and mine closure and reclamation, to which the Company’s operations are subject. Additional provisions governing mine environmental management are provided in the Minerals and Mining Act, 2006, and Minerals and Mining Regulations, 2012.

The Company’s future mining, processing, development, and mineral exploration activities will also subject to various laws governing prospecting, development, production, taxes, labor standards, occupational health and safety, land rights of local people and other matters. New rules and regulations may be enacted, or existing rules and regulations may be modified and applied in a manner that could have an adverse effect on the Company’s financial position and results of operations.

Market, Customers, and Distribution Methods

Although there can be no assurance, large and well capitalized markets are readily available for all metals and precious metals throughout the world. A very sophisticated futures market for the pricing and delivery of future production also exists. The price for metals is affected by a number of global factors, including economic strength and resultant demand for metals for production, fluctuating supplies, mining activities and production by others in the industry, and new and or reduced uses for subject metals.

The mining industry is highly speculative and of a very high-risk nature. As such, mining activities involve a high degree of risk, which even a combination of experience, knowledge and careful evaluation may not be able to overcome. Few mining projects actually become operating mines.

The mining industry is subject to a number of factors, including intense industry competition, high susceptibility to economic conditions (such as price of metal, foreign currency exchange rates, and capital and operating costs), and political conditions (which could affect such things as import and export regulations, foreign ownership restrictions). Furthermore, the mining activities are subject to all hazards incidental to mineral exploration, development and production, as well as risk of damage from earthquakes, any of which could result in work stoppages, damage to or loss of property and equipment and possible environmental damage. Hazards such as unusual or unexpected geological formations and other conditions are also involved in mineral exploration and development.

Competition

The mineral exploration industry is highly competitive. We are a new and exploration stage company and have a weak competitive position in the industry. We compete with junior and senior mineral exploration companies, independent producers and institutional and individual investors who are actively seeking to acquire mineral exploration properties throughout the world together with the equipment, labor and materials required to operate on those properties. Competition for the acquisition of mineral exploration interests is intense with many mineral exploration leases or concessions available in a competitive bidding process in which we may lack the technological information or expertise available to other bidders.

Many of the mineral exploration companies with which we compete for financing and for the acquisition of mineral exploration properties have greater financial and technical resources than those available to us. Accordingly, these competitors may be able to spend greater amounts on acquiring mineral exploration interests of merit or on exploring or developing their mineral exploration properties. This advantage could enable our competitors to acquire mineral exploration properties of greater quality and interest to prospective investors who may choose to finance their additional exploration and development. Such competition could adversely impact our ability to attain the financing necessary for us to acquire further mineral exploration interests or explore and develop our current or future mineral exploration properties.

We also compete with other junior mineral exploration companies for financing from a limited number of investors that are prepared to invest in such companies. The presence of competing junior mineral exploration companies may impact our ability to raise additional capital in order to fund our acquisition or exploration programs if investors perceive that investments in our competitors are more attractive based on the merit of their mineral exploration properties or the price of the investment opportunity. In addition, we compete with both junior and senior mineral exploration companies for available resources, including, but not limited to, professional geologists, land specialists, engineers, camp staff, helicopters, float planes, mineral exploration supplies and drill rigs.

General competitive conditions may be substantially affected by various forms of energy legislation and/or regulation introduced from time to time by the governments of Ghana, the United States and other countries, as well as factors beyond our control, including international political conditions, overall levels of supply and demand for mineral exploration.
