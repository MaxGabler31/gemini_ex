ITEM 1. | BUSINESS

OVERVIEW
We develop, market, sell, and support software and integrated solutions for video and audio content creation, management and distribution. We are a leading technology provider that powers the media and entertainment industry. We do this by providing an open and efficient platform for digital media, along with a comprehensive set of tools and workflow solutions. Our solutions are used in production and post-production facilities; film studios; network, affiliate, independent and cable television stations; recording studios; live-sound performance venues; advertising agencies; government and educational institutions; corporate communications departments; and by independent video and audio creative professionals, as well as aspiring professionals. Projects produced using our tools, platform and ecosystem include feature films, television programming, live events, news broadcasts, sports productions, commercials, music, video and other digital media content. With over one million creative users and thousands of enterprise clients relying on our technology platforms and solutions around the world, Avid enables the industry to thrive in today’s connected media and entertainment world.
Our mission is to empower media creators with innovative technology and collaborative tools to entertain, inform, educate and enlighten the world. Our clients rely on Avid to create the most prestigious and award-winning feature films, music recordings, television shows, live concerts, sporting events and news broadcasts. Avid has been honored for technological innovation with 16 Emmy Awards, one Grammy Award, two Oscars and the first ever America Cinema Editors Technical Excellence Award. In 2018, Avid was named the recipient of the prestigious Philo T. Farnsworth Award by the Television Academy, to honor Avid’s 30 years of continuous, transformative technology innovations, including products that have improved and accelerated the entire editing and post production process for television. Our creative tools and workflow solutions were used in all 2019 Oscar nominated films for Best Film Editing, Best Sound Editing, Best Sound Mixing, and Best Picture. 
CORPORATE STRATEGY
Acceleration of digitization is having a tremendous impact on the media industry and altering the industry value chain. Today’s consumers are empowered to create and consume content on-demand, anywhere, anytime. Organizations in the media industry are under pressure to connect and automate the entire creation-to-consumption workflow, and are facing a number of challenges, including:

• | Increasing rate of content creation and digitation of media assets - Many organizations are feeling intense pressure to create more and more content, increasingly tailored for audience niches, while also facing greater competition from nimble players. At the same time, access to creative tools is wider today than ever before, giving more people the ability to tell their stories.


• | Exponential growth of distribution platforms - The number of distribution platforms continue to expand, and the economic models of new distribution platforms are still evolving. Many organizations need to embrace new opportunities while also maximizing heritage business.


• | Continued increase in content consumption - There has been a tremendous increase in viewership in the last decade, but it is spread across many outlets and channels, and while there is this increase in viewership, it is dwarfed by an increase in competitive content. In addition, with growing audience fragmentation, compelling content, brand equity and relevance is even more critical today.


• | Disparate mix of tools, skills & workflows - Lack of commonality and a fragmented supplier landscape creates incompatibilities, inhibiting agility, collaboration, sharing and efficiency.


• | Media technology budgets - Today’s economic realities are placing pressure on media technology budgets, while content output must increase exponentially to deliver on the market requirements. Content creators and distributors have to do a lot more, with essentially flat budgets, necessitating more efficient workflows and solutions.

We believe we are uniquely positioned in the media technology industry because we have a differentiated platform strategy and a well-established market position. Our products and solutions allow our customers to (i) create high-quality, engaging and immersive content, (ii) distribute to more outlets and devices, (iii) maximize and protect the value of media assets, and (iv) create operational and capital efficiency. As a result of our unique position across the media industry, we believe we can take advantage of the following opportunities and trends:

• | Large and growing market poised for transition - Customers are facing significant disruption and are on the cusp of making major changes and investments in their business and operational approaches, which are challenges that our product offerings address.


• | Deeply entrenched with a market leadership position - We have the ability to strategically leverage a significant global customer base that is loyal to our brand across TV, film, music and media.


• | Best positioned to help the industry navigate disruption - Our unique approach encompasses a common technology platform, leading software apps and integrated solutions-with a large and open ecosystem, which we believe significantly differentiates us from our competitors.


• | Ready to intercept the next emerging opportunity - By leveraging our unique partnership with Microsoft and our MediaCentral platform, we believe we can lead the media and entertainment industry into the cloud with market-leading Software as a Service, or SaaS, offerings.

Our strategy for connecting creative professionals and media enterprises with audiences in a powerful, efficient, collaborative, and profitable way leverages our Avid MediaCentral Platform - the open, extensible, and customizable foundation that streamlines and simplifies content workflows by integrating all Avid or third-party products and services that run on top of it. The platform provides secure and protected access, and enables fast and easy creation, delivery and monetization of content.
We work to ensure that we are meeting customer needs, staying ahead of industry trends and investing in the right areas through a close and interactive relationship with our customer base. The Avid Customer Association was established to be the world’s most innovative and influential media technology community representing thousands of organizations and over 27,000 professionals from all levels of the industry including the industry’s most inspirational and award-winning thought leaders, innovators and storytellers. The Avid Customer Association fosters collaboration between Avid, its customers and other industry colleagues to help shape our product offerings as well as providing a means to shape our industry together. 
A key element of our strategy is our transition to a recurring revenue-based model, through a combination of subscription offerings and long-term agreements. We started offering subscription licensing options for some of our products and solutions in 2014, and had approximately 125,000 paying subscribers at the end of 2018. These licensing options offer choices in pricing and deployment to suit our customers’ needs. Our subscription offerings to date have primarily been sold to creative professionals, however, we expect to increase subscription sales to media enterprises going forward as we expand offerings and move through customer upgrade cycles, which we expect will further increase recurring revenue on a longer-term basis. Our long-term agreements are comprised of multi-year agreements with large media enterprise customers to provide specified products and services, including SaaS offerings, and channel partners and resellers to purchase minimum amounts of products and service over a specified period of time. We believe our strategy to increase recurring revenue will continue to increase our visibility of revenue and cash flows in future periods.
Another key aspect of our strategy has been to implement programs to increase operational efficiencies and reduce costs. We are making significant changes in business operations to better support the company’s strategy and overall performance. We have implemented a number of spending control initiatives with an emphasis on non-personnel costs to reduce the overall cost structure while still investing in key areas that will drive growth. We are also revamping our supply chain and logistics, moving to a lean model that leverages a new supplier and distribution network. We are optimizing our go-to-market strategy, simplifying it to address specific customer markets and help maximize our commercial success. We expect this will improve our effectiveness, increase efficiency and drive growth in our pipeline and ultimately revenue.

Avid’s growing product portfolio is rooted in providing open and extensible products that ensure our long-term position with customers. Our software and integrated solutions, as well as our services offerings, address the diverse needs, skills and sophistication levels of our customers. All of our key products and solutions have been integrated into our MediaCentral Platform, which provides the industry’s most open, integrated and efficient platform designed for media. In addition, we provide flexible deployment models, licensing options and commercial structures so our customers can choose how, when and where to deploy and use our tools.
The standalone software portion of our portfolio consists of our Creative Software Suite and the Enterprise Software Suite, representing a large high-margin software and maintenance business. 
Creative Software Solutions
The Creative Software Suite includes our iconic Media Composer, Pro Tools and Sibelius tools, as well the Artist Community platform and the Avid Marketplace - all of which are key components of our cloud-enabled software subscription strategy.
Media Composer
Our award-winning Media Composer product line is used to edit video content, including television programming, commercials and films. Our cloud-enabled solutions that include Media Composer enable broadcast news, sports, reality television and film professionals to acquire, access, edit and finish stories anytime and from everywhere. Leveraging an integrated, yet open, end-to-end architecture, this solution gives contributors the ability to craft stories where and while they are happening and speed them to delivery, while maintaining connectivity with the central production operation. Media Composer also offers resolution flexibility and independence, accelerating high-res, HDR, and HD workflows. We offer Media Composer through both subscription and perpetual license offerings.

Pro Tools
Our Pro Tools digital audio software facilitates the audio production process, including music and sound creation, recording, editing, signal processing, integrated surround mixing and mastering and reference video playback. The Pro Tools platform supports a wide variety of internally developed and third-party software plug-ins and integrated hardware. Pro Tools solutions are offered at a range of price points and are used by professionals in music, film, television, radio, gaming, Internet and other media production environments. We offer Pro Tools through both subscription and perpetual license offerings.

Student versions are also available to assist in the teaching of music composition and score writing. Sibelius music notation software offers sophisticated, yet easy-to-use tools that are proven and trusted by composers, arrangers, publishers, educators, and students alike. We also offer Sibelius | Cloud Sharing, which allows users to view and play scores anywhere from the cloud using current web browsers and mobile devices. We offer Sibelius through both subscription and perpetual license offerings.
Avid Link
Avid Link is a free mobile application for anyone wanting to connect with other artists, producers, mixers, composers, editors, videographers, movie makers, and graphic designers, and to the Avid Marketplace. Currently available as a public beta for Mac, Windows, iOS and Android users, Avid Link is intended to make it easy for users to find, connect, message, and collaborate with audio and video creators, promote their work and skills to a vast network of media professionals, manage and keep their software up to date, and purchase new tools. We believe Avid Link will increase interest and demand for Avid’s suite of product offerings.
Enterprise Software Solutions
Avid’s Enterprise Software Suite is built on the MediaCentral platform along with a rich suite of applications, modules and services and is also the foundation of our cloud and SaaS offerings.
Media Central
In 2018, we announced the availability of MediaCentral | Cloud UX, Avid’s next-generation media production suite that further extends the Avid MediaCentral platform into the cloud. The MediaCentral platform scales from the simplest to the most sophisticated solutions. Built on a customizable cloud native microservices architecture, MediaCentral platform features a cloud-based user experience that runs on any device, workflow modules for editorial, production, news, graphics, and asset management, with apps to enhance and scale any of those modules, and a wide array of media services and partner connectors. Every user is connected in a completely integrated workflow environment with a user-friendly interface, and gains a unified view into all their media with flexible deployment options for on premises, hybrid or cloud (public/private) environments.
As part of the Avid MediaCentral platform, we also offer an Editorial Management module for smaller creative teams that provides the same robust media management capabilities used by the largest media enterprises in the industry. Integrated within Media Composer via a panel, Editorial Management connects directly to Avid NEXIS storage to provide easy access to media with hyper-search functionality. Editorial Management also extends collaboration capabilities for the assistant editor in an easy to use web interface by allowing Media Composer bin creation, logging and search capabilities, greatly expanding the efficiency of creative teams.
SaaS Solutions
In 2017, we announced a strategic partnership with Microsoft to deliver Azure certified solutions to support end-to-end hybrid and cloud deployments of news workflows. Our partnership includes developing virtualized versions of many of our product offerings, allowing them to run in a private cloud, public cloud or in hybrid deployments, enabling customers to 
4

migrate to more traditional IT infrastructures leveraging IP technology to integrate disparate systems within a broadcast environment. We believe our new SaaS and cloud offerings will allow our customers to (i) scale production while lowering costs, (ii) enable anytime access, boosting efficiency and collaboration and (iii) deliver content quickly and securely to any device, from anywhere. With many of our SaaS and cloud offerings just coming on-line, historical revenue related to SaaS offerings has not been significant, however, we expect these product offerings to be significant growth drivers going forward.
Integrated Solutions
The Integrated Solutions part of our portfolio mainly consists of four common, best-in-class hardware platforms that are combined with tightly integrated software elements to create powerful and highly differentiated solutions - all of which are designed to complement and enhance our overall software strategy.
Avid NEXIS
Our Avid NEXIS family of shared storage systems are real-time, open solutions that bring the power of shared storage to local, regional, national and multinational broadcasters and post-production facilities at competitive prices. Customers can improve allocation of creative resources and support changing project needs with an open, shared storage platform that includes file system technology on lower cost hardware, support for third-party applications and streamlined administration to create more content at an affordable price. Avid NEXIS is the industry’s first and only software-defined storage platform specifically designed for storing and managing media. Avid NEXIS enables fully virtualized storage so media organizations can adjust storage capacity mid-project, without disrupting workflows. Powered by our MediaCentral Platform, Avid NEXIS delivers media storage flexibility, scalability, and control for both Avid-based and third-party workflows. It has been designed to serve small production teams as powerfully as large media enterprises and is built with flexibility to grow with customers at every stage of their business.
S6
Our S6 product line offers customers a range of complementary control surfaces and consoles, leveraging the open industry standard protocol EUCON (Extended User Control) to provide open solutions that meet the needs of customers ranging from the independent professional to the high-end broadcaster. Our Pro Tools | S6 control surface for sound recording, mixing and editing was designed as a state-of-the-art modular solution that scales to meet both current and future customer requirements. S6 is designed for audio professionals in demanding production environments, delivering the performance needed to complete projects faster while producing high quality mixes. Our Artist Series control surfaces offer integrated, hands-on control for price-sensitive applications. Compact and portable, all control surfaces in the Artist line feature EUCON, allowing hands-on control of the user’s applications. Finally, the free Pro Tools | Control iOS app enables customers to record and mix faster and easier than working with a mouse and keyboard alone.
Our VENUE product family and our VENUE | S6L live sound system includes console systems for mixing audio for live sound reinforcement for concerts, theater performances and other public address events. We offer a range of VENUE systems designed for large performance settings, such as stadium concerts, as well as medium-sized theaters and houses of worship. VENUE systems allow the direct integration of Pro Tools solutions to create and playback live recordings.
Maestro
Our Maestro product line offers customers comprehensive solutions for integrating virtual sets, augmented reality and video wall control into existing workflows, ideal for any type of production needs in news, sports, entertainment and in-studio productions, creating greater accessibility, efficiency at scale to enable the delivery of content with graphics faster. Maestro features a core platform that includes a powerful render engine and featured design tool called Maestro | Designer that drives a line-up of applications that are designed to address the specific challenges broadcasters face when automating the integration of statistics and graphics for the creation of an engaging broadcast. By adding graphics capabilities across the entire product line, we enable journalists and producers to add graphics remotely to news stories or enhance any story with innovative stats to drive augmented reality graphics for presenting data in new and compelling ways.
FastServe
5

Our FastServe video server product line assists broadcasters in making the move to UHD and IP based workflows with a new, modular architecture. The Avid FastServe family integrates with the MediaCentral platform, empowering creative teams to deliver content fast for news, sports, entertainment, and other media productions. Its 10GbE interface offers direct connection to Avid NEXIS storage, enabling real-time ingest, editing, and playout, even while media is being captured. Plus, its modular, future-proof architecture fits any budget, improves efficiency, and provides a smooth transition from HD to UHD, and from SDI workflows to video over IP. We also continue to sell and support our on-air server solutions, including AirSpeed 5000 and AirSpeed 5500, which enable broadcasters to automate the ingest and playout of television and news programming.  The AirSpeed 5000 and 5500 video servers work with a wide range of applications to improve workflow and provide cost-efficient ingest and play to air capabilities for broadcasters of any size.

I/O & Processing
We offer a number of hardware products that complement our Media Composer and Pro Tools creative solutions, which include I/O devices, interfaces and audio and video processing equipment.
Customer Support
We offer a variety of service contracts and support plans, allowing each customer to select the level of technical and operational support that they need to maintain their operational effectiveness. Support contracts typically include the right to the latest software updates, call support and in some cases hardware maintenance. Support contracts for individual products are sold bundled with initial product offerings or as renewals once initial contracts have lapsed. Support contracts are also sold on an enterprise basis where a customer purchases support for all Avid products owned. Our Customer Care team provides customers with a partner committed to giving them help and support when they need it. Our global Customer Care team of industry professionals offers a blend of technology expertise and real-world experience throughout the audio, visual, and entertainment industries.  The team’s mission is to provide timely, informed responses to our customers’ issues, and proactive maintenance for our solutions to help our customers maintain high standards of operational effectiveness.
Professional Services
Our Professional Services team delivers workflow design and consulting, program and project management, system installation and commissioning, custom development and role-based product level training. The Professional Services team facilitates the engagement with our customers to maximize their investment in technology, increase their operational efficiency, and enable them to reduce deployment risk and implement our solutions.
Training and Education
Our Education team delivers public and private training to our customers and alliance partners to ensure that they have the necessary skills and technical competencies to deploy, use, administer and create Avid solutions. The Education team develops and licenses curriculum content for use by third party Avid Learning partners to deliver training to customers, users and alliance partners. The Education team includes the Avid Certification program which validates the skills and competency of Avid users, administrators, instructors, support representatives and developers.
COMPETITION
Our customer markets are highly competitive and subject to rapid change and declining average selling prices.  The competitive landscape is fragmented with a large number of companies providing various types of products and services in different markets and geographic areas.  We provide integrated solutions that compete based on total workflow value, features, quality, service, and flexibility of pricing and deployment options.  Companies with which we compete in some contexts may also act as our partners in other contexts, such as large enterprise customer environments.
Certain companies that compete with us across some of our products and solutions are listed below by the market relevant to Avid in which they compete predominantly:
6


• | Broadcast and Media: Belden Inc. (Grass Valley), ChyronHego Corporation, Dalet S.A., Dell Technologies Inc. (EMC Isilon), EVS Corporation, Harmonic Inc., Quantum Corporation, Ross Video Limited, and Vizrt Ltd., among others. 


• | Audio and Video Post and Professional: Ableton AG, Adobe Systems Incorporated, Apple Inc., AudioTonix Limited, Blackmagic Design Pty Ltd, PreSonus Audio Electronics, Inc., and Yamaha Corporation, among others. 

Some of our principal competitors are substantially larger than we are and have greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources than us. For a discussion of these and other risks associated with our competitors, see “Risk Factors” in Item 1A of this Form 10-K.
OPERATIONS
Sales and Services Channels 
We market and sell our products and solutions through a combination of direct, indirect and digital sales channels. Our direct sales channel consists of internal sales representatives serving select customers and markets. Our indirect sales channels include global networks of independent distributors, value-added resellers, system integrators, and retailers. Our digital sales channel is represented by the online Avid Marketplace, and also through the Xchange Market Platform (“XMP”) of some of our key partners and distributors.
We have significant international operations with offices in 20 countries and the ability to reach approximately 170 countries through a combination of our direct sales force and resellers. Sales to customers outside the United States accounted for 64%, 62% and 64%, of our total net revenues in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Additional information about the geographic breakdown of our revenues and long-lived assets can be found in Note O to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K. For additional information about risks associated with our international operations, see “Risk Factors” in Item 1A of this Form 10-K.
We generally ship our products shortly after the receipt of an order. However, a high percentage of our revenues has historically been generated in the third month of each fiscal quarter and concentrated in the latter part of that month. Orders that may exist at the end of a quarter and have not been shipped are not recognized as revenues in that quarter and are included in revenue backlog.
We provide customer care services directly through regional in-house and contracted support centers and major-market field service representatives and indirectly through dealers, value-added resellers and authorized third-party service providers. Depending on the solution, customers may choose from a variety of support offerings, including telephone and online technical support, on-site assistance, hardware replacement and extended warranty, and software upgrades. In addition to customer care services, we offer a broad array of professional services, including installation, integration, planning and consulting services, and customer training.
Manufacturing and Suppliers 
Our manufacturing operations consist primarily of a network of contract manufacturers around the globe to manufacture many of our products, components and subassemblies, and original equipment manufacturers, or OEMs, from whom we purchase finished assemblies. Our products undergo testing and quality assurance at the final assembly stage. In addition to our external manufacturing operations, we also have an internal manufacturing operation consisting primarily of configuring into complete systems the products, board sets, subassemblies and components purchased from third parties, and final assembly and testing of some board sets, software, related hardware components and complete systems.  We depend on sole-source suppliers for many key hardware product components and finished goods, including some critical items. Although we have procedures in place to mitigate the risks associated with our sole-sourced suppliers, we cannot be certain that we will be able to obtain sole-sourced components or finished goods from alternative suppliers or that we will be able to do so on commercially reasonable terms without a material impact on our results of operations or financial position. For the risks associated with our use of contractors and sole-source vendors, see “Risk Factors” in Item 1A of this Form 10-K.
7

Our company-operated manufacturing facilities, primarily for final assembly and testing of certain products, are located in Kfar Saba, Israel, and Dublin, Ireland. Our contract manufacturers and OEMs manufacture our products at a relatively limited number of different facilities located throughout the world and, in most cases, the manufacturing of each of our products is concentrated in one or a few locations. An interruption in manufacturing capabilities at any of these facilities, as a result of equipment failure or other reasons, could reduce, delay or prevent the production of our products. Because some of our manufacturing or our contract manufacturers’ operations are located outside of the United States, including in Israel, Ireland, China, Mexico and Thailand, those manufacturing operations are also subject to additional challenges and risks associated with international operations. For these and other risks associated with our manufacturing operations, see “Risk Factors” in Item 1A of this Form 10-K.
Research and Development
We are committed to delivering best-in-class digital media content-creation solutions that are designed for the unique needs, skills and sophistication levels of our target customer markets as well as a generic media platform for the media industry to host our own as well as our partner solutions. Having helped establish the digital media technology industry, we are building on a 30 year heritage of innovation and leadership in developing content-creation solutions and platforms. We have research and development, or R&D, operations around the globe. Our R&D efforts are focused on the development of digital media content-creation, distribution and monetization tools as well as the media platform. These tools operate primarily on the Mac and on Windows platforms, whereas the media platform primarily operates on Linux platforms. Our R&D efforts also include highly optimized media storage solutions, standards-based media transfer and media asset management tools, as well as ingest and playout solutions to cover the entire workflow. In addition to our internal R&D efforts, we outsource a significant portion of certain R&D projects to an internationally based partner in Kiev, Ukraine. Our R&D expenditures for 2018, 2017 and 2016 were $62.4 million, $68.2 million and $81.6 million, respectively, which represented 15%, 16% and 16% of our total net revenues, respectively. For the risks associated with our use of partners for R&D projects, see “Risk Factors” in Item 1A of this Form 10-K.
Our philosophy is to prioritize research and development investments to take advantage of market opportunities based on the following short-term, medium-term and long-term horizons:

• | Here & Now - Improve performance, solidify core portfolio, improve margins and ignite growth.


• | Emerging - Expand opportunities by pursuing growth areas, extending our product portfolio


• | and expanding market opportunities.


• | Transformational - Build for the future, creating unique defensible differentiation in our products and solutions with disruptive and visionary innovation.

Our company-operated R&D operations are located in: Burlington, Massachusetts; Berkeley, California; Munich, Germany; Kaiserslautern, Germany; Kfar Saba, Israel; Szczecin, Poland; and Montreal, Canada. We also partner with a vendor in Kiev, Ukraine for outsourced R&D services.
Intellectual Property
We regard our software and hardware as proprietary and protect our proprietary interests under the laws of patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets, as well as through contractual provisions.
We have obtained patents and have registered copyrights, trademarks and service marks in the United States and in many foreign countries. At February 8, 2019, we held 123 U.S. patents, with expiration dates through 2037, and had 17 patent applications pending with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. We have also registered or applied to register various trademarks and service marks in the United States and a number of foreign countries, including Avid, Avid Nexis, AirSpeed, EUCON, MediaCentral, Media Composer, Pro Tools and Sibelius. As a technology company, we regard our patents, copyrights, trademarks, service marks and trade secrets as being among our most valuable assets, together with the innovative skills, technical competence and marketing abilities of our personnel.
Our software is licensed to end users pursuant to shrink-wrap, embedded, click-through or signed license agreements. Our products generally contain features to guard against unauthorized use. Policing unauthorized use of computer software is difficult, and software piracy is a persistent problem for us, as it is for the software industry in general. Although we attempt 
8

to protect our intellectual property rights through patents, trademarks, copyrights, licensing arrangements, maintaining certain technology as trade secrets and other measures, there can be no assurance that any patent, trademark, copyright or other intellectual property rights owned by us will not be invalidated, circumvented or challenged, that such intellectual property rights will provide competitive advantages to us, or that any of our pending or future patent applications will be issued with the claims, or the scope of the claims, sought by us, if at all. Others may develop technologies that are similar or superior to our technology, duplicate our technology or design around the patents that we own. In addition, effective patent, copyright and trade secret protection may be unavailable or limited in countries in which we do business or may do business in the future. For these and other risks associated with the protection of our intellectual property, see “Risk Factors” in Item 1A of this Form 10-K.
