Item 1. Business
 
Nano Magic Holdings Inc., a Delaware corporation (“we”, “us”, “our”, “Nano Magic” or the “Company”), formerly Nano Magic Inc., develops, commercializes and markets consumer and industrial products powered by nanotechnology. Our nanotechnology powered solutions are formulated in the Unites States. We are recognized for the products manufactured and sold by our wholly-owned subsidiary Nano Magic LLC (formerly PEN Brands LLC). These include the NANO MAGIC and ULTRA CLARITY brand eyeglass cleaner. Our consumer products include electronic device hygiene & protection, anti-fog solutions, household cleaning and automobile cleaning and protection in addition to lens care. Our focus for consumer products is to sell Nano Magic-branded consumer products in big box retail and direct-to-consumer sales on our website and other on-line marketplaces. We historically sold our consumer products directly to opticians, ophthalmologists and small optical retailers and we will continue to do so. Institutional and industrial applications include cleaning and defogging and other coatings for glass and ceramics. We also develop and sell printable inks and pastes, thermal management materials, and graphene foils and windows through our other wholly-owned subsidiary, Applied Nanotech, Inc. (“Applied Nanotech”). Applied Nanotech also functions as our Innovation and Technology Center in Austin, Texas, and, in addition to performing product development work for our business, engages in contract research and development work for government and private customers.
 
Our principal operating segments coincide with our different business activities. Our two reportable segments for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 were (i) the Product segment and (ii) the Contract Services segment.
 
Product Segment
 
In our Product segment, revenue is based on the retail and institutional sale of specialty products utilizing nanotechnology to deliver unique performance attributes. We have a strong focus on understanding surfaces and our products for surfaces can be used on a wide variety of substrates. Our consumer products are sold as liquids, gels, foam and as wet and dry towelettes. Institutional coating products are typically sold in liquid form enabling application by a variety of common commercial techniques We rely on intellectual property including trade secret formulations to protect our proprietary technology.
 
We have multiple product technology platforms that offer solutions to common surface problems such as ease of cleaning, preventing fogging, preventing accumulation of dirt or grime, improving resistance to scuffing and wear and surface protection. All our products have some “nano” characteristic about them – whether it is being active at the molecular level, incorporation of submicron-particles, or creating very thin, self-assembling coatings that are 20 nanometers or less in thickness.
 
Our consumer products are primarily customized cleaning and protection solutions. With respect to our consumer products, we strive to create segment leading brands for solutions that are sustainable, of high quality, and that are both easy and safe to apply. Recently we introduced a new product that combines antifog and cleaning into one for convenience for our users. This, and other products can be used on eyeglasses, safety goggles and glasses, extreme sport glasses, goggles and visors. Our solutions are also packaged for use on electronic screens, windows, mirrors, shower doors, and other similar clear surfaces along with the cleaning of everyday household surfaces. We have also expanded into the auto care sector with Force Field® windshield protection. This product creates a non-stick, super water repellent protective barrier — like a force field — to protect the windshield against rain, bugs, and salt. The coating solution is easy-to-apply and improves visibility and safety while driving.
 
Industrial surface treatment products include a family of coating liquids that create nano-thin, strongly-bound, invisible, “forcefield”-like coatings on surfaces used for glass and ceramic surfaces and a series of clear coatings for plastics incorporating submicron sized particles to improve abrasion resistance and wear resistance without sacrificing transparency. We manufacture our formulations internally to protect our technology and strive to maintain the highest quality for the products that we and our commercial partners bring to the marketplace.

In addition to our surface treatment products, we sell metallic inks and pastes to a variety of customers around the world. The submicron particles in our formulations are compatible with the nozzles used in digital printing, including 3D printing. Certain products based on nano-copper are available only outside Asia under agreements with our former research partner Ishihara Chemical Company, Ltd., that has exclusive rights in Asia to patents developed under research contracts with them. Other copper products that we sell are available worldwide.
 
In the medical field, our thin carbon foil made of layers of graphene is sold for use in cyclotron accelerators that produce nuclear pharmaceuticals used by the medical field in Positron Emission Tomography (PET) imaging.
 
Our vision is to harness the power of nanotechnology to create a safer, more socially conscious, and higher performing world. We have three primary areas of focus:
 

1. | Surface cleaning for safety, time and cost savings: Treating surfaces at the nano-scale for easy clean performance – to clean better and to stay cleaner longer; 
---+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. | Preventing fogging: Surface treatments at the nano-scale to prevent fogging for safety and improved performance, especially on lenses, sportwear and protective eyewear; and 
3. | Sustainability: Creating nano-scale devices and formulas using safe, natural ingredients and manufacturing methods while avoiding the use of harsh chemicals and pesticides, whenever possible.

Marketing and Distribution
 
We sell our Nano Magic branded consumer products directly to consumers and retailers in the United States and through a distributor in Canada. Direct-to-consumer sales are through our website, nanomagic.com, on Amazon and other online marketplaces. We also have products in pharmacies, and big box retailers. Sales to big box retailers also include private label products under the retailers’ names. Some of our products are incorporated into our customer’s branded products. We continue direct sales to opticians and ophthalmologists.
 
Our industrial coating products, inks and pastes, and graphene foil products are sold directly to institutional and industrial customers.
 
Manufacturing Operations
 
We manufacture, pack and label liquids and towelettes as well as specialty surface coatings at our 29,220-square foot facility in Madison Heights, Michigan. Metallic inks and pastes and the graphene windows are made at our Innovation and Technology Center in Austin, Texas. Health and safety protocols related to the COVID-19 pandemic are in effect at our facilities, but both our facilities are operating.
Intellectual Property and Proprietary Rights
 
Our nanotechnology expertise and the related intellectual property used in our current products is specialized in the areas of surface science, molecular self-assembly, transparent composites, surfactants, sub-micron metallic inks and pastes and graphene foils. The intellectual property developed from this work is protected with a combination of selective patents and primarily by trade secrets. This intellectual property strategy is like that used by leading companies in the fragrance and flavors industry. No single patent is significant to any of our commercial products. Please refer to the section entitled “Intellectual Property Rights” in this Item 1 for a more detailed discussion of these matters.
Competition
 
Products sold into the optical segment, which has historically been our core sales channel, have a small number of significant competitors. Our products are known to be the “benchmark” products in these segments and generally outperform those of our competitors. Some of our products in these segments do compete for certain customers or certain applications against lower-priced, traditional materials. Most of the companies selling products into these market segments are privately-held U.S. packaging or catalog companies. Examples in the U.S. include Hilco Accessories, California Accessories, and Amcon Laboratories. Internationally, the catalog company, Prosben, Inc., from the Peoples Republic of China is a competitor. These companies are not selling direct to consumer or in big box retail and pharmacies. Optical company, Carl Zeiss, sells its branded optical products in big box retail in those chains where it has optical stores.
 
In the nano-coating products area or the anti-fog product line we are not aware of any competitive products that we believe match our product performance or processing characteristics. With the COVID-19 pandemic and fogging caused by increased use of masks, other companies have made more of an effort to sell anti-fog products and there were new entrants into this market, but no company has a significant portion of the market.
 
Most inks and pastes sold in commercial quantities today are manufactured and sold by large multinational chemical companies. For example, the two largest suppliers of silver inks and pastes for solar cell production are DuPont and Ferro. We are unable to compete directly with companies of that size in established silver ink markets. The use of metallic inks in 2D and 3D printing is just developing. Because silver is expensive, other metals are preferred for these applications. Numerous other companies are working with other technologies for the commercial use of conductive inks and pastes.

Backlog
 
Sales are primarily made under purchase orders for delivery of products. We do not believe that a backlog as of any date is indicative of future results. Some agreements give customers the right to purchase a specific quantity of products during a specified period, but these agreements do not obligate the customers to purchase any minimum quantity. Private label customers are required to commit either to minimums or to repurchase unique inventory items related to their product(s). The quantities purchased by the customer, as well as the shipment schedules, are frequently revised during the agreement term to reflect changes in the customer’s needs. Because of our relatively small size, a customer’s delay of a product shipment can make a difference in the results for an accounting period.
Geographical Information
 
All long-lived assets are in the United States.
 
Sources and availability of raw materials and the names of principal suppliers
 
We use third-party suppliers in the United States to obtain substantially all raw materials, components and packaging products. As is customary in our industry, historically we have not had long-term or exclusive agreements with third-party suppliers and have generally made purchases through purchase orders. In the last quarter of 2018 and first quarter of 2019 we terminated most of our outside contract and toll manufacturing, bringing our manufacturing back in house. We believe that we have good relationships with our suppliers.
 
Apart from the disruption affecting all manufacturing businesses as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, some of the raw materials and bottles used to produce our liquid products are used to produce hand sanitizer and other cleaning product that were in high demand during the pandemic and some of our raw materials and packaging became harder to find due to the COVID-19 pandemic, but we were able to obtain what we needed for our operations. With some suppliers we have moved to blanket purchase orders and have seen some price increases, but this has not disrupted operations.
 
Key Customers
 
A limited number of key customers historically accounted for a majority of our revenue in the Product segment. The company re-built its customer base in 2021 and 2020 with the addition of new sales channels. In 2021 four customers represented 52% of Product revenue, and in 2020, two customers represented 21% of Product revenue. A limited number of customers constitute substantially all of our Contract services segment. In 2021, two customers provided 100% of revenue in the Contract services segment and, in 2020, three customers represented 92% of revenue in that segment.
 
Impact of COVID-19
 
In December 2019, COVID-19 was first reported in Wuhan, China. Less than four months later, on March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic. During the rest of 2020, restrictions imposed by Federal, state and local governments affected operations of our business and those of our vendors and customers as well as logistics for shipping and receiving supplies and shipping our products. We experienced longer lead-times to receive supplies and price increases on some items, but did not suffer any major disruption and these changes have been incorporated into our operating procedures and business.
 
The increased use of face masks and other personal protective equipment as a result of the pandemic created additional demand for our antifog product. Whether this will continue as government restrictions are lifted and COVID-19 related recommendations for mask wearing become less restrictive is unknown.
 
Whether the effects of COVID-19 restrictions on businesses and our customers generally, and on our business in particular, will continue, and how this will change with changes in government restrictions over time, or from other effects of the COVID-19 pandemic is unknown.

Contract Services Segment
 
Our Contract services segment functions as the Innovation and Technology Center for our new products as well as performing work for government agencies and private strategic partners. Formerly called the research and development segment, this segment has moved away from areas of research that do not involve product development, especially government contracts that required us to fund part of the research cost. This segment is involved in development work under contract for government and private entities. The Center is also a resource for proof of concepts and prototypes for proposed Nano Magic products. Our work generally falls under one of three technology platforms:

● | Printed sensors; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Printed electronics; and 
● | Submicron particle formulations and materials for health and safety products. 

 
Much of our contract product development work is done under government contracts. Government contracts frequently limit profit on work done. With private development contracts, there is a relationship between revenues received under the contract and rights granted to the licensee under the contract. Our short-term goal when we work for others is to cover all out-of-pocket costs and contribute to our overall overhead. Our long-term goal is to become a trusted supplier of products to our development partners.
 
Nanoelectronics Applications – Inks and Pastes
 
Metallic Inks & Pastes
 
Copper Inks - New digital and additive manufacturing processes allow industries to move from the design process directly to the production line. We believe that only submicron particles are capable of producing inks that are compatible with the nozzles used in digital printing.
 
Other metallic inks – Our technology and development work in conductive inks also resulted in inks and pastes using nickel, copper-nickel alloy, silver, indium, and aluminum. Research partners who funded some of our work using silver and aluminum have exclusive rights to certain products for solar applications. We are not restricted in using products for other applications, and we can sell into the solar field our products that do not infringe those specific patents.
 
These different inks can be used in printed electronics as well as printed sensors.
 
Technical Inks Printing Solution (TIPS)
 
Conductive inks have the potential to revolutionize many types of electronics manufacturing. Our strategy is to provide a comprehensive solution for end users not just by developing inks, but assisting in the process from start to finish. We call this our Technical Inks Printing Solution. We have also formed relationships with hardware manufacturers with the goal of providing seamless integration into high volume manufacturing for companies wishing to use conductive inks in their manufacturing processes. In addition to traditional 2D printing applications, we developed multifunctional inks for 3D printing applications, the fastest growing segment of printed electronics.
 
We also build on our expertise in inks and pastes to work with potential customers to develop inks to their specifications for their products in development. Product sales typically come from repeat business or from customer inquiries in our areas of expertise.
 
Sensors
 
Our approach to sensor technology offers the unique advantage of recognizing and sometimes measuring materials at the molecular level. Our competition in the sensor area will come from a variety of technologies and companies depending on the purpose and use of the sensor. The areas where we are currently active are described below.
 
Hydrogen and Methane Sensors. Hydrogen sensors were initially targeted for use in fuel cells for automobiles and for remote monitoring of large power transformers. We developed a hydrogen sensor for use in the measurement of hydrogen in power transformer products. Currently, we are not aware of commercial interest in hydrogen sensors.

Methane gas detectors that we developed for use in the natural gas industry under funding from the Northeast Gas Association have achieved UL 1484 certification for Residential Gas Detectors. In 2018, the Northeast Gas Association completed a field test and reliability study of these sensors. The results have led to further work to improve the performance of these detectors beyond the UL 1484 standards. Northeast Gas Association has told us that they have a commercialization partner. Following that, in 2020 we reached agreement with the Northeast Gas Association to license to our background intellectual property pursuant to which we will be entitled to a percentage of revenue from any commercial sales through March 31, 2028. It is our understanding that the Northeast Gas Association is not presently working to commercialize its sensor technology.
 
Submicron Particle Formulations and Materials for Health and Safety Applications
 
Using our experience with metallic inks and our prior work with carbon nanotube composites we developed a new graphene foil that is used by institutional customers who make nuclear pharmaceuticals for medical imaging applications. We have developed mountings for the foil and have developed foils that include both carbon nanotubes and graphene for longer life in cyclotron applications. We have built on this experience to develop targets to be used by customers in this industry.
 
Related to the Company’s contract services revenue, three customers accounted for 100% and 92% of contract services revenue in 2021 and 2020, respectively. All three of those customers were government entities in 2021 and 2020.
 
Intellectual Property Rights
 
An important part of our overall business and product development strategy is to protect our intellectual property and, when appropriate, we seek patent protection for our products and proprietary technology. Trade secret protection is most important to our products. Our patent portfolio consists of approximately a dozen issued patents.
 
The patenting of technology-related products and processes involves uncertain and complex legal and factual questions. The legal standards change from time to time, and administrative and court interpretations are not always consistent in one jurisdiction, or across different jurisdictions. Therefore, there is no assurance what scope of protection any issued patents will provide, or whether any such patents ultimately will be upheld as valid by a court of competent jurisdiction in the event of a legal challenge. The costs of such proceedings would be significant and an unfavorable outcome could result in the loss of rights to the invention at issue in the proceedings.
 
If we fail to obtain patents or elect not to file for patent protection, there can be no assurance that we can protect our rights in the technology, or that others will not independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary products and techniques, or otherwise gain access to our technology.
 
Competitors have filed applications for, or have been issued, patents, and may obtain additional patents and proprietary rights relating to products or processes used in, necessary to, competitive with, or otherwise related to, our patents. The scope and validity of these patents, and the extent to which we may be required to obtain licenses under these patents or under other proprietary rights and the cost and availability of licenses is unknown. This may limit our ability to use and to license our technology. Litigation concerning these or other patents could be protracted and expensive. If suit were brought against us for patent infringement, we could potentially challenge the validity of the other patent but would need to overcome a presumption of validity. If we were found to infringe and the patent was held valid (or was unchallenged), there could be no assurance that the prevailing party would grant us a license. Even if a license were available, the payments that would be required would be unknown and could materially reduce the value of our interest in the affected products.
 
We require our employees, directors, consultants, outside scientific collaborators, sponsored researchers, and other advisors to execute confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of employment or consulting relationships with us. These agreements provide that all confidential information developed or made known to the individual through the relationship is to be kept confidential and not disclosed to third parties except in specific circumstances. In the case of employees and some consultants, the agreements provide that all inventions conceived by the individual while working for us will be our property. There is no assurance, however, that these agreements will provide sufficient protection for our trade secrets in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of such information.

Government Contracts
 
A portion of our revenue in the Contract services segment consists of reimbursement of expenditures under U.S. government contracts. Our revenue from government contracts was $376,105 and $683,422 for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. These reimbursements represented all or a portion of the costs associated with such contracts. As of December 31, 2021, we had one government contract in process that had approximately $90,762 of potential revenue yet to be recognized. Government contracts are subject to delays and risk of cancellation. Also, in the ordinary course of business, government contractors generally are subject to audits and reviews by government agencies. These audits and reviews involve review of a contractor’s performance on its contracts, as well as its pricing practices, the costs incurred and compliance with all laws, regulations and standards. We have been audited by the government, with no material changes, and we do not expect the results of any government audit to have a significant effect on our operations or our financial statements.
Research and Development
 
Research and development drive our new products and improvement of existing products. Research and development costs incurred in the development of the Company’s products was $34,875 for the year ended December 31, 2021. Research and development costs were $56,816 for 2020. This represented approximately 0.9% and 2.2% of our total operating costs in each of those years. The ability to engineer product performance using nanotechnology is one of the ways we distinguish our products in marketing and sales of our products. Product research and development work includes branding and packaging, development and refinement of formulas, engineering of liquid formulas that can be applied both by hand and by machine, optimization for a variety of performance characteristics, testing and characterization, and work on manufacturing processes and techniques both for producing the product, and for a customer’s use of the product.
 
Compliance with Laws and Regulations
 
Our operations must satisfy governmental safety standards. Applicable safety standards are established by the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (“OSHA”), pollution control standards by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) and other state and local regulations, including foreign regulation for products manufactured or shipped outside the U.S. We take these requirements into account in product development. Cost of compliance with these regulations has not been significant in the past and we do not expect it to be material in the future.
 
OSHA, the EPA, the CDRH and other governmental agencies, both in the United States, the states where we or our customers sell products, and foreign countries, may adopt additional rules and regulations that may affect us and products using our technology. The cost of compliance with these regulations has not been significant to us in the past and is not expected to be material in the future. Changing regulations can affect our customers, and we have in the past, and may be required in the future, to reformulate or change packaging to address regulatory issues. This can affect timing of sales which may be significant in an accounting period.
 
Our commercial products do not require any government approvals.
 
Employees
 
As of December 31, 2021, we had 35 full-time employees. Our employees are valued team members and are important to our growth and success. This is especially true given our relatively small size. By cross-training so that individuals can master a number of different tasks, we try to create a more challenging work environment and minimize disruption in the case of absence or employee departures. We strive to provide a positive work environment emphasizing a positive attitude, team work and ethical behavior. We are not subject to any collective bargaining agreements, and we consider our relations with our employees to be good.
