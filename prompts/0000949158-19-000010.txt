General
At Cray, we believe the questions visionaries pose are a force for discovery, especially those that challenge the limits of possibility. For decades, we have partnered with these visionaries, arming them with advanced and creative supercomputing capabilities so they can question, investigate, and, ultimately, shape the future.
As we look ahead, we see opportunities at the convergence of data and discovery—where artificial intelligence (AI) and data analytics unite with supercomputing. We believe Cray is uniquely positioned at this intersection to partner with visionaries who aspire to turn insight into application and discovery into disruption.
Our focus is on the design, development, manufacture, marketing, and servicing of computing products that magnify and enhance human capital, foster discovery and innovation, and create scientific break-throughs, as well as competitive advantages. That means our products are aimed primarily at the high end of the high-performance computing (HPC), data analytics, and AI markets—the segments populated by the pioneers, executives, and entrepreneurs leading their industries in both the public and private sectors. These products include compute systems commonly known as supercomputers, as well as high-performance storage, data analytics, and AI solutions. We offer them individually, integrated into a complete solution, or hosted in the cloud, depending on a customer’s needs. We also provide related software and system maintenance, support, and engineering services. 
We provide solutions based on four main models: (1) tightly integrated supercomputing designed throughout for scalability and sustained performance; (2) customizable cluster supercomputing based on highest-performance, industry-standard components; (3) robust high-performance storage solutions; and (4) integrated solutions for graph analysis, large-scale analytics, and AI applications. 
Close customer partnerships are fundamental to our business. The questions driving our customers’ work inform our product direction and, in turn, our products combined with our customer engagement enable users to ask the next, more complex questions to investigate, discover, and further their efforts. To facilitate customer success, we also provide customized service from installation to 24x7 on-site support. Our customers include domestic and foreign governments and government-funded entities, academic institutions, and commercial companies. 
Our continuing strategy is to gain market share by extending our technology leadership and differentiation, as well as expanding our addressable market in areas where we can leverage our experience and technology, such as in AI applications and data analytics.

Overview
Huge growth in data volumes and data complexity, the development of advanced algorithmic techniques, and increased time-to-value requirements are driving the need for supercomputing-class architectures. We believe that our experience building some of the largest supercomputers in the world has positioned us to address the data analytics and fast-growing AI markets with products that apply supercomputing technologies to solve the most challenging use cases at scale.
Our supercomputing products span a broad performance spectrum and address the critical computing resource challenges HPC users face today: achieving massive scaling to tens of thousands of processors, ease of use for increased productivity, and very high levels of sustained performance on applications. We achieve this by partnering with users to understand what is limiting them and then designing and integrating supercomputers that help clear those obstacles. Our systems combine highly capable processors, high-speed interconnect technology, and innovative packaging to address increased thermal requirements driven by density and processor power requirements, upgradability, energy efficiency, and system reliability. In addition, our robust HPC-optimized software environment enhances performance, productivity, and manageability at supercomputing scale across a variety of computing technologies. 
Our storage and data management products include integrated data storage solutions designed to support systems requiring the high performance requirements needed for supercomputing and data-intensive workloads. These solutions leverage years of experience delivering high-performance parallel storage and file systems to leading-edge customers. With our storage solutions, 
3

users can also rapidly deploy highly scalable and extremely fast file systems that integrate with supercomputer and cluster computing solutions from both Cray and third-party HPC vendors. 
Products, Services and Customer Support
We concentrate on building product solutions in two major markets: the supercomputing portion of the HPC market and the high-end of the big data market, including storage and AI solutions. We also provide related software and system maintenance, support, and engineering services that leverage our intimate understanding of our customers and their requirements.
Cray Supercomputing Systems
Today, HPC customers who require the highest levels of scaling and performance choose our Cray XC series supercomputer. The XC series provides optimized compute density, an HPC-integrated software stack, and sustained performance at scale for customers’ computing needs. For systems that emphasize flexibility, capacity, custom design, and integration for compute-intensive needs, customers choose our Cray CS series cluster supercomputers, which include our CS500 and CS-Storm systems.
Our supercomputing roadmap, including our next generation “Shasta” system, is designed to take us from today’s computational demands to the exascale era (where systems will have exaflops performance, or a billion billion calculations a second—1,000 times faster than the petascale systems that were first introduced only about a decade ago). Our products will continue to integrate diverse technologies into a unified architecture enabling customers to match the computational solution to their desired outcome. 
Cray XC Series Supercomputer. The Cray XC series supercomputer is our highly integrated supercomputing system. It provides extreme scale, sustained performance, and heterogeneous computational resources through the combination of processor options, the Aries interconnect and its unique Dragonfly network topology, our fully integrated software environment, and innovative power and cooling technologies. A single Cray XC system can run both a highly scalable custom workload and an industry-standard, independent software vendor (ISV) workload.
The Cray XC series supercomputer has the following software features to handle challenging applications: the Cray Linux Environment, a suite of high-performance software optimized over more than a decade; powerful compiler, runtime, and related software leveraging the underlying hardware components; many optimized applications, such as Fortran and C++ applications, applications written in languages such as Python and Scala, as well as Cray’s Chapel parallel programming language; and the ability to run applications natively or leverage container technologies. Cray XC users can also run analytics and AI workloads alongside modeling and simulation workloads, using our Urika-XC analytics software, familiar system tools, and schedulers.
The Cray XC50 supercomputer supports the newest generation of processors—Intel x86 processors, Marvell ARM-based processors, and NVIDIA GPUs—which, coupled with the Aries network and Cray’s HPC-optimized software stack including the Cray Linux Environment and Cray Programing Environment, deliver our fastest system with peak system performance of up to 500 petaflops (PF) and 1 PF in a single cabinet.
The Cray XC50-AC air-cooled supercomputer offers all the benefits of the Cray XC50 system in a smaller form factor. Like the Cray XC system, it supports the newest generation x86 processors, ARM-based processors, and GPUs. The XC50-AC can deliver up to 236 teraflops peak performance in a 24” cabinet with no requirement for liquid cooling or extra blower cabinets.
Cray CS500 Cluster Supercomputer. The Cray CS500 cluster supercomputing system is a modular, highly scalable, high availability platform designed for a broad range of workloads in an industry standard form factor. It offers an energy-efficient, air-cooled architecture and comes integrated with a comprehensive and easy to manage HPC software stack, software tools compatible with most open source and commercial compilers, tools, schedulers, and libraries. It supports Cray and third-party systems management software solutions.
Cray CS-Storm Accelerated GPU Supercomputer. The CS-Storm supercomputer employs GPUs in a high-density architecture to deliver industry-leading performance, density, and energy efficiency. The CS-Storm 500NX system supports up to eight GPUs connected by the NVIDIA NVLink high-speed network. The CS-Storm 500GT maximizes network bandwidth with up to four network links per node with up to 10 GPU or field-programmable gate array (FPGA) cards per node all running at full power. CS-Storm configurations feature the same HPC software environment as the CS500 cluster system and Urika-CS AI and analytics software making them machine and deep learning ready.
Shasta: Exascale-Class Supercomputing. We expect the continued advancement of many-core and accelerator processors, the increasing diversity of processor architectures, and the changing memory and storage hierarchy to be advantageous trends for Cray. They complement our strengths in networking, scaling, system software, and cooling and power management technologies. The growing number of cores on each processor continues to amplify scaling issues, and accelerators or coprocessors will further 
4

stress the system’s communications network. We believe our balanced approach to system design and support for innovative parallel programming methodologies will become increasingly critical to capitalize on the benefits of many-core processing.
In November 2018, we announced our future exascale-class supercomputer product line, the next generation system code-named Shasta, expected to be commercially available in the fourth quarter of 2019. This system will represent an entirely new design and is set to be the technology that underpins the next era of supercomputing—an era characterized by exascale performance capability, new data-centric workloads, and an explosion of processor architectures.
With Shasta, we expect to further realize our long-time vision of adapting supercomputing systems to workloads using optimized processing and networking. The system represents sweeping innovations in hardware and software, incorporating our proprietary next-generation Cray system software to enable modularity and extensibility, a new Cray-designed interconnect, unparalleled flexibility in processing choice within a system, and a software environment that provides for seamless scalability.
Fundamental to Shasta’s exascale capability is Slingshot, our new high-speed, purpose-built supercomputing interconnect. Slingshot will have up to five times more bandwidth per node than our current highly successful Aries network and is designed for data-centric computing. It will feature Ethernet compatibility, advanced adaptive routing, first-of-a-kind congestion control, and sophisticated quality-of-service capabilities.
Workloads today are rapidly evolving, making it difficult to choose the optimal architecture. Shasta is expected to meet the rising demand for single systems to handle converged modeling, simulation, AI, and analytics workloads with a data-centric design that allows it to run diverse workloads and workflows, all at the same time. It will eliminate the distinction between clusters and supercomputers with a single supercomputing system architecture that offers significant flexibility.
Any processor choice—or heterogeneous mix—will be able to be incorporated with a single management and application development infrastructure. Customers will be able to flex from single to multi-socket processor nodes, GPUs, FPGAs, and other processing options that will emerge, such as AI-specialized accelerators, in the same system. Shasta will also allow for interconnect choices with those from Cray (Slingshot), Intel (Omni-Path), or Mellanox (InfiniBand). The Shasta systems’ hardware and software innovations tackle bottlenecks, manageability, and job completion issues that emerge or are magnified as core counts grow, compute node architectures proliferate, and workflows expand to incorporate AI at scale. 
Software
Core to our supercomputing leadership is our proprietary Cray software. We have extensive experience designing, developing, and adapting system software as an integral aspect of our product portfolio and distributing that software as part of system sales. This system software includes the operating system, system management, optimized data management, movement and analysis, and programming environment. Our software research and development expertise includes operating system optimizations and scalable hardware control, monitoring and management, including power control, monitoring of environmental data, and hardware diagnostics. Our integrated system software together provides reliability, availability, and serviceability (RAS) for Cray systems. The Cray programming environment includes our own and commercially available third-party compilers, communication and scientific libraries, as well as a rich suite of application development tools and software designed for maximizing application performance. We believe this suite of products provides Cray with a competitive advantage and allows us more flexibility in adopting new processing technologies as they become available.

The application features job runtime variability for real-time and historical views of data, event correlation, trend analysis, and customized alerts all from a single view.
Cray DataWarp Applications Accelerator. Our DataWarp technology addresses a key problem experienced by supercomputing customers: disk-based storage I/O has not been able to keep up with improvements in processor performance and delivering sustainable performance on a spectrum of applications with varying I/O-intensive workloads has become costly and impractical. DataWarp provides a new tier of storage featuring solid-state drives (SSD) and software that is tightly integrated with Cray XC series supercomputing resources. DataWarp supports high application I/O requirements while reducing overall application computing time for I/O-intensive workloads. Production customers have increased the I/O bandwidth of their production supercomputing systems by over two times, enhancing their ability to make scientific discoveries faster.
Customer Support
Our worldwide customer support organization delivers the “Cray experience.” This unique, high-quality support relationship gives us a competitive advantage and plays an important role in our ability to maintain long-term customer relationships. Support services are important to our customers and, in many cases, we locate our support personnel at or near customer sites globally, supported by a central service organization. Our support services include hardware and software maintenance in support of our systems, applications support, installation project management, system installation and de-installation, site preparation, and technical training for our systems. In addition, we offer ancillary services in application consulting, third-party software support, site engineering, on-site analysts for defined projects, and specialized training. Our support arrangements generally provide for support services on an annual basis, although many cover multiple years. While most customers pay for support on an annual basis, others pay on a monthly, quarterly, or multi-year basis. Typically, customers may select levels of support and response times ranging from delivery of parts only to 24x7 coverage with two-hour response times.
Sales and Marketing 
We focus our sales and marketing activities on both horizontal and vertical marketing activities ranging from government agencies or government-funded research laboratories to academic institutions and commercial entities requiring HPC, big data systems, and storage. Cray has a bi-modal sales model. We offer solutions through a highly-trained direct sales force operating throughout North America, South America, Asia, Europe, the Middle East, Australia, and Africa. More than half of our sales force is located in the United States and Canada, with the remainder overseas. Cray also sells its systems and technology through a growing network of authorized partners, which currently include Sirius Computer Solutions Inc. and World Wide Technology, while Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Dell Inc., and Atos/Bull are among authorized ClusterStor resellers.
A formal request-for-proposal process for HPC systems or technology drives a majority of our large systems sales and engineering service engagements in the academic and government markets. We utilize pre-sales technical experts to develop technical proposals that meet customer requirements and benchmarking teams to demonstrate the advantages of our particular supercomputing and storage products or services being proposed. For a majority of our larger sales opportunities, the proposal process, including establishing system size, options, pricing, and other commitments, involves a number of resources outside of our sales organization. While we often tailor our supercomputer (including cluster) solutions for individual customers, there is substantial commonality in the underlying components and systems, allowing us to leverage manufacturing and supply chain operations.
Government agencies and government-funded scientific research institutions around the world comprise a large portion of our customer base. We actively manage our relationship with U.S. government agencies and Congress.
Manufacturing and Supply Chain
We subcontract the manufacture of a majority of the hardware sub-assemblies and certain components for our high-end products and custom-engineered systems, including integrated circuits, printed circuit boards, storage enclosures, connectors, cables, and power supplies, on a sole or limited source basis to third-party suppliers. We use contract manufacturers to assemble certain components. Our manufacturing strategy currently centers on build-to-order systems, focusing on obtaining competitive 
6

assembly and component costs while concentrating our resources on the high-value components, final assembly, test, and quality assurance stages to ensure a positive customer experience. This strategy allows us to avoid the large capital commitment and overhead associated with establishing full-scale manufacturing facilities; helps us to maintain the flexibility to adopt new technologies as they become available without the risk of equipment obsolescence; provides near real-time configuration changes to exploit faster and/or less expensive technologies; and, provides a higher level of large scale system quality. Our manufacturing personnel are located in Chippewa Falls, Wisconsin. 
Our systems designed for the supercomputer market segment and our custom-engineered solutions incorporate components that are available from single or limited sources, often containing our design input or proprietary designs. Such components include integrated circuits, interconnect systems, and certain memory devices. Prior to the development of a particular product, components are typically competitively bid to a short list of technology partners. The technology partner that provides the highest value solution for the component is often awarded the contract for the life of the component. Once we have engaged a technology partner, changing our product designs to utilize another supplier’s standard or custom components can be a costly and time-consuming process. We also have sole or limited sources for less critical components, such as peripherals, power supplies, cooling, and chassis hardware. We obtain key processor components from Intel, NVIDIA, AMD, Marvel, and other vendors from time to time for our Cray XC and cluster systems. We have a license for the Aries interconnect chip that we developed but later transferred to Intel that we purchase from Broadcom Corporation (formerly Avago) that contracts with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company for the manufacture of the application specific integrated circuit (ASIC). Our procurements from these vendors are primarily through purchase orders. We have chosen to deal with sole sources in specific cases due to the availability of specific technologies, economic advantages, and other factors. Reliance on single or limited source vendors involves several risks, including the possibility of shortages of key components, long lead times, reduced control over delivery schedules, design or persistent quality issues, and changes in direction by vendors. We have been adversely affected by delays in obtaining qualified competitive components previously.

IBM, Intel, NEC, and Fujitsu also build systems leveraging their own processors. In addition, certain Chinese companies are investing significantly in HPC and are becoming more aggressive and competitive in the HPC global arena. Our competitors include the previously named companies as well as smaller companies that assemble systems from commercially available commodity products. The Cray CS500 and CS-Storm supercomputing cluster products are designed to help us better address this market by providing flexible HPC alternatives with competitive pricing. To the extent that Intel, AMD, NVIDIA, IBM, and other processor suppliers develop processors or networks with greater capabilities or at lower cost than the processors we use in our products at any given time, including from Intel, AMD, Marvell, and NVIDIA, our systems may be at a competitive disadvantage to systems utilizing such other processors.
The competitive landscape in the big data, AI, and analytics market is quite varied, with competition from vendors offering integrated solutions, such as IBM, commodity cluster systems with either open source or proprietary machine learning and data analytics software, traditional business intelligence vendors, such as Teradata, Oracle, IBM, SAS, and SAP, and offerings from cloud providers. In particular, the AI market is nascent and rapidly evolving. Early adopters who are now deploying large, mission-critical AI and analytics problems have discovered that commodity or cloud-based approaches do not scale or deliver results in an acceptable timeframe and have recognized the advantages of tightly integrated solutions. Our Cray Urika-XC and Urika-CS AI and analytics software suites, combined with our Cray XC and CS platforms—which compete primarily on the basis of performance, scalability, integration, and total cost of ownership—are an alternative for users at all scales. 
8

Our storage products compete with a number of manufacturers and integrators of parallel storage solutions, including IBM with its Spectrum Scale parallel file system, as well as solutions from Data Direct Networks, Lenovo, NetApp, Dell EMC, and other storage companies.
