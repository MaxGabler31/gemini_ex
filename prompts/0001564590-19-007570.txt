ITEM 1. 
BUSINESS
 Mid-Con Energy Partners, LP, is a publicly held Delaware limited partnership formed in July 2011 that engages in the ownership, acquisition and development of producing oil and natural gas properties in North America, with a focus on EOR. Our general partner is Mid-Con Energy GP, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company. Our limited partner units (“common units”) are listed under the symbol “MCEP” on the NASDAQ. 
Overview
 We operate as one business segment engaged in the ownership, acquisition and development of producing oil and natural gas properties. As of December 31, 2018, our properties were located in Oklahoma, Texas and Wyoming core areas. Our properties primarily consist of mature, legacy onshore oil reservoirs with long-lived, relatively predictable production profiles and low production decline rates.
 Our management team has significant industry experience, especially with waterflood projects and, as a result, our operations focus primarily on enhancing the development of producing oil properties through waterflooding. Waterflooding, a form of secondary oil recovery, works by displacing or “sweeping” oil to producing wellbores. As of December 31, 2018, 60% of our net proved reserves were being produced under waterflood, on a Boe basis. Through the continued development of our existing properties and through future acquisitions, we seek to increase our reserves and production in order to make and, over time, increase distributions to our unitholders. In order to enhance the stability of our cash flow for the benefit of our unitholders, we generally hedge a portion of our production volumes through various commodity derivative contracts.
 Our oil and natural gas production and reserve data as of December 31, 2018, were as follows:
  
• | we had total estimated proved reserves of 24.8 MMBoe, of which 96% were oil and 75% were proved developed;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | we owned a working interest in 2,182 wells, 98% operated through our affiliate, Mid-Con Energy Operating;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | average production for the month ended December 31, 2018, was 6,238 gross (3,635 net) Boe/d; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | our total estimated proved reserves had an average reserve-to-production ratio of 19 years.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our Business Strategy and Competitive Strengths
 Our primary business objective is to create long-term stakeholder value through management of current cash flow and long-term reserves. Our goal is to increase the value of our properties through a combination of waterflood development and efficiently operating long-lived, low-decline, mature properties. The key elements of our strategy are:

• | concentrate on competitive strengths;
--+--------------------------------------


• | pursue acquisitions with the potential to create value through our core strengths;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | maintain and increase long-lived, low-decline reserve base;
--+------------------------------------------------------------


• | maintain a high degree of operational control and high working interest; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | optimize cash flow.
--+--------------------

 These elements are primarily focused on conventional, primarily oil assets in Oklahoma, Texas and Wyoming.
 Concentrate on competitive strengths. We focus our attention on assets that have value creation potential through waterflood development and on conventional, primarily oil assets that have complex histories where we can create value through operational enhancements. We have a successful history of economically adding significant production and reserves through waterflooding in Oklahoma and Texas. In 2018, we began acquiring assets in Wyoming where we believe we can continue this track record of adding economic reserves and production through waterflooding. We have also been successful at increasing margins, and consequently value, in conventional, long-lived, low-decline, predominantly oil fields in Oklahoma, Texas and Wyoming.  
 Pursue acquisitions with the potential to create value through our core strengths. We continue to evaluate fields that we believe have potential for waterflood development or margin enhancements through operational efficiency. These can usually be acquired at relatively low entry costs as the existing margins are relatively low.

Maintain and increase long-lived, low-decline reserve base. Maintaining and increasing a long-lived, low-decline reserve base provides us a more stable platform. This type of asset base requires less reinvestment capital to maintain current production and reserves, leaving more free cash flow to be deployed in growth projects and/or acquisitions.  
 Maintain a high degree of operational control and high working interest. We are able to have a high degree of operational control by operating a high percentage of our properties through our affiliate, Mid-Con Energy Operating. Our operational control along with maintaining a high working interest in our assets allows us to control our operating costs and the timing of our capital expenditures.
 Optimize cash flow. We are focused on maximizing the value and cash flow generated from our operations by increasing reserves and production while controlling costs. Our approach to managing our properties provides us the ability to react quickly to changing commodity price environments. As commodity prices fall, we are able to shut in our lowest margin wells to lessen the impact on cash flow. Since the vast majority of our production is unitized, we are able to shut-in marginal wells without forfeiting leasehold. As oil prices rise, we are able to return wells to operation, increasing the impact on cash flow. Our cash flow optimization allows us to optimize the timing and allocation of capital among our investment opportunities to maximize the rates of return on our properties. We exercise financial discipline by attempting to balance our development capital expenditures with our cash flows from our operations.
 Our Areas of Operations
 As of December 31, 2018, our properties were primarily located in the Mid-Continent, Permian, Big Horn and Powder River Basin regions of the United States in the Oklahoma, Texas and Wyoming core areas. These core areas are generally composed of multiple fields and waterflood units that are in close proximity to one another, produce from geologically similar reservoirs and utilize similar recovery methods. Focusing on these core areas allows us to apply our cumulative technical and operational knowledge to ongoing property development and to better predict future rates of recovery. 
Oklahoma
 The majority of our Oklahoma properties are being produced under waterflood and are operated by Mid-Con Energy Operating. At December 31, 2018, our average working interest in these properties was 89%. During 2018, we drilled 4 gross producing wells and converted 4 gross wells to injection.
Texas
 At December 31, 2018, we had an average working interest of 95% in our Texas properties. During 2018, we drilled 5 gross producing wells, 1 gross injection well and converted 4 gross wells to injection wells.
Wyoming
 At December 31, 2018, we had an average working interest of 80% in our Wyoming properties.
 The following table shows our estimated net proved reserves by core area, based on a reserve report prepared by our internal reserve engineers and audited by CG&A, our independent petroleum engineers, as of December 31, 2018:

 | Estimated Net Proved Reserves as of December 31, 2018 | 
----------+-------------------------------------------------------+-------
 | | | | % of Total | | | | | % Proved | | | Standardized Measure | 
Core Area | MBoe | | Proved Reserves | | | % Oil | Developed Reserves | | | Amount (1) ($ in millions) | | | % of Total | 
Oklahoma | | 13,198 | | | 53 | % | 95 | % | | | 88 | % | | $ | 163 | 47 | %
Texas | | 4,215 | | | 17 | % | 95 | % | | | 88 | % | | $ | 84 | 24 | %
Wyoming | | 7,429 | | | 30 | % | 98 | % | | | 45 | % | | $ | 101 | 29 | %
Total | | 24,842 | | | 100 | % | 96 | % | | | 75 | % | | $ | 348 | 100 | %


(1) | Our estimated net proved reserves and standardized measure were computed by applying average 12-month index prices (calculated as the unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month price for each month within the applicable 12-month period, held constant throughout the life of the properties). These prices were adjusted by lease for quality, transportation fees, location differentials, marketing bonuses or deductions and other factors affecting the price received at the wellhead. The average 12-month index prices were $65.56 per Bbl for oil and $3.10 per MMBtu for natural gas for the 12 months ended December 31, 2018.

Operations
 General
 We operate 98% of our properties, as calculated on a Boe basis as of December 31, 2018, through our affiliate, Mid-Con Energy Operating. For all of the wells we operate, we design and manage the development, recompletion or workover procedures and supervise operational and maintenance activities. We do not own the drilling rigs or other oil field services equipment used for drilling or maintaining wells on the properties we operate.
 We engage numerous independent contractors and affiliates to provide all of the equipment and personnel associated with our drilling and maintenance activities, including well servicing, trucking, water hauling, bulldozing, and various downhole services (e.g., logging, cementing, perforating and acidizing). These services are short-term in duration (often being completed in less than a day) and are typically governed by a one-page service order that states only the parties’ names, a brief description of the services and the price.
 We also engage several independent contractors to provide hydraulic fracturing services. These services are usually completed in four to six hours utilizing lower pressures and volumes of fluid than are typically employed in multi-stage hydraulic fracturing jobs performed in connection with unconventional oil and natural gas shale plays. These services are not normally governed by long-term services contracts, but instead are generally performed under one-time service orders, which state the parties’ name, a description of the services and the price. These service orders sometimes contain additional terms, for example, taxes, payment due dates, warranties and limitations of the contractor’s liability to damages arising from the contractor’s gross negligence or willful misconduct.

Engineering, Geological and Other Technical Services
 Mid-Con Energy Operating employs production and reservoir engineers, geologists and land specialists, as well as field production supervisors. Through the services agreement, we have the direct operational support of a staff of approximately 20 petroleum professionals with significant technical expertise. We believe that this technical expertise, which includes extensive experience utilizing secondary recovery methods, particularly waterfloods, differentiates us from, and provides us with a competitive advantage over, many of our competitors. Please see Item 13. “Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence - Agreements and Transactions with Related Parties” for more information.
Administrative Services
 Mid-Con Energy Operating provides us with management, administrative and operational services under the services agreement. We reimburse Mid-Con Energy Operating, on a cost basis, for the allocable expenses it incurs in performing these services. Mid-Con Energy Operating has substantial discretion to determine in good faith which expenses to incur on our behalf and what portion to allocate to us. For a detailed description of the administrative services provided by Mid-Con Energy Operating pursuant to the services agreement, please see Item 13. “Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence - Agreements and Transactions with Related Parties.”
Oil and Natural Gas Leases
 The typical oil and natural gas lease agreement covering our properties provides for the payment of royalties to the mineral owner for all hydrocarbons produced from any well drilled on the lease premises. As of December 31, 2018, the lessor royalties and other leasehold burdens on our properties ranged from less than 11.9% to 32.2%, resulting in a net revenue interest to us ranging from 67.8% to 88.1% on a 100% working interest basis, and our average net revenue interest is 71.6%. For the majority of our properties, leases are held by production and do not require lease rental payments.
Principal Customers
 For the year ended December 31, 2018, sales of oil and natural gas to three purchasers accounted for 83% of our sales. The loss of any of our customers could temporarily delay production and sales of our oil and natural gas. If we were to lose any of our significant customers, we believe we could identify substitute customers to purchase the impacted production volumes. However, if any of our customers dramatically decreased or ceased purchasing oil from us, we may experience difficulty receiving comparable rates for our production volumes.
Delivery Commitments
 We have no commitments to deliver a fixed and determinable quantity of our oil or natural gas production in the near future under our existing contracts.
Hedging Activities
 We continue to enter into commodity derivative contracts with unaffiliated third parties that are also members of our banking group to achieve more predictable cash flows and to reduce our exposure to short-term fluctuations in oil and natural gas prices. At December 31, 2018, our commodity derivative contracts had maturities through September 2020 and were comprised of commodity price and differential swaps. For a more detailed discussion of our hedging activities, see Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”
Competition
 We operate in a highly competitive environment for acquiring properties and securing trained personnel. Many of our competitors possess and employ financial resources substantially greater than ours, which can be particularly important in the areas in which we operate. These companies may have a greater ability to continue acquisition, and or exploration and production activities during periods of low commodity prices. Some of our competitors may also possess greater technical and personnel resources than us. As a result, our competitors may be able to pay more for properties, as well as evaluate, bid for and purchase a greater number of properties than our financial or personnel resources permit. Our ability to acquire additional properties and to discover reserves in the future will depend on our ability to evaluate and select suitable properties and to consummate transactions in a highly competitive environment. In addition, there is substantial competition for capital available for investment in the oil and natural gas industry.
 At times, we may also be affected by competition for drilling rigs, completion rigs and the availability of related equipment and services. In times past, the U.S. onshore oil and natural gas industry has experienced shortages of drilling and completion rigs, equipment, pipe and personnel, which have delayed development drilling and caused significant increases in the price for this equipment and personnel. We are unable to predict when, or if, such shortages may occur or how they would affect our development program.
 10

Insurance
 In accordance with industry practice, we maintain insurance against many potential operating risks to which our business could be exposed. Our coverage includes general liability, commercial umbrella liability, control of well, auto liability, property and equipment, worker’s compensation and employer’s liability, and directors and officer’s liability.
 Currently, we have coverage for general liability insurance coverage, which includes coverage for sudden and accidental pollution liability and legal and contractual liabilities arising out of property damage and bodily injury, among other things. The insurance policies contain maximum policy limits and in most cases, deductibles that must be met prior to recovery and are subject to certain customary exclusions and limitations. This insurance coverage is in addition to the general and automobile liability policies and may be triggered if the general or automobile liability insurance policy limits are exceeded and exhausted. The control of well policy insures us for blowout risks associated with drilling, completing and operating our wells, including above ground pollution.
 These policies do not provide coverage for all liabilities, and no assurance can be given that the insurance coverage will be adequate to cover claims that may arise, or that we will be able to maintain adequate insurance at rates we consider reasonable. A loss not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
 Environmental Matters and Regulation
 General
 Our operations are subject to stringent and complex federal, tribal, state and local laws and regulations governing environmental protection as well as the discharge of materials into the environment. These laws and regulations may, among other things (i) require the acquisition of permits to conduct exploration, drilling and production operations; (ii) govern the types, quantities and concentration of various substances that can be released into the environment or injected into formations in connection with drilling and production activities; (iii) restrict the way we handle or dispose of our wastes; (iv) limit or prohibit drilling activities on certain lands lying within wilderness, wetlands and other protected areas; (v) require investigatory and remedial measures to mitigate pollution from former and ongoing operations, such as requirements to close pits and plug abandoned wells; and (vi) impose obligations to reclaim and abandon wellsites. Any failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative, civil, and criminal penalties, the imposition of corrective or remedial obligations, and the issuance of orders enjoining performance of some or all of our operations.
 These laws and regulations may also restrict the rate of production below the rate that would otherwise be possible. The regulatory burden on the oil and natural gas industry increases the cost of doing business in the industry and consequently affects profitability. Additionally, the U.S. Congress and federal and state agencies frequently revise environmental laws and regulations, and any changes that result in more stringent and costly waste handling, storage, transport, drilling, disposal and remediation requirements for the oil and natural gas industry could have a significant impact on our operating costs.
 Prior to the current U.S. Presidential administration, the clear trend in environmental regulation has been to place more restrictions and limitations on activities that may affect the environment, and thus any changes in environmental laws and regulations or re-interpretation of enforcement policies that result in more stringent and costly waste handling, storage, transport, drilling, disposal or remediation requirements could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations. We may be unable to pass on such increased compliance costs to our customers. Moreover, accidental releases or spills may occur in the course of our operations, and we cannot provide assurances that we will not incur significant costs and liabilities as a result of such releases or spills, including any third-party claims for damage to property, natural resources or persons. While we believe that we are in substantial compliance with existing environmental laws and regulations and that continued compliance with existing requirements will not materially affect us, we can provide no assurance that we will not incur substantial costs in the future related to revised or additional environmental regulations that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
 The following is a summary of the more significant existing environmental, health and safety laws and regulations to which our business operations are subject and for which compliance may have a material adverse impact on our capital expenditures, results of operations or financial position.
 Hazardous Substances and Waste
 The federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, as amended (“RCRA”), and comparable state statutes and their respective implementing regulations, regulate the generation, transportation, treatment, storage, disposal and cleanup of hazardous and non-hazardous wastes. Under the auspices of the EPA, most states administer some or all of the provisions of RCRA, sometimes in conjunction with their own, more stringent requirements. Federal and state regulatory agencies can seek to impose administrative, civil and criminal penalties for alleged non-compliance with RCRA and analogous state requirements. Drilling fluids, produced waters and most of the other wastes associated with the exploration, development and production of oil, if properly handled, are exempt from 
 11

regulation as hazardous waste under Subtitle C of RCRA. These wastes, instead, are regulated under RCRA’s less stringent solid waste provisions, state laws or other federal laws. However, it is possible that certain oil exploration, development and production wastes now classified as non-hazardous could be classified as hazardous wastes in the future. Any such change could result in an increase in our costs to manage and dispose of wastes, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position.
 The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, as amended (“CERCLA”), also known as the Superfund law, and comparable state laws impose liability, without regard to fault or legality of conduct, on classes of persons considered to be responsible for the release of a “hazardous substance” into the environment. These persons include the current and past owner or operator of the site where the release occurred, and anyone who disposed or arranged for the disposal of a hazardous substance released at the site. Under CERCLA, such persons may be subject to joint and several, strict liability for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances that have been released into the environment, for damages to natural resources and for the costs of certain health studies. CERCLA also authorizes the EPA and, in some instances, third parties to act in response to threats to public health or the environment and to seek to recover from responsible classes of persons the costs they incur. It is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the hazardous substances or other pollutants released into the environment. Despite the so-called petroleum exclusion, we generate materials in the course of our operations that may be regulated as hazardous substances.
 We currently own and lease numerous properties that have been used for oil and/or natural gas exploration, production and processing for many years. Although we believe that we have utilized operating and waste disposal practices that were standard in the industry at the time, hazardous substances, wastes, or hydrocarbons may have been released on, under or from the properties owned or leased by us, or on, under or from other locations, including off-site locations, where such substances have been taken for disposal. In addition, some of our properties have been operated by third parties or by previous owners or operators whose treatment and disposal of hazardous substances, wastes, or hydrocarbons was not under our control. These properties and the substances disposed or released on, under or from them may be subject to CERCLA, RCRA and analogous state laws. Under such laws, we could be required to remove or remediate previously disposed wastes (including wastes disposed of or released by prior owners or operators), to clean up contaminated property (including contaminated groundwater) and to perform remedial operations to prevent future contamination.
 Water Discharges
 The federal Water Pollution Control Act, as amended, also known as the Clean Water Act, and analogous state laws, impose restrictions and strict controls regarding the discharge of pollutants, including oil and hazardous substances, into state waters and federal navigable U.S. waters The discharge of pollutants into federal or state waters is prohibited, except in accordance with the terms of a permit issued by the EPA or an analogous state or tribal agency that has been delegated authority for the program by the EPA. Federal, state and tribal regulatory agencies can impose administrative, civil and criminal penalties for non-compliance with discharge permits or other requirements of the Clean Water Act and analogous state laws and regulations. Plan requirements imposed under the Clean Water Act require appropriate containment berms and similar structures to help prevent the contamination of navigable waters in the event of a hydrocarbon tank spill, rupture or leak. In addition, the Clean Water Act and analogous state laws required individual permits or coverage under general permits for discharges of storm water runoff from certain types of facilities.
 The Oil Pollution Act of 1990, as amended (“OPA”), amends the Clean Water Act and establishes strict liability for owners and operators of facilities that are the site of a release of oil into U.S. waters. The OPA and its associated regulations impose a variety of requirements on responsible parties related to the prevention of oil spills and liability for damages resulting from such spills. A “responsible party” under the OPA includes owners and operators of certain onshore facilities from which a release may affect waters of the United States.
 The Safe Drinking Water Act, as amended (“SDWA”) and analogous state laws impose requirements relating to our underground injection activities. Under these laws, the EPA and state environmental agencies have adopted regulations related to permitting, testing, monitoring, record-keeping and reporting of injection well activities, as well as prohibitions against the migration of injected fluids into underground sources of drinking water. We currently own a number of injection wells, used primarily for reinjection of produced waters that are subject to SDWA requirements.
 Hydraulic Fracturing
 Hydraulic fracturing is an important and common practice that is used to stimulate production of oil and/or natural gas from dense subsurface rock formations. We employ conventional hydraulic fracturing techniques to increase the productivity of certain of our properties. The hydraulic fracturing process involves the injection of water, sand and chemicals under pressure into rock formations to fracture the surrounding rock and stimulate production. The hydraulic fracturing process is typically regulated by state oil and natural gas commissions. However, the EPA has asserted federal regulatory authority over certain hydraulic fracturing activities involving diesel under the SDWA and has published guidance related to this regulatory authority. In addition, from time to time, Congress has considered federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing including disclosure of the chemicals used in the hydraulic fracturing process. Several states in which we operate have adopted rules requiring the disclosure of certain information related to hydraulic fluids 
 12

associated with wells that are hydraulically fractured. Additionally, some states and local governments have adopted, and other states are considering adopting, regulations that could restrict hydraulic fracturing in certain circumstances. For example, the State of Oklahoma has issued directives to shut-in or reduce the volume sent to disposal wells in the areas that have experienced recent earthquake activity. Other authorities are considering restrictions on the disposal of hydraulic fluids by deep well injection. We follow applicable industry standard practices and legal requirements for groundwater protection in our hydraulic fracturing activities. In the event that new or more stringent federal, state or local legal restrictions are adopted in areas where we operate, we could incur potentially significant added costs to comply with such requirements, experience delays or curtailment in the pursuit of exploration, development, or production activities.
 There are certain governmental reviews either underway or being proposed that focus on environmental aspects of hydraulic fracturing practices. Furthermore, a number of federal agencies are analyzing, or have been requested to review, a variety of environmental issues associated with hydraulic fracturing. The EPA has completed a study of the potential environmental effects of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water resources and issued its final report in December 2016. The report concluded that hydraulic fracturing activities can impact drinking water resources under some circumstances and identified conditions under which such impacts can be more frequent or severe. In June 2016, the EPA published final pretreatment standards for oil and natural gas extraction to ensure that wastewater from hydraulic fracturing activities is not sent to publicly owned treatment works. Subsequent rules have extended the implementation date for certain facilities that are subject to these standards. The U.S. Department of Energy is conducting an investigation of practices the agency could recommend to better protect the environment from drilling using hydraulic fracturing completion methods. More recently, there have been reports linking the injection of produced fluids from hydraulic fracturing to earthquakes. These ongoing or proposed studies, depending on their degree of pursuit and any meaningful results obtained, could spur initiatives to further regulate hydraulic fracturing under the SDWA or other regulatory mechanisms.
 Almost all of our hydraulic fracturing operations are conducted on vertical wells. The fracture treatments on these wells are much smaller and utilize much less water than what is typically used on most of the shale oil and natural gas wells that are being drilled throughout the United States. The majority of our leasehold acreage is currently held by production from existing wells. Therefore, fracturing is not currently required to maintain this acreage but it will be required in the future to develop the majority of our proved behind pipe and proved undeveloped reserves associated with this acreage. 
 We follow applicable industry standard practices and legal requirements for groundwater protection in our operations, subject to close supervision by state and federal regulators, which conduct many inspections during operations that include hydraulic fracturing. We minimize the use of water and dispose of the produced water into approved disposal or injection wells. We currently do not intentionally discharge water to the surface.
 Air Emissions
 The federal Clean Air Act, as amended, and comparable state laws regulate emissions of various air pollutants through air emissions standards, construction and operating permitting programs and the imposition of other compliance requirements. These laws and regulations may require us to obtain pre-approval for the construction or modification of certain projects or facilities expected to produce or significantly increase air emissions, obtain and strictly comply with stringent air permit requirements or utilize specific equipment or technologies to control emissions. The need to obtain permits has the potential to delay the development of our projects.
 While we may be required to incur certain capital expenditures in the next few years for air pollution control equipment or other air emissions-related issues, we do not believe that such requirements will have a material adverse effect on our operations. For example, on August 16, 2012, the EPA published final regulations under the Clean Air Act that, among other things, required additional emissions controls for natural gas and NGLs production, including New Source Performance Standards to address emissions of sulfur dioxide and volatile organic compounds (“VOC”), and a separate set of emission standards to address hazardous air pollutants frequently associated with such production activities. The final regulations required the reduction of VOC emissions from natural gas wells through the use of reduced emission completions or “green completions” on all hydraulically fractured wells constructed or refractured after January 1, 2015. For well completion operations that occurred at such well sites before January 1, 2015, the final regulations allow operators to capture and direct flowback emissions to completion combustion devices, such as flares, in lieu of performing green completions. These regulations also established specific new requirements regarding emissions from dehydrators, storage tanks and other production equipment. Compliance with these requirements could increase our costs of development and production, though we do not expect these requirements to be any more burdensome to us than to other similarly situated companies involved in oil and natural gas exploration and production activities.
 Climate Change
 In December 2009, the EPA published its findings that emissions of carbon dioxide, or CO2, methane, and other greenhouse gases (“GHG”), present a danger to public health and the environment. Based on these findings, the EPA began adopting and implementing regulations that restrict emissions of GHG under existing provisions of the federal Clean Air Act. These regulations include requirements to regulate emissions of GHG from motor vehicles, certain requirements for construction and operating permit reviews for GHG emissions from certain large stationary sources, rules requiring the reporting of GHG emissions from specified large GHG

emission sources including operators of onshore oil and natural gas production and rules requiring so-called green completions of natural gas wells for wells constructed after January 2015. In addition, in May 2016, the EPA issued new regulations that set methane and VOC emission standards for certain oil and natural gas facilities. In July 2017, the EPA proposed a two-year study of certain requirements of this rule pending reconsideration of the rule. The Paris Agreement, which was created by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, entered into force on November 4, 2016. The Paris Agreement requires participating countries to establish “nationally determined contributions” to mitigate climate change that “represent a progression over time” and are reported at five-year intervals. The United States announced its intention to withdraw from the Paris Agreement on June 1, 2017.
 We are currently monitoring GHG emissions from our operations in accordance with the GHG emissions reporting rule. Data collected from our initial GHG monitoring activities indicated that we do not currently exceed the threshold level of GHG emissions triggering a reporting obligation. To the extent we exceed the applicable regulatory threshold level in the future, we will report the emissions beginning in the applicable period. Also, the U.S. Congress has from time to time considered legislation to reduce emissions of GHG and almost one-half of the states, either individually or through multi-state regional initiatives, already have begun implementing legal measures to reduce emissions of GHG. The adoption and implementation of any regulations imposing reporting obligations on, or limiting emissions of GHG from, our equipment and operations could require us to incur significant costs to reduce emissions of GHG associated with operations or could adversely affect demand for our production.
 The EPA also previously finalized regulations to reduce carbon dioxide emissions from the utility power sector, commonly referred to as the Clean Power Plan, which, if implemented, could reduce the demand for fossil fuels. The implementation of this rule was stayed pending judicial review, and in October 2017, the EPA proposed the repeal of the Clean Power Plan. Legal challenges caused delays to repeal the regulations. However, the U.S. Supreme Court rejected any further court challenges to the Trump Administration’s decision to repeal the Clean Power Plan in October 2018.
 National Environmental Policy Act
 Oil exploration, development and production activities that are located on federal lands or have a federal “nexus” are subject to the National Environmental Policy Act, as amended, (“NEPA”). NEPA requires federal agencies, including the Department of the Interior, to evaluate major agency actions having the potential to significantly impact the environment. In the course of such evaluations, an agency will prepare an environmental assessment that analyzes the potential direct, indirect and cumulative impacts of a proposed project and, if necessary, will prepare a more detailed environmental impact statement that may be made available for public review and comment. Future or proposed exploration and development plans on federal lands, governmental permits or authorizations that are subject to the requirements of NEPA may be required. This process has the potential to delay the development of oil projects.
Endangered Species Act
 The federal Endangered Species Act (“ESA”) may restrict activities that affect endangered or threatened species. Federal agencies are required to ensure that any action authorized, funded or carried out by them is not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of listed species or modify their critical habitat. The designation of previously unidentified endangered or threatened species habitats could cause us to incur additional costs or become subject to operating restrictions or bans in the affected areas. Moreover, as a result of a settlement approved by the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia on September 9, 2011, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is required to consider listing more than 250 species as endangered under the Endangered Species Act over a period of six years. The designation of previously unprotected species in areas where we operate as threatened or endangered could cause us to incur increased costs arising from species protection measures or could result in limitations on our exploration and production activities that could have an adverse impact on our ability to develop and produce our reserves.
OSHA
 We are subject to the requirements of the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act, as amended (“OSHA”), and comparable state statutes whose purpose is to protect the health and safety of workers. In addition, the OSHA hazard communication standard, the Emergency Planning and Community Right to Know Act and implementing regulations, and similar state statutes and regulations require that we organize and/or disclose information about hazardous materials used or produced in our operations and that this information be provided to employees, state and local governmental authorities and citizens. We believe that we are in substantial compliance with all applicable laws and regulations relating to worker health and safety.
Other Regulation of the Oil and Natural Gas Industry
 General
 Various aspects of our oil and natural gas operations are subject to extensive and frequently changing regulation as the activities of the oil and natural gas industry often are reviewed by legislators and regulators. Numerous departments and agencies, both federal and 
 14

state, are authorized by statute to issue, and have issued, rules and regulations binding upon the oil and natural gas industry and its individual members.
 The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (“FERC”) regulates interstate natural gas transportation rates, and terms and conditions of transportation service, which affects the marketing of the natural gas we produce, as well as the prices we receive for sales of our natural gas. FERC regulates interstate oil pipelines under the provisions of the Interstate Commerce Act (“ICA”) as in effect in 1977 when ICA jurisdiction over oil pipelines was transferred to FERC, and the Energy Policy Act of 1992, or the EPA Act 1992. FERC is also authorized to prevent and sanction market manipulation in natural gas markets under the Energy Policy Act of 2005. In 1989, Congress enacted the Natural Gas Wellhead Decontrol Act, which removed all remaining price and non-price controls affecting wellhead sales of natural gas, effective January 1, 1993. While sales by producers of natural gas and all sales of crude oil, condensate and NGLs can currently be made at uncontrolled market prices, Congress could reenact price controls in the future.
 In addition, the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) and the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (“CFTC”) hold statutory authority to prevent market manipulation in oil and energy futures markets, respectively. Together with FERC, these agencies have imposed broad rules and regulations prohibiting fraud and manipulation in oil and natural gas markets and energy futures markets. We are also subject to various reporting requirements that are designed to facilitate transparency and prevent market manipulation. Failure to comply with such market rules, regulations and requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.
 Oil and NGLs Transportation Rates
 Our sales of crude oil, condensate and NGLs are not currently regulated and are transacted at market prices. In a number of instances, however, the ability to transport and sell such products is dependent on pipelines whose rates, terms and conditions of service are subject to FERC jurisdiction under the ICA and EPA act 1992. The price we receive from the sale of oil and NGLs is affected by the cost of transporting those products to market. Interstate transportation rates for oil, NGLs and other products are regulated by the FERC, and in general, these rates must be cost-based or based on rates in effect in 1992, although FERC has established an indexing system for such transportation which allows such pipelines to take an annual inflation-based rate increase. Shippers may, however, contest rates that do not reflect costs of service. The FERC has also established market-based rates and settlement rates as alternative forms of ratemaking in certain circumstances.
 In other instances involving intrastate-only transportation of oil, NGLs and other products, the ability to transport and sell such products is dependent on pipelines whose rates, terms and conditions of service are subject to regulation by state regulatory bodies under state statutes. Such pipelines may be subject to regulation by state regulatory agencies with respect to safety, rates and/or terms and conditions of service, including requirements for ratable takes or non-discriminatory access to pipeline services. The basis for intrastate regulation and the degree of regulatory oversight and scrutiny given to intrastate pipelines varies from state to state. Many states operate on a complaint-based system and state commissions have generally not initiated investigations of the rates or practices of liquids pipelines in the absence of a complaint.
 Regulation of Oil and Natural Gas Exploration and Production
 Our exploration and production operations are subject to various types of regulation at the federal, state and local levels. Such regulations include requiring permits, bonds and pollution liability insurance for the drilling of wells, regulating the location of wells, the method of drilling, casing, operating, plugging and abandoning wells, notice to surface owners and other third parties, and governing the surface use and restoration of properties upon which wells are drilled. Many states also have statutes or regulations addressing conservation of oil and natural gas resources, including provisions for the unitization or pooling of oil and natural gas properties, the establishment of maximum rates of production from oil and natural gas wells and the regulation of spacing of such wells.
 Oklahoma allows forced pooling or integration of tracts to facilitate exploration, while other states rely on voluntary pooling of lands and leases. In some instances, forced pooling or unitization may be implemented by third parties and may reduce our interest in the unitized properties. In addition, state conservation laws establish maximum rates of production from oil wells, generally prohibit the venting or flaring of natural gas and impose requirements regarding the ratability of production. These laws and regulations may limit the amount of oil and natural gas we can produce from our wells or limit the number of wells or the locations at which we can drill.
 States also impose severance taxes and enforce requirements for obtaining drilling permits. For example, the State of Oklahoma currently imposes a production tax and an excise tax for oil and natural gas properties. Additionally, production tax rates vary by state. States do not regulate wellhead prices or engage in other similar direct economic regulation, but there can be no assurance that they will not do so in the future.
 There are constantly numerous new and proposed regulations related to oil and natural gas exploration and production activities. The failure to comply with these rules and regulations can result in substantial penalties. Our competitors in the oil and natural gas industry are subject to the same regulatory requirements and restrictions that affect our operations.
 15

The oil and natural gas industry is also subject to compliance with various other federal, state and local regulations and laws. Some of those laws relate to resource conservation and equal employment opportunity. We do not believe that compliance with these laws will have a material adverse effect on us.
 Regulation of Oil and Gas Pipelines
 Oil and gas pipelines are subject to construction, installation, operation and safety regulation by the U.S. Department of Transportation (“DOT”) and various other federal, state and local agencies. Congress has enacted several pipeline safety acts over the years. Currently, the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (“PHMSA”) under the DOT administers pipeline safety requirements for natural gas and hazardous liquid pipelines. These regulations, among other things, address pipeline integrity management and pipeline operator qualification rules. In June 2016, Congress approved new pipeline safety legislation, the “Protecting Our Infrastructure of Pipelines and Enhancing Safety Act of 2016,” which provides the PHMSA with additional authority to address imminent hazards by imposing emergency restrictions, prohibitions and safety measures on owners and operators of gas or hazardous liquids pipeline facilities. Significant expenses could be incurred in the future if additional safety measures are required or if safety standards are raised and exceed the current pipeline control system capabilities. 
 The PHMSA has proposed additional regulations for gas pipeline safety. For example, in March 2016, the PHMSA proposed a rule that would expand integrity management requirements beyond “High Consequence Areas” to apply to gas pipelines in newly defined “Moderate Consequence Areas.” Also, on January 10, 2017, the PHMSA approved final rules expanding its safety regulations for hazardous liquid pipelines by, among other things, expanding the required use of leak detection systems, requiring more frequent testing for corrosion and other flaws and requiring companies to inspect pipelines in areas affected by extreme weather or natural disasters. The final rule was withdrawn by the PHMSA in January 2017, and it is unclear whether and to what extent the PHMSA will move forward with its regulatory reforms.
