Item 1    Business 
 Corporate Structure 
         Focus Inc. was incorporated as a Delaware corporation on July 29, 2015 for the purpose of completing the IPO and Reorganization Transactions. On July 30, 2018, we completed our IPO of 18,648,649 shares of Class A common stock, par value $0.01 per share. The shares began trading on the NASDAQ Global Select Market on July 26, 2018 under the ticker symbol "FOCS." We used the proceeds from the IPO to purchase certain outstanding Focus LLC units, to reduce indebtedness under our credit facility and for acquisitions and general corporate business purposes. 
         In connection with the IPO and Reorganization Transactions, Focus Inc. became a holding company whose sole material asset is a membership interest in Focus LLC. Focus LLC directly or indirectly owns all of the outstanding equity interests in our partner firms. Focus Inc. is the sole managing member of Focus LLC and is responsible for all operational, management and administrative decisions of Focus LLC. Subject to certain restrictions, unitholders of Focus LLC (other than Focus Inc. and any of its subsidiaries) may receive shares of our Class A common stock pursuant to the exercise of an exchange right or the call right. 
   Our Company 
         We are a leading partnership of independent, fiduciary wealth management firms operating in the highly fragmented registered investment advisor ("RIA") industry, with a footprint of 60 partner firms primarily in the United States. We have achieved this market leadership by positioning ourselves as the partner of choice for many firms in an industry where a number of secular trends are driving RIA consolidation. Our partner firms primarily service ultra-high net worth and high net worth individuals and families by providing highly differentiated and comprehensive wealth management services. Our partner firms benefit from our intellectual and financial resources, operating in a scaled business model with aligned interests, while retaining their entrepreneurial culture and independence. 
 3

           Our partnership is built on the following principles, which enable us to attract and retain high-quality wealth management firms and accelerate their growth: 

   
Entrepreneurship: | Emphasis on the entrepreneurial spirit, independence and unique culture of each partner firm. 
Fiduciary Standard: | Partnership with wealth management firms that are held to the fiduciary standard in serving their clients. 
Alignment of Interests: | Alignment of principals' interests with our interests through our differentiated partnership and economic model. 
Value-Add Program: | Empowerment of our partner firms through collaboration on strategy, growth and acquisition opportunities, marketing, technology and operational expertise, best practices and access to world-class intellectual resources and capital to fund expansion and acquisitions.


        We were founded by entrepreneurs and began revenue-generating and acquisition activities in 2006. Since that time, we have:
 

 created a partnership of 60 partner firms, the substantial majority of which are RIAs registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission
(the "SEC") pursuant to the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (the "Advisers Act"); 
 built a business with revenues of $910.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018; 
 established an attractive revenue model whereby in excess of 95% of our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2018 were fee-based and
recurring in nature; 
 built a partnership model currently comprised of over 3,000 wealth management-focused principals and employees; and 
 established a national footprint across the United States and expanded our footprint internationally with partner firms in the United Kingdom,
Canada and Australia. 

         We are in the midst of a fundamental shift in the growing wealth management services industry. The delivery of wealth management services is moving from traditional brokerage, commission-based platforms to a fiduciary, open-architecture and fee-based structure. This shift has resulted in a significant transfer of client assets and wealth management professionals out of traditional brokerage, commission-based platforms to independent wealth management practices. We believe that our leading partnership of independent, fiduciary wealth management firms positions us to benefit from these trends. 
         The independent wealth management industry, including RIAs, is highly fragmented, which we believe enables us to continue our growth strategy of acquiring high-quality wealth management firms, directly and through acquisitions by our partner firms. We have a track record of enhancing the competitive position of our partner firms by providing them with access to the resources of our large organization. Our scale enables us to help our partner firms achieve operational efficiencies and ensure organizational continuity. Additionally, our scale, resources and value-added services increase our partner firms' ability to achieve growth through a variety of tactical, operational and strategic initiatives, as well as the consummation of their own acquisitions. As our existing partner firms benefit from these growth initiatives, we continue to focus on acquisitions of new partner firms. 
         Our partnership is comprised of trusted professionals providing comprehensive wealth management services under a largely recurring, fee-based model, which differentiates our partner firms from the traditional brokerage platforms whose revenues are largely derived from commissions. We derive a substantial majority of our revenues from wealth management fees for investment advice, financial and 
 4

   tax planning, consulting, tax return preparation, family office services and other services. We also generate other revenues from recordkeeping and administration service fees, commissions and distribution fees and outsourced services. 
   Our Growth Strategy 
         We believe we are well-positioned to take advantage of favorable trends in the wealth management industry, including the migration of wealth management professionals from traditional brokerage, commission-based platforms to a fiduciary, open-architecture and fee-based structure. We plan to grow our business through the growth of our existing partner firms and expansion of our partnership. 
 Growth of Our Existing Partner Firms 
 


High-Quality, Growth-Oriented Partner Firms 

         Our goal has been and continues to be to acquire high-quality, entrepreneurial wealth management firms that have built their businesses through a proven track record of growth. We believe that our partner firms will continue to take advantage of the shift in the market share of client assets to the RIA space and grow organically through acquisitions of wealth management practices and customer relationships, attracting new clients, additions of new wealth management professionals, increasing the amount of assets from existing clients and market-based growth over time. The economic arrangements put in place at the time of acquisition through our management agreements further incentivize the principals of our partner firms to continue executing on their growth plans. 
 


Value-Added Services 

         We have a team of over 70 professionals who support our partner firms by providing value-added services, including marketing and business development support, advisor coaching and development and structuring compensation and incentive models along with career path planning, succession planning advice, operational and technology expertise, legal and regulatory support and providing negotiating leverage with vendors. Our value-added services also include acquisition opportunities for our partner firms through a proactive outreach program, structuring, executing and funding transactions and providing guidance to partner firms to facilitate their integration into our partnership. We assign a relationship leader to each partner firm who is tasked with coordinating our value-added services to assist that partner firm in accelerating its growth. These services are provided to our partner firms at no additional cost. Our partner firms have access to the resources of a large organization, which ultimately enhances their operations, enabling them to better serve their clients. 
         Some of our key value-added services are described in detail below. 
  Marketing and Business Development.    We offer marketing and business development coaching to our partner firms on topics including referral programs, revenue enhancement measures, communications, website and social media, brand strategy and public relations support. Our marketing team works closely with each of our partner firms to understand their unique value proposition in order to ultimately help our partner firms better market themselves to clients and their centers of influence, including accounting and law firms who serve as potential referral sources. To further support our partner firms, in June 2018 we completed a minority investment in Financial Insight Technology, Inc. (known as SmartAsset), a New York-based FinTech company that connects prospective clients with financial advisors and provides tools to help people make financial decisions. 
         Talent Management.    We also support the mentoring of next-generation talent through continuous coaching programs that we organize and execute. These programs emphasize key learnings gained from observing top talent across our organization. These services allow our firms to benefit from best practices across our talent pool. 
 5

           Compensation Structures and Succession Planning.    We help our partner firms align their compensation models to further incentivize their teams. We also facilitate wealth management professional career path planning and advise on principal promotions to the respective management company. These services allow our partner firms to attract and retain the highest quality wealth management professionals. Our acquisition structure facilitates succession planning by maintaining the partner firm and management company as separate entities, thereby allowing for the principals owning the management company to change over time without disrupting client relationships at the partner firm. 
         Operations and Technology.    We assist partner firms in selecting and implementing third-party technology solutions that strengthen each firm's operational performance. Our partner firms can request that our operations team conduct detailed operational assessments to determine their staffing and operating efficiency. Additionally, our operations team provides partner firms negotiating leverage with vendors and cost-efficient access to third-party technology. 
  Legal and Regulatory Support.    We have an experienced team of legal professionals in place at Focus LLC to help support our partner firms in fulfilling their regulatory responsibilities by providing additional guidance and expertise. We also have relationships with numerous legal and compliance advisors to help our partner firms maintain compliance. 
  Sharing of Best Practices / Collaboration with Other Partner Firms.    Our partner firms have access to networking opportunities, best practices roundtable discussions and training seminars. We offer offsite meetings, seminars and other opportunities for partner firms to learn and adopt best practices. On a semiannual basis, we host partners meetings where wealth management professionals from our partner firms have opportunities to meet face to face to collaborate and share ideas. In addition we host periodic summits for chief investment officers, chief compliance officers, chief operating officers and chief marketing officers, where our partner firms can gather and share industry expertise and business development practices. Our partner firms are also encouraged to share best practices regularly in order to enhance their collective ability to better serve their clients. 
 


Acquisitions by Our Partner Firms 

         We support acquisitions of wealth management practices and customer relationships by our partner firms to further expand their businesses. Partner firms pursue acquisitions for a variety of reasons, including geographic expansion, acquisition of new talent and/or specific expertise and succession planning. Acquisitions by our partner firms allow them to add new talent and services to better support their client base while simultaneously capturing synergies from the acquired businesses. We believe there are currently approximately 5,000 firms in the United States that are suitable targets for our partner firms. We have an experienced team of professionals with deep industry relationships to assist in identifying potential acquisition targets for our partner firms. Through our proprietary in-house sourcing effort, we frequently identify acquisition opportunities for our partner firms. Additionally, many of our partner firms are well-known in the industry and have developed extensive relationships. In recent years, principals and employees of our partner firms have identified attractive merger candidates, and we believe this trend will continue as our partner firms continue to build scale. 
         In addition to sourcing opportunities, we are actively involved through each stage of the process to provide legal, financial, tax, compliance and operational expertise to guide our partner firms through the due diligence process and execution. We provide the funding for acquisitions in the same manner that a parent company would typically fund acquisitions by its wholly owned subsidiaries. 
         Our partner firms typically acquire substantially all of the assets of a target firm for cash or a combination of cash and equity and the right to receive contingent consideration. In certain situations, when the acquisition involves a merger with a corporation, and the consideration includes our Class A 
 6

   common stock, Focus Inc. may purchase all of the equity of a target firm and then contribute the assets to our partner firm. In certain instances, our partner firms may acquire only the customer relationships. At the time a partner firm consummates an acquisition, we amend our management agreement with the partner firm to adjust Base Earnings and Target Earnings to reflect the projected post-acquisition Earnings Before Partner Compensation ("EBPC") of the partner firm. 
         Our partner firms completed 12 transactions in 2016, 15 transactions in 2017 and 17 transactions in 2018. Our partner firms may choose to merge with each other as well. Consolidation of our existing partner firms leads to efficiencies and incremental growth in our cash flows. Since October 2012, seven partner firms have consummated mergers with other partner firms. 
   Expansion of Our Partnership 
 


Acquisitions of New Partner Firms 

         Since inception, a fundamental aspect of our growth strategy has been the acquisition of high-quality, entrepreneurial wealth management firms to expand our partnership. We believe that there are approximately 1,000 firms in the United States that are high-quality targets for future acquisitions. While most of our acquisitions have taken place in the United States, we see opportunities in multiple international locations where market and regulatory trends toward the fiduciary standard and open-architecture access mirror those occurring in the United States. We have already begun expansion into the United Kingdom, Canada and Australia. 
         Our differentiated partnership model has allowed us to grow and enhance our leadership position in the wealth management industry. 
         We are highly selective in choosing our partner firms and conduct extensive financial, legal, tax, operational and business due diligence. We evaluate a variety of criteria including the quality of the wealth management professionals, historical revenues and cash flows, the recurring nature of the revenues, compliance policies and procedures and the alignment of interests between wealth management professionals and clients. We focus on firms with owners who are committed to the long-term management and growth of their business. 
         With limited exceptions, our partner firm acquisitions have been structured as acquisitions of substantially all of the assets of the firm we choose to partner with but only a portion of the underlying economics in order to align the principals' interests with our own objectives. To determine the acquisition price, we first estimate the operating cash flow of the business based on current and projected levels of revenue and expense, before compensation and benefits to the selling principals or other individuals who become principals. We refer to the operating cash flow of the business as Earnings Before Partner Compensation or EBPC, and to this estimate as Target Earnings. In economic terms, we typically purchase only 40% to 60% of the partner firm's EBPC. We refer to the corresponding percentage of Target Earnings on which we base the purchase price as "Base Earnings". Under a management agreement among our operating subsidiary, the management company and the principals, the management company is entitled to management fees typically consisting of all future EBPC of the acquired wealth management firm in excess of Base Earnings up to Target Earnings, plus a percentage of any EBPC in excess of Target Earnings. Through the management agreement, we create downside protection for ourselves by retaining a cumulative preferred position in Base Earnings. 
         Since 2006, when we began revenue-generating and acquisition activities, our model has allowed us to grow to a partnership with 60 partner firms. Acquisitions of partner firms to date have been structured as illustrated below, with limited exceptions. Subsidiary mergers at the partner firm level 
 7

   have been structured differently, and in the future we may structure acquisitions in foreign jurisdictions differently depending on legal and tax considerations. 
 
 (1)
Focus LLC forms a wholly owned subsidiary. 
(2)
In exchange for cash or a combination of cash and equity and the right to receive contingent consideration, the operating subsidiary acquires substantially all of the assets of the target firm, which is owned by the selling principals, and becomes the successor firm. 
(3)
The selling principals form a management company. In addition to the selling principals, the management company may include non-selling principals who become newly admitted in connection with the acquisition or thereafter. 
(4)
The successor firm, the principals and the management company enter into a management agreement which typically has an initial term of six years subject to automatic renewals for consecutive one-year terms, unless earlier terminated by either the management company or us in certain limited situations. Under the management agreement, the management company is entitled to management fees typically consisting of all future EBPC of the successor firm in excess of Base Earnings up to Target Earnings, plus a percentage of any EBPC in excess of Target Earnings. Pursuant to the management agreement, the management company provides the personnel who conduct the day-to-day operations of the successor firm. Through the management agreement, we create downside protection for ourselves by retaining a cumulative preferred position in Base Earnings. 

         In connection with a typical acquisition, we enter into an acquisition agreement with the target wealth management firm and its selling principals pursuant to which we purchase substantially all of the assets of the target firm. The purchase price is a multiple of Base Earnings, which is a percentage of Target Earnings. The purchase price is comprised of a base purchase price and a right to receive contingent consideration in the form of earn out payments. The base purchase price typically consists of an upfront cash payment and may include equity. The contingent consideration is paid upon the satisfaction of specified growth thresholds typically over a six-year period. This arrangement may result in the payment of additional purchase price consideration to the sellers for periods following the closing of an acquisition. The growth thresholds are typically tied to the compounded annual growth rate ("CAGR") of the partner firm's earnings. Earn out payments are typically payable in a combination of cash and, in some cases, equity. 
 8

           The acquisition agreements contain customary representations and warranties of the parties, and closing is generally conditioned on the delivery of certain ancillary documents, including an executed management agreement, a confidentiality and non-solicitation agreement, a non-competition agreement and a notice issued by the acquired firm to its clients notifying them of the acquisition and requesting their consent for the assignment of any agreements to the successor firm. 
         In connection with the acquisition, management companies and selling principals agree to non-competition and non-solicitation provisions of the management agreement, as well as standalone non-competition and non-solicitation agreements required by the acquisition agreement. Such non-competition and non-solicitation agreements typically have five-year terms. The non-competition and non-solicitation provisions of the management agreement continue during the term of the management agreement and for a period of two years thereafter. 
         Our partner firms are primarily overseen by the principals who own the management company formed concurrently with the acquisition. Our operating subsidiary, the management company and the principals enter into a long-term management agreement pursuant to which the management company provides the personnel responsible for overseeing the day-to-day operations of the partner firm. The term of the management agreement is generally six years subject to automatic renewals for consecutive one-year terms, unless earlier terminated by either the management company or us. Subject to applicable cure periods, we may terminate the management agreement upon the occurrence of an event of cause, which may include willful misconduct by the management company or any principal that is reasonably likely to result in a material adverse effect, the failure of the management company to comply with regulatory or other governmental compliance procedures or a material breach of the agreement by the management company or the principals. In some cases, we may have the right to terminate the agreement if any principal ceases to be involved on a full-time basis in the management of the management company or the performance of services under the agreement. Generally, the management company may terminate the management agreement upon a material breach of the agreement by us and the expiration of the applicable cure period. 
         This ownership and management structure allows the principals to maintain an entrepreneurial spirit through autonomous day-to-day decision making, while gaining access to our extensive resources and preserving the principals' long-term economic incentive to continue to grow the business. The management company structure provides both flexibility to us and stability to our partner firms by permitting the principals to continue to build equity value in the management company as the partner firm grows and to control their internal economics and succession plans within the management company. 
         The following table provides an illustrative example of our economics, including management fees earned by the management company, for periods of projected revenues, +10% growth in revenues and 10% growth in revenues. This example assumes (i) Target Earnings of $3.0 million; (ii) Base Earnings 
 9

   acquired of 60% of Target Earnings or $1.8 million; and (iii) a percentage of earnings in excess of Target Earnings retained by the management company of 40%.

        In certain circumstances, the structure of our relationship with partner firms may differ from the typical structure described above. In addition, our future international acquisitions may not be structured like our typical partner firm acquisitions. For example, the structure of our ownership interests in non-U.S. partner firms may differ from the way in which we own our U.S. partner firms. 
 


Lift Outs of Established Wealth Management Professionals 

         From time to time, through Focus Independence, we offer teams of wealth management professionals at traditional brokerages and wirehouses with attractive track records and books of business the opportunity to establish their own independent wealth management firm and ultimately join our partnership as a new partner firm. This program gives these professionals the opportunity to build a business largely unencumbered by the conflicts of interest they face at traditional brokerages and wirehouses and with more favorable economics. Focus Independence is a targeted approach to lift out teams of wealth management professionals from traditional brokerages and wirehouses with attractive track records and books of business and make them entrepreneurs within our partnership. The program has been successful, with the substantial majority of ultra-high net worth and high net worth clients historically retained by the newly formed partner firm. We have completed 13 acquisitions of new partner firms through  Focus Independence since the program's inception. 
         We work with each team of wealth management professionals to establish a new RIA business and provide consultation as needed on virtually everything needed to transition to and operate the new RIA as a full-service firm, including technology, personnel and office space. With many teams, we enter into an option agreement, which provides us with the option to acquire substantially all of the assets of the RIA 12 to 13 months after the team's resignation date. The option agreement provides a purchase price formula, typically equal to a multiple of the portion of the new RIA's run rate EBPC at the time of acquisition closing. The option agreement also establishes the portion of the purchase price to be 
 10

   paid in cash and equity. Transactions with teams where we do not enter into an option agreement may be structured more like a typical acquisition. 
   Our Partner Firms 
         Our partner firms provide comprehensive wealth management services to ultra-high net worth and high net worth individuals and families, as well as business entities, under a largely recurring, fee-based model. Our partner firms provide these services across a diverse range of investment styles, asset classes and clients. The substantial majority of our partner firms are RIAs, and certain of our partner firms also have affiliated broker-dealers and/or insurance brokers. Several of our partner firms and principals have been recognized as leading wealth management firms and advisors by financial publications such as Barron's, The Financial Times and Forbes. 
         Our partner firms derive a substantial majority of their revenues from wealth management fees for investment advice, financial and tax planning, consulting, tax return preparation, family office services and other services. Wealth management fees are primarily based either on a contractual percentage of the client assets, a flat fee, an hourly rate or a combination of such fees and are billed either in advance or arrears on a monthly, quarterly or semiannual basis. We also generate other revenue from recordkeeping and administration service fees, commissions and distribution fees and outsourced services. 
         We currently have 60 partner firms. All of our partner firm acquisitions have been paid for with cash or a combination of cash and equity and the right to receive contingent consideration. We have to date, with limited exceptions, acquired substantially all of the assets of the firms we choose to partner with and have assumed only post-closing contractual obligations, not any material existing liabilities.

           The maps below show the locations of our partner firms as of March 25, 2019. The majority of our partner firms operate multiple offices. 
 
        Upon joining our partnership, each partner firm transitions its operations to our common general ledger, payroll and cash management systems. Our common general ledger system provides us access to financial information of each partner firm and is designed to accommodate the varied needs of each individual business. We control payroll and payment of management fees for partner firms through a common disbursement process. The common payroll system allows us to effectively monitor compensation, new hires, terminations and other personnel changes. We employ a cash management system under which cash held by partner firms above a threshold is transferred into our centralized accounts. The cash management system enables us to control and secure our cash flow and more efficiently monitor partner firm earnings and financial position. 
         We and our partner firms devote substantial time and effort to remaining current on, and addressing, regulatory and compliance matters. Each of our registered partner firms has its own chief compliance officer and has established a compliance program to help detect and prevent compliance violations. 
 15

          
        While the chief compliance officers at our partner firms are principally responsible for maintaining their respective compliance programs and to tailor them to the specifics of their partner firms' business, we have an experienced team of legal professionals in place at the holding company to support our partner firms in fulfilling their regulatory responsibilities by providing additional guidance and expertise. We collaborate with each of our partner firms in its completion of an annual compliance risk assessment, which is conducted by an outside law firm or a compliance consulting firm. We also engage third-party firms to conduct periodic cybersecurity audits and help coordinate completion of certain other employee trainings. We also monitor how our partner firms address risk assessment recommendations and regulatory exam findings. We also work with our partner firms to assist them in identifying capable legal and compliance advisors by leveraging our extensive relationships. 
   Focus Successions 
         We have a succession program, referred to as Focus Successions, to provide third-party wealth management firms a succession planning solution for their businesses. Pursuant to the program, one of our partner firms grants the third-party wealth management firm the right to offer to sell substantially all of its assets to the partner firm at any time with notice. The third-party firm's right under the succession agreement is subject to certain conditions, and the terms of the sale are pre-negotiated in a form of asset purchase agreement. Generally, the term of a succession agreement is one year and renews automatically for an additional year unless earlier terminated by one of the parties. No succession transition has been initiated to date, but several of the succession plans have been converted into acquisitions by our partner firms. 
 Competition 
         The wealth management industry is very competitive. We compete with a broad range of wealth management firms, including public and privately held investment advisors, traditional brokerages and wirehouses, firms associated with securities broker-dealers, financial institutions, private equity firms and insurance companies. We believe that important factors affecting our partner firms' ability to compete for clients include the ability to attract and retain key wealth management professionals, investment performance, wealth management fee rates, the quality of services provided to clients, the depth and continuity of client relationships, adherence to the fiduciary standard and reputation. 
         We strategically built a leading partnership of independent, fiduciary wealth management firms led by entrepreneurs through a unique, disciplined and proven acquisition strategy. Our differentiated partnership model has allowed us to grow and enhance our leadership position in the wealth management industry. As we continue our growth strategy of acquiring high-quality partner firms, we believe that important factors affecting our ability to compete for future acquisitions include:
 

 the degree to which target wealth management firms view our partnership model as preferable, financially and operationally or otherwise, to
acquisition or other arrangements offered by other potential purchasers; 
 the reputation and performance of our existing and future partner firms, by which target wealth management firms may judge us and our future
prospects; and 
 the quality and breadth of our value-added services. 

 Employees 
         As of December 31, 2018, we had over 2,600 employees, 76 of whom were employed at the holding company. 
         Additionally, as of December 31, 2018, there were approximately 400 principals who were part of the management companies that oversaw partner firms and were not our employees.

     Trademarks 
         We own many registered trademarks and service marks in the United States. We believe the Focus Financial Partners name and the many distinctive marks associated with it are of significant value and are very important to our business. Accordingly, as a general policy, we monitor the use of our marks and vigorously oppose any unauthorized use of the marks. 
         We register some of our copyrighted material and otherwise rely on common law protection of our copyrighted works. Such copyrighted materials are not material to our business. 
   Available Information 
         We are required to file annual, quarterly and current reports, proxy statements and certain other information with the SEC. The SEC maintains a website at www.sec.gov that contains reports, proxy and information statements and other information regarding registrants that file electronically with the SEC. Any documents filed by us with the SEC, including this Annual Report, can be downloaded from the SEC's website. 
         We also make available free of charge through our website, www.focusfinancialpartners.com, electronic copies of certain documents that we file with the SEC, including our Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file such material with, or furnish it to, the SEC. 
   Regulatory Environment 
   Existing Regulation 
         Our partner firms are subject to extensive regulation in the United States. In addition, Greystone, Dorchester, Prime Quadrant and Financial Professionals are subject to extensive regulation in the United Kingdom, Canada and Australia, as applicable. In the United States, our partner firms are subject to regulation primarily at the federal level, including regulation by the SEC under the Advisers Act, by the U.S Department of Labor (the "DOL") under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended ("ERISA"), and by the SEC and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority ("FINRA") for our partner firm subsidiaries that are broker-dealers. Our partner firms may also be subject to regulation by state insurance and securities regulators for insurance and other aspects of our partner firms' activities. Outside of the United States, Greystone is primarily regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority in the United Kingdom, Dorchester and Prime Quadrant are primarily regulated by the securities regulators of Canada's provinces, and Financial Professionals is primarily regulated by the Australian Securities & Investment Commission ("ASIC"). 
         Our U.S. based partner firms that are investment advisers are registered with the SEC under the Advisers Act. The Advisers Act imposes numerous obligations on RIAs, including fiduciary duties, compliance and disclosure obligations, recordkeeping requirements and operational requirements. Certain of our partner firms sponsor unregistered and registered funds in the United States and certain foreign jurisdictions. These activities subject those partner firms to additional regulatory requirements in those jurisdictions. In addition, many state securities commissions impose filing requirements on investment advisers that operate or have places of business in their states. Similarly, many states require certain client facing employees of RIAs and FINRA-registered broker-dealers to become state licensed. 
         Certain of our partner firms have affiliated SEC registered broker-dealers for the purpose of distributing funds or other securities products. Broker-dealers and their personnel are regulated, to a large extent, by the SEC and self-regulatory organizations, principally FINRA. In addition, state blue 
 17

   sky commissions have supervisory authority over broker-dealer activities conducted in their states. Broker-dealers are subject to regulations which cover virtually all aspects of their business, including sales practices, trading practices, use and safekeeping of clients' funds and securities, recordkeeping and the conduct of directors, officers, employees and representatives. Broker-dealers are also subject to net capital rules that mandate that they maintain certain levels of capital. Certain partner firms have a limited number of employees that are registered representatives with unaffiliated broker-dealers. 
         Certain of our partner firms have affiliated insurance brokers. State insurance laws grant state insurance regulators broad administrative powers. These supervisory agencies regulate many aspects of the insurance business, including the licensing of insurance brokers and agents and other insurance intermediaries, and trade practices such as marketing, advertising and compensation arrangements entered into by insurance brokers and agents. 
         Our partner firms are also subject to regulation by the DOL under ERISA and related regulations with respect to investment advisory and management services provided to participants in retirement plans covered by ERISA, including individual retirement accounts. Among other requirements, ERISA imposes duties on persons who are fiduciaries under ERISA and prohibits certain transactions involving related parties. 
         Additionally, we and our partner firms are subject to various data privacy and cybersecurity laws designed to protect client and employee personally identifiable information. These laws and regulations are increasing in complexity and number which has resulted in greater compliance risk and cost for us. The unauthorized access, use, theft or destruction of client or employee personal, financial or other data could expose us to potential financial penalties and legal liability. 
   Additional Regulatory Reform 
         Our partner firms are subject to the numerous regulatory reform initiatives in the United States and in international jurisdictions where they operate. New laws or regulations, or changes in enforcement of existing laws or regulations, could have a material and adverse impact on the scope or profitability of our partner firms' business activities or require us and/or our partner firms to change business practices and incur additional costs as well as potential reputational harm. 
         For example, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the "Dodd-Frank Act") was signed into law in the United States in July 2010. The Dodd-Frank Act is expansive in scope and requires the adoption of extensive regulations, many of which have just recently been adopted or become effective. 
         On April 18, 2018, the SEC proposed a package of rulemakings and interpretations that if adopted would impose a best interest standard of conduct for broker-dealers, require the delivery of a short-form disclosure document to retail investors, restrict the use of the term "adviser" or "advisor" by broker-dealers who are not also registered as investment advisers and clarify the SEC's views on the fiduciary duty that investment advisers owe to their clients. It is not clear how the adoption of such proposals would impact our partner firms. 
         On February 1, 2019, a Royal Commission in Australia issued a highly publicized report following a 12-month inquiry of misconduct in the banking, superannuation and financial services industry. The report makes many recommendations that, if adopted into law or regulations, could impact our existing or any future Australian partner firms or investments. Some of the regulations include a new system of registration for financial advisers to be overseen by a new regulatory body and the repeal of carve-outs and grandfathering of certain conflicted remuneration prohibitions. 
         In addition, financial regulators are increasing their enforcement and examination attention across a wide range of activities and business practices, including disclosure, conflicts of interest, cybersecurity, business continuity and succession planning. Such enhanced scrutiny may increase the likelihood of enforcement actions or violation findings or cause us or our partner firms to change business practices or incur additional costs. It is also not possible to predict how such changes may impact the businesses of our competitors and the competitive dynamics of the industry.
