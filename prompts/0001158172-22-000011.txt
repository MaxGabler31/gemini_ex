Overview
We are a global information and analytics company that measures advertising, content, and the consumer audiences of each, across media platforms. We create our products using a global data platform that combines information on digital platforms (connected (Smart) televisions, mobile devices, tablets and computers), television ("TV"), over the top devices ("OTT"), direct to consumer applications, and movie screens with demographics and other descriptive information. We have developed proprietary data science that enables measurement of person-level and household-level audiences, removing duplicated viewing across devices and over time. This combination of data and methods enables a common standard for buyers and sellers to transact on advertising. This helps companies across the media ecosystem better understand and monetize their audiences and develop marketing plans, content and products to more efficiently and effectively reach those audiences. Our ability to unify behavioral and other descriptive data enables us to provide audience ratings, advertising verification, and granular consumer segments that describe hundreds of millions of consumers. Our customers include digital publishers, television networks, movie studios, content owners, brand advertisers, agencies and technology providers.
The information we analyze crosses geographies, types of content and activities, including websites, mobile and OTT applications ("apps"), video games, television and movie programming, electronic commerce ("e-commerce") and advertising.
We are a Delaware corporation headquartered in Reston, Virginia with principal offices located at 11950 Democracy Drive, Suite 600, Reston, VA 20190. Our telephone number is 703-438-2000.
Recent Key Developments
Leadership Changes
On July 21, 2021, Gregory Fink resigned as our Chief Financial Officer ("CFO") and Treasurer, effective August 31, 2021. 
On October 19, 2021, our Board of Directors appointed Jonathan Carpenter as CFO and Treasurer, effective November 29, 2021. On December 10, 2021, our Board of Directors appointed Mary Margaret Curry as Chief Accounting Officer.
On February 28, 2022, our Chief Executive Officer ("CEO") and Executive Vice Chairman, William Livek, announced his intention to retire as CEO and transition to a non-executive Vice Chairman role after his successor as CEO is named. Mr. Livek plans to serve as non-executive Vice Chairman of our Board of Directors through the completion of his term in 2024.
Acquisition of Shareablee
On December 16, 2021, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "Merger Agreement") with Shareablee, Inc. ("Shareablee"). Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, we acquired Shareablee for a total purchase price of up to $45.0 million, subject to certain adjustments and achievement of certain conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement.
At closing, the aggregate consideration payable to the former holders of Shareablee's capital stock and warrant, and certain underlying equity awards that we assumed in the acquisition, was approximately 9.1 million shares of our common stock, including an estimated working capital adjustment. The number of shares of common stock issuable at closing was determined by dividing (x) $36.4 million, plus the exercise price of options that we assumed, by (y) a price per share of our common stock of $4.12. The closing price of our common stock on the Nasdaq Global Select Market on December 16, 2021 was $3.14 per share. 
With the closing of the Shareablee acquisition, we plan to expand our Media Metrix® and Video Metrix® currencies to include Shareablee's social media engagement and video insights, in order to bridge the industry gap of traditional digital and social measurement services that exists today. We expect the combined audience insights of Comscore and Shareablee to give media companies, brands and advertisers an unmatched understanding of cross-platform consumer engagement and reach. Integration plans call for Comscore digital products to benefit from Shareablee data, and for Shareablee clients to have additional advantages with curated views of Comscore digital data embedded in their Shareablee dashboards.

Refer to Footnote 6, Debt for additional information on the Notes and the Secured Term Note. 
COVID-19
During 2020 and the first half of 2021, the COVID-19 pandemic and related government mandates and restrictions had a significant impact on the media, advertising and entertainment industries in which we operate. The pandemic also had an impact on our business, including with respect to the execution of new and renewal contracts, the impact of closed movie theaters on our customers, customer payment delays and requests to modify contractual payment terms. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we took actions to mitigate the near-term liquidity impact, including freezing hiring, exiting non-critical consultants and contractors, terminating or negotiating reductions in vendor agreements and leases, and reducing certain travel, marketing, recruiting and other corporate activities. Although we cannot quantify the impact that the pandemic may have on our business in the future, we have seen positive recovery in the current year, including the reopening of theaters in most markets worldwide.
Background and Market
We were founded in 1999 on the belief that digital technology would transform the interactions between people, media and brands in ways that would generate substantial demand for data and analytics about that interaction. The growing adoption of digital technologies also allowed measurement of the behavior of consumers' online activities. Based on this vision, we built a global opt-in panel that provided insight into online activities. Over the years we have enhanced our product offerings by uniting panel data with census-level data from website tags and other sources, and we expanded our presence in various markets. In 2016, we merged with Rentrak Corporation ("Rentrak"), a global media measurement and advanced consumer targeting company serving the entertainment, television, video and advertising industries. Following the Rentrak merger, we have access to millions of television and video on demand ("VOD") screens and the ability to measure box office results from movie screens across the world. We also have an opt-in Total Home Panel, which enables measurement of household devices that use a home's internet connection, whether traditional mobile and computer devices, streaming media devices, gaming consoles or Internet of Things ("IOT") devices, which may include devices such as smart speakers, thermostats, and appliances.
Our Approach to Media Measurement 
Our approach to measuring media consumption addresses the ubiquitous nature of media content and the fragmentation caused by the variety of platforms and technologies used to access such content. Advertising exposure and effectiveness is another rapidly changing and fragmented area where we apply scale for validation and campaign measurement across devices, platforms and ecosystem technology providers. We believe this fragmentation presents major challenges to using legacy measurement systems that are comprised of relatively small panels of cooperating consumers or limited to specific media platforms. Our products and services are built on measurement and analytic capabilities comprised of broad-based data collection, proprietary databases, internally developed software and a computational infrastructure to measure, analyze and report on digital, television and movie activity at the level of granularity that we believe the media and advertising industries need.
Data Collection 
The following collection methods illustrate our extensive data sourcing:
•We collect data from proprietary consumer panels that measure the use of computers, tablets and smartphones that access the internet. These panelists have agreed to install our passive metering software on their devices, home network or both.
•We collect data from our near-census digital network whereby content publishers implement our software code (referred to as "tagging") on their websites, in mobile applications and video players to provide us usage information. 
•We license certain demographic and behavioral mobile and panel data from third-party data providers.
•We obtain television viewership information from satellite, telecommunications, connected (Smart) TV and cable operators covering millions of television and VOD screens.
Table of Contents

•We measure gross receipts and attendance information from movie screens across the world.
•We integrate our digital and television viewership information with other third-party datasets that include consumer demographic characteristics, attitudes, lifestyles and purchase behavior.
•We integrate many of our services with ad serving platforms.
•We utilize knowledgeable in-house industry analysts that span verticals such as pharmaceuticals, media, finance, consumer packaged goods and political information to add value to our data.
•We have created an opt-in Total Home Panel, which can capture data that runs through a home's internet connection. This expands our intelligence to include such activity as game console and IOT device usage.
Data Science and Management
The ability to integrate, manage and transform massive amounts of data is core to our company. We continue to invest in technologies to enable large-scale measurement with protection of consumer privacy and attractive economics. Our systems contain multiple redundancies and advanced distributed processing technologies. We have created innovations such as:
•Our UDM methodology, which allows us to combine person-centric panel data with website server data. We believe this gives our customers greater accuracy, granularity and relevance in audience measurement. 
•Our TV measurement systems, underpinned by multiple patents, which enable us to provide a consistent measurement of TV audience sizes across national, local, and addressable television to customers evaluating programming as well as customers selling and buying TV advertising. 
•An ability to de-duplicate audiences across platforms, which is based on direct observations within our consumer panel and census data combined with proprietary data science. This de-duplication allows us to measure the reach and frequency of advertising and content exposure across platforms and over time.
•An ability to validate advertising delivery and detect fraud through our Invalid Traffic and Sophisticated Invalid Traffic filtration methods. These methods have been accredited by the Media Rating Council, which provides our customers with added assurances of validity and reliability.
•An ability to capture the full content of a website or app session, which allows us to measure activity beyond page views such as purchase transactions, application submissions and product configurations.
•An ability to intelligently categorize massive amounts of web and video content, which allows us to inform targeted and brand-safe advertising.
Product Delivery
We deliver our products and services through diverse methods to meet the needs of our customers. These include Software-as-a-Service ("SAAS") delivery platforms, application programming interface and other data feeds that integrate directly with customer systems, and integrations with advertising technology providers such as data management platforms and demand-side platforms that enable data management, ad management and programmatic ad trading.

New Product Investments and Releases
Cookieless - Engineering Products in a Privacy Centric World
Our digital measurement is centered upon using first party panel data combined with additional information captured through census measurement and data partnerships. Historically, we have used cookies and mobile advertising IDs to provide additional context and scale to our digital audience measurement solutions, as well as to assist in more targeted measurement and reportability. The development of new opt-in permissions and enhanced focus on consent-based measurement provide the benefit of limiting the transfer of consumer personal information, but also mean changes to data collection and measurement processes. 
Table of Contents

We are adopting new methodologies to lead this transition to a more privacy-centric world. A key component is leveraging our capabilities in panels, which we believe give us a competitive advantage in digital and cross-platform management. In parallel, our work with existing and new partners to collaborate and test emerging solutions is intended to expand the reach of our census-level integrations. We are creating measurement innovations designed to produce stronger products engineered for privacy.
We are also engaged in industry initiatives that focus on the viability and success of the "free web," which is driven by advertising investment. One of these initiatives, championed by Google and Facebook, is a proposal from the World Federation of Advertisers. In addition, in June 2021 we were selected by the Association of National Advertisers as a partner in their Cross-Media Measurement initiative for a pilot in measuring privacy-preserving reach and frequency measurements for television and digital media audiences, which is capable of reporting both demographics and cross-platform deduplication.
In December 2021, OpenAP and the Video Advertising Bureau identified Comscore as a participating measurement company in XPm, their cross-platform measurement framework that is backed by national TV publishers. 
Comscore Predictive Audiences
With third-party cookie deprecation fast approaching, advertisers need bold new solutions to ensure their campaigns continue to reach the right audiences without interruption. In the first quarter of 2021 we launched Predictive Audiences – a cookie-free targeting capability that enables advertisers to reach audiences based on granular consumer behavior through privacy-friendly contextual signals. This solution delivers scale and precision beyond what was previously available in the industry, and can be used across digital, mobile, and CTV campaigns.
Branded Content Reporting
In 2021, we partnered with Hive, a leading provider of enterprise AI solutions, to reinvent its Branded Content reporting. Hive's computer vision technology is utilized to identify logos within video content. This detection from Hive is coupled with Comscore's media information to size the audiences to branded content, as well as describing those audiences based on demographics and advanced attributes.

Government Regulation and Privacy 
U.S. and international data security and privacy laws apply to our various businesses. We have programs in place to detect, contain and respond to data security incidents; however, increasing technology risks or unauthorized users who successfully breach our network security could misappropriate or misuse our proprietary information or cause interruptions in our services. Many countries have data protection laws with different requirements than those in the U.S., and many states in the U.S. have or are developing their own data protection and privacy requirements. This may result in inconsistent requirements and differing interpretations across jurisdictions.
Governments, privacy advocates and class action attorneys are increasingly scrutinizing how companies collect, process, use, store, share and transmit personal data. Laws such as the California Consumer Privacy Act ("CCPA"), Brazil's General Data Protection Law ("LGPD"), the General Data Protection Regulation ("GDPR") in Europe and industry self-regulatory codes have been enacted, and 
Table of Contents

more are being considered that will affect our ability (and our customers' ability) to reach current and prospective customers, to respond to individual customer requests under the laws, and to implement our business models effectively. The GDPR took effect in May 2018 and includes requirements regarding the collection and handling of individuals' personal data. The CCPA went into effect in January 2020, and the LGPD went into effect in September 2020. Beginning in January 2023, three new state privacy laws (and their applicable regulations) are scheduled to come into effect. The California Privacy Rights Act of 2020 ("CPRA") is scheduled to become fully operative on January 1, 2023 (substantially expanding the CCPA); the Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act is scheduled to become effective on January 1, 2023; and the Colorado Privacy Act is scheduled to become effective on July 1, 2023. In addition, regulators in the European Union and elsewhere are increasingly focused on consent and the collection of data using tracking technologies and cross-border data transfers. Failure to meet the applicable GDPR, CCPA, CPRA or LGPD requirements, or failure to comply with privacy, data collection, data transfer or consent requirements in other jurisdictions, could result in substantial penalties.
We also monitor actions by the Federal Communications Commission and the Federal Trade Commission, including regulatory developments affecting Internet Service Providers and other industry participants.
Human Capital Management
Our management of human capital is essential to the success of our company, and our management team is actively engaged in developing a strong, engaged team to execute on our business plans. 
As of January 31, 2022, we had 1,355 employees and 145 contingent providers/contractors. Our employee population, which is comprised 94% of full-time employees and 6% of part-time employees, is dispersed across the globe, as outlined below as of December 31, 2021.

Employee Engagement & Retention
The development, attraction and retention of talent is critical to the success of our business. We focus on building employee engagement; developing a positive culture of trust, transparency, learning, and involvement; and competitive pay and benefits structures to attract and retain employees and protect the intellectual capital that we have built. We regularly review our employee turnover and satisfaction rates, and develop strategies and tactics to improve employee engagement and retention. On average, employee tenure is over six years, and more than 20% of our employees have been employed by our company for more than ten years. 
We seek to attract and retain the best talent from a diverse group of sources around the world, in order to meet our current and future staffing needs. In addition to a robust employee referral practice and independent outreach, we have developed relationships with universities, professional associations, and industry alliances to further increase our outreach and talent pool. In 2021, our company conducted hiring in North America, Europe, India, and Latin America.
Where feasible within the countries in which we operate, we provide a competitive and varied portfolio of healthcare, wellness, financial, and other benefit offerings to suit the diverse needs and lifestyles of our employees. Within the United States, 86% of our employee population was enrolled in one of our healthcare plans as of December 31, 2021.
We provide virtual, on-demand learning opportunities to all employees, and we also develop and deliver custom learning programs to meet specific business needs and employee interests. In 2021, approximately 60% of our employees participated in learning activities through the on-demand portal. 
We believe we have strong labor practices and employee-friendly policies that enable a culture of trust, collaboration, and compliance. Our employment standards begin and end with respect for the dignity and worth of each person. Employees have multiple avenues through which to express opinions, ideas, and concerns, which enables an open culture of communication and inclusion; our policies require that complaints are investigated and any findings are addressed. Our employees are not represented by labor unions outside of those few countries where union representation is a customary practice of doing business. The Company operates a Compliance

Management System, a key component of which is mandatory training for all employees in areas including workplace harassment and our code of business conduct.
Work Environment
We believe we have created a work environment, whether in person or virtually, that represents our commitment to safety and wellness. In light of continued uncertainty in public health, we continue to provide flexibility to work remotely to ensure that employees can work effectively from their homes and protect their own health and that of their households. We provide both system and technology capability as well as personal support, including wellness activities and resources, virtual social activities, and support for working parents. Supporting the person, not just the "worker," allows us to maintain business operations without endangering employees or customers. We had no safety incidents or known incidents of work-related COVID-19 transmissions reported in 2021.
Diversity and Inclusion
We strive to build and develop a workforce that reflects diversity, equity, and inclusion at all levels of the organization. As of December 31, 2021, approximately 40% of our global workforce was female and approximately 30% of our executive leaders were female. Within the United States, approximately 40% of our employees identified as a person of color or as other than white. Our view is that our culture of involvement and appreciation of others enables us to more fully develop and leverage the strengths of our workforce to meet our business objectives. We place a high value on inclusion and employee-led opportunities across the Company, including the Employee Resource Groups ("ERGs") which are sponsored by senior leadership but are developed and maintained by diverse groups of employees who share or champion common interests, representations, or causes. We currently have ERGs in support of LGBTQ+ persons, people of color, women, young professionals, and remote workers. We have amplified our conversation and actions relating specifically to inclusion and diversity in the last year, taking a more active executive stance and implementing learning and development initiatives, additional ERGs, virtual employee gatherings and activities, and talent acquisition opportunities.
