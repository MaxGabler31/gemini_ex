Item 1. Business.
Our Company
We are the largest lifestyle retail chain devoted to western and work-related footwear, apparel and accessories in the United States. With 300 stores in 38 states as of March 26, 2022, we have more than three times as many stores as our nearest direct competitor that sells primarily western and work wear, and believe we have the potential to grow our domestic store base to 900 stores. Our stores, which are typically freestanding or located in strip centers, average 10,600 selling square feet and feature a comprehensive assortment of brands and styles, coupled with attentive, knowledgeable store associates. We target a broad and growing demographic, ranging from passionate western and country enthusiasts to workers seeking dependable, high-quality footwear and apparel. We strive to offer an authentic, one-stop shopping experience that fulfills the everyday lifestyle needs of our customers and, as a result, many of our customers make purchases in both the western and work wear sections of our stores. Our store environment, product offering and marketing materials represent the aesthetics of the true American West, country music and rugged, outdoor work. These threads are woven together in our motto, “Be True”, which communicates the genuine and enduring spirit of the Boot Barn brand.

Our product offering is anchored by an extensive selection of western and work boots and is complemented by a wide assortment of coordinating apparel and accessories. Many of the items that we offer are basics or necessities for our customers’ daily lives and typically represent enduring styles that are not meaningfully impacted by changing fashion trends. Accordingly, approximately 75% of our store inventory is kept in stock through automated replenishment programs. Our boot selection, which comprises approximately one-third of each store’s selling square footage space, is merchandised on self-service fixtures with western boots arranged by size and work boots arranged by style and function. This allows us to display the full breadth of our inventory and deliver a convenient shopping experience. We also carry market-leading assortments of denim, western shirts, cowboy hats, belts and belt buckles, western-style jewelry and accessories. Our western assortment includes many of the industry’s most sought-after brands, such as Ariat, Cinch, Cody James, Corral, Dan Post, Durango, El Dorado, Idyllwind, Justin, Laredo, Miss Me, Montana Silversmiths, Moonshine Spirit, Shyanne, Stetson, Tony Lama, Twisted X, Resistol and Wrangler. Our work assortment includes rugged footwear, outerwear, overalls, denim and shirts for the most physically demanding jobs where durability, performance and protection matter, including safety-toe boots and flame-resistant and high-visibility clothing. Among the top work brands sold in our stores are Carhartt, Cody James Work, Dickies, Georgia Boot, Hawx, Thorogood, Timberland Pro and Wolverine. Our merchandise is also available on our e-commerce websites.
Boot Barn was founded in 1978 and, over the past 44 years, has grown both organically and through successful strategic acquisitions of competing chains. We have rebranded and remerchandised the acquired chains under the Boot Barn banner. We believe that our business model and scale provide us with competitive advantages that have contributed to our consistent and strong financial performance, generating sufficient cash flow to support national growth.

​
On September 11, 2017, we acquired assets from Wood’s Boots, a four-store family-owned retailer with stores in Midland and Odessa, Texas. As part of the transaction, we purchased the inventory, entered into new leases with the stores’ landlord, offered employment to the Wood’s Boots team at all four store locations and assumed certain customer credits.

The Country Outfitter assets were purchased for $1.8 million of cash and assumed liabilities. The Company operates www.countryoutfitter.com as a website separate from its other e-commerce sites.
Sheplers Acquisition
On June 29, 2015, we acquired Sheplers, Inc. and Sheplers Holding Corporation (now known as Sheplers, LLC and Sheplers Holding LLC, respectively, following the conversion of these entities to limited liability companies on September 26, 2021) (these entities collectively, “Sheplers”), a western lifestyle company with 25 retail locations across the United States and an e-commerce business. We refer to the acquisition as the “Sheplers Acquisition”. We financed the Sheplers Acquisition with borrowings under a senior secured asset-based revolving credit facility for which Wells Fargo Bank, National Association is agent (the “June 2015 Wells Fargo Revolver”), and a syndicated senior secured term loan for which GCI Capital Markets LLC was agent (the “2015 Golub Term Loan”). Through the Sheplers Acquisition, we added eight new markets, expanded both our Texas (Dallas and San Antonio) and Denver markets, and greatly increased our omni-channel capabilities as Sheplers had a leading e-commerce platform (“Sheplers e-

commerce”). We rebranded 19 of the 25 retail stores acquired through the Sheplers Acquisition, and closed the remaining six stores during fiscal 2016. The acquisition-date fair value of the consideration transferred totaled $149.3 million. 
Our Competitive Strengths
We believe the following strengths differentiate us from our competitors and provide a solid foundation for future growth:
Powerful lifestyle brand. The Boot Barn brand is built on western lifestyle values that are core to American culture. Our deep understanding of this lifestyle enables us to create long-lasting relationships with our customers who embody these ideals. Our brand is highly visible through our sponsorship of local and national rodeos, stock shows, concerts and country music artists. We sell our products through pop-up shops at several of the largest events that we sponsor. We believe these grassroots marketing efforts make our brand synonymous with the western lifestyle, validate our brand’s authenticity and establish Boot Barn as the trusted specialty retailer for all of our customers’ everyday needs.
Strong e-commerce positioning. We offer a compelling shopping experience to our customers, including 300 brick-and-mortar stores combined with our e-commerce websites consisting primarily of bootbarn.com, sheplers.com and countryoutfitter.com. Bootbarn.com and sheplers.com offer a compelling every-day low price shopping experience catered towards a lifestyle customer with western roots and a strong work influence. Countryoutfitter.com has a curated assortment appealing to a more fashion-based country lifestyle customer. Each of our e-commerce sites has distinct brand positioning and provides a differentiated shopping experience to our customers.
Fast growing specialty retailer of western and work wear in the U.S. Our broad geographic footprint, which currently spans 38 states, provides us with significant economies of scale, enhanced supplier relationships, the ability to recruit and retain high quality store associates and the ability to reinvest in our business at levels that we believe exceed those of our competition.
Loyal customer base. Our customers come to us for many aspects of their everyday footwear and clothing needs because of the breadth and availability of our product offering. Our customer loyalty program, B Rewarded, enhances our connection and relationship with our customers. Our loyalty program has grown rapidly since its inception in fiscal 2011 and as of March 26, 2022, includes approximately 5.8 million members who have purchased merchandise from us in the last three fiscal years. The majority of our sales are made to these customers. We leverage this database, which provides useful information about our customers, to enhance our marketing activities across our stores and e-commerce websites, refine our merchandising and planning efforts and assist in our selection of sites for new stores.
Differentiated shopping experience. We deliver a one-stop shopping experience that engages our customers and, we believe, fulfills their lifestyle needs. Our stores are designed to create an inviting and engaging experience and include prominent storefront signage, a simple and easy-to-shop layout and a large and conveniently arranged self-service selection of boots. We offer significant inventory breadth and depth across a range of boots, apparel and accessories. Additionally, all of our stores are equipped with touch screen devices that allow our customers to access millions of additional boots, apparel and other items from our e-commerce warehouse inventory as well as the inventory at most of our larger third-party vendors, purchase these items in store, and, in most cases, receive free shipping. We also have touch screen devices that allow customers to browse our in-store assortment and select an item that meets their functional requirements and preferences. We continue to enhance customer service with our omni-channel initiatives, including buy online pick up in-store, buy online pick up curbside, buy online return in store, buy online ship from store, same day delivery and in-store fulfillment of online purchases. We believe that our strong, long-lasting supplier relationships enhance our ability to provide a compelling merchandise assortment with a strong in-stock position both in-store and online. Our knowledgeable store associates are passionate about our merchandise and deliver a high level of service to our customers. These elements help promote customer loyalty and drive repeat visits.
Compelling merchandise assortment and strategy. We believe we offer a diverse merchandise assortment that features the most sought-after western and work wear brands, well-regarded niche brands and exclusive brands across a range of merchandise categories including boots, apparel and accessories. We have a core assortment of styles 

3



that serves as a foundation for our merchandising strategy and we augment and tailor that assortment by region to cater to local preferences. 
Portfolio of exclusive brands. We have leveraged our scale, merchandising experience and customer knowledge to launch a portfolio of brands exclusive to us, which primarily include Shyanne, Cody James, Moonshine Spirit, Idyllwind, Hawx, Cody James Work, El Dorado, Cleo + Wolf, Brothers & Sons, Rank 45 and Blue Ranchwear. Our exclusive brands are currently available in stores, on bootbarn.com, sheplers.com and countryoutfitter.com and offer high-quality western and work boots as well as apparel and accessories for men, ladies and kids. Each of our exclusive brands address product and price segments that we believe are underserved by third-party brands and has historically achieved better merchandise margins than the third-party brands that we carry. Customer receptivity and demand for our exclusive brands have been strong, demonstrated by their increasing penetration and sales momentum across our store base and e-commerce websites.
Versatile store model with compelling unit economics. We have successfully opened and currently operate stores that generate strong cash flow, consistent store-level financial results and an attractive return on investment across a variety of geographies, markets, store sizes and location types. We operate stores in markets characterized as agribusiness centers and ranch regions, and in other various geographies throughout the United States. Our stores are also successful in small, rural towns, suburban and major metropolitan areas.
Our new store model requires an average net cash investment of approximately $1.2 million and targets an average payback period of three years. Our lean operating structure, coupled with our strong supplier relationships, has allowed us to grow with minimal supply chain investments as a portion of our products ship directly from our suppliers to our stores. We believe that our proven retail model and attractive unit economics support our ability to grow our store footprint in both new and existing markets across the U.S.
Highly experienced management team and passionate organization. Our senior management team has extensive experience across all key retail disciplines and has been instrumental in developing a robust and scalable infrastructure to support our growth. In addition to playing an important role in developing our long-term growth initiatives, our senior management team embraces the genuine and enduring qualities of the western and work lifestyle and has created a positive culture of enthusiasm and entrepreneurial spirit which is shared by team members throughout our entire organization. 
Our Growth Strategies
We are pursuing several strategies to continue our profitable growth, including:
Continuing omni-channel leadership.  Our growing national footprint, social media following and broader marketing efforts drive traffic to our stores and e-commerce websites. We operate our e-commerce websites as an alternative to shopping in the stores, which allows us to reach customers outside our geographic footprint. We continue to make investments in both online and in-store advertising, aimed at increasing traffic to our e-commerce websites, which reached more than 88 million total visits in fiscal 2022 compared to more than 69 million total visits in fiscal 2021, and increasing the amount of merchandise purchased by customers who visit our websites, while improving the shopping experience for our customers. Additionally, all of our stores are equipped with touch screen devices that allow our customers to access millions of additional boots, apparel and other items from our e-commerce warehouse inventory as well as the inventory at most of our larger third-party vendors, purchase these items in store, and, in most cases, receive free shipping. We also have touch screen devices that allow customers to browse our in-store assortment and select an item that meets their functional requirements and preferences. We continue to enhance customer service with our omni-channel initiatives, including buy online pick up in-store, buy online pick up curbside, buy online return in store, buy online ship from store, same day delivery and in-store fulfillment of online purchases. We have also made investments in our e-commerce infrastructure, including adding automation to our warehouses to support expanding e-commerce growth. Our e-commerce sales as a portion of total consolidated net sales were 15.5% and 18.6% in fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021, respectively.

Driving same store sales growth. We believe that we can continue to grow our same store sales by increasing our brand awareness, driving additional traffic to our stores and e-commerce websites and increasing the amount of merchandise purchased by customers while visiting both our stores and e-commerce channels. Our management team has several initiatives in place to accelerate growth, enhance our store associates’ selling skills, drive store-level productivity and increase customer engagement through our loyalty program.
Building our exclusive brand portfolio. We believe we can achieve gross margin enhancement by increasing the penetration of our exclusive brand sales. As of March 26, 2022, our exclusive brands primarily include Shyanne, Cody James, Moonshine Spirit, Idyllwind, Hawx, Cody James Work, El Dorado, Cleo + Wolf, Brothers & Sons, Rank 45 and Blue Ranchwear, and are sold in our stores and on our e-commerce websites. Each of our exclusive brands, which address product and price segments that we believe are underserved by third-party brands, offers high quality exclusive products to our customers and has historically achieved better merchandise margins than the third-party brands that we carry. 
Expanding our store base. Driven by our compelling store economics, we believe that there is a significant opportunity to expand our store base in the U.S. During fiscal 2022, we opened 28 new stores with no acquisitions. We typically rebrand acquired stores within twelve months from the date of acquisition. Based on an extensive analysis, we believe that we have the potential to grow our domestic store base of 300 stores as of March 26, 2022 to approximately 900 stores over time. Over the long-term we plan to target store openings in new and existing markets and in adjacent and underserved markets that we believe will be receptive to our concept. Over the past several years, we have made investments in personnel, information technology, warehouse infrastructure and e-commerce platforms to support the expansion of our operations.
Leveraging our economies of scale. We believe that we have a variety of opportunities to increase the profitability of our business over time. Our ability to leverage our infrastructure and drive store-level productivity due to economies of scale is expected to be a primary driver of our improvement in profitability. We intend to continually refine our merchandise mix and increase the penetration of our exclusive brands to help differentiate us from our competitors and achieve higher merchandise margins. We also expect to capitalize on additional economies of scale in purchasing and sourcing as we grow our geographic footprint and online presence.
Enhancing brand awareness. We intend to enhance our brand awareness and customer loyalty in a number of ways, such as continuing to grow our store base and our online and social media initiatives. We use broadcast media such as radio, television and outdoor advertisements to reach customers in new and existing markets. We also maintain our strong market position through our grassroots marketing efforts, including sponsorship of rodeos, stock shows and other western industry events, as well as our association with country music, including partnerships with Miranda Lambert and Brad Paisley and up-and-coming country musicians. We have an effective social media strategy with high customer engagement, as evidenced by our strong following on Facebook and Instagram. 
Our Market Opportunity
We participate in the large, growing and highly fragmented western, country lifestyle and work wear markets of the broader apparel and footwear industry. We offer a variety of boots, apparel and accessories that are basics or necessities for our customers’ daily lives. Many of our customers are employed in the agriculture, oil and gas, manufacturing and construction industries, and are often country and western enthusiasts. We believe that growth in the western and country lifestyle markets will continue to be driven by the growth of western events, such as rodeos, the popularity of country music, growth in casual wear, affinity for outdoor activities, and the continued strength and endurance of the western lifestyle. We believe that growth in the work wear market will continue to be driven by increasing activity in construction and manufacturing. Additionally, government regulations for workplace safety have driven and, we believe, will continue to drive, sales in specific categories, such as safety-toe boots and flame-resistant and high-visibility clothing for various industrial and outdoor occupations.

Our Sales Channels
During fiscal 2022, we continued to enhance our omni-channel capabilities. Our current omni-channel presence consists of both brick-and-mortar stores as well as an e-commerce platform, consisting primarily of bootbarn.com, sheplers.com and countryoutfitter.com.
Our stores
As a lifestyle retail concept, our stores offer a broad array of merchandise to outfit an entire family, while working during the week, relaxing on the weekend, or dressing up for an evening out. Our stores are easy to navigate with clear sight lines to all major product categories. Our preferred store layout has ladies’ and children’s apparel on one side of the store and men’s western and men’s work apparel on the other side. Our basic denim is usually merchandised on shelving placed on the exterior walls, while our premium-priced, more stylized denim and clothing are prominently displayed on floor fixtures and mannequins. We utilize the space in the front of the store for accessories such as hats, belts, jewelry, handbags, home merchandise, gifts and various impulse purchase items.
Boots, our signature category, anchor the rear of the store with an expansive assortment displayed on fixtures up to six shelves in height. We offer virtually all of our boots in pairs out on the sales floor. To reflect the typical purchasing decision process of each of our customer segments, we arrange all western boots by size and all work boots by function and brand. While our knowledgeable and friendly store associates are readily available to assist our customers, the store design facilitates a self-service shopping experience.
Our stores are generally located in or near high visibility, power and large neighborhood shopping centers with trade areas of five or more miles. Our stores average 10,600 selling square feet and feature a comprehensive assortment of brands and styles, coupled with attentive, knowledgeable store associates. Our stores are designed and managed to drive profitability and, we believe, create a compelling customer shopping experience.
During fiscal 2022, we opened 28 new stores. As of March 26, 2022, our retail footprint included 300 stores in 38 states across the U.S. Two of our stores are operated under the “American Worker” name. Our American Worker stores primarily feature work-related footwear, apparel and accessories. We do not currently intend to open additional American Worker stores.

E-commerce
Our e-commerce websites are an integral part of our brand and allow us to further build awareness in our current markets and reach customers not served by our current geographic footprint. During fiscal 2022, we had more than 88 million total visits to our websites and we sold merchandise to customers in all 50 states. Approximately 2.9% of our total e-commerce revenue for fiscal 2022 was generated from customers outside of the United States. Such foreign-source revenue constituted approximately 0.5% of our overall net sales in fiscal 2022.

7



Our growing national footprint and broader marketing efforts drive traffic to our bootbarn.com website, which in turn also drives traffic to our stores. We believe that many customers, especially those shopping for boots, browse online at bootbarn.com and then visit our stores to make their purchases to ensure a proper fit. As a multi-channel retailer, we are implementing technology initiatives that integrate in-store and e-commerce platforms into one seamless customer experience. As an example, our stores have in-store touch screen devices that expand the product offering available to our in-store customers, including additional styles, colors and sizes not carried in the store. We continue to enhance customer service with our omni-channel initiatives, including buy online pick up in-store, buy online pick up curbside, buy online return in store, buy online ship from store, same day delivery and in-store fulfillment of online purchases.
Our e-commerce businesses are every-day low price models. For all of our e-commerce brands, we communicate information on current promotions and upcoming events on our e-commerce websites, which helps drive purchases online and traffic to our stores. We continue to improve follow-up email communication related to order confirmations, as well as offer boot care and other accessories associated with boot purchases.
Store expansion opportunities and site selection
We have substantial experience in opening stores in new and existing geographic markets. During the last three fiscal years, we have successfully added, on a net basis, 60 new stores through a combination of organic growth and strategic acquisitions. We evaluate potential new locations in light of a variety of criteria, including local demographics and population, the area’s industrial base, the existing competitive landscape, occupancy costs, store visibility, traffic, environmental considerations, co-tenancy and accessibility. We also consider a region’s total store potential to help ensure efficiencies in store management and media spending. Most of our stores are in high-traffic and highly visible locations and many have freeway signage. Stores located in metropolitan areas are typically established in high-density neighborhoods, and stores located in rural areas are typically established near highways or major thoroughfares.
Based on a recent extensive internal and external analysis of our current customer base, store performance drivers and competitor penetration, we believe that the U.S. market supports the ability to grow our current domestic store base to approximately 900 stores. We utilized multiple methods for measuring market size, including a review of demographic and psychographic factors by core-based statistical areas across the United States. We supplemented that data by analyzing our share of the geographic markets in which we currently operate and extrapolating that share to new geographic markets. Based on our market analysis, we have created a regional and state-by-state development plan to strategically extend our store portfolio. Careful consideration was given to operational constraints and merchandising differences in new and existing markets, while balancing the relevant risks associated with opening stores in those markets.
Over the past several years, we have invested in construction and real estate resources, information technology and warehouse infrastructure to support the expansion of our operations. In addition, we have developed a model for new stores that assumes a leased 8,000 to 12,000 square foot space, requires an average net cash investment of approximately $1.2 million and targets an average payback period of three years. We believe that under this model we can grow our store base by approximately 10% annually over the next several years without substantially modifying our current resources and infrastructure. 
Store Management and Training
We have a strong culture focused on providing superior customer service. We believe that our store associates and managers form the foundation of the Boot Barn brand. We recruit people who are welcoming, friendly and service-oriented, and who often live the western lifestyle or have a genuine affinity for it. We have a positive culture of enthusiasm and entrepreneurial spirit throughout the Company, which is particularly strong in our stores. Given the lifestyle nature of the Boot Barn brand, we have developed a natural connection between our customers and our store associates.
Given the importance of both fit and function in selling much of our product, we utilize a well-developed sales, service and product training program. We provide more than 20 hours of training for new store associates, as well as 

8



ongoing product, sales and leadership training. Additionally, we provide home office and supplier-led workshops on products, selling skills and leadership at our annual three-day store manager meeting. Our store management training programs emphasize building skills that lead to effective store management and overall leadership. Our store managers are responsible for hiring and staffing our stores and are empowered with the sales, customer service and operational tools necessary to monitor employee and store performance. We believe that our continued investments in training our employees help drive loyalty from our store associates and, in turn, our customers. We are committed to providing the right merchandise solution for each of our customers based on the ultimate end use of our products. Our goal is to train each of our store associates to be able to guide a customer throughout a store and provide helpful knowledge on product fit, functions and features across our departments. Rather than rely heavily on sales commissions and supplier-specific incentive programs, we utilize a system under which the vast majority of our store associates’ compensation is based on an hourly wage. We believe that this produces a team-oriented culture, creates a less pressured selling environment and helps ensure that our store associates are focused on the specific needs of our customers.
Merchandising
Strategy
We seek to establish our stores as a one-stop destination for western and work-related footwear, apparel and accessories. Our merchandising strategy is to offer a core assortment of products, brands and styles by store, department and price point. We augment and tailor this assortment by region to cater to local preferences such as toe profiles for western boots, styling for western apparel, and functions and features for work apparel and work boots depending on climate and the local industries served. In addition, we actively maintain a balance between third party brands and our own brands that, we believe, offers our customers a compelling mix between selection, product and value.
Our business is moderately seasonal and as a result our revenues fluctuate from quarter to quarter. The third quarter of our fiscal year, which includes the Christmas shopping season, has historically produced higher sales and disproportionately higher operating results than the other quarters of our fiscal year. Historically, neither the western nor the work component of our business has been meaningfully impacted by fashion trends or seasonality. We believe that many of our customers are driven primarily by utility and brand, and our best-selling styles tend to be items that carry over from year to year with only minor updates. In fiscal 2022, fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020 we generated approximately 33%, 34% and 34% of our net sales during our third fiscal quarter, respectively.
We have a minimal amount of seasonal merchandise that could necessitate significant markdowns. This allows us to implement automated replenishment systems for approximately 75% of our store merchandise, meaning that, as sales are captured in a store’s point of sale system, recommended purchase orders are systematically generated for approval by our merchandising group, ensuring our strong in-stock inventory position. As a result, demand and margins for the majority of our products are fairly predictable, which reduces our inventory risk. Unfavorable economic conditions, including those caused by COVID-19, could leave us with either excess inventory or a shortage of inventory and increased pressure on our margins. For more information about the risks, uncertainties, and other factors that could affect our future results, please see Item 1A, Risk Factors, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
Our products
During fiscal 2022, our products contributed to overall sales in the following manner:

● | Gender—Men’s merchandise accounted for approximately 60% of our sales with the balance being ladies, kids and unisex merchandise.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Styling—Western styles comprised approximately 70% of our sales, with work-related and other styles making up the balance.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Product category—Boots accounted for 48% of our sales, with apparel comprising an additional 36% and the balance consisting of hats, gifts, accessories and home merchandise.

Throughout our long history we have maintained collaborative relationships with our key suppliers. These relationships, coupled with our scale, have allowed us to carry a wide selection of popular and niche brands, including Ariat, Carhartt Workwear, Cinch, Corral, Dan Post, Georgia Boot, Justin Boots, Keen, Rocky, Stetson, Timberland, Tony Lama, Twisted X, Wolverine and Wrangler. In many cases, we are one of the largest accounts of our suppliers and have become important as the largest specialty retailer of western and work wear in the U.S. As a result, we have several advantages relative to our competitors, including increased buying power and access to first-to-market or limited-edition products. This provides us with competitive differentiation and the ability to generate higher merchandise margins.
Our scale has also allowed us to introduce our own proprietary western wear brands, Shyanne and Cody James, which offer high-quality western boots, shirts, jackets and hats for women and men, respectively. We also have an exclusive license agreement with country music star Brad Paisley, who designs a collection of boots, apparel and accessories for us, under the brand name Moonshine Spirit, that reflect his lifestyle and personality. In fiscal 2019 we entered into a new partnership with country music artist Miranda Lambert, to develop a lifestyle brand, Idyllwind, inspired by her music and creative talents, which includes boots, apparel and accessories. In fiscal 2020 we developed two additional exclusive brands, Hawx and Cody James Work. These brands offer high quality work wear and work boots to our customers. We created these brands to address segments that we believe are underserved by third-party brands. In fiscal 2022 we developed four new exclusive brands, Cleo + Wolf, Brothers & Sons, Rank 45 and Blue Ranchwear. These brands expand our exclusive merchandise assortment to our country customer. We have a dedicated product development team that designs and sources merchandise from suppliers around the world. These product assortments are exclusive to Boot Barn and are merchandised and marketed as if they were third-party brands both in our stores and on our e-commerce websites. In fiscal 2022, sales from our exclusive brand products accounted for approximately 28.3% of our consolidated sales including our stores and e-commerce websites. These exclusive brands differentiate us from our competitors and have historically produced higher incremental merchandise margins than the third-party brands that we carry.
Planning and allocation
We believe that we have assembled a talented and experienced team in both the buying and merchandise planning functions. The experience of our team is critical to understanding the technical requirements of our merchandise based on region and use, such as the appropriate safety toe regulations for work boots in a particular industry. The team is constantly managing our replenishment model to ensure a high in-stock position by stock keeping unit, or SKU, on a store-by-store basis. Our merchandising team optimizes the product selection, mix and depth across our stores by analyzing demand on a market-by-market basis, continuously reviewing our sell-through results, communicating with our suppliers about local market preferences and new products, shopping our competitors’ stores, and immersing themselves in trade and western lifestyle events including rodeos, country music concerts and other industry-specific activities. Our merchandising team also makes frequent visits to our stores and partners with our regional, district and store managers to refine the merchandise assortment by region. Our team has demonstrated the ability to effectively manage merchandising, pricing and promotional strategies across our store base.
To keep the product assortment fresh, we reposition a small portion of our merchandise on the sales floor every month. To drive traffic to our stores and create in-store energy and excitement, we execute a promotional calendar that showcases select brands or merchandise categories throughout the year and rotates on a monthly cadence. Our promotional activity also enables us to consistently engage with our customers both online and in-store, as well as through our various marketing media. Our ability to optimize the price for each merchandise category on a market-by-market basis, helps us to maximize profitability while remaining price competitive. 
Marketing and Advertising
Our marketing strategy is designed to build brand awareness, acquire new customers, enhance customer loyalty and drive in-store and online transactions. We customize our marketing mix for each of our markets and purposes. For example, during store grand openings we engage in additional local community outreach and advertise in local print media in select markets. We primarily use the following forms of media:

10



Pay-per-click—We use pay-per-click advertising to reach online shoppers whose behavior indicates an interest in our products. This marketing medium allows us the opportunity to grow our business and acquire new customers. 
Radio and television—We purchase spots on both national and regional radio stations, primarily country music channels, to draw customers to nearby locations. We also maintain relationships with several country music artists in order to capitalize on the popularity of country music, using our stores and marketing communications to promote their album sales or concerts. In return, these country music artists often make in-store appearances or mention us on social media and occasionally give private performances. We also purchase television spots to create awareness in new markets and occasionally help support grand openings of new stores.
Direct mail—We conduct several direct mail campaigns, and during fiscal 2022, we sent out approximately 7.4 million mailers, ranging in size from postcards to catalogs of approximately 50 pages.
E-mail—We e-mail our e-commerce customers and members of our B Rewarded loyalty program as part of our cross-channel effort to drive traffic to our stores and websites. We sent more than one billion e-mails in fiscal 2022.
Social media—We also have a marketing strategy that has produced a fast-growing social media presence, as evidenced by our strong following on Facebook and Instagram. Our posts celebrate country and western life and humor, and routinely get thousands of likes, hundreds of shares and dozens of comments each. 
Event sponsorship—We typically sponsor community-based western events each year within the regional footprint of our store locations. Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo, a well-known 20-day celebration of western heritage, is one of our most prominent sponsorships and attracts more than two million visitors to Houston, Texas, where we operate many stores in the area. We also sponsor the San Antonio Stock Show and Rodeo, an 18-day event with more than two million attendees. Other prominent sponsorships include Cheyenne Frontier Days, the largest outdoor rodeo in the U.S., the Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association and related National Finals Rodeo in Las Vegas, Nevada, Professional Bull Riders and the National High School Rodeo Association, which supports rodeos for competitors in high school and junior high school. At more prominent events, we often set up large pop-up shops which allow participants to purchase our merchandise. 
Distribution
Our suppliers ship less than half of our in-store merchandise directly to our stores and a portion of our e-commerce merchandise to our e-commerce customers. The remaining units are either shipped from our distribution center located in Fontana, California, or from the distribution center in Wichita, Kansas, that we acquired as a result of the Sheplers Acquisition. Our distribution center in California primarily distributes our exclusive brand and volume discount purchases to our stores, and supplies inventory for sponsored events and new store openings. Our Wichita, Kansas distribution center fulfills our e-commerce orders. In accordance with our automated replenishment programs, third-party suppliers typically deliver merchandise to our stores daily, ensuring in-stock merchandise availability and a steady flow of new inventory for our customers. 
Competition
The retail industry for western and work wear is highly fragmented and characterized by primarily regional competitors. We estimate that there are thousands of independent specialty stores scattered across the country. We believe that we compete primarily with smaller regional chains and independents on the basis of product quality, brand recognition, price, customer service and the ability to identify and satisfy consumer demand. In addition, as we expand our e-commerce sales presence, we are competing to an increasing degree with online retailers and the e-commerce offerings of traditional competitors. We also compete with farm supply stores and, to a lesser degree, mass merchants, some of which are significantly larger than us, but most of which realize only a small percentage of their total revenues from the sale of western and work wear. We have more than three times as many stores as our nearest direct competitor that sells primarily western and work wear and we believe that our nationally recognized lifestyle brand, economies of scale, breadth and depth of inventory across a variety of categories, strong in-stock position, portfolio of authentic

exclusive brands, enhanced supplier partnerships, exclusive offerings and ability to recruit and retain high quality store associates favorably differentiate us from our competitors.
Information technology
We have made significant investments to create a scalable information technology platform to support growth in our retail and e-commerce sales without further near-term investments in our information technology infrastructure. We use an Enterprise Resource Planning system (“Aptos Retail”) for integrated point-of-sale, merchandising, planning, sales audit, customer relationship management, inventory control, loss prevention, purchase order management and business intelligence. We operate Aptos Retail on a software-as-a-service platform. This approach allows us to regularly upgrade to the most recent software release with minimal operational disruption, nominal systems infrastructure investment and a relatively small in-house information technology department. Aptos Retail also interfaces with our accounting system. 
We have also invested in an information technology platform for our e-commerce websites, which acts as the foundation for our digital store fronts. 
Intellectual property
We regard our trademarks as having value and as being important to our marketing efforts. We have registered our trademarks in the U.S., including our brand name “Boot Barn” and our exclusive brands. We have a registered trademark for the “Sheplers” and “Country Outfitter” brand names. We have foreign trademark protection in China and Hong Kong where we have registered our Boot Barn trademarks. We also own the domain name for our primary e-commerce websites, www.bootbarn.com, www.sheplers.com and www.countryoutfitter.com. Our policy is to pursue registration of our trademarks and to rigorously defend their infringement by third parties. 
Our employees
As of March 26, 2022, we employed approximately 2,200 full-time and 6,200 part-time employees, of which approximately 1,000 were employed at our Store Support Center and distribution centers and approximately 7,400 were employed at our stores. The number of employees, especially part-time employees, fluctuates depending upon our seasonal needs. None of our employees are represented by a labor union and we consider our relationship with our employees to be good. We have never experienced a strike or significant work stoppage. 
Regulation and legislation
We are subject to labor and employment laws, laws governing truth-in-advertising, privacy laws, safety regulations and other laws at the federal, state and local level, including consumer protection regulations, such as the Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act of 2008, that regulate retailers and govern the promotion and sale of merchandise and the operation of stores and warehouse facilities. We monitor changes in these laws and believe that we are in material compliance with all applicable laws.
We source many of our exclusive brand products from outside the U.S. The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other similar anti-bribery and anti-kickback laws and regulations generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to non-U.S. officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Our policies and our supplier compliance agreements mandate compliance with applicable law, including these laws and regulations.

Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements
This annual report contains forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties. All statements other than statements of historical or current fact included in this annual report are forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). Forward-looking statements refer to our current expectations and projections relating to, by way of example and without limitation, our financial condition, liquidity, profitability, results of operations, margins, plans, objectives, strategies, future performance, business and industry. You can identify forward-looking statements by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. These statements may include words such as “anticipate”, “estimate”, “expect”, “project”, “plan”, “intend”, “believe”, “may”, “might”, “will”, “could”, “should”, “can have”, “likely” and other words and terms of similar meaning in connection with any discussion of the timing or nature of future operating or financial performance or other events, but not all forward-looking statements contain these identifying words. For example, all statements we make relating to our estimated and projected earnings, revenues, costs, expenditures, cash flows, growth rates and financial results, our plans and objectives for future operations, growth or initiatives, strategies or the expected outcome or impact of pending or threatened litigation are forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause or contribute to such a discrepancy include, but are not limited to, the factors set forth in Item 1A. Risk Factors – “Summary of Risk Factors” below.
We derive many of our forward-looking statements from our current operating budgets and forecasts, which are based upon detailed assumptions. While we believe that our assumptions are reasonable, we caution that it is very difficult to predict the impact of known factors, and it is impossible for us to anticipate all factors that could affect our actual results. For these reasons, we caution readers not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements.
See “Risk Factors” for a more complete discussion of the risks and uncertainties mentioned above and for a discussion of other risks and uncertainties. It is not possible for our management to predict all risks, nor can we assess the impact of all factors on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements we may make. In addition, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic may also exacerbate other risks discussed herein, any of which could, individually or in the aggregate, have a material effect on us. Additional impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic may arise that we are not aware of currently. All forward-looking statements attributable to us are expressly qualified in their entirety by these cautionary statements as well as others made in this annual report and in our other SEC filings and public communications. You should evaluate all forward-looking statements made by us in the context of these risks and uncertainties.
We caution you that the risks and uncertainties identified by us may not be all of the factors that are important to you. Furthermore, the forward-looking statements included in this annual report are made only as of the date hereof. Our forward-looking statements do not reflect the potential impact of any future acquisitions, mergers, dispositions, joint ventures or investments that we may make. We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as otherwise required by law.
