History 
 
iQSTEL, formerly known as PureSnax International, Inc., was incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on June 24, 2011. PureSnax was previously a wellness brand focused on bringing healthy snacks and foods to consumers. On March 8, 2017, PureSnax exited a previous License Agreement with a Canadian snack food Licensor. From March of 2017 until its acquisition of Etelix.com USA, LLC, PureSnax was working to develop its own brand and its own products for manufacture, distribution, sales and marketing of various products within the health foods and snacks industry and to pursue related business opportunities. PureSnax acquired Etelix.com USA, LLC on June 25, 2018. The company left the healthy snacks and foods business to focus on the Telecommunications Business.
 
In August 30, 2018, PureSnax changed its name to “iQSTEL Inc.” and received a new CUSIP number: 46265G107, as well as a new trading symbol “IQST” in order to better resemble its new name. iQSTEL also changed the Standard Industrial Classification (SIC Code) to 4813, Telephone Communications, Except Radiotelephone.
 
The transformative process is an ongoing effort. However, in the last year the Company achieved the restructuring of its revenue from a 100% VoIP business to one where currently VoIP represents half of overall Company revenue, while SMS and value-added SMS services account for the other half. SMS and value-added SMS is a much higher gross profit business; thus the Company’s bottom line has increased in tandem.

Operating Subsidiaries
 
Based on our current business infrastructure, the Company has expanded from its original VoIP services into new business areas: Short Message Service (SMS) for Applications to Person (A2P) and Person to Person (P2P); Internet of Things (IoT) solutions and Blockchain-based platforms.
 
Etelix.com USA LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of iQSTEL Inc., is a Miami, Florida-based international telecom carrier founded in 2008 that provides telecom and technology solutions worldwide, with commercial presence in North America, Latin America, and Europe. Etelix provides International Long-Distance voice services for Telecommunications Operators (ILD Wholesale), and Submarine Fiber Optic Network capacity for internet (4G and 5G).
 
Etelix is interconnected to the most important players in the industry, with a very strong focus on Asian markets, among which it is worth mentioning: China Telecom, PCCW, Hutchinson Telecom, Vodafone India, KDDI, Airtel, Reliance, Viettel, TATA Communications, Flow Jamaica (Cable and Wireless Caribbean), Cable and Wireless Panama, Millicom (TIGO), Telefonica de España (Movistar), Telecom Italia (TIM), Portugal Telecom (MEU), Optimus (NOS), Belgacom (BICS), Deutsche Telekom, iBasis, Orbitel and Entel.
 
An important milestone in the evolution of Etelix was in 2013, when the company become part of a consortium of major carriers for the upgrade of the Maya-1 submarine cable systems that runs from Hollywood, Florida to the city of Tolu in Colombia. This consortium is led by Orange Telecom and Orbitel, where Etelix participates with 10 Gbps of capacity. The bulk of this contract was sold to Millicom (Tigo Costa Rica). This capacity considerably enhanced Tigo’s ability to deploy world-class 4G services to its customers in Costa Rica.

SwissLink Carrier AG is a Switzerland based international Telecommunications Carrier founded in 2015 providing international VoIP connectivity worldwide, with commercial presence in Europe, CIS and Latin America. SwissLink Carrier AG is a Swiss licensed Operator.
 
One of Company’s strategic line of actions is to expand the participation in Asian and African traffic. Africa is currently the market with the higher contribution to margin and Asia concentrate one third of the termination traffic in the industry. Estimations show that 56% (International Telecommunication Union) of the traffic terminating in Africa is originated from customers in Europe; while the corresponding percentage of traffic terminated in Asia is 37% (International Telecommunication Union). Based on these numbers the goal to expand the participation in the Asian and African traffic goes through establishing a strong presence in Europe.
 
The acquisition of Swisslink strengthened the Company’s presence in Europe putting us in a very competitive position to capture traffic to Asian and African countries; however, it will also give us the opportunity to compete in the European traffic, where we currently have a low participation.
 
QGlobal SMS LLC is a 100% owned subsidiary of iQSTEL Inc. QGlobal SMS is a USA based company founded in 2020 specialized in international and domestic SMS termination.
 
IoT Labs LLC is a 51% owned subsidiary of iQSTEL Inc. IoT Labs is a SMS service provider based in Austin, TX.
 
The Company has entered into the SMS business in 2020 through the acquisition of QGlobal and IoT Labs. Both companies specialize in international and domestic SMS termination, with emphasis on the Applications to Person (A2P), Person to Person (P2P) and OmniChannel Marketing Services for several markets: Wholesale Carrier, Government, Corporate, Enterprise, Small and Medium Companies.
 
QGlobal SMS has commercial presence in Europe, USA and Latin America, with robust international interconnection with Tier-1 SMS Aggregators, guarantying to its customers’ high quality and low termination rates, in over more than 100 countries, while IoT Labs is specialized in the SMS traffic exchange between US and Mexico.
 
With the acquisition of these two SMS providers, we quickly began to cross-sell services to our existing client base.

Regulations
 
Telecommunications services are subject to extensive government regulation in the United States of America. Any violations of the regulations may subject us to enforcement actions, including interest and penalties. The FCC has jurisdiction over all telecommunications common carriers to the extent they provide interstate or international communications services, including the use of local networks to originate or terminate such services
Regulation of Telecom by the Federal Communications Commission
 
Telecommunication License
 
Anyone seeking to conduct telecommunications business where the telecommunication services will transpire between the United States of America and an international destination must obtain a license from the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). This particular license is named a Section 214 license, after the section in the Communications Act of 1934.
 
Etelix.com USA, LLC was authorized by the Federal Communications Commission to provide facility-based services in accordance with section 63.18(e)(1) of the Commission’s rules; and also to provide resale services in accordance with section 63.18(e)(2) under license number ITC-214-20090625-00303.
 
Since Etelix has no other network infrastructure outside the United States of America, no other licenses are required for us to operate as an international carrier service provider.
 
Universal Service and Other Regulatory Fees and Charges
 
In 1997, the FCC issued an order, referred to as the Universal Service Order, which requires all telecommunications carriers providing interstate telecommunications services to contribute to universal service support programs administered by the FCC (known as the Universal Service Fund). These periodic contributions are currently assessed based on a percentage of each contributor’s interstate and international end user telecommunications revenues reported to the FCC. Etelix also contributed to several other regulatory funds and programs, most notably Telecommunications Relay Service and FCC Regulatory Fees (collectively, the Other Funds). Due to the manner in which these contributions are calculated, we cannot be assured that we fully recover from our customers all of our contributions.
 
In addition, based on the nature of our current business, we receive certain exemptions from federal Universal Service Fund contributions. Changes in our business could eliminate our ability to qualify for some or all of these exemptions. Changes in regulation may also have an impact on the availability of some or all of these exemptions. If even some of these exemptions become unavailable, they could materially increase our federal Universal Service Fund or Other Funds’ contributions and have a material adverse effect on the cost of our operations and, therefore, on our ability to continue to operate profitably, and to develop and grow our business. We cannot be certain of the stability of the contribution factors for the Other Funds. Significant increases in the contribution factor for the Other Funds in general and the Telecommunications Relay Service Fund in particular can impact our profitability. Whether these contribution factors will be stable in the future is unknown, but it is possible that we will be subject to significant increases.
