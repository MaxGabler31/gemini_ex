ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Our Company Overview

Auscrete Corporation was formed as an enterprise to take advantage of technologies developed for the construction of affordable, thermally efficient and structurally superior commercial structures and residential housing. This "GREEN" product is the culmination of design and development since the early 1980's and is the result of the amalgamation of various material developments, taking an idea to a product and further developing that product to address an ongoing problem in the world's largest consumer marketplace, the quest for affordable, efficient and enduring housing. Auscrete's structures are monetarily highly competitive. A turnkey house, ready to move in sells for around $100-$110 per square foot. That is very competitive in today's market but is brought about by Auscrete's ability to manufacture large building products in mass production format. Each house is constructed on site and this produces an attractive site-built home, a durable home that will combat all kinds of adverse weather and age conditions. It will not burn, is not affected by termites or rot, its thermal efficiency saves extensively on energy costs, has extreme longevity and has very low maintenance needs.

Founder's Development Activities to Date

Auscrete's CEO and founder, John Sprovieri, possessed certain proprietary technology in lighter-weight concrete manufacturing that has been acquired by the corporation. He has applied his engineering and marketing expertise to develop and promote products under the product name, Auscretehomes and Auscrete. These products are the culmination of the refinements made to a technology developed in Australia in the mid 1980's. The Australian product has been used in many parts of the world in construction, and Mr. Sprovieri has further developed it in the US by creating a highly thermally efficient building system. The process enables infusion of millions of tiny air bubbles and EPS insulation into a special inert concrete mix enabling the creation of an insulated and lightweight product without sacrificing strength or structural integrity.

Since commencing re-development of the basic technology almost thirteen years ago, Mr. Sprovieri has refined and modified the basic insulating formula that involves a number of purpose-built machines that have been fabricated for the manufacturing of Auscrete’s product.

The process includes machinery that can produce and infuse various sized aggregates, product specific hydraulically operated casting beds, concrete batching plant, materials handling equipment, specialized finishing machines and a "Hot Box" materials thermal testing station that gives thermal "R" ratings of materials to ASTM specifications. Additionally, many sample panels were produced for testing and for the construction of structures. At the outset and putting the Company’s technology to practical use, Auscrete Corporation has produced many and varied housing and commercial buildings.

Future Strategy

Auscrete Corporation intends to position itself as a major supplier in the affordable housing market. Housing is generally considered "affordable" when its cost does not exceed 30 percent of the median family income in a given area. In many parts of the country, housing costs have shown signs of adversely affecting workers, corporations and local economies. Yet still the availability of affordable housing is becoming increasingly scarce forcing large numbers of working families to live on the streets overwhelming Governmental services.

The company is offering a product that not only makes housing affordable, but also offers some luxuries as well, such as standard heat pump/air conditioning that would not be available in other houses at such comparable pricing. By constructing using the Auscrete Building System, those luxuries will result in lower cost utilities and a comfortable 'feel' to the living environment, as can be achieved with a product offering excellent thermal and soundproofing qualities as well as superb fire resistance.

Developers and contractors will offer the homes as complete, turnkey ready constructed site-built dwellings. Even though they are technologically advanced, they are just plain good value masonry homes built of a time proven product, concrete.

Auscrete can economically deliver whole house panel sets throughout the entire West Coast and as far away as Texas or Alberta, Canada servicing a fast-emerging market in this above average, affordable housing growth area.

The company plans on selling most of its output to developers, contractors and builders who will purchase the complete set of wall, roof and interior panels from Auscrete and use their own construction crews to construct and complete the houses.
