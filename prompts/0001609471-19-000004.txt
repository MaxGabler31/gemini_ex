General Development of Business
Overview
Carey Watermark Investors 2 Incorporated (“CWI 2”) is a publicly owned, non-traded real estate investment trust (“REIT”) that, together with its consolidated subsidiaries, invests in, manages and seeks to enhance the value of, interests in lodging and lodging-related properties in the United States. As a REIT, we are not subject to U.S. federal income taxation as long as we satisfy certain requirements, principally relating to the nature of our income, the level of our distributions to our stockholders and other factors. We conduct substantially all of our investment activities and own all of our assets through CWI 2 OP, LP, a Delaware limited partnership (the “Operating Partnership”). We are a general partner and a limited partner of, and own a 99.985% capital interest in, the Operating Partnership. Carey Watermark Holdings 2, LLC (“Carey Watermark Holdings 2”), which is owned indirectly by W. P. Carey Inc. (“WPC”), holds a special general partner interest of 0.015% in the Operating Partnership. In order to qualify as a REIT, we cannot operate hotels directly; therefore, we lease our hotels to our wholly-owned taxable REIT subsidiaries (“TRSs” and collectively the “TRS lessees”). At December 31, 2018, we held ownership interests in 12 hotels, with a total of 4,424 rooms.
We are managed by Carey Lodging Advisors, LLC (our “Advisor”), an indirect subsidiary of WPC, pursuant to an advisory agreement, dated February 9, 2015, as amended, among us, the Operating Partnership and our Advisor (the “Advisory Agreement”). Under the Advisory Agreement, our Advisor is responsible for managing our overall hotel portfolio, including providing oversight and strategic guidance to the independent hotel operators that manage our hotels. On February 9, 2015, CWA 2, LLC (the “Subadvisor”) entered into a subadvisory agreement with our Advisor (the “Subadvisory Agreement”). The Subadvisor provides services to our Advisor primarily relating to acquiring, managing, financing and disposing of our hotels and overseeing the independent hotel operators that manage the day-to-day operations of our hotels. In addition, the Subadvisor provides us with the services of Mr. Michael G. Medzigian, our Chief Executive Officer, subject to the approval of our independent directors.
WPC is a diversified REIT and leading owner of commercial real estate that is listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol “WPC.” In addition, WPC also manages the portfolios of certain non-traded investment programs. In June 2017, WPC exited non-traded retail fundraising activities and no longer sponsors new investment programs, although it has stated that it currently expects to continue managing its existing programs, which includes us and our affiliate, Carey Watermark Investors Incorporated (“CWI 1”), through the end of their respective life cycles.
Watermark Capital Partners, LLC is a private investment firm formed in May 2002 that focuses on assets that benefit from specialized marketing strategies and demographic shifts, including hotels and resorts, resort residential products, recreational projects (e.g., golf and club ownership programs), and new-urbanism and mixed-use projects. The principal of Watermark Capital Partners, Mr. Medzigian, has managed lodging properties valued in excess of $7.0 billion during his over 37 years of experience in the lodging and real estate industries, including as the chief executive officer of Lazard Freres Real Estate Investors, a real estate private equity management organization, and as a senior partner of Olympus Real Estate Corporation, the real estate fund management affiliate of Hicks, Muse, Tate and Furst Incorporated.
We raised offering proceeds in our initial public offering of $280.3 million from our Class A common stock and $571.0 million from our Class T common stock, for an aggregate of $851.3 million. The offering commenced in May 2014 and closed in July 2017. In addition, from inception through December 31, 2018, $20.7 million and $40.3 million of distributions were reinvested in our Class A and Class T common stock, respectively, through our distribution reinvestment plan (“DRIP”). We have fully invested the proceeds from our offering.
In April 2018, we announced that our Advisor had determined our estimated net asset values per share (“NAVs”) as of December 31, 2017 to be $11.11 for both our Class A and Class T shares of common stock. We currently intend to announce our NAVs as of December 31, 2018, as determined by our Advisor, by April 2019. 
We have no employees. At December 31, 2018, WPC had 206 employees who were available to perform services for us under the Advisory Agreement (Note 3) and Watermark Capital Partners employed 18 individuals who were available to perform services for us under the Subadvisory Agreement.

Narrative Description of Business
Business Objectives and Strategy 
We are a non-traded REIT that strives to create value in the lodging industry. Our primary investment objectives are to provide stockholders with current income in the form of quarterly distributions and to increase the value of our portfolio in order to generate long-term capital appreciation.
Our core strategy for achieving these objectives is to build and enhance the value of a portfolio of interests in lodging and lodging related investments. We employ value-added strategies, such as re-branding, renovating, expanding or changing hotel operators, when we believe such strategies will increase the operating results and values of the hotels we acquire. We regularly review the hotels in our portfolio to ensure that they continue to meet our investment criteria. If we were to conclude that a hotel’s value has been maximized, or that it no longer fits within our financial or strategic criteria, we may seek to sell the hotel and use the net proceeds for investments in our existing or new hotels, or to reduce our overall leverage. While we do not operate our hotel properties, both our asset management team and our executive management team monitor and work cooperatively with our hotel operators in all aspects of our hotels' operations, including advising and making recommendations regarding property positioning and repositioning, revenue and expense management, operations analysis, physical design, renovation and capital improvements, guest experience and overall strategic direction. We believe that we can add significant value to our portfolio through our intensive asset management strategies. Our executive and asset management teams have significant experience in hotels, as well as in creating and implementing innovative asset management initiatives.
We will adjust our investment focus from time to time based upon market conditions and our Advisor's views on relative value as market conditions change. Material changes in our investment focus will be described in our periodic reports filed with the SEC; however, these reports would typically be filed after changes in our investment focus have been made, which in some cases may be several months after such changes. 
As a REIT, we are allowed to own lodging properties, but are prohibited from operating these properties. In order to comply with applicable REIT qualification rules, we enter into leases with certain of our subsidiaries organized as TRSs. The TRS lessees in turn contract with independent property operators that manage the day-to-day operations of our properties.
The lodging properties we have acquired include full-service branded hotels located in urban settings, resort properties and select-service hotels. Full-service hotels generally provide a full complement of guest amenities, including food and beverage services, meeting and conference facilities, concierge and room service and valet parking, among others. Select-service hotels typically have limited food and beverage outlets and do not offer comprehensive business or banquet facilities. Resort properties may include smaller boutique hotels and large-scale integrated resorts. All of our investments to date have been in the United States, however, we may consider, and are not prohibited under our organizational documents from making, investments outside the United States.
Our Portfolio
At December 31, 2018, our portfolio was comprised of our full or partial ownership in 12 hotels with 4,424 guest rooms, all located in the United States. See Item 2. Properties.
Holding Period
We generally intend to hold our investments in real property for an extended period depending on the type of investment. The determination of whether a particular asset should be sold or otherwise disposed of will be made after consideration of relevant factors, including prevailing economic conditions, with a view to achieving maximum capital appreciation for our stockholders while avoiding increases in risk. No assurance can be given that this objective will be realized.
Financing Strategies
At December 31, 2018, our hotel portfolio, including both the hotels that we consolidate in our financial statements (“Consolidated Hotels”) (as further discussed in Note 4) and the hotels that we record as equity investments in our financial statements (“Unconsolidated Hotels”) (as further discussed in Note 5), was 58% leveraged. Our organizational documents permit us to incur leverage of up to 75% of the total costs of our investments or 300% of our net assets (whichever is less), or a higher amount with the approval of a majority of our independent directors.

Transactions With Affiliates
We may borrow funds or purchase properties from, or enter into joint ventures with, our Advisor, the Subadvisor, or their or our respective affiliates, if we believe that doing so is consistent with our investment objectives and we comply with our investment policies and procedures. A majority of our directors (including the independent directors) must approve any significant investment in which we invest jointly with an entity sponsored and/or managed by our Advisor, the Subadvisor or their or our respective affiliates (Note 3).
Competition
The hotel industry is highly competitive. Hotels we acquire compete with other hotels for guests in our markets. Competitive factors include location, convenience, brand affiliation, room rates, range and the quality of services, facilities and guest amenities or accommodations offered. Competition in the markets in which our hotels operate include competition from existing, newly renovated and newly developed hotels in the relevant segments. Competition can adversely affect the occupancy, average daily rates (“ADR”), and revenue per available room (“RevPAR”) of our hotels, and thus our financial results, and may require us to provide additional amenities, incur additional costs or make capital improvements that we otherwise might not choose to make, which may adversely affect our profitability.
Seasonality
Certain lodging properties are seasonal in nature. Generally, occupancy rates and revenues are greater in the second and third quarters than in the first and fourth quarters. As a result of the seasonality of certain lodging properties, there may be quarterly fluctuations in results of operations of our properties. Quarterly financial results may be adversely affected by factors outside our control, including weather conditions and poor economic factors. As a result, we may need to enter into short-term borrowings in certain periods in order to offset these fluctuations in revenues, to fund operations or to make distributions to our stockholders.
Certain Environmental and Regulatory Matters
Our hotel properties are subject to various federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations. In connection with our current or prior ownership or operation of hotels, we may potentially be liable for various environmental costs or liabilities (including investigation, clean-up and disposal of hazardous materials released at, on, under, in or from the property). Environmental laws and regulations typically impose responsibility without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of or was responsible for the presence of hazardous materials or contamination, and liability is often joint and several. As part of our efforts to mitigate these risks, we typically engage third parties to perform assessments of potential environmental risks when evaluating new acquisitions or if required to do so by a lender. Such environmental surveys are limited in scope, however, and we remain exposed to contaminates (e.g., such as asbestos and mold) and hazardous or regulated substances used during the routine operations of our hotels (e.g., swimming pool or dry cleaning chemicals). Our hotel properties incur costs to comply with environmental and health and safety laws and regulations and could be subject to fines and penalties for non-compliance. 
We have not received written notice from any governmental authority of any material noncompliance, liability or claim relating to hazardous or toxic substances or other environmental matters in connection with any of our properties. And although we are not currently aware of any material environmental or health and safety claims pending or threatened against us, a claim may be asserted against us in the future that could have a material adverse effect on us. 
Our properties must comply with Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (the “ADA”) to the extent that such properties are “public accommodations” as defined by the ADA. We believe that our properties are substantially in compliance with the ADA, however, the obligation to make readily achievable accommodations is an ongoing one and we will continue to assess our properties and make alterations as appropriate.
