     ITEM 1.BUSINESS
     Our Company
     Interlink Electronics, Inc. (“we”, “us”, “our”, “Interlink” or the “Company”) designs, develops, manufactures and sells a range of force-sensing technologies that incorporate our proprietary materials technology, firmware and software into a portfolio of standard products and custom solutions.  These include sensor components, subassemblies, modules and products that support effective, efficient cursor control and novel three-dimensional user inputs.  Our Human Machine Interface (“HMI”) technology platforms are deployed in a wide range of markets including consumer electronics, automotive, industrial, and medical.  The application of our HMI technology platforms includes vehicle entry, vehicle multi-media control interface, rugged touch controls, presence detection, collision detection, speed and torque controls, biological monitoring and others. 
     Interlink has been a leader in the printed electronics industry for over 30 years with the commercialization of our patented Force-Sensing Resistor (“FSR®”) technology that has enabled rugged and reliable HMI solutions.  Our solutions have focused on handheld user input, menu navigation, cursor control, and other intuitive interface technologies for the world’s top electronics manufacturers.
     We invented FSR® technology and pioneered commercialization of printed electronics manufacturing, paving the way for industry-wide adoption of force sensing technology.  Our extensive knowledge and experience with this technology, along with the firmware we incorporate in our HMI solutions, differentiates us from other providers of HMI solutions.  We, along with our customers, incorporate our FSR and force sensing sensors and modules into end user products.  Our sensors and modules are used in electronics devices and systems where user input must be converted into electronics and software data.  Our force sensing technology solution platforms enabled industry-first implementations in gaming, smartphone, rugged notebook, automotive cockpit and automotive entry applications.  Consumer and end-user demand for enhanced user experience is driving the need for innovative multi-modal HMI technologies and applications.  Force sensing input provides a critical novel modality that drives a paradigm shift in HMI. 
     Market requirements for innovative solutions that enable smaller, thinner devices, lower power consumption, highly refined designs, better navigation and more intuitive usability in all environments, are also driving increased demand for our products.  Consumers expect to use multi-modal HMI in the home, industrial and medical environments, automotive spaces (both inside and outside the vehicle), and in all technology interactions where they formerly used switches and knobs.  Interlink delivers cutting edge, high performance solutions for all of these environments.
     Significant market opportunities are rapidly emerging for us to improve upon the functionality of standard capacitive sensors which are widely available and competitively priced.  Inadvertent activation, where users unintentionally activate a control, is a common problem with capacitive technology.  In contrast, force sensing solutions require a deliberate application of force to operate.  We have had recent success in using our force sensing solutions in combination with capacitive technologies to minimize the latter’s performance issues, enabling force sensing solutions to complement competitive technologies and provide us with new opportunities for growth.  We continue to simultaneously expand our standard product portfolio and develop new technology platforms to grow existing markets and capture emerging markets.
     Interlink serves our world-wide customer base from our corporate headquarters in Westlake Village, California (greater Los Angeles area), our global research and development (“R&D”) and engineering center in Singapore, our printed-electronics manufacturing facility in Shenzhen, China and our global distribution and logistics center in Hong Kong.  We also maintain engineering, assembly and prototyping capabilities in Simi Valley, California along with technical and sales offices in Japan and at multiple locations in the United States.  We sell our products in a wide range of markets, including consumer electronics, automotive, industrial and medical, to some of the world’s largest companies and most recognizable brands.

     Our Industry
     HMI technologies have been available since the early 1970’s, but were used almost exclusively in industrial products during the first 20 years of their existence.  The introduction of touchpad mouse devices for laptop computers in the early 1990’s represented the first significant transition of HMI technologies into the consumer electronics market.  Personal devices utilizing touch sensitive technology became ubiquitous in our daily human-machine interactions with the introduction in 2007 of smart phone technology incorporating capacitive screens.  As the smart phone became an integral part of consumers’ daily lives throughout the world, it influenced consumers’ expectations of how we should interact with all types of devices.  Whether those devices are personal electronics, industrial and medical equipment, or automobiles, purchasers of equipment expect sleek, highly-functioning design including touch-sensing technology.  Consumers no longer want to push buttons or flip switches; rather, they expect smooth touch pads and gesture-driven input.  Engineers are responding to this demand by incorporating touch sensitive technology into a wide range of products, and any device that can utilize force and position sensing inputs to control or enhance its functionality is a candidate for use of the technology.
     The products and solutions that we design, develop and manufacture for HMI applications are primarily printed electronic products.  Printed electronics is a set of printing methods used to create electrical devices on various substrates.  For over 30 years we have honed and developed the processes necessary to manufacture high quality printed electronic products for HMI applications.   Printed electronic technologies are emerging as potential low-cost replacements to silicon based electronics in many specific application areas.  According to industry analyst group IDTechEx, the projected market for printed sensor components will surpass $2 billion by 2021, and the market share for printed force sensors alone will be approximately 20% by 2020.  According to the IDTechEx report Printed, Organic & Flexible Electronics Forecasts, Players & Opportunities 2017-2027, the total market for printed, flexible and organic electronics will grow from $29.28 billion in 2017 to $73.43 billion in 2027. The majority of that is OLEDs (organic but not printed) and conductive ink used for a wide range of applications, however, stretchable electronics, logic and memory, thin film sensors have huge growth potential.

      Our product development teams are skilled in concept definition, rapid prototyping, hardware and firmware development and integration support.  Interlink benefits from its own world-class manufacturing facility in Shenzhen, China, allowing us to react quickly to customer needs, while ensuring the highest quality standards.  We also maintain a technical sales force that can address new and existing customer opportunities worldwide.
     Our Technology Platforms and Products
     Interlink was founded on the invention and commercialization of FSR®, the industry’s first force sensing solution using printed electronics manufacturing.  As we transition from an FSR® sensor supplier to an HMI solutions provider, we pursue and embrace leading edge force sensing technology platforms.  Our chief technology officer and global research and development center, both located in Singapore, along with our US-based R&D team, are focused on strategic technology roadmaps, development of scalable technology platform architectures and pursuit of synergistic technology partnerships.  In an ever changing and competitive landscape, Interlink is committed to staying ahead of the technology curve.
     The two primary types of user-input technologies common in today’s devices are capacitive and resistive.  Capacitive sensors are used in the touch screens found in most smart phones and similar devices used globally by millions of consumers.  The most significant drawback to the capacitive technology is its inability to measure force, although there has been some progress recently in enhancing the technology with pseudo force sensing.  Capacitive sensors have become a high-volume, low-margin commodity product. 
     Our patented FSR® technology consists of a bottom layer of conductor traces, a proprietary resistive ink top layer and a spacer that separates the two layers.  An additional top layer that contains graphics and protects the sensor can also be added.  FSR® sensors can be as thin as eight thousandths of an inch, making them particularly well suited for use where space is a critical issue, as in portable electronics.  Our force sensing technology enables the sensor to be used for continuously variable control functions.  For example, in a pointing device, increased pressure can be used to produce faster cursor movement.  Unlike capacitive devices, an FSR® sensor’s performance is not impeded by the presence of moisture, dirt or dust, making the sensor suitable for use outdoors and in moist and other “hostile” environments.  Our

FSR® sensors have no moving parts, can be packaged in a sealed environment, and consume substantially lower power and are less susceptible to false readings or unintended touches than capacitive sensors.  We have developed sophisticated firmware that allows our FSR technology to become a complete solution delivering effective HMI functionality to our customers.
     Custom Solutions
     Interlink offers a comprehensive portfolio of standard solutions, from simple force sensors to multi-finger capable rugged trackpads.  The largest part of our business, however, is the development and manufacture of custom solutions for our major customers.  We offer full integration capability spanning initial concept to large volume manufacturing.  Custom solutions can be a single or multi-technology platform to meet customer requirements, and include both input and output technologies.  We also offer full firmware development and integration support.     Standard Solutions
     Our portfolio of standard solutions includes:
    
· | Our FSR® technology is the most versatile force sensing technology on the market today. These innovative sensors provide an inverse change in resistance in response to an increase or decrease in applied force. Our standard range of sensors provides engineers and designers with a durable, reliable, easy to measure, thin-form factor and low-cost solution for HMI touch solutions and analog data capture for machines. FSR® sensors are available in a range of sizes, shapes and lengths and with several connection options. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Force sensing linear potentiometers (“FSLP”) are sensors which can be used for menu navigation and control. Our use of force allows for high-rate scrolling and a more intuitive user experience. The FSLP is an easy to integrate, high resolution, ultra-low power based solution that brings intuitive user controls to reduced form factor hand-held consumer electronic devices. These sensors are available in multiple lengths. We also offer a ring sensor for full 360-degree position sensing. These sensors are designed to be integrated into a device’s host processor without the need for a dedicated microprocessor. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Our integrated mouse modules and pointing solutions can add touchpad or 360-degree pointing control to virtually any electronic device. Ranging from simple mouse button integration to National Electrical Manufacturer Association (“NEMA”) rated industrial pointing devices, these solutions are ideal for applications away from the desktop. The modules use FSR® technology and measurement firmware in a four-zone sensor or 4-wire resistive touchpad configuration along with a micro-controller to provide pressure sensitive cursor direction and speed control in a durable and easy to integrate form factor.

      Intellectual Property
     We believe that intellectual property protection is crucial to our business.  We rely on a combination of patents, copyrights, trade secrets, trademarks, nondisclosure agreements with employees and third parties, licensing and other contractual agreements with third parties to protect our intellectual property.  We maintain and support an active program to protect our intellectual property primarily through the filing of patent applications and the defense of issued patents against infringement.  We are not currently engaged in any patent infringement suits.  Part of our strategy involves ring-fencing our intellectual property.  Ring-fencing involves patenting not only the core technology, but also every improvement or piece of technology around the core technology.  This strategy is designed to make it more difficult for competitors to design around the invention, while ensuring some areas of competitive advantage remain in the event a competitor successfully attacks the core patent.  
     Our failure to obtain or maintain adequate protection for our intellectual property rights for any reason could hurt our competitive position.  There is no guarantee that patents will be issued from the patent applications that we have filed or

may file.  Our issued patents may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, and claims of our patents may not be of sufficient scope or strength, or issued in the proper geographic regions, to provide meaningful protection or any commercial advantage.  See “Risk Factors” under Item 1A of this Form 10-K for further discussion of the risks associated with patents and intellectual property.
     Our FSR® sensors are manufactured using proprietary screen-printing techniques.  All proprietary aspects of the manufacturing process are currently conducted in-house at our US and China manufacturing facilities to maintain quality and protect our force sensing technology from infringement.  While screen-printing is a common process in various industries, the quality and precision of printing, as well as the specific processes required to make high-quality FSR® sensors, require considerable expertise.  We believe this expertise is difficult to replicate over the short term and, to our knowledge, no unrelated party has done so.  As a result, we consider this expertise to be one of our more important trade secrets.  We require our employees to sign nondisclosure agreements and seek to limit access to sensitive information to the greatest practical extent.
     As of December 31, 2017, we held sixteen patents, and had eight patents-pending.  We group our patents into three general categories: sensors, which includes four patents expiring between 2022 and 2027; sensing systems, which includes five patents expiring between 2026 and 2033, respectively; and human interface devices, which includes seven patents expiring between 2023 and 2026.  Our intellectual property strategy involves filing additional patent applications in our strategic focus markets on a regular basis.
 Competition
     The markets for our products are highly competitive and subject to rapid advancement in design technology.  We must identify and capture future market opportunities by developing and deploying value-added products.
     We compete for market share based on our customers’ selection of our components over our competitors during the design phase of their products.  Our ability to compete is dependent on the needs of our customers, how well our products address those needs, our corporate relationships, and a variety of other factors.
     We offer a disruptive technology that is replacing outdated and undesirable approaches including switch technology.  We often must convince companies to abandon older, proven but less elegant technologies and adopt our solutions.  This change is supported by significant end-user demand for touch-sensitive solutions.  We also compete against the highly commoditized capacitive resistor technology.  However, our solutions are focused on providing functionality in situations where capacitive is unreliable or entirely unavailable.
     The markets for our products are characterized by significant price competition and we anticipate that our products will continue to face substantial pricing pressure.
     Sales and Marketing
     We sell our HMI solutions and force sensing devices through our direct sales employees as well as outside sales representatives and distributors.  We work directly with large multi-national companies, small start-up companies, technology design houses and original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”).  Our sales personnel have extensive engineering backgrounds and receive substantial support from our internal engineering resources.  Sales frequently result from interactions between senior management, design engineers, procurement departments, and our sales personnel.  We interact with our customers throughout the product development and order process.  We maintain sales offices in the United States, Hong Kong and Japan. We primarily utilize Digi-Key Electronics, based in Thief River Falls, MN, as a global, full-service distributor of our standard products.
     Due to the technical nature of our products, the length of our sales cycle can vary from a few months to several years and requires continued participation from our sales, engineering and management teams.  Our sales cycle for our custom solutions generally includes the following two phases:

--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      Mass Production
     Once the customer has chosen our solution, they may move their product into the production phase.  It may take several months or more to go from design win to production. Product lifespan varies dramatically depending on the market place and product.  Consumer electronics may have a lifespan of six months to five years; industrial and automotive applications may continue for three to ten years, and medical product lifespans may continue past 20 years.

We supply some of the world’s largest consumer electronics manufacturers, luxury and mid-market car companies, familiar names in the medical and industrial equipment markets, research engineers and designers entering the Internet-Of-Things (“IoT”) market, and companies of all different sizes in other markets.
     Our customer base is widely dispersed geographically.  Sales to customers located outside the United States have historically accounted for a significant percentage of our revenues, a trend we expect to continue.  On a bill-to basis, international sales constituted 51.8% and 42.5% of our net revenues for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.  
     Future sales of our products will be based on, among other elements, expansion into adjacent markets, continued expansion of our product line, the acceptance of our product line, expansion into additional domestic and international markets, and our ability to maintain a competitive position against other technology providers.
     For the year ended December 31, 2017, we had three customers that represented 17.1%, 14.7% and 13.8% of net revenues, respectively.  For the year ended December 31, 2016, we had three customers that represented 22.4%, 11.7% and 11.3% of net revenues, respectively.
     Manufacturing Operations
     We have our own modern manufacturing facility in Shenzhen, China that is ISO 9001 and ISO 14001 certified, and all products are RoHS and REACH compliant. As part of our continuous improvement methodology the facility is currently undertaking TS16949 certification. We also maintain an engineering, assembly and prototyping facility in Simi Valley, California.

     We purchase our materials from outside suppliers.  We carefully select suppliers based on their ability to provide quality parts and components that meet technical specifications.  We actively monitor these suppliers, but we are subject to substantial risks associated with the performance of our suppliers.  We source certain of our components from a single supplier, which increases the risk of shortages and shipment delays and decreases our ability to negotiate with that supplier.
     Engineering, Research and Development
     Rapid advancements in process technologies and increasing levels of functional integration characterize the market for our products.  We believe that our future success will depend largely on our ability to continue improving our products and our process technologies, and to develop new technologies.
     Our Chief Technology Officer and global R&D center are located in Singapore, where we focus on product innovation.  In April, 2017 we announced our intention to grow this facility substantially over the next three years, including expanding our R&D engineering team, expanding the size of the facility, and investing in additional tools and equipment.  This includes a commitment to add 10 scientists and engineers to our existing team in Singapore and invest $3.5 million to establish a state-of-the art facility. The global R&D team will pursue scientific research, technology platform development and advanced product development in areas of material science, printed electronics devices and manufacturing processes and multi-disciplinary system engineering.  The global R&D center will support strategic partnerships with key players in electronics manufacturing services, digital manufacturing including 3D printing and product development. 
     We also operate engineering centers in the United States and China, primarily focused on customer support, quality control and product integration.
     Our Employees
     As of December 31, 2017, we had 97 employees worldwide.  Our employees, listed in population size order from largest to smallest, are in the following departments: operations, R&D, administration, and sales.  Our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel is essential to our continued success.  None of our employees are represented by a collective bargaining agreement, and we have never experienced a work stoppage.  We believe our employee relations are good.
