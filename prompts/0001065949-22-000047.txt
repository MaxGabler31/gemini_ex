ITEM 1. BUSINESS.
GENERAL



The following is a summary of some of the information contained in this document. Unless the context requires otherwise, references in this document to “our Company,” “us,” “we,” “our,” “Atlas,” or the “Company” are to Atlas Technology Group, Inc.
DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS 



Atlas Technology Group, Inc., a Florida corporation, (“Atlas”, “the Company”, “We", "Us" or “Our’) is a SEC reporting shell company. Shares of our common stock can only be traded in the expert market as of the date of this report. We believe this is due to there being no broker dealers willing to quote our stock. We intend to seek approval for our shares of common stock to be traded on the Pink Sheets again. Once relisted on the Pink Sheets, we will then seek to merge with an entity with experienced management and opportunities for growth in return for shares of our common stock to create values for our shareholders. There is no guarantee that we will be successful in becoming relisted on the Pink Sheets and no potential merger candidate has been identified at this time.



Our principal executive offices are located at PO Box 147165, Lakewood, Colorado, 80214 and the telephone number is (303) 323-4896.

IMPACT OF COVID-19



We have only limited operations at this time and consequently have not been directly impacted by the COVID-19 outbreak at this time. However, the detrimental effect of the COVID-19 outbreak on the economy as a whole may have a detrimental impact on our ability to raise funding and commence operations for the foreseeable future.
Reports to Security Holders



We are subject to the reporting requirements of Section 12(g) of the Exchange Act, and as such, we intend to file all required disclosures.



We provide an annual report that includes audited financial information to our shareholders. We will make our financial information equally available to any interested parties or investors through compliance with the disclosure rules for a small business issuer under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. We are subject to disclosure filing requirements including filing Form 10-K annually and Form 10-Q quarterly. In addition, we will file Form 8-K and other proxy and information statements from time to time as required. We do not intend to voluntarily file the above reports in the event that our obligation to file such reports is suspended under the Exchange Act. The public may read and copy any materials that we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, (“SEC”), at the SEC’s Public Reference Room at 100 F Street NE, Washington, DC 20549. The public may obtain information on the operation of the Public Reference Room by calling the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330. The SEC maintains an Internet site (http://www.sec.gov) that contains reports, proxy and information statements, and other information regarding issuers that file electronically with the SEC.
Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act



We qualify as an “emerging growth company” as defined in Section 101 of the Jumpstart our Business Startups Act (“JOBS Act”) as we did not have more than $1.07 billion in annual gross revenues and did not have such amount as of December 31, 2021, our last fiscal year.



We may lose our status as an emerging growth company on the last day of our fiscal year during which (i) our annual gross revenue exceeds $1.07 billion or (ii) we issue more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt in a three-year period. We will lose our status as an emerging growth company if at any time we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer. We will lose our status as an emerging growth company on the last day of our fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the date of the first sale of common equity securities pursuant to an effective registration statement.



As an emerging growth company, we may take advantage of specified reduced reporting and other burdens that are otherwise applicable to generally reporting companies. These provisions include:




- | A requirement to have only two years of audited financial statement and only two years of related Management Discussion and Analysis Disclosures:
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


- | Reduced disclosure about the emerging growth company’s executive compensation arrangements; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


- | No non-binding advisory votes on executive compensation or golden parachute arrangements.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




As an emerging growth company, we are exempt from Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and Section 14A(a) and (b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Such sections are provided below:



Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requires a public company’s auditor to attest to, and report on, management’s assessment of its internal controls.



Sections 14A(a) and (b) of the Securities and Exchange Act, implemented by Section 951 of the Dodd-Frank Act, require companies to hold shareholder advisory votes on executive compensation and golden parachute compensation.

-



We have already taken advantage of these reduced reporting burdens in this Form 10-K, which are also available to us as a smaller reporting company as defined under Rule 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”).



As long as we qualify as an emerging growth company, we will not be required to comply with the requirements of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and Section 14A(a) and (b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.



In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”) for complying with new or revised accounting standards. We are choosing to irrevocably opt in to the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards under Section 102(b)(2) of the JOBS Act. 



CURRENT BUSINESS



Atlas Technology Group, Inc., a Florida corporation, (“Atlas,” “the Company,” “We," "Us," or “Our’) is a SEC reporting shell company. Shares of our common stock can only be traded in the expert market as of the date of this report. We believe this is due to there being no broker dealers willing to quote our stock. We intend to seek approval for our shares of common stock to be traded on the Pink Sheets again. Once relisted on the Pink Sheets, we will then seek to merge with an entity with experienced management and opportunities for growth in return for shares of our common stock to create values for our shareholders. There is no guarantee that we will be successful in becoming relisted on the Pink Sheets and no potential merger candidate has been identified at this time.



Effective May 29, 2021, we entered into an agreement with Corporate Excellence Consulting Inc. (“CECI”), our then controlling shareholder, and Mr. David Cutler (“Mr. Cutler”) (“the Agreement”) under which:




- | CECI surrendered, and we cancelled, the single outstanding share of Series A Preferred Stock. The single outstanding share of Series A Preferred Stock carried super preferred voting rights enabling the holder to vote the equivalent of 61% of all voteable preferred and common shares issued and outstanding,
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- | We issued a new share of Series A Preferred Stock, carrying the same super preferred voting rights described above, to Mr. Cutler. As a consequence of this issuance, Mr. Cutler became our new controlling shareholder, 
- | Mr. Cutler was appointed as a director of ours and as our Chief Financial Officer, 
- | Mr. Cutler paid $5,000 to CECI on our behalf as a partial repayment of the outstanding fees due by us to CECI, 
- | Mr. Cutler undertook to pay a further $30,000 on our behalf as a full and final settlement of the outstanding fees due by us to CECI, such payment to be made on the approval by FINRA of a proposed name change and reverse stock split, and 
- | CECI agreed to accept the $35,000 to be paid to them by Mr. Cutler on our behalf in full and final settlement of the outstanding fees due by us to CECI. 




The initial payment of $5,000 to CECI was made by Mr. Cutler as agreed.



There is no guarantee that it will be possible to complete the remaining terms of the Agreement.

Since its Inception in August 1996, the Company has at various times been involved in the following business activities: software sales, provision of information technology application support services, distribution of energy efficient lighting products and movie production and talent management. All of these business activities have been ultimately unsuccessful.



By December 31, 2018, the Company had ceased all operations and had disposed of all its former operating subsidiaries.



General Business Plan



Our business plan to seek to have shares of our common stock relisted on the Pink Sheets and then to complete a merger has many uncertainties which pose risks to investors.



There is no guarantee that we will be successful in becoming relisted on the Pink Sheets.



We intend to seek, investigate and, if such investigation warrants, acquire an interest in business opportunities presented to us by persons or firms which desire to seek the advantages of an issuer who has complied with the Securities Act of 1934 (the “1934 Act”). We will not restrict our search to any specific business, industry or geographical location, and we may participate in business ventures of virtually any nature. This discussion of our proposed business is purposefully general and is not meant to be restrictive of our unlimited discretion to search for and enter into potential business opportunities. We anticipate that we may be able to participate in only one potential business venture because of our lack of financial resources. We may seek a business opportunity with entities which have recently commenced operations, or that desire to utilize the public marketplace in order to raise additional capital in order to expand into new products or markets, to develop a new product or service, or for other corporate purposes. All of these activities have risk to investors including dilution and management.



We expect that the selection of a business opportunity will be complex. Due to general economic conditions, rapid technological advances being made in some industries and shortages of available capital, we believe that there are numerous firms seeking the benefits of an issuer who has complied with the 1934 Act. Such benefits may include facilitating or improving the terms on which additional equity financing may be sought, providing liquidity for incentive stock options or similar benefits to key employees, providing liquidity (subject to restrictions of applicable statutes) for all stockholders and other factors. Potentially, available business opportunities may occur in many different industries and at various stages of development, all of which will make the task of comparative investigation and analysis of such business opportunities extremely difficult and complex. We have, and will continue to have, essentially no assets to provide the owners of business opportunities. However, we will be able to offer owners of acquisition candidates the opportunity to acquire a controlling ownership interest in an issuer who has complied with the 1934 Act without incurring the cost and time required to conduct an initial public offering.



The analysis of new business opportunities will be undertaken by, or under the supervision of, our Board of Directors. We intend to concentrate on identifying preliminary prospective business opportunities which may be brought to our attention through present associations of our director, professional advisors or by our stockholders. In analyzing prospective business opportunities, we will consider such matters as (i) available technical, financial and managerial resources; (ii) working capital and other financial requirements; (iii) history of operations, if any, and prospects for the future; (iv) nature of present and expected competition; (v) quality, experience and depth of management services; (vi) potential for further research, development or exploration; (vii) specific risk factors not now foreseeable but that may be anticipated to impact the proposed activities of the company; (viii) potential for growth or expansion; (ix) potential for profit; (x) public recognition and acceptance of products, services or trades; (xi) name identification; and (xii) other factors that we consider relevant. As part of our investigation of the business opportunity, we expect to meet personally with management and key personnel. To the extent possible, we intend to utilize written reports and personal investigation to evaluate the above factors.



We will not acquire or merge with any company for which audited financial statements cannot be obtained within a reasonable period of time after closing of the proposed transaction.

Acquisition Interest



In implementing a structure for a particular business acquisition, we may become a party to a merger, consolidation, reorganization, joint venture, or licensing agreement with another company or entity. We may also acquire stock or assets of an existing business. Upon consummation of a transaction, it is probable that our present management and stockholders will no longer be in control of us. In addition, our sole director may, as part of the terms of the acquisition transaction, resign and be replaced by new directors without a vote of our stockholders, or sell his stock in us. Any such sale will only be made in compliance with the securities laws of the United States and any applicable state.



 It is anticipated that any securities issued in any such reorganization would be issued in reliance upon exemption from registration under application federal and state securities laws. In some circumstances, as a negotiated element of the transaction, we may agree to register all or a part of such securities immediately after the transaction is consummated or at specified times thereafter. If such registration occurs, it will be undertaken by the surviving entity after it has successfully consummated a merger or acquisition and is no longer considered an inactive company.



The issuance of substantial additional securities and their potential sale into any trading market which may develop in our securities may have a depressive effect on the value of our securities in the future. There is no assurance that such a trading market will develop.



While the actual terms of a transaction cannot be predicted, it is expected that the parties to any business transaction will find it desirable to avoid the creation of a taxable event and thereby structure the business transaction in a so-called “tax-free” reorganization under Sections 368(a)(1) or 351 of the Internal Revenue Code (the “Code”). In order to obtain tax-free treatment under the Code, it may be necessary for the owner of the acquired business to own 80% or more of the voting stock of the surviving entity. In such event, our stockholders would retain less than 20% of the issued and outstanding shares of the surviving entity. This would result in significant dilution in the equity of our stockholders.



As part of our investigation, we expect to meet personally with management and key personnel, visit and inspect material facilities, obtain independent analysis of verification of certain information provided, check references of management and key personnel, and take other reasonable investigative measures, to the extent of our limited financial resources and management expertise. The manner in which we participate in an opportunity will depend on the nature of the opportunity, the respective needs and desires of both parties, and the management of the opportunity.



With respect to any merger or acquisition, and depending upon, among other things, the target company’s assets and liabilities, our stockholders will in all likelihood hold a substantially lesser percentage ownership interest in us following any merger or acquisition. The percentage ownership may be subject to significant reduction in the event we acquire a target company with assets and expectations of growth. Any merger or acquisition can be expected to have a significant dilutive effect on the percentage of shares held by our stockholders.



We will participate in a business opportunity only after the negotiation and execution of appropriate written business agreements. Although the terms of such agreements cannot be predicted, generally we anticipate that such agreements will (i) require specific representations and warranties by all of the parties; (ii) specify certain events of default; (iii) detail the terms of closing and the conditions which must be satisfied by each of the parties prior to and after such closing; (iv) outline the manner of bearing costs, including costs associated with the Company’s attorneys and accountants; (v) set forth remedies on defaults; and (vi) include miscellaneous other terms.



As stated above, we will not acquire or merge with any entity which cannot provide independent audited financial statements within a reasonable period of time after closing of the proposed transaction. If such audited financial statements are not available at closing, or within time parameters necessary to ensure our compliance within the requirements of the 1934 Act, or if the audited financial statements provided do not conform to the representations made by that business to be acquired, the definitive closing documents will provide that the proposed transaction



8
-



will be voidable, at the discretion of our present management. If such transaction is voided, the definitive closing documents will also contain a provision providing for reimbursement for our costs associated with the proposed transaction.



Competition



We believe we are an insignificant participant among the firms which engage in the acquisition of business opportunities. There are many established venture capital and financial concerns that have significantly greater financial and personnel resources and technical expertise than we have. In view of our limited financial resources and limited management availability, we will continue to be at a significant competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors.
Investment Company Act 1940



Although we will be subject to regulation under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the 1934 Act, we believe we will not be subject to regulation under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the “1940 Act”) insofar as we will not be engaged in the business of investing or trading in securities. In the event we engage in business combinations that result in us holding passive investment interests in a number of entities, we could be subject to regulation under the 1940 Act. In such event, we would be required to register as an investment company and incur significant registration and compliance costs. We have obtained no formal determination from the SEC as to our status under the 1940 Act and, consequently, any violation of the 1940 Act would subject us to material adverse consequences. We believe that, currently, we are exempt under Regulation 3a-2 of the 1940 Act.
Intellectual Property



We have not and do not own any intellectual property.



Employees



We presently have no full time executive, operational or clerical staff.



Throughout the past few years through May 28, 2021, Ms. Cortney Morris provided her services to us on a part time basis as director, Chief Executive Officer, President, Secretary and Chief Financial Officer. She resigned in 2021.



From May 29, 2021, Mr. David Cutler, our new controlling shareholder, was appointed as a director of ours and as our Chief Financial Officer to provide his services to us on a part time basis.



Revenue



We did not record any revenue during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, or from January 1, 2022 through the date of this filing. 



Factors Effecting Future Performance



Our goal is to obtain debt and, or, equity finance to meet our ongoing operating expenses and attempt have our shares of common stock relisted on the Pink Sheets and then to merge with another entity with experienced management and opportunities for growth in return for shares of our common stock to create value for our shareholders.



Although there is no assurance that this series of events will be successfully completed, we believe we can successfully relist our shares of common stock on the Pink Sheets and complete an acquisition or merger which will enable us to continue as a going concern.



Any acquisition or merger will most likely be dilutive to our existing stockholders.



The factors affecting our future performance are listed and explained below under the section “Risk Factors” below:
