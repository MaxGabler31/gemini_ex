Item 1.    Business
Overview
GSI provides in-place associative computing solutions for applications in high growth markets such as artificial intelligence (AI) and high-performance computing (HPC), including natural language processing and computer vision. Our initial associative processing unit (“APU”) products are focused on applications using similarity search. Similarity search is used in visual search queries for ecommerce, computer vision, drug discovery, cyber security and service markets such as NoSQL, Elasticsearch, and OpenSearch. Our extensive historical experience in developing high speed synchronous static random access memory, or SRAM, facilitated our ability to transform the focus of our business to the development of reliable hardware AI products and solutions like the APU.
Even as we expand our offering of in-place associative computing solutions, we continue to be committed to the synchronous SRAM market, by making available exceedingly high density performance memory products for incorporation into in high-performance networking and telecommunications equipment, such as routers, switches, wide area network infrastructure equipment, wireless base stations and network access equipment. Our position in the synchronous SRAM market is well established and we have long-term supplier relationships with many of the leading original equipment manufacturer, or OEM, customers including Nokia.  The revenue generated by these sales of high-speed synchronous SRAM products is being used to finance the development of our new in-place associative computing solutions and new types of SRAM products. We also serve the ongoing needs of the military/defense and aerospace markets by offering robust high-quality radiation-tolerant and radiation-hardened space grade SRAMs in addition to new in-place associative computing solutions including synthetic aperture radar (SAR) image processing.
We utilize a fabless business model for the manufacture of our APU and SRAM products, which allows us both to focus our resources on research and development, product design and marketing, and to gain access to advanced process technologies with only modest capital investment and fixed costs. 
GSI’s fiscal year 2022 net revenue increased by 20% over net revenue in fiscal year 2021, reflecting the improvements in global economic conditions as restrictions resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic were lifted as well as the implementation of price increases on our products in December 2021. GSI’s gross margin also improved

by 7.8% compared to the prior fiscal year, reflecting increased sales of higher-margin products and our ability to manage supply chain challenges and increased costs brought on by the pandemic. Our first-place wins in the MAFAT challenge and the MoSAIC challenge have given GSI high-profile exposure to the leading agencies in the Israeli and American military and defense organizations allowing us to pursue opportunities such as our proof of concept order from Elta System Ltd, a subsidiary of Israeli Aerospace Industries, which is funding a SAR image processing acceleration system based on the APU technology. Our APU technology and software was proven to perform on par with prominent industry leaders in AI by our results in the Billion-Scale Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search (ANNS) Challenge in early fiscal 2022.
We were also named an OpenSearch partner in fiscal 2022 and are pursuing commercial opportunities for the APU with OpenSearch and Elastic. We are preparing to launch our OpenSearch platform on the AWS Marketplace with a software plugin to accelerate vector search in fiscal 2023. We are expecting additional customer interest for our Gemini-I APU product following the release of the initial version of the compiler stack in February 2022 and the expected release of version 2 in July 2022, which will be entirely Python enabled for coding algorithms, applications, and libraries. 
In fiscal 2022, we shipped prototypes of our radiation-hardened SRAM products to three customers, and in the first quarter of fiscal 2023, we started a program with a major prime contractor for a radiation-hardened SRAM prototype that is anticipated to ship in the first half of fiscal 2023 and has prospects for increasing GSI’s net revenue in fiscal 2023 and beyond.
We were incorporated in California in 1995 under the name Giga Semiconductor, Inc. We changed our name to GSI Technology in December 2003 and reincorporated in Delaware in June 2004 under the name GSI Technology, Inc. Our principal executive offices are located at 1213 Elko Drive, Sunnyvale, California, 94089, and our telephone number is (408) 331-8800.
Industry and Market Strategy
Associative Processing Unit Computing Market Overview
The market for associating processing computing solutions is significant and growing rapidly. The total addressable market (TAM) for APU search applications, which is the market where GSI is focusing its commercialization efforts, has been determined by GSI to be approximately $164 billion in 2022, and growing at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 19% to $287 billion by 2025. GSI has similarly determined that the Serviceable Available Market (SAM) for APU search applications is approximately $5.4 billion in 2022, and anticipated to grow at a CAGR of 21% to $10 billion by 2025. The search market segments included in GSI’s TAM and SAM analysis include computer vision, synthetic aperture radar, drug discovery, cybersecurity, and service markets such as NoSQL, Elasticsearch, and OpenSearch.
The growth in demand for associative processing computing solutions is being driven by the increasing market adoption and usage of graphics processing unit (GPU) and CPU farms for AI processing of large data collections, including scientific research. However, the large-scale usage of GPU and CPU farms for AI processing of data is demonstrating the limits of GPU and CPU processing speeds and resulting in ever higher energy consumption. The amounts of data being processed, which is coming from increasing numbers of users and continuously increasing amounts of collected data, has resulted in efforts to split and store the processed data among multiple databases, through a process called sharding. Sharding substantially increases processing costs and worsens the power consumption factors associated with processing so much data. As the environmental impacts of data processing are becoming increasingly important, and complex workloads are causing the migration from enterprise computing to edge computing for real-time applications, it is becoming increasingly difficult to achieve market demands for low power usage, smaller footprints and higher speeds.

The GSI APU has the potential to outperform CPU’s and GPU’s in the market for AI processing of large data collections by providing lower latency and increased capacity in a smaller form-factor and achieve such results with lower power consumption. In addition, GSI’s compute-in-place technology has wide application. The APU has several benefits that are particularly useful to overcoming the data processing challenges noted above. First, the APU does not have the word size limitation of traditional CPU and GPU processors. Because traditional data processors move data around to various parts of a system, they need to select or duplicate resources of particular word sizes, be they 8-bit, 16-bit, 32-bit or 64-bit. The APU is based on a memory line structure, which means the APU can operate on an instruction at 16-bits, and then the next instruction at say 768-bits or 2048-bits. The APU can operate on any word width that makes sense for the problem and also for what makes sense at the current processing step. This flexibility is a tremendous advantage for non-linear processing like trigonometry. The APU is also an associative machine, which means that data that is resident in the device can be applied to a function only if it is deemed associated (for example, with a meta-tag) to the processing. Such processing is similar to a person looking for his car in a parking lot, but ignoring all cars that are not the color of his car. Another strength of the APU design, is that it is multi-threaded. One sensor or query input can be simultaneously applied to multiple functions or searches in the device.
Our associative computing technology utilizes in-memory associative processor structures to address the bottlenecks that limit performance and increase power consumption in CPUs, GPUs, and FPGAs when processing large datasets. By constantly having to move operands and results in and out of devices with ever increasing processing speeds and bus speeds, current solutions are focused on memory transfers rather than addressing the basic computation problem. By changing the computational framework to parallel processing and having search functions conducted directly in a processing memory array, the APU can greatly expedite computation and response times in many “big data” applications. We are creating a new category of computing products that are expected to have substantial target markets and a large new customer base in those markets. 
Our commercialization efforts for the APU product are focused on markets where the APU shows factors of improvement against CPU or GPU-only systems. The APU differentiates itself most for similarity search, multi-modal search, real-time very large database search, and several scientific high-performance computing workloads processing sensor data. The APU’s improved performance over GPU or GPU systems provides a paradigm-shifting ability to process data in real-time. As a result, we see demand for the APU in artificial intelligence applications, including approximate nearest neighbor searches, natural language processing, cryptography, and synthetic aperture radar as well as other fields where the APU’s smaller footprint, superior speed, and low system power consumption is needed. GSI is currently in development and field testing with potential customers in the computer vision, synthetic aperture radar, drug discovery and cybersecurity market segments and is rolling out a SaaS solution for Elasticsearch and OpenSearch. Our expectations of demand for the APU have been supported by comparisons of the power usage for processing a large area SAR image for one second at high resolution. In one comparison, the APU used on average 93% less power than CPU or GPU systems.
Similarity search uses a technique called distance metric learning, in which learning algorithms measure how similar or related objects are. The APU is well suited for very fast similarity search because its design enables distance metric learning at fast computation speeds with high degrees of accuracy. Our APU is further differentiated from other solutions in the market by its scalability for very large datasets. The use of visual search, a subset of similarity search that uses very large datasets, is forecasted to grow rapidly as AI is adopted by the online retail industry. The APU has demonstrated its ability to increase the rate of computation for visual search by orders of magnitude with greater accuracy and reduced power consumption. The APU also adds multi-modal search capability to this computational performance. For instance, the ability to search on a picture of a product on an ecommerce website, with pricing and specific filters, does not impede the performance of the in-memory search. This kind of performance has the potential to transform online retailers’ capabilities to run search queries and improve customers’ online shopping experience.

The APU’s higher speeds and increased accuracy in similarity search has been shown to speed drug discovery, which can potentially lower drug discovery costs, an important consideration for research organizations dependent on funding. The APU is well suited for enhancing drug discovery work because it can perform similarity searches using very descriptive molecular representations in a virtual environment. The APU’s ability to process word lengths of 2000-8000 bits can significantly reduce the cost of developing drugs by allowing virtual screening and requires less use of physical laboratories. Use of AI products like the APU could reduce costs, increase drug efficacy and safety, and increase speed to market thereby potentially saving billions of dollars. For these reasons, the APU is drawing interest from prospective customers in the pharmaceutical and genomics industries.
New Markets for the APU
The APU is capable of processing large data arrays in a very cost competitive solution for large database similarity search, but the mathematical capabilities of the APU also create new opportunities for using real-time causal processing. Examples of this are SAR, image re-registration, and mathematical structural similarity index measure (SSIM). This combination of sensor processing, image processing, and computer vision at high performance has the potential to bring application processing that normally requires several resources in a data center to real-time edge applications. Possible examples are aircraft reconnaissance, satellite processing, and advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) support. Furthermore, GSI’s expertise in developing radiation-tolerant components creates new opportunities in the growing market for AI products that can be used in low earth orbit and space applications, where other AI products are not able to survive the harsh environment.
APU Board Level Product
The APU is currently available as a full-size PCIe card, which is our LEDA-E product, and is used in enterprise, datacenter, and edge server installations. We are also in the final stages of introducing a short 1U SSD-type E1.L form factor card, that will be our LEDA-S board level product, and is used in short off-the-shelf SSD server boxes. The E1.L form factor enables the use of market standard rack enclosures to build a dense APU compute appliance, such as a 16 card LEDA-S 1U form factor enclosure. We envision that this dense appliance would be of high interest for in-plane real-time SAR applications for instance. The APU board level products are also integrated and sold as server appliances that include software for turn-key applications in various markets such as medical molecular search and edge SAR image processing.
APU SaaS Product
We are also commercializing the APU as a service. This service offering runs on servers in a datacenter that has a direct connection to Amazon Web Services (AWS). Customers can access the APU via the AWS Cognito user identity and data synchronization service for GSI-packaged Software-as-a-Service (SAAS) applications, or a customer’s own custom APU-accelerated applications. The cloud connected cards in this datacenter are also connected via the same ultra-low latency system to provide approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) and multi-modal extension capability to OpenSearch.
APU Commercialization Risk
Sales of APU products have not been material to date. If we fail to commercialize our APU products, we may not generate sufficient revenues to offset our development costs and other expenses, which will have an adverse impact on our business including a potential impairment of intangible assets and a negative impact on our market capitalization.

High-Speed Synchronous SRAM Market Overview
High-speed synchronous SRAMs are incorporated into networking and telecom equipment, military/defense and aerospace applications, audio/video processing, test and measurement equipment, medical and automotive applications, and other miscellaneous applications. The networking and telecom market demand for high-speed synchronous SRAMs has been, and is expected to continue, declining due to the industry trend of embedding greater amounts of SRAM into each generation of ASICs/controllers products, thereby reducing the need for external SRAMs. As a result, the demand for external high-speed synchronous SRAMs in new end-products is being driven by markets such as military/defense and aerospace applications. Such applications require a combination of high densities and high random transaction rates that GSI is well positioned to serve, being the only SRAM manufacturer to offer 288Mb densities as well as offering the highest truly random transaction rate in the industry – 1866 million transactions per second (MT/s). To further serve the military/defense and aerospace markets, GSI has been focusing on qualifying its products for space/satellite applications to capitalize on opportunities resulting from the development of near-earth orbiting satellite mega constellations, as well as the more traditional geo-stationary earth orbit satellite communication platforms and national assets. 
High-Speed Synchronous SRAM Products
We offer four families of high-speed synchronous SRAMs – SyncBurst™, NBT™, SigmaQuad™, and SigmaDDR™. All four SRAM families feature high density, high transaction rate, high data bandwidth, low latency, and low power consumption. These four product families provide the basis for approximately 10,000 individual part numbers. They are available in several density and data width configurations, and are available in a variety of performance, feature, temperature, and package options. Our products can be found in a wide range of networking and telecommunications equipment, including routers, universal gateways, fast Ethernet switches and wireless base stations. We also sell our products to OEMs that manufacture products for military/defense and aerospace applications such as radar and guidance systems and satellites, for test and measurement applications such as high-speed testers, for automotive applications such as smart cruise control, and for medical applications such as ultrasound and CAT scan equipment.
We have introduced and are marketing radiation-hardened, or “RadHard”, and radiation-tolerant, or “RadTolerant”, SRAMs for military/defense and aerospace applications such as networking satellites and missiles. Our initial RadHard and RadTolerant products are 288 megabit, 144 megabit, and 72 megabit devices from our SigmaQuad-II+ family. We have also expanded our product offerings to include 144 megabit, 72 megabit, and 32 megabit SyncBurst and NBT SRAMs RadTolerant products to enable the avionics and other space platforms that have historically leveraged smaller asynchronous devices. The RadHard products are housed in a hermetically-sealed ceramic column grid array package, and undergo a special fabrication process that diminishes the adverse effects of high-radiation environments.
SRAM Leadership in the High Performance Memory Market
We endeavor to address the overall needs of our SRAM customers, not only satisfying their immediate requirements for our latest generation, highest performance networking memory, but also providing them with the ongoing long-term support necessary during the entire lives of the systems in which our products are utilized.

​
Many of our OEM customers use contract manufacturers to assemble their equipment. Accordingly, a significant percentage of our net revenues has been derived from sales to these contract manufacturers and to consignment warehouses who purchase products from us for use by contract manufacturers. In addition, we sell our products to OEM customers indirectly through domestic and international distributors.
In the case of sales of our products to distributors and consignment warehouses, the decision to purchase our products is typically made by the OEM customers. In the case of contract manufacturers, OEM customers typically provide a list of approved products to the contract manufacturer, which then has discretion whether or not to purchase our products from that list.
Direct sales to contract manufacturers and consignment warehouses accounted for 31.0%, 43.7% and 33.7% of our net revenues for fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Sales to foreign and domestic distributors accounted for 66.8%, 54.7% and 61.3% of our net revenues for fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
The following direct customers accounted for 10% or more of our net revenues in one or more of the following periods:

Sales, Marketing and Technical Support
We sell our products primarily through our worldwide network of independent sales representatives and distributors. As of March 31, 2022, we employed 18 sales and marketing personnel, and were supported by over 200 independent sales representatives, which we believe will enable us to address an expanded customer base with the continuing introduction of our associative computing products in fiscal 2023. We believe that our relationship with our U.S. distributors, Avnet, Mouser and Digi-Key, put us in a strong position to address the Very Fast SRAM memory market in the United States. We currently have regional sales offices located in Canada, China, Hong Kong, Israel and the United States. We believe this international coverage allows us to better serve our distributors and OEM customers by providing them with coordinated support. We believe that our customers’ purchasing decisions are based primarily on product performance, low power consumption, availability, features, quality, reliability, price, manufacturing flexibility and service. Many of our OEM customers have had long-term relationships with us based on our success in meeting these criteria.
Our sales are generally made pursuant to purchase orders received between one and twelve months prior to the scheduled delivery date. Because industry practice allows customers to reschedule or cancel orders on relatively short notice, these orders are not firm and hence we believe that backlog is not a good indicator of our future sales. We have experienced increased costs as a result of supply chain constraints for wafers, including a recent 20% increase in the price of wafers, outsourced assembly, burn-in and test operations. We have responded with increased pricing to our customers. We typically provide a warranty of up to 36 months on our products. Liability for a stated warranty period is usually limited to replacement of defective products.
Our marketing efforts are, first and foremost, focused on ensuring that the products we develop meet or exceed our customers’ needs. Our marketing efforts are currently focused on marketing the newly developed in-place associative computing solutions and our radiation-tolerant and radiation-hardened space grade SRAMs. Previously, those efforts were focused on defining our high-performance SRAM product roadmap. 
We work closely with key customers to understand their roadmaps and to ensure that the products we develop meet their requirements (primary aspects of which include functionality, performance, electrical interfaces, power, and schedule). Our marketing group also provides technical, strategic and tactical sales support to our direct sales personnel, sales representatives and distributors. This support includes in-depth product presentations, datasheets, application notes, simulation models, sales tools, marketing communications, marketing research, trademark administration and other support functions. We also engage in various marketing activities to increase brand awareness.
 We emphasize customer service and technical support in an effort to provide our OEM customers with the knowledge and resources necessary to successfully use our products in their designs. Our customer service organization includes a technical team of applications engineers, technical marketing personnel and, when required, product design engineers. We provide customer support throughout the qualification and sales process and continue providing follow-up service after the sale of our products and on an ongoing basis. In addition, we provide our OEM customers with comprehensive datasheets, application notes and reference designs and access to our FPGA controller IP for use in their product development.
Manufacturing
We outsource our wafer fabrication, assembly and wafer sort testing, which enables us to focus on our design strengths, minimize fixed costs and capital expenditures and gain access to advanced manufacturing technologies. Our engineers work closely with our outsource partners to increase yields, reduce manufacturing costs, and help assure the quality of our products.

Currently, all of our SRAM and APU wafers are manufactured by TSMC under individually negotiated purchase orders. We do not currently have a long-term supply contract with our foundry, and, therefore, TSMC is not obligated to manufacture products for us for any specified period, in any specified quantity or at any specified price, except as may be provided in a particular purchase order. Our future success depends in part on our ability to secure sufficient capacity at TSMC or other independent foundries to supply us with the wafers we require.
Our APU products are manufactured at TSMC using 28 nanometer process technology. The majority of our current SRAM products are manufactured using 0.13 micron, 90 nanometer, 65 nanometer and 40 nanometer process technologies on 300 millimeter wafers at TSMC. 
Our master die methodology enables multiple product families, and variations thereof, to be manufactured from a single mask set. As a result, based upon the way available die from a wafer are metalized, wire bonded, packaged and tested, we can create a number of different products. The manufacturing process consists of two phases, the first of which takes approximately sixteen to seventeen weeks and results in wafers that have the potential to yield multiple products within a given product family. After the completion of this phase, the wafers are stored pending customer orders. Once we receive orders for a particular product, we perform the second phase, consisting of final wafer processing, assembly, burn-in and test, which takes approximately ten to twenty-eight weeks to complete. Substrates are required in the second phase before assembly process can begin for many of our products. Due to supply chain constraints, it can take up to one year or more to acquire the necessary substrates required in the assembly process. We maintain a supply of substrates, based on historical usage or estimated requirements for anticipated orders, to minimize the impact of this lead time. This two-step manufacturing process enables us to significantly shorten our product lead times, providing flexibility for customization and to increase the availability of our products.
All of our manufactured wafers, including wafers for our APU product, are tested for electrical compliance and most are packaged at Advanced Semiconductor Engineering, or ASE, which is located in Taiwan. Wistron Neweb Corporation in Taiwan manufactures the boards for our APU product line. Our test procedures require that all of our products be subjected to accelerated burn-in and extensive functional electrical testing which is performed at our Taiwan and U.S. test facilities. Our radiation-hardened products are assembled and tested at STS, located near our Sunnyvale, California headquarters facility.
Research and Development
We have devoted substantial resources in the last six years on the development of our APU products. Our research and development staff includes engineering professionals with extensive experience in the areas of high-speed circuit design, including APU design, as well as SRAM design and systems level networking and telecommunications equipment design. Additionally, we have assembled a team of software development experts in Israel needed for the development of the various levels of software required in the use of our APU products. The design process for our products is complex. As a result, we have made substantial investments in computer-aided design and engineering resources to manage our design process.
Competition
Our existing and potential competitors include many large domestic and international companies, some of which have substantially greater resources, offer other types of memory and/or non-memory technologies and may have longer standing relationships with OEM customers than we do. Unlike us, some of our principal competitors maintain their own semiconductor fabs, which may, at times, provide them with capacity, cost and technical advantages.

11



Our principal competitors include NVIDIA Corporation and Intel Corporation for our in-place associative computing solutions and Cypress Semiconductor (Infineon Technologies AG), Integrated Silicon Solution and REC for our SRAM products. We expect additional competitors to enter the associative computing market as well. While some of our competitors offer a broader array of products and offer some of their products at lower prices than we do, we believe that our focus on performance leadership provides us with key competitive advantages.
In December 2021, we were among the leaders in the Billion-Scale Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search (ANNS) Challenge held at the NeurIPS 2021 Conference performing on par with NVIDIA and Intel. Our results in the ANNS Challenge proved that our technology could perform on par with the category leaders in AI. The Billion-Scale ANNS Challenge was created to provide a comparative understanding of algorithmic ideas and their application at scale, promote the development of new techniques for the problem and demonstrate their value, and introduce a standard benchmarking approach.
In April 2022, we announced that our submission to the Mobile Standoff Autonomous Indoor Capabilities (MoSAIC) Challenge won first place in the Human/Object Tagging category. The MoSAIC Challenge was designed to identify best-in-class, cutting-edge hardware and software solutions to address challenging and longstanding technological gaps concerning remote autonomous indoor maneuvers. The MoSAIC Challenge was led by the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD), Irregular Warfare Technical Support Directorate (IWTSD), and the Israel Ministry of Defense (IMOD), Directorate of Defense Research and Engineering (DDR&D), along with the Merage Institute.
We believe that our ability to compete successfully in the rapidly evolving markets for “big data” and memory products for the networking and telecommunications markets depends on a number of factors, including:
● product performance, features, including low power consumption, quality, reliability and price; 
● manufacturing flexibility, product availability and customer service throughout the lifetime of the product; 

● | the availability of software tools, such as compilers and libraries that enable customers to easily design products for their specific needs;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

● the timing and success of new product introductions by us, our customers and our competitors; and 
● our ability to anticipate and conform to new industry standards.
We believe we compete favorably with our competitors based on these factors. However, we may not be able to compete successfully in the future with respect to any of these factors. Our failure to compete successfully in these or other areas could harm our business.
The market for networking memory products is competitive and is characterized by technological change, declining average selling prices and product obsolescence. Competition could increase in the future from existing competitors and from other companies that may enter our existing or future markets with solutions that may be less costly or provide higher performance or more desirable features than our products. This increased competition may result in price reductions, reduced profit margins and loss of market share.
In addition, we are vulnerable to advances in technology by competitors, including new SRAM architectures as well as new forms of DRAM and other new memory technologies. Because we have limited experience developing IC products other than Very Fast SRAMs, any efforts by us to introduce new products based on new technology, including our new in-place associative computing products, may not be successful and, as a result, our business may suffer.

Intellectual Property
Our ability to compete successfully depends, in part, upon our ability to protect our proprietary technology and information. We rely on a combination of patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secret laws, non-disclosure and other contractual arrangements and technical measures to protect our intellectual property. We believe that it is important to maintain a large patent portfolio to protect our innovations. We currently hold 120 United States patents, including 62 memory patents and 58 associative computing patents, and have in excess of a dozen patent applications pending. We cannot assure you that any patents will be issued as a result of our pending applications. We believe that factors such as the technological and creative skills of our personnel and the success of our ongoing product development efforts are also important in maintaining our competitive position. We generally enter into confidentiality or license agreements with our employees, distributors, customers and potential customers and limit access to our proprietary information. Our intellectual property rights, if challenged, may not be upheld as valid, may not be adequate to prevent misappropriation of our technology or may not prevent the development of competitive products. Additionally, we may not be able to obtain patents or other intellectual property protection in the future. Furthermore, the laws of certain foreign countries in which our products are or may be developed, manufactured or sold, including various countries in Asia, may not protect our products or intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the United States and thus make the possibility of piracy of our technology and products more likely in these countries.
The semiconductor industry is characterized by vigorous protection and pursuit of intellectual property rights, which have resulted in significant and often protracted and expensive litigation. We or our foundry from time to time are notified of claims that we may be infringing patents or other intellectual property rights owned by third parties. We have been involved in patent infringement litigation in the past. We have been subject to other intellectual property claims in the past and we may be subject to additional claims and litigation in the future. Litigation by or against us relating to allegations of patent infringement or other intellectual property matters could result in significant expense to us and divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel, whether or not such litigation results in a determination favorable to us. In the event of an adverse result in any such litigation, we could be required to pay substantial damages, cease the manufacture, use and sale of infringing products, expend significant resources to develop non-infringing technology, discontinue the use of certain processes or obtain licenses to the infringing technology. Licenses may not be offered or the terms of any offered licenses may not be acceptable to us. If we fail to obtain a license from a third party for technology used by us, we could incur substantial liabilities and be required to suspend the manufacture of products or the use by our foundry of certain processes.
Human Capital Resources
As of March 31, 2022, we had 180 full-time employees, including 126 engineers, of which 88 are engaged in research and development and 55 have PhD or MS degrees, 18 employees in sales and marketing, 12 employees in general and administrative capacities and 65 employees in manufacturing. Of these employees, 62 are based in our Sunnyvale facility, 58 are based in our Taiwan facility and 46 are based in our Israel facility. We believe that our future success will depend in large part on our ability to attract and retain highly-skilled, engineering, managerial, sales and marketing personnel. Our employees are not represented by any collective bargaining unit, and we have never experienced a work stoppage. We believe that our employee relations are good.
Compensation and benefits
​
Our goal is to attract, motivate and retain talent with a focus on encouraging performance, promoting accountability and adhering to our company values. The future growth and success of our company largely depends on our ability to attract, train and retain qualified professionals. As part of our effort to do so, we offer competitive compensation and benefit programs including a 401(k) Plan, stock options for all employees, flexible spending

accounts and paid time off. We understand that effective compensation and benefits programs are important in retaining high-performing and qualified individuals. We continue to assess our healthcare and retirement benefits each year in order to provide competitive benefits to our employees.
Diversity, inclusion and belonging
​
We are committed to our continued efforts to increase diversity and foster an inclusive work environment that supports the global workforce and the communities we serve. We recruit the best people for the job regardless of gender, ethnicity or other protected traits and it is our policy to fully comply with all laws applicable to discrimination in the workplace. Our diversity, equity and inclusion principles are also reflected in our employee training and policies. We continue to enhance our diversity, equity and inclusion policies which are guided by our executive leadership team.
Ethics & Corporate Responsibility
​
 We are committed to ensuring ethical organizational governance, embracing diversity and inclusion in the board room and throughout the organization and are committed to observing fair, transparent, and accountable operating practices. We seek to create and foster a healthy, balanced, and ethical work environment for everyone in our organization. To this end, we promote an ethical organizational culture and encourage all employees to raise questions or concerns about actual or potential ethical issues and company policies and to offer suggestions about how we can make our organization better. These practices are set forth in our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, which is periodically reviewed by all of our employees and is available on our website under “Corporate Governance.”
Health and safety
​
We are committed to maintain a safe and healthy workplace for our employees. Our policies and practices are intended to protect our employees.
Since fiscal 2021, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have implemented safety protocols and new procedures to protect our employees. These protocols include complying with social distancing and other health and safety standards as required by state and local government agencies, taking into consideration guidelines of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and other public health authorities. In addition, we modified the way we conduct many aspects of our business including the practice of social distancing, wearing face coverings and maintaining a quarantine for employees determined to be in close contact with a COVID-19 case. From March 2020 and through April 2022, except for our employees located in Taiwan, the majority of our employees have worked from home around the world.
