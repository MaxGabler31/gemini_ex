Resort Savers, Inc. was incorporated in the State of Nevada on June 25, 2012. At formation, the Company was authorized to issue 100,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.0001 per share (“Common Stock”), and 15,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.0001 per share (“Preferred Stock”). On July 3, 2018, the Company’s board of directors (the “Board of Directors”) approved a change in our fiscal year end from January 31 to December 31. The Company now operates on a fiscal year ending on December 31. Resort Savers has limited cash on hand. We have sustained losses since inception and have relied solely upon the sale of our securities and loans for funding. Resort Savers has never declared bankruptcy, been in receivership, or been involved in any kind of legal proceeding.

On August 1, 2014, a change of control of the Company occurred, whereby a controlling interest in the Company was sold by Michelle LaCour, our former President, Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer and Director and a former 5% stockholder, and James LaCour, our former Secretary and Director and a former 5% stockholder, to the following: (1) Zhou Gui Bin (236,733 shares at a purchase price of $0.20 per share); (2) Zhou Wei (236,733 shares at a purchase price of $0.20 per share); and (3) Zong Xin International Investment Holdings Co. LTD (“Zong Xin”) (1,636,734 shares at a purchase price of $0.20 per share). On August 11, 2014, in connection with the transfer of shares described in this paragraph, Ms. LaCour and Mr. LaCour resigned from each of their roles as officers and Directors of the Company, and they were replaced by Zhou Gui Bin as President, CEO and Director, and Zhou Wei as Treasurer, CFO, Secretary and Director. 

On September 25, 2014 the Company effected a forward ten-for-one (10-for-1) stock split on its Common Stock, having the equivalent effect of issuing an additional nine shares of Common Stock for each share of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the effective date of the forward stock split. All share and per share information has been retroactively restated for financial presentation of prior periods.

Worx America, Inc.

From January 2015 through March 2015, the Company, by and through its wholly owned subsidiary, Xing Rui International Investment Holding Group Co., Ltd. (“Xing Rui”), acquired 20,068,750 shares of common stock (representing 20% of the issued and outstanding common stock) of Worx America, Inc. (“Worx”), a private company based in Houston, Texas, in exchange for $1,650,000 cash and 1,000,000 shares of common stock of Borneo Resource Investments Ltd. (“BRNE”) with a value of $350,000. Specifically, on January 28, 2015, the Company paid $350,000 cash in exchange for 5,403,728 common shares of Worx, on March 20, 2015, the Company paid $1,300,000 cash and transferred 1,000,000 shares of common stock of BRNE in exchange for 14,665,022 common shares of Worx. The Company accounted for this investment using the equity method, with an initial cost of $2,000,000.

Worx designs automated solutions for industrial, environmental and energy industries to improve efficiency and systems output. The Worx automated robotic tank cleaning system reduces tank cleaning time, reduces or eliminates the need for personnel to enter tanks, and may reduce the volume of solvents used to clean a tank. 

A description of the products, services, principal market and distribution methods of Worx can be found within this Part I, Item 1 under the heading “Principal Products, Services and Their Markets.”

Shenzhen Amuli Industrial Development Co. Ltd.

On October 1, 2015, the Company issued 3,033,926 shares of its Common Stock to Xu Xiao Yun in exchange for sixty percent (60%) of Shenzhen Amuli Industrial Development Co. Ltd., a PRC corporation (“Amuli”). The equity of Amuli that was transferred by Xu Xiao Yun was held by Huaxin Changrong (Shenzhen) Technology Service Co., Ltd. (“Huaxin”), which was formed by Xing Rui for the purpose of holding the equity of Amuli and other PRC subsidiaries. The purchase price was valued $2,400,000. 

On November 19, 2018, the Company disposed of its partial ownership interest in Amuli by causing Huaxin and Amuli to enter into a Share Purchase Agreement (the “Amuli Disposition Agreement”) with Ms. An Wenhui, a citizen of the PRC and minority shareholder of Amuli (the “Purchaser”), pursuant to which, among other things and subject to the terms and conditions contained therein, Huaxin sold its sixty percent (60%) Amuli equity stake (the “Amuli Shares”) to the Purchaser (the “Amuli Disposition”). Pursuant to the Amuli Disposition Agreement, in exchange for the Amuli Shares, the Purchaser paid to Huaxin a cash price of $1 or the equivalent thereof in Chinese Yuan (the “Purchase Price”). Our Board of Directors approved the Amuli Disposition Agreement, the Amuli Disposition and the Purchase Price, because among other reasons the Board of Directors believed that Amuli would not produce significant future income or cash flow. The Amuli Disposition Agreement contains substantially fewer representations and warranties in comparison to other agreements entered into by the Company and its subsidiaries. Additionally, the closing of the Amuli Disposition occurred contemporaneously with the signing of the Amuli Disposition Agreement, which resulted in little or no covenants or closing conditions imposed on the parties. As a result, Amuli is no longer a partially-owned subsidiary of the Company. 

Amendment to Articles of Incorporation

On October 9, 2015, we amended our Articles of Incorporation to increase the maximum number of authorized shares of Common Stock to 1,000,000,000 shares. We did not amend the amount of authorized shares of Preferred Stock or par values for Common Stock or Preferred Stock.

Beijing Yandong Tieshan Oil Products Co., Ltd.

On January 29, 2016, the Company entered into an exchange agreement (the “Tieshan Oil Exchange Agreement”) with Mr. Yang Baojin (“Mr. Yang”), a citizen of the PRC, and the Company’s subsidiary Huaxin. Mr. Yang was the president and majority owner of Beijing Yandong Tieshan Oil Products Co., Ltd. (“Tieshan Oil”). Pursuant to the Tieshan Oil Exchange Agreement, the Company issued 4,800,000 shares of its Common Stock to Mr. Yang, who delivered to Huaxin an ownership interest in Tieshan Oil such that Huaxin at the time of closing owned 51% of all ownership interests in Tieshan Oil (the “Tieshan Oil Exchange”). The Company held 1,200,000 shares of its Common Stock in escrow (the “Escrow Shares”) to issue to Mr. Yang twelve months following the closing of the Tieshan Oil Exchange, in connection with the successful performance of certain covenants by Mr. Yang. The Company did not issue the Escrow Shares to Mr. Yang in connection with the Tieshan Oil Exchange. 

On May 16, 2018, the Company completed its acquisition of Tieshan Oil by entering into a second share exchange agreement (the “Second Tieshan Oil Exchange Agreement”) with Mr. Yang. Pursuant to the Second Tieshan Oil Exchange Agreement, the Company, through Huaxin, agreed to acquire the remaining 49% of Tieshan Oil held by Mr. Yang, in exchange for the issuance to Mr. Yang of 16,000,000 shares of the Company’s Common Stock (the “Tieshan Oil Acquisition”). The Tieshan Oil Acquisition closed simultaneously with the execution of the Second Tieshan Oil Exchange Agreement. 

Apart from the Tieshan Oil Acquisition, neither the Company nor Huaxin has a material relationship with either Mr. Yang or Tieshan Oil.

A description of the products, services, principal market and distribution methods of Tieshan Oil can be found within this Part I, Item 1 under the heading “Principal Products, Services and Their Markets.”

On February 9, 2018, concurrently with the execution of the Admall Exchange Agreement and the Dusun Termination Agreement, Zhou Gui Bin resigned from his positions as President, CEO, Secretary and Director of the Company, and Zhou Wei resigned from his positions as Treasurer, CFO and Director of the Company. The departing Directors approved, by written consent in lieu of special meeting of the Board of Directors, the appointment of Mr. Ding-Shin “DS” Chang and Mr. Boon Jin “Patrick” Tan as the new Directors of the Company and submitted such appointment for approval and ratification by the Company’s stockholders. The Company’s departing Directors also appointed Mr. Ding-Shin “DS” Chang as the Company’s President and CEO, Mr. Boon Jin “Patrick” Tan as the Company’s Treasurer and CFO, and Mr. Liang-Yu “Jacky” Chang as the Company’s Secretary, all of whom are to serve on an at-will basis until their resignation or removal by the Board of Directors. 
Change in Fiscal Year End; Change to Bylaws; Reverse Stock Split; Corporate Name Change

On July 3, 2018, our Board of Directors approved a change in our fiscal year end from January 31 to December 31. The Company now operates on a fiscal year ending on December 31. The Company changed its bylaws to reflect the change in fiscal year end. 

Contemporaneously with the change in fiscal year end, our Board of Directors approved a reverse one-for-thirty (1-for-30) stock split (the “Reverse Split”) of the Company’s issued and outstanding Common Stock and a change of corporate name from “Resort Savers, Inc.” to “SCGI Group Holding, Inc.” (the “Name Change”). 

However, after further consideration of the business needs of the Company, the Board of Directors delayed the implementation of the Reverse Split and Name Change indefinitely. 

Principal Products, Services and Their Markets

As described above in this Part I, Item 1, we have ownership interests in Worx, Tieshan Oil and Admall.

Worx designs automated solutions for industrial, environmental and energy industries to improve efficiency and systems output. The Worx automated robotic tank cleaning system reduces tank cleaning time, reduces or eliminates the need for personnel to enter tanks, and may reduce the volume of solvents used to clean a tank. Actual results vary from tank to tank and may involve variables including the product in the tank, physical condition of the tank such as corrosion, or amount of sludge accumulated. Worx is currently refining its product line to improve speed and efficiency, and our investment in Worx has facilitated this development. We hope to utilize this important technology for deployment into commercial markets in China and greater Asia in the future. 

Tieshan Oil is principally engaged in the trading of oil, gas and lubricant products within the PRC. During the year ended December 31, 2018, one customer, who is a related party, accounted for 98% of revenues from related party. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, one customer accounted for approximately 98% and 0% of accounts receivable, two vendors account for approximately 96% and 0% of accounts payable, respectively

Admall engages in the business of providing nutrition consultancy services and training as well as selling health products through an online store.

We are also seeking additional global investment opportunities in emerging companies with products that have potential for expanding regional and international sales and revenues. 

Competitive Business Conditions and Strategy; Our Position in the Industry

Our core business is the acquisition of businesses which we believe will generate cash within an acceptable time horizon, and we primarily use our capital stock as consideration in such acquisitions. We face many competitors in the strategic investment and acquisition sector, including private equity funds, sovereign wealth and pension funds, corporate conglomerates, single family offices and multi-family offices, asset management firms, corporate acquirors which are strategically positioned in industries competitive with ours, and other small-cap public companies which primarily use equity securities to finance investments and acquisitions. In the latter category, barriers to entry are extremely low, and we face intense competition to source investment targets and to close investments. Our competitors have significantly greater financial and marketing resources than we do, including sufficient cash to pay consideration for acquisitions. There are no assurances that our efforts to compete in the marketplace will be successful or that we will continue to be able to compete with other funds, companies or other sources of capital to secure competitive acquisition targets and consummate future transactions.

Patents, Trademarks, Licenses, Agreements or Contracts

There are no aspects of our business plan which require a patent, trademark, or product license. We have not entered into any vendor agreements or contracts that give or could give rise to any obligations or concessions. 
Research and Development Activities and Costs

We have spent no time on specialized research and development activities and have no plans to undertake any research or development in the future.

Number of Employees

Resort Savers, including its subsidiaries, has 20 full-time employees and we do not anticipate hiring more employees in the near future. None of our Officers and/or Directors have signed any employment agreement, or any other agreement containing provisions related to financial remuneration for services, with the Company.

The public may obtain information on the operation of the Public Reference Room by calling the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330.

Emerging Growth Company and Smaller Reporting Company Status

Emerging Growth Company

We are an “emerging growth company” as defined in Section 2(a)(19) of the Securities Act, as modified by the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the “JOBS Act”). As such, we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not “emerging growth companies” including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the “Sarbanes-Oxley Act”), reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. We intend to take advantage of all of these exemptions.

In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an “emerging growth company” can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards, and delay compliance with new or revised accounting standards until those standards are applicable to private companies. We have elected to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period.

We could be an emerging growth company until the last day of the first fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of our the registration of our first common equity offering, although circumstances could cause us to lose that status earlier if our annual revenues exceed $1.07 billion, if we issue more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt in any three-year period or if we become a “large accelerated filer” as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act.


8

Smaller Reporting Company

We also qualify as a “smaller reporting company” under Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act, which is defined as a company with a public equity float of less than $250 million. To the extent that we remain a smaller reporting company at such time as are no longer an emerging growth company, we will still have reduced disclosure requirements for our public filings, some of which are similar to those of an emerging growth company, including not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements.
