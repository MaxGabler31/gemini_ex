Industry Background
Today’s Communications Service Providers ("CSPs") and enterprises are investing in their networks to compete in an ever-changing technology and customer experience landscape driven largely by cloud computing, mobile workforces requiring hyper-connectivity, new high-performance applications and use cases, and an insatiable demand for bandwidth by end-customers and the applications they use. As a result, service providers and enterprises are adding key enabling technologies to their networks for increased flexibility, programmability, scalability, reliability, and to enable new applications and services with an expedited time to market. These investments provide a competitive advantage and bring value-added services to increase network efficiency, increase customer satisfaction and produce new revenue streams. Within these broad industry themes, investment in our products and services is driven by several key industry trends.
Increased Adoption of Cloud Communications and Collaboration
The shift to cloud-based communications began several years ago driven largely by the advantages of running applications in a virtual cloud environment and reducing dependency on on-premises computing and communications technologies. The Coronavirus Disease 2019 ("COVID-19") pandemic has accelerated this trend significantly, driven by the need for more remote working and commerce for many businesses and industries. As a result, businesses and consumers have rapidly shifted from brick-and-mortar facilities and travel to work-from-home, or hybrid work-in-the-office and work-from home, using cloud communications and collaboration platforms such as Microsoft Teams, Zoom Phone and others, and require these communications platforms to be highly secure and scalable.
Evolution of Communications Service Provider Networks
CSPs of all types continue to face challenges to their businesses because of the significant technological evolution, increasing competition, disruption by Over-the-Top ("OTT") providers (those providing video entertainment over the Internet rather than through traditional cable, telco and satellite networks), and shifts in customer expectations. They also need to drive new revenues with more digital, efficient, automated, secure, and reliable networks driven largely by software, automation, cloud networking, and other technologies such as analytics and machine-learning. All these factors are causing service providers to re-think and evolve, or even over-haul, the way networks are designed, architected, managed, and optimized to deliver services to their customers with disruptive economics. They are migrating their networks and services software to run on private and/or public clouds (referred to as the "Telco Cloud") using cloud-native technologies, architectures and operational processes with automation and concepts such as Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery ("CI/CD"). Increasingly, network operators are also pursuing open, multi-layer optimized and disaggregated IP and Optical networking solutions, where they have the flexibility to assemble networks based on transport and control subsystems from different vendors with software-defined networking. The newest generation of broadband cellular technology ("5G"), and the corresponding promise of new revenue-generating applications and services for consumers and businesses, are key drivers of investment in the evolution of underlying mobile and fixed network infrastructures, and disruptions providing opportunity for new suppliers to be selected.
Service providers in some global regions, as mandated by governments or voluntarily, are also replacing certain incumbent vendor communications equipment and technology in their networks because of concerns for security. This presents a significant growth and market share opportunity.
Insatiable Demand for Hyper-Connectivity and Bandwidth Driven by New Services, Applications, and the Cloud
Our global information society is overflowing with telecommunications data traffic, for business, entertainment, education, surveillance, industrial control, online retail, and many other applications. These applications, increasingly delivered from the cloud, generate a huge amount of data driven largely by the video and image components. This exponential growth in data traffic is expected to continue and even accelerate, enabled by 5G upgrades to the mobile radio network. New applications will emerge, such as Reality/Virtual Reality ("R/VR"), cloud gaming, tele-health, Internet of Things ("IoT"), and Industry 4.0, all made possible by the massive bandwidth increases, low latency and highly secure infrastructure.
At the foundation, high performance Optical connections and advanced IP networking are needed to keep pace with the advancements in communications. This hyper-connectivity will be a key enabler and deliver disruptive ultra-low cost-per-bit communications within and between networks and the cloud, while also delivering on the promise of latency sensitive networking demanded by many of the applications.
Need for Reliable, Secure, High-Bandwidth Enterprise and Critical Infrastructure Communications
Companies and verticals that are classified as being part of a “critical infrastructure” are defined as those companies whose assets, systems, and networks, whether physical or virtual, are considered vital to a country’s national interest. Critical infrastructure providers are under increasing pressure to support new services, reduce carbon emission, improve security, expand automation, and increase safety. Achieving these goals requires a transition to a modernized, secure communications network that supports both IP and optical transport seamlessly. With a seamless integrated IP and optical transport solution, a critical infrastructure network operator can provide a highly reliable, secure, future proof communications solution optimized for critical industries. An essential requirement for this solution includes a security suite that incorporates state-of-the-art operational technologies protection measures, giving operators extra confidence in the security of their network.
Data is the lifeblood of any business, and it must be easily accessible across the enterprise to power business applications and to support services to end-customers. It must also be replicated across multiple locations for business continuity and disaster recovery and must be protected from inappropriate access, theft, and corruption. Enterprises deploy optical networking, secured by optical encryption, to attain the needed performance and security. Similarly, command and control groups within today’s armed forces have a need for high performance secure networks as their strategic sensors and assault systems are becoming more integrated. In this ecosystem, effective decision-making requires the pooling and analysis of data from a vast array of sensors and other information sources. The data must be delivered securely, in real-time, to wherever it is required. These solutions integrate intelligent optical transport with agile IP networking to provide a converged, secure, communication network.
Addressing the “Digital Divide” with Rural Broadband and High-Speed Internet Connectivity
Governments in many countries around the world are investing to address and help close the digital divide and extend ultra-broadband services and connectivity to underserved communities. As an example, in the United States, the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, the FCC Rural Digital Opportunity Fund ("RDOF"), the 5G Fund for Rural America, and the USDA Rural Development Broadband ReConnect Program expect to provide billions of dollars in funding to deliver broadband connectivity to rural communities in the U.S. Whether working or learning from home, streaming 4K television, or playing the latest online video games, rural subscribers demand dependable, high-speed Internet access to participate and thrive in the digital world. Forward-looking service providers are taking advantage of government funding programs to expand network capacity and transform the communities they serve. Next-generation rural broadband networks help service providers grow their revenues by extending service reach and diversity, and by satisfying the massive pent-up demand for high-speed internet connectivity. Next-generation broadband networks will also leverage new technologies like fixed-wireless access, while laying the foundation for future revenue opportunities like 5G backhaul transport services.
Strategy Overview
Our mission is to create a recognized global technology leader providing open, cloud-centric solutions spanning multiple network layers that enable the secure exchange of communications and information, with unparalleled scale, performance, and elasticity. To realize this mission, we have begun the implementation of a focused strategy for our business underpinned by our transformative ECI Acquisition and migration of communications networks and software applications to the cloud.
•Operational Integration - A key step of the strategy includes continuing to successfully drive the integration of ECI and Ribbon to achieve best-in-class operational efficiencies. We have made significant progress and largely completed this integration in 2021, including a revamped internal organization aligned along a business unit model with regional sales teams and integrated corporate functions, as well as the addition of new experienced members to our leadership team.
•Intellectual Property and Technology Integration - Beyond operational integration, we continue to explore opportunities to blend the intellectual property and technological know-how underlying the classic Ribbon business with that acquired as part of the ECI Acquisition to develop new products and services to meet the new challenges faced by our customers.
•Cross-Selling - We are laser-focused on marketing and selling our combined post-acquisition broad portfolio to our global deployed base of service provider and enterprise customers to expand our presence and share of the larger IP and Optical networking and transport market and cross-sell the complete portfolio.
•North American IP Optical Networks Market Share - We expect to continue to unlock the value of the former ECI portfolio by growing IP Optical Networks market share in the North American market by leveraging the extensive deployment base and ongoing business that we have with service providers and enterprise customers. We have already experienced some early cross-selling successes with new IP Optical customer wins in North America announced in the second half of 2020 and in 2021.
•Participate in the 5G Opportunity - The ECI Acquisition has also advanced our strategy of expanding into the service provider 5G data domain with the IP Optical Networks portfolio bundled with network analytics and intelligence, and security offerings. We believe 5G is a multi-year opportunity as global service providers roll out the new capital-intensive technology and build out the needed network infrastructure over the next decade. We want to be at the forefront of preparing our customers for the deployment of 5G on two major fronts: providing for metro, backhaul and long-haul transport and networking solutions in service provider networks, industrial verticals, and critical infrastructure; and supporting their needs as new applications, including IoT and AI, become a reality with 5G.
•Software-Centric and Cloud-Native Offerings - The value of virtual, cloud-native, and software-driven solutions deployable in the cloud has only grown because of the COVID-19 pandemic and the migration of network services to the Telco Cloud, which underscores another area of major focus for us. As a strategy, we continue to aggressively transition a significant portion of our product portfolio and business model towards more software, cloud-native offerings with automation and as-a-Service selling model. This transition is instrumental in continuing to improve profitability and competitiveness, and growing the recurring revenue portion of our business.
•Enterprise Offerings - The market need and growth rate are higher at the network edge than at the core. We are focused on growing this area of our business through our overall enterprise solutions for securing communications and our IP optical network connectivity solutions, which together are typically geared towards critical infrastructure, large enterprises, and small and medium businesses, building on our partnerships with key go-to-market channels and solutions providers such as Microsoft, as well as other popular unified communications and collaboration ("UC&C") 
platforms such as Zoom Phone and similar service provider UC&C offerings. We have recently created a dedicated and expanded sales force focused on the enterprise market segment.
•Partnerships - We continually look to form industry partnerships that will enhance our current solution offerings to our customers.
•Focus - We maintain a constant feedback loop to ensure we stay focused on activities that support the strategy of our main business segments and ensure our investments in research and development are directly aligned to these goals. As part of this strategy, we completed the sale of our cloud-based enterprise communications services (the "Kandy Communications Business") in December 2020 to American Virtual Cloud Technologies, Inc. ("AVCT"). We believe that the sale enables us to be even more focused on executing our service provider and enterprise strategy to the benefit of our customers while allowing AVCT to unlock Kandy’s true value and strong potential and capitalize on the momentum the business has established. As part of the transaction, we became an investor in AVCT, which means that we have a continued opportunity to capitalize on the continued success of Kandy. We believe execution on this multi-faceted strategy will strengthen our financial foundation, will continue to improve our relationships and collaboration with our customers, and will further align us with our key stakeholders - customers, partners, employees, and investors.

Manufacturing
We rely on global contract manufacturers and original design manufacturers to manufacture, assemble, test and ship our products. We typically utilize long-term relationships with our contract manufacturers and regularly review business relationships in an attempt to reduce cost of goods and supply risks. We employ formal quality, environmental and ethics management programs with all of our contract manufacturers. 
Our leading manufacturers have presence in multiple international locations. This enables us to implement a flexible manufacturing and logistics landscape for each product line and target markets. This structure also facilitates redundancy and business continuity to mitigate risks related to adverse trade tariff, taxation, and natural disasters. Moreover, we wholly own the intellectual property related to fabrication files, assembly, testing algorithms and manufacturing operating procedures, thus reducing sole dependency on a specific contract manufacturer.
Inventory Suppliers and Sourcing
We work with strategic global suppliers for our key integrated circuit components, systems, and software. Certain of our networking products use third-party optical modules embedded on board or configured as pluggable units. These modules are designed and manufactured by leading optical technology vendors and supplied to us based on agreed-upon our controlled performance specifications.
Our policy is to purchase major components directly from original suppliers or from authorized distributors. We regularly review market trends and volume demand for newly introduced products with our suppliers and distributors to negotiate reduced component pricing as the products mature. We carefully manage end-of-sale and end-of-life transitions to maximize return on investment and minimize wasted material, while maximizing customer satisfaction. When we must source such end-of-life components from distributors and brokers, we typically encounter increased component pricing. In some cases, when such parts cannot be sourced reliably any longer in the open market, we undertake costly redesign efforts with alternative components.
In order to maintain competitive lead time for our customers, we employ sophisticated demand and supply management systems. We also utilize agility and safety stock processes to help meet higher-than-forecasted customer demand to stock raw material and sub-assembly inventory. We occasionally experience unforeseen demand drops of certain products or sub-assemblies due to technology evolution, customer consumption behavior, or shortened product lifecycle. For example, we encountered supply chain disruptions in 2021 due to component demand and logistics complications. We regularly review current inventory levels to ensure adequate reserves for excess and obsolete inventory arising from shortened product life cycle or demand drops.

We continue to invest in analytics and automation to allow our customers to operate our solutions at scale with end-to-end visibility and control over the robustness, security, and efficiency of the solution.

We believe intellectual property is fundamental to our business and success, and we depend upon our ability to develop, maintain and protect our technology. We seek to safeguard our investments in technology and rely on a combination of U.S. and foreign patent, trademark, trade secret and copyright law and contractual restrictions to protect the proprietary aspects of our technology. As of December 31, 2021, we had been issued 705 patents in the U.S, which expire between 2022 and 2040, and had 33 in-process patent applications in the U.S. As of such date, we also had 300 issued patents in foreign jurisdictions, and had 27 patent applications. As of December 31, 2021, we had 32 trademarks registered in the U.S. and 117 trademarks registered in foreign jurisdictions.
In addition to the protections described above, we seek to safeguard our intellectual property by employing measures to protect against the unauthorized use or disclosure of the source and object code for our software, documentation and other written materials; licensing our software pursuant to signed license agreements, which impose restrictions on others' ability to use our software; and seeking to limit disclosure of our intellectual property by requiring employees and consultants with access to our proprietary information to execute confidentiality agreements.
We have incorporated third-party licensed technology into certain of our products and may be required to license additional technology from third parties to develop new products or to enhance existing products. Although many companies are often willing to enter into such licensing agreements, no assurance can be provided that such licenses can be negotiated on reasonable terms, or at all. The failure to enter into technology development or licensing agreements, when necessary, could limit our ability to develop new products and could harm our business.
Despite our efforts to protect our technology and proprietary rights as discussed above, unauthorized parties may still obtain and use our technology and software. We have defended, and intend to vigorously defend when necessary, our intellectual property from infringement. Other companies in the communications and technology industries frequently threaten litigation or file suit against us (directly or indirectly through customers to whom we could owe indemnification) based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. We are currently subject to, and expect to face in the future, allegations that we have infringed the intellectual property rights of third parties, including those of our competitors and non-practicing entities.
Regulatory Considerations
As a company with global operations, we are subject to complex U.S. and foreign laws and regulations, including trade regulations, tariffs, import and export regulations, anti-bribery and corruption laws, antitrust or competition laws, cybersecurity, privacy and data protection, among others. In addition, our operations are also subject to a number of environmental regulations such as the Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive ("WEEE") and the Directive on the Restriction of the Use of Certain Hazardous Substances in Electrical and Electronic Equipment ("RoHS"). We have developed policies and procedures to assist us in complying with these laws and regulations. Our historical compliance costs, including those related to environmental regulations, have not resulted in a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. We expect the laws and regulations to which we are subject will continue to increase and the future costs of compliance with existing or new regulations could materially impact our business in the future.
Our Employees
As a global company, we continue to focus on improving our "One Team" approach, aligning around a work culture that reflects and expresses our values, with global processes and platforms that enable us to work efficiently across borders and functions. We aim to create a workplace that is engaging, inspiring, challenging and inclusive. We strive to be an employer of choice for our current employees and for future employees who are seeking an opportunity to join our dynamic business, positioned at the nexus of global communications technology and social transformation.
As of December 31, 2021, we had a total of 3,685 employees worldwide, located geographically as follows:

 | Number of employees | Percentage of total
Asia | 1,509 | | 41 | %
North America | 997 | | 27 | %
EMEA | 1,058 | | 29 | %
LATAM | 121 | | 3 | %

Approximately 640 employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements or works councils, and we believe that our relations with the labor unions are generally good.
Our values are focused on teamwork, passion (taking pride in our achievements), being a trusted advisor to our customers, innovation and being "TRUE" - Transparent, Respectful, Unpretentious and Empowered. Engaging our employees includes aligning with these values and providing a workplace that is one in which we all work toward shared objectives that contribute to a better world and a better society. We engage our employees by providing opportunities for personal and professional growth and maintaining a culture of open communications where everyone receives constructive performance feedback and is encouraged to offer new ideas about any aspect of the work we do and our ways of doing things.
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion ("DEI"). We believe that having a diverse group of people who contribute different perspectives and viewpoints is a serious competitive advantage and critical to the success of any organization. In our most recent survey completed in 2021, 89% of employees responded that they feel comfortable working at Ribbon and 87% agreed that our employees appreciate others whose gender, backgrounds and beliefs are different from their own. We held our first annual Global Diversity Day in 2021 to engage employees in inspiring dialogue led by expert guest speakers on topics such as gender equality in the workplace and personal accountability for diversity.
Our DEI strategy's initial focus is on achieving stronger representation of women in a variety of roles at all levels of the organization, with an emphasis on women in management. As of December 31, 2021, the percentage of employees in each region that identified as female was as follows:

 | Percentage of employees identifying as female
Asia | 26 | %
North America | 20 | %
EMEA | 23 | %
LATAM | 18 | %
Percentage of total employees identifying as female | 23 | %

We have established a number of goals to increase the number of women in our workforce. For 2021, we established a goal that at least 25% of our new hires identify as female and we exceeded that goal with approximately 29% of our new hires identifying as female. Longer term, we also want to improve the number of women in management roles and have established a goal of at least 30% of management roles to be held by women by 2025 (and 40% long-term) from an initial baseline of 16%.
Attracting women to technology careers has traditionally been a challenge, and we recognize the need to accelerate the hiring and advancement of women at Ribbon. To support our efforts, we have created the Ribbon Diversity Council that will develop our DEI strategy and create initiatives to deliver stronger diverse representation at Ribbon, including initiatives aimed at improving our outreach to female candidates, expanding options for professional and leadership development, and raising awareness at all levels of the organization to encourage an understanding of more balanced representation of women and other under-represented groups across the Company.
Employee Turnover and Engagement. We believe one of the best ways to monitor our overall employee engagement is through monitoring employee turnover rates, as successful employee engagement helps increase employee tenure and reduce voluntary turnover. For the year ended December 31, 2021, our voluntary employee turnover was 11.6% globally. Like many companies in our industry, this is up significantly from our historical levels. While we have generally been able to successfully backfill these positions, we continue to review the reasons provided by employees as to their departure and have taken a number of steps to address these concerns, including implanting regional salary increases to remain competitive in local markets, reviewing employee benefits, introducing selective retention programs to ensure we retain our key employees in a very competitive employment market globally and providing additional targeted employee engagement in regional locations or functions with higher attrition.
As a further way of measuring employee engagement, in 2022 we again conducted an employee pulse survey to better understand employees' views on items such as our strategy, communication and whether or not they would recommend Ribbon as a place to work. We intend to use the results from this and future surveys to look for ways to continually improve our employee engagement. In 2021, we also created Ribbon Engagement Committees, employee-led groups in each of our major locations, charged with delivering programs of locally relevant activities and events that facilitate networking, enable exchange of ideas and help enhance employee satisfaction, productivity and engagement in local communities.
Training and Development. We believe investing in our employees' professional development so that they can perform their current roles more effectively and can be prepared for roles of greater responsibility in the future. Our training programs utilize a combination of in-person and online programs and include core modules, some of which are mandatory, relating to ethical conduct, products and services, safety, human rights and anti-corruption, as well as additional tailored programs on topics such as leadership, management, project management and competency development. In 2021, we delivered approximately 18 training hours per employee across our workforce, up from approximately 12 hours in 2020.
Safety, Health and Well-being. We strive for a workplace that is free of hazards for our employees. We take care to comply with applicable safety regulations and have a strong track record for safety that we reinforce through regular training modules in all of our locations.
As a result of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, we have taken a number of steps to help ensure the safety and well-being of our employees. This included closing our offices and shifting most employees to work from home. We instituted a phased return to occupancy plan that provided for a gradual return of employees to our locations on a part-time basis (typically 2-3 days per week) based on the current conditions in the geographic region the office is located in, as well as local regulations. In certain locations, such as India, we also sponsored COVID-19 vaccination drives to assist employees and their families in being able to receive COVID-19 vaccines. We have provided regular communications to our employees to update them on our policies and created a COVID-19 resource site for them that includes information and resources on working from home and links to official resources from the World Health Organization, the Centers for Disease Control and others.
Community Investment. We value the communities in which we work. We encourage a service mindset among our employees wherever they are and support community involvement and engagement. To that end, since 2010, we have provided a day of paid time off for all employees to participate in our Global Day of Service during which they are encouraged to volunteer and contribute to local non-profits in their communities.

Corporate Governance and Social Responsibility
We are committed to operating ethically, efficiently and inclusively. We believe we contribute to the communities in which we operate through the mitigation of climate change and other global sustainable development priorities. We aim to help improve the quality of the lives of people, society and the health of the planet through leveraging our expertise in transforming networks, enhancing security and delivering world-class solutions. We believe that communications technology and continuous innovation form the backbone upon which sustainable development largely depends. Major technology trends supported by our solutions include the accelerated adoption of collaboration platforms such as Microsoft Teams and Zoom; the 5G revolution; accelerating customers' ability to transfer carbon-intensive data storage from using local physical environments to the cloud; supporting service providers’ increased network demands to allow more people to work from home; and using our analytics solutions to maximize network efficiencies.
We have taken a more strategic position to our environmental, social and governance ("ESG") practices. Our recent materiality study reviewed the expectations and requirements of both our stakeholders and our competitors to focus on the ESG practices that are most critical to our business and those where we believe we can make the largest positive impact. From this materiality study, we published a strategy which we believe will positively impact our future environmental performance, and deliver social benefits for our customers, employees and society at large. Additionally, we believe the governance improvements made as a result of our strategy will result in enhancements in our accountability and that of our suppliers and partners. We have developed three initial targets to display both our confidence in delivery and our commitment to supporting the United Nations' Sustainability Development Goals: (1) reduction of our greenhouse gas emissions by 30% by 2030; (2) improvement in our workforce diversity with a specific goal to achieve at least 30% of women in management by 2025; and (3) enhancement of controls in our supply chain to improve ethical and sustainable conduct amongst our suppliers.
We are committed to protecting the environment and preventing pollution within a product's lifecycle through responsible product design and requiring suppliers to adhere to sustainable practices. An example of this is our focus on continuously improving the power and space efficiency of our products to reduce overall energy consumption in our customers' networks at our own facilities. We align our compliance goals with component directives such as RoHS legislation in the European Union and China and with the European WEEE directive. We also hold a host of internationally recognized certifications for our global offerings, including ISO 9001: 2015 - Quality Management Systems; ISO 14001: 2015 - Environmental Management Systems; and SI 10000: 2013 - Social Responsibility (covering our sites in Israel).
It has always been paramount to our way of doing business to act with the utmost integrity, honesty and transparency. Our commitment to ethical business practices guide us in our compliance with national and international laws and regulations, including anti-corruption, anti-bribery and unfair competition, antitrust and human rights. We maintain a Code of Conduct that applies to all of our directors, employees, contractors and suppliers. We are committed to strong corporate governance practices, which include building long-term value and assuring success for our stockholders and other stakeholders, including employees, customers and the communities in which we operate.

Seasonality
We have experienced quarterly fluctuations in customer activity due to seasonal considerations. We typically experience increases in order volume in the fourth quarter due to greater spending on operating and capital expenditures by our service provider customers. We typically experience reductions in order volume toward the beginning of the calendar year, when our service provider customers are operationalizing their annual budgets and plans, which may result in lower revenue in the first quarter. These typical seasonal effects may vary. Accordingly, they should not be considered a reliable indicator of our future operating results.
