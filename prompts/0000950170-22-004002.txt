 Item 1. Business.
Overview
We are a biopharmaceutical company focused on developing a diversified pipeline of targeted therapeutic candidates across multiple modalities in order to bring important medicines to cancer patients. Our strategy is to source innovation through both internal discovery efforts and external collaborations, focusing on advanced stage assets with novel technology platforms and differentiated mechanisms. Before we advance a product candidate into clinical development, we evaluate its potential for anti-tumor activity as a single agent as well as its ability to generate an immune system response or to inhibit oncogenic drivers. Using this strategy, we have efficiently developed or in-licensed a portfolio of product candidates that currently includes eight distinct programs.
Our pipeline currently includes three clinical-stage candidates and five preclinical programs. We are evaluating our lead candidate, CLN-081, in a Phase 1/2a trial in patients with non-small cell lung cancer, or NSCLC, harboring epidermal growth factor receptor, or EGFR, exon 20 insertion mutations who have previously received platinum-based chemotherapy. In December 2021, we presented efficacy and safety data from this trial that we believe supports CLN-081’s differentiated clinical profile. In January 2022, we announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or the FDA, granted CLN-081 Breakthrough Therapy Designation, or BTD. Our two other clinical stage programs include CLN-049, a bispecific T cell-engaging antibody targeting FLT3 and CD3 that is in an ongoing clinical trial for patients with relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia, or r/r AML; and CLN-619, a monoclonal antibody that stabilizes a unique tumor cell surface target, MICA/MICB, to promote an antitumor response via activation of both natural killer (NK) cells and certain T cells. CLN-619 is in an ongoing clinical trial for patients with advanced solid tumors. Both CLN-049 and CLN-619 demonstrated compelling antitumor activity preclinically in multiple in vivo models and we believe that both programs have first-in-class potential. Our preclinical pipeline includes two programs in investigational new drug application, or IND, enabling studies, CLN-617 and CLN-978, and three programs in research.
 In order to advance and grow our portfolio, we adhere to our Cullinan Oncology approach, which is guided by the following core elements:
•Platform technology diversification to mitigate overall risk and maximize optionality
 •Capital allocation strategy based on risk-adjusted potential, including staged funding to pre-specified scientific and clinical results 
 •Internal development capabilities complemented by external business development 
 •Disciplined asset evaluation and selection with emphasis on structural and mechanistic differentiation; and
 •Focus on translational medicine and product candidates with in vivo single agent activity.
 Our Pipeline
Our pipeline includes oncology product candidates and programs that are intentionally diversified by mechanism, technology platform, modality and stage of development. We rigorously assess each of our programs to justify continued investment and determine proper capital allocation. When certain programs do not meet our de-risking criteria for advancement, we terminate those programs and preserve our capital and resources to invest in programs with greater potential. As a result, our pipeline will continue to be dynamic.
We believe that each program candidate has differentiating design features or mechanisms of action, as well as first- and/or best-in-class potential. We currently hold worldwide development and commercialization rights to each of our product candidates, except for CLN-081, where Japan and Greater China rights have been partnered. Our current pipeline is summarized in the diagram below:
   Our Strategy
We are advancing a broad and deep pipeline of targeted oncology product candidates, including multiple clinical stage programs, that span a range of cancer indications and diverse technology platforms. Our focused approach is to select and advance molecules with first- and/or best-in-class potential that activate the immune system or target key oncogenic drivers and have the promise of single agent efficacy. The key elements of our strategy are to:
•Build a pipeline of differentiated oncology product candidates that are diversified by mechanism, therapeutic approach, modality and stage of development. We seek to mitigate risk by maintaining a diversified portfolio of uncorrelated product candidates and programs, and by intentionally carrying a portfolio mix such that some programs are directed toward novel targets, while others focus on more validated pathways. For the latter programs, we seek drug candidates with mechanisms or formats that we believe will be responsible for differentiating tolerability, ease of administration, efficacy or a combination thereof. Importantly, before we advance a product candidate into clinical development, we evaluate its ability to generate an immune system response or to inhibit oncogenic drivers as a single agent in vivo. 
 •Expand our pipeline through research collaborations, business development, and internally designed programs. Our founders and management team are leaders in oncology drug discovery, clinical development and business development and commercial operations. Their proven track records and longstanding relationships in the life sciences industry provide us with access to ideas and assets from around the world. In addition, their experiences and deep understanding of molecular oncology and cancer immunotherapy also enable us to translate novel concepts into internally designed product candidates. We are actively evaluating external collaboration and in-licensing opportunities as well as internal development opportunities to continue to expand our pipeline. 


•Advance our lead product candidate, CLN-081, toward potential regulatory approval for the targeted treatment of NSCLC patients with EGFRex20ins mutations. As of December 2021, we had enrolled 73 patients across five dosing levels in our ongoing Phase 1/2a trial. We intend to leverage CLN-081’s BTD to support our ongoing discussions with the FDA and to provide a CLN-081 regulatory update by the end of the first quarter of 2022.
 •Establish clinical proof-of-concept for CLN-049 and CLN-619 in patients with hematological malignancies and solid tumors, respectively. Both CLN-049 and CLN-619 have strong potential for clinical differentiation. CLN-049’s target, FLT3, is expressed frequently on AML cells and leukemic blasts but minimally on healthy blood cells, which differentiates FLT3 from other tumor surface antigens identified in AML, such as CD33 and CD123. Furthermore, by targeting extracellular FLT3, regardless of mutant or wild type status, we believe CLN-049 has the potential to reach a broader patient population than existing small molecule FLT3 kinase inhibitors acting on the intracellular domain, which are limited to a subset of approximately 25% of AML patients with FLT3 mutations. CLN-619’s target, MICA/B, is expressed by a broad range of tumor types across both solid tumors and hematological malignancies. Furthermore, the MICA/B receptor, NKG2D, is expressed in both innate and adaptive effector cell populations. Finally, CLN-619 facilitates an antitumor immune response through multiple modes of action, including inhibition of MICA/B shedding, ADCC mediation, enhancement of NKG2D receptor binding, and prevention of decoy NKG2D by shed MICA/B. We intend to provide a clinical update on both programs by mid 2023. 
 •Continue to advance and evolve our pipeline with a goal of advancing one product candidate into the clinic and one program into IND-enabling studies each year. In addition to our three clinical stage product candidates, we have five additional preclinical programs that are designed with the goal of addressing limitations of approved oncology therapies. For example, we believe CLN-617 is the only single agent immunotherapy in development combining IL-2 and IL-12 with a collagen-binding domain to enhance retention of cytokines within the tumor microenvironment. Another of our research programs, CLN-978, is a half-life extended, humanized, single-chain T cell engaging antibody that we believe has the potential to improve on some of the shortcomings of the approved CD3/CD19 bispecific T cell engager, blinatumomab, and to compete with CD19-targeted CAR-T cell therapies. We expect to submit INDs for CLN-617 and CLN-978 by the end of the first half of 2023.
 •Evaluate strategic opportunities to accelerate development timelines and maximize the value of our portfolio. We intend to maximize the value for each of our programs by opportunistically leveraging the existing infrastructure of other companies or internally pursuing later-stages of development and commercialization. Our subsidiaries hold the worldwide rights to our product candidates, except for CLN-081. Our licensor, Taiho Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., or Taiho Pharma, retains rights in Japan and we sublicensed Greater China rights to Zai Lab (Shanghai) Co., Ltd., or Zai Lab. Our business model provides us with the flexibility to efficiently pursue various types of transactions and collaborations with third parties at the subsidiary level. It also enables us to preserve resources for continued internal investment upon successful achievements of development milestones. We have made and will continue to make decisions regarding each of our subsidiaries and programs with the overarching aim of maximizing both patient benefit and shareholder value. 
 Our Structure
We have historically established distinct subsidiaries for externally sourced programs to execute our strategy of building a diversified oncology company in a capital efficient manner. Our holding company, Cullinan Oncology, Inc., or Cullinan, provides all capital, human resources, and other services to each subsidiary via a shared services agreement. Each subsidiary holds the exclusive rights to intellectual property, or IP, for any of our product candidates and programs that was sourced externally. This structure enables us to keep licensors economically incentivized at the program level through our ability to offer equity and access to potential cash milestones and royalty payments. Further, because each subsidiary is a separate legal entity that holds all of the assets related to the development candidate, including the relevant intellectual property, and has no employees, fixed assets, or overhead costs, we have flexibility both to raise capital at either the parent or subsidiary level and to pursue subsidiary-level licenses or stock sales.
 In the figure below, we have listed each subsidiary’s product candidate as well as any relevant licensors or shareholders. Cullinan’s ownership, as of December 31, 2021, as a percentage of fully-diluted shares outstanding is listed below.
Our Structure
 
Note: The Company owned 45% of Cullinan MICA as of December 31, 2021.
 The structure of our financing arrangements with each subsidiary enables us to increase our economic ownership when we provide additional capital. Further information about our subsidiaries, including ownership and governance, is included in the “Management’s Discussion and Analysis” section of this Annual Report.
Our structure was designed to (i) enhance operational efficiency, (ii) maintain an optimal cost structure, (iii) attract leading collaborators and licensors and (iv) promote asset flexibility, as further described below.
•Enhance operational efficiency: We centralize all employees and services at our holding company and allocate resources to subsidiaries as needed. We empower managers to access these resources and make program-level decisions in order to increase productivity and speed. We believe this model enables a flexible organizational structure that can achieve scale through the addition of programs without increasing burdensome bureaucracy or redundant infrastructure. 
 •Maintain an optimal cost structure: We have a relatively small number of employees and have built a network of trusted external service providers, choosing to leverage their infrastructure and expertise as needed instead of embarking on capital-intensive lab, manufacturing and equipment expenditures. As of December 31, 2021, we had 31 full time employees and three consultants working on eight active programs. By reducing overhead costs, we believe we can increase the likelihood that we can generate a return on invested capital. 
 •Attract leading collaborators and licensors: Each of our subsidiaries has its own capitalization and governance, enabling us to keep collaborators and licensors economically incentivized at the program level. We believe that the experienced leadership team and shared services at our holding company differentiate us from other potential licensees. 
 •Promote asset flexibility: Each subsidiary holds the relevant intellectual property of its product candidates or programs and has none of its own employees, fixed assets, or overhead costs. This allows us to efficiently pursue various subsidiary-level transactions, such as stock or asset sales, licensing transactions, strategic partnerships, co-development arrangements, or spin-outs. It also provides us with the flexibility to terminate programs with minimal costs if results do not meet our de-risking criteria for advancement. 
Our Programs
CLN-081
Our lead product candidate, CLN-081, is an orally available small molecule designed as a next generation, irreversible EGFR inhibitor in development for the treatment of NSCLC patients harboring EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations. In January 2022, we announced that the FDA granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation to CLN-081. The molecule was designed with a unique chemical scaffold to bind to the active site exon 20 insertion mutant EGFR, inhibiting mutant activity while sparing wild type EGFR activity. In preclinical studies, CLN-081 demonstrated high selectivity for cells with EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations, while relatively sparing cells expressing wild type EGFR. CLN-081 displayed potent antitumor activity in in vitro and in vivo models of exon 20 insertion mutant EGFR NSCLC.
 We licensed worldwide rights, excluding Japan, to CLN-081 from Taiho Pharma in 2018 and initiated a Phase 1/2a dose escalation and expansion trial in previously treated, adult NSCLC patients with EGFRex20ins mutations. In December 2021, we provided a clinical update that included safety and efficacy data from 73 evaluable patients enrolled across five dose levels, ranging from 30 to 150mg BID. At the 100mg BID dose, we observed the following efficacy highlights:
•14 of 36 (39%) response evaluable patients achieved a confirmed partial response.
 •35 of 36 (97%) response evaluable patients achieved a best response of partial response or stable disease. 
 •The estimated median duration of response was greater than 15 months and an estimated median progression free survival that was 12 months in the initial cohort of phase 1 patients (n=13); follow-up is ongoing for the patients enrolled in the Phase 2a cohort (n=23). 
 We also observed a favorable safety and tolerability profile at the 100mg BID dose level, as evidenced by the lack of Grade 3 or greater treatment-related adverse events, or TRAEs, of rash or diarrhea, which are associated with EGFR TKIs therapies. EGFR-associated TRAEs have been manageable with conventional supportive care, and the implementation of systematic GI prophylaxis has not been required. As seen with other EGFR TKIs, a case of Grade 3 treatment-related pneumonitis has been observed at the 100mg BID dose, although the patient had recently undergone treatment with checkpoint inhibitor therapy and had a concurrent presence of a significant hydropneumothorax, not related to treatment, in the contralateral lung. We believe that the totality of CLN-081’s data at the 100mg BID dose reflects its differentiated clinical profile.
We sublicensed CLN-081 development rights in Greater China to Zai Lab in exchange for an upfront fee, milestones and royalties. The licensing agreement provided Zai Lab with an exclusive license to research, develop, commercialize and manufacture CLN-081 and products which contain CLN-081 in Greater China. See the section of this Annual Report titled “Business - License Agreements — Zai License Agreement” for more information.
Background on NSCLC and EGFR mutations
Lung cancer is by far the leading cause of cancer deaths among both men and women, comprising almost 25% of all cancer deaths. Each year, more people die of lung cancer than of colon, breast, and prostate cancers combined. The American Cancer Society estimated that, in 2022, there will be approximately 236,740 new cases of lung cancer and approximately 130,180 deaths from lung cancer in the United States. The most common subtype of lung cancer is NSCLC, which represents approximately 80% to 85% of all lung cancers.
EGFR is a receptor tyrosine kinase, or RTK, that normally functions to trigger cell division when growth factors bind to the receptor. Oncogenic mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain can induce growth factor independent activation of EGFR, resulting in uncontrolled cell growth and proliferation. Ultimately, these aberrant signals can contribute to the development of NSCLC. EGFR mutations are present in approximately 15% to 25% of U.S. and Western European NSCLC patients and approximately 30% to 50% of Asian NSCLC patients. Given its important role and prevalence in cancer, mutant EGFR is a critical target in lung cancer therapy. Exon 19 deletion and exon 21 L858R substitution mutations, collectively referred to as classical EGFR mutations, are the most common and account for over 75% of EGFR mutations in NSCLC. Multiple EGFR inhibitors, including gefitinib, erlotinib, afatinib, and osimertinib, target these common mutations and have been approved as first-line therapies, thus validating mutant EGFR as a target for the treatment of NSCLC.

 Exon 20 insertions, which account for 7% to 13% of all EGFR mutations in NSCLC patients, are the most prevalent after the classical EGFR mutations. We estimate an incidence of approximately 2,000 to 5,000 NSCLC patients in the U.S. and approximately 1,000 to 3,000 patients in France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and the United Kingdom with EGFRex20ins mutations. Preclinical studies have shown that exon 20 insertions, as well as classical EGFR mutations, have the characteristics of oncogenic driver mutations, which are responsible for both tumorigenesis and the progression of cancer. However, in contrast to classical EGFR mutations, exon 20 insertions do not sensitize the kinase domain to treatment with approved EGFR inhibitors.
Currently, there are two targeted therapies with accelerated approval for NSCLC patients with EGFRex20ins mutations whose disease has progressed on or after platinum-based chemotherapy: amivantamab-vmjw (Rybrevant) and mobocertinib (Exkivity). Despite these accelerated approvals, we believe significant unmet need remains for NSCLC patients with EGFRex20ins mutations. Specifically, we believe there is an opportunity for an oral therapy with strong selectivity for mutant vs. wild type EGFR, which could potentially lead to an improved safety and tolerability profile, especially with respect to treatment related adverse events such as rash, diarrhea, and infusion site reactions, as well as cardiovascular events.
CLN-081
CLN-081 is a small molecule that was designed as an irreversible EGFR inhibitor with a novel pyrrolopyrimidine scaffold, which is unique among the therapies in development that are targeting EGFRex20ins mutations. CLN-081 is designed to fit into the ATP-binding site of EGFR where it covalently modifies C797, thereby forming a durable drug-protein linkage that irreversibly inhibits the mutant receptor. In preclinical studies, CLN-081 demonstrated high selectivity and inhibition of EGFR in cells expressing mutant EGFR proteins, with substantially less inhibition in cells expressing wild type EGFR.
The selectivity index of CLN-081 versus competing EGFR inhibitors was evaluated in vitro as measured by the ratio of the half-maximal growth inhibition, or IC50, value of cells expressing wild type EGFR versus cells expressing exon 20 insertion mutant EGFR. As shown below, CLN-081 demonstrated the highest selectivity index among a panel of EGFR targeted therapies, suggesting that CLN-081 may be capable of achieving clinically relevant inhibition of EGFR with exon 20 insertion mutations with relative sparing of wild type EGFR.
CLN-081 Demonstrated Superior Selectivity
Across Multiple EGFRex20ins Mutations

   Preclinical Data
Multiple preclinical studies, including IND-enabling studies, of CLN-081 have been completed, which supported the submission and acceptance of our IND by the FDA in the second quarter of 2019. In vivo activity of CLN-081 was evaluated in multiple EGFRex20ins mutation-driven tumor models, including three of the most common insertion mutations as shown in the figure below. In all three mouse models, doses of 200 milligrams per kilogram, or mpk, of CLN-081 achieved persistent tumor regression with no body weight loss over five percent. In comparison, 20mpk of afatinib induced only modest tumor growth inhibition in these models. The results of these common insertion mutation models are summarized below.

 In another preclinical study, the antitumor activity and impact on body weight of CLN-081 was compared to that of poziotinib, which, at the time, was the most advanced EGFRex20ins inhibitor in clinical development. Antitumor activity and body weight change were measured in mice bearing a xenografts tumor as shown below. Comparable tumor growth suppression was observed in the mice treated with 1mpk of poziotinib as those treated with 100mpk of CLN-081. Notably, poziotinib treatment led to body weight loss in all mice. In contrast, mice treated with CLN-081 with doses up to 200mpk showed no significant body weight loss. We believe these results illustrate the potential selectivity and potential therapeutic window for CLN-081.

  Clinical Development
We initiated our ongoing Phase 1/2a trial of CLN-081 in the fourth quarter of 2019. This first-in-human, open-label, multi-center trial is designed to evaluate the safety and tolerability, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and preliminary efficacy of CLN-081 in adult NSCLC patients with EGFRex20ins mutations. The trial included two major components: dose escalation and cohort expansion. Dose escalation began with a single patient accelerated titration design, and transitioned to 3+3 decision rules upon the first occurrence of a Grade 2 or greater TRAE, which occurred at the 100 mg BID dose level. This trial had a flexible, adaptive design that allowed for further expansion of any given cohort at the discretion of the Sponsor gated by acceptable safety and pre-specified efficacy criteria. Cohorts could be expanded to 6, then 13, then 36 patients gated by these criteria. We expanded cohorts at the 65, 100, and the 150 mg BID dose levels, including enrollment up to the maximum of 36 patients at the 100 mg BID dose level which has been completed. Although we expanded enrollment at 150 mg BID dose level, we subsequently discontinued enrollment after 11 patients had been enrolled, based on assessment of the overall clinical profile at this dose level. We have enrolled patients across sites in the U.S., the Netherlands, Singapore, Hong Kong, and Taiwan, and we plan to initiate additional sites, including in China.

As of December 2021, 73 patients across five dose escalation cohorts, including cohorts at 30, 45, 65, 100, and 150 mg BID dose levels, received at least one dose of CLN-081. The patient population in our trial is heavily pre-treated, with a median of two prior systemic therapies and 66% of patients having received two or more prior therapies at study entry (i.e. 3rd line of therapy or greater). Further, 37% of patients have received prior treatment with an EGFR inhibitor, including 5% that have received prior treatment with poziotinib or Exkivity, that target Exon20ins mutations. Over half (53%) of the patients received prior treatment with a checkpoint inhibitor.
Safety and Pharmacokinetic Data
The following table provides a summary of treatment related safety and tolerability events, including rash and diarrhea, which are toxicities related to inhibition of WT EGFR, as well as laboratory abnormalities including anemia and transaminase elevations across the 100 mg and 150 mg BID dose levels for comparison, as well as the overall safety population in our ongoing Phase 1/2a trial. We believe that this safety and tolerability profile compares favorably to other EGFR exon 20 inhibitors, in particular with respect to the incidence and severity of diarrhea.
 


In the 39 safety evaluable patients who have been treated at the dose of 100 mg BID, no patients have experienced Grade 3 or greater treatment related rash or diarrhea. At this dose level, 72% and 34% of patients have experienced treatment-related rash and diarrhea, respectively, of either Grade 1 or 2 severity; however, the ratio of patients who experience Grade 1 versus Grade 2 events is approximately 3:1 for both rash and diarrhea. Both events have been manageable with conventional supportive care, and implementation of systematic GI prophylaxis has not been required for diarrhea management. As has been seen with other EGFR TKI, a case of G3 treatment-related pneumonitis has been observed at this dose, although the patient had recent treatment with checkpoint inhibitor therapy and the concurrent presence of a significant hydropneumothorax, not related to treatment, in the contralateral lung.
Key observations in 11 safety evaluable patients at the 150 mg BID dose level included treatment-related Grade 3 diarrhea in two patients, Grade 3 rash in one patient, and two patients with Grade 3 and Grade 4 transaminitis. In addition, one patient who was off treatment with CLN-081 for more than three weeks because of progressive disease was reported as having G3 treatment-related pneumonitis; the patient had a concurrent Pneumocystis jiroveci infection. In addition, an increase in rates of dose reduction and dose discontinuation were observed among patients treated at the 150 mg BID compared to the 100 mg BID dose level. These observations informed our decision to discontinue further enrollment of patients at 150 mg BID, after 11 patients.
 Preliminary pharmacokinetic, or PK, data demonstrated a near dose-dependent trend in exposure, as measured by unbound area under the curve, or AUC, and Cmax values. Furthermore, the target unbound AUC required to achieve tumor regression in preclinical studies was reached starting at the initial dose of 30 mg BID. Notable features of the CLN-081 PK profile include sustained PK exposure over GI50 for EGFRex20ins mutations for eight hours post dose, limited interpatient heterogeneity and limited exposure above the GI50 for WT EGFR at doses at or below 100 mg BID. Consistent with the clinical safety profile at 100 mg BID dose compared with the 150 mg BID dose, at the 150mg BID dose, we observed CLN-081 concentrations above WT EGFR GI50 ratios for approximately four hours.
 Efficacy Data
 The following table summarizes best response characteristics for response-evaluable patients treated at the 100 mg BID (N=36) and 150 mg BID (N=11) BID dose levels as well as the overall population across dose levels in aggregate (N=70) as of a December 13, 2021 data cutoff. Among patients treated at 100 mg BID at the data cutoff, 14 patients achieved a confirmed response, indicating a 39% confirmed overall response rate (cORR). This cORR was higher than the 27% cORR among 11 patients at the 150mg BID dose cohort. At the 100mg BID dose cohort, 35 of 36 (97%) patients experienced a best response of stable disease or partial response, including confirmed or unconfirmed responses.
 

Below are additional efficacy analyses for the 36 patients treated at the 100mg BID dose cohort, including a swimmer’s chart (A), a waterfall chart with percentage best change from baseline (B), and a spider plot with percentage change in target lesions over time (C). We have also included estimated response duration and progression free survival from patients treated in the Phase 1 cohort (n=13) at 100mg BID (D). Patients in the trial have their initial tumor imaging performed after approximately six weeks of treatment, and then every nine weeks thereafter. Based on these analyses, we believe that CLN-081 has shown substantial antitumor activity with broad EGFR exon 20 variant coverage; a rapid onset of action; and encouraging response quality as measured by duration of response and progression-free survival.

CLN-049
Our second clinical-stage oncology product candidate, CLN-049, is a humanized bispecific antibody that we are developing for the treatment of AML. We are currently evaluating CLN-049 in a clinical trial in adult patients with r/r AML. CLN-049 is designed to simultaneously bind to FLT3 on the extracellular domain of target leukemic cells and to CD3 on T cells, triggering the T cells to kill the target cancer cells. FLT3 is a validated proto-oncogene and several kinase inhibitors targeting mutant FLT3 are approved for the treatment of r/r AML, but are limited to approximately 25% of the AML population with FLT3 mutations. By targeting FLT3 on the extracellular domain, CLN-049 has the potential to address up to approximately 80% of AML patients. Preclinically, we have observed that CLN-049 led to highly potent FLT3-dependent killing of leukemic cells in vitro at a wide range of FLT3 expression levels on AML cells regardless of FLT3 mutational status. In preclinical studies, treatment with CLN-049, even at low doses, led to survival benefit in an AML xenograft model and complete elimination of leukemic blasts in mouse models implanted with AML cell lines or primary patient leukemic cells.
Background on Acute Myeloid Leukemia and FLT3
 The American Cancer Society estimates that, in 2022, there will be approximately 20,000 newly diagnosed patients with AML and approximately 11,500 deaths from AML in the U.S. AML is a complex hematologic malignancy characterized by uncontrolled proliferation of malignant immature myeloid blast cell populations. These blasts may completely infiltrate and replace the bone marrow, resulting in major disruption of normal hematopoiesis and pancytopenia, very high numbers of circulating blasts in the peripheral blood, and infiltration of visceral organs as well as the skin. In addition, patients with AML may be susceptible to bleeding complications due to thrombocytopenia and experience complications from treatment with cytotoxic chemotherapy. These patients may also be severely immuno-compromised secondary to their disease and experience prolonged periods of neutropenia and lymphopenia. As a result, these patients are often susceptible to life-threatening infections that also contribute to severe morbidity and mortality.
Despite advancements in the treatment of AML, there continues to be a high unmet need in these patients. Eligible newly diagnosed patients are typically treated with intensive induction chemotherapy, which may include continuous infusion of cytarabine with an anthracycline, in an attempt to achieve a complete remission. The majority of patients that experience complete remission undergo hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, or HSCT. Despite aggressive first-line combination chemotherapy, the recent approvals of multiple targeted small molecules for molecularly defined AML patient subsets, and the use of HSCT in patients with a suitable matched donor, the prognosis of patients with AML remains extremely poor. Although 60% to 85% of younger adult patients achieve complete remissions, patients older than 60 years of age have inferior complete response rates of 40% to 60%. In addition, approximately 40% of all patients relapse following HSCT.

FLT3, or FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3, is a Class III RTK with a well-recognized and essential role in hematopoiesis. In healthy individuals, expression of FLT3 is restricted to a subpopulation of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells, or HSPCs, inducing their proliferation and differentiation into monocytes, dendritic cells, B cells, and T cells. FLT3 has been identified as a proto-oncogene and plays a key role in promoting leukemic cell proliferation and survival. Several small molecule kinase inhibitors targeting FLT3 mutations are in development or have been approved for the treatment of AML. However, these product candidates and approved therapies only address approximately 25% of AML patients who have intracellular FLT3 genetic mutations but do not address the larger subset of patients with extracellular expression of FLT3 on the surface of cancer cells.
Studies have shown that FLT3 is expressed by FACS staining on AML blasts in approximately 80% of AML patients, regardless of an oncogenic driver mutation. In one study, leukemic bulk cells from 318 newly diagnosed or relapsed AML patients were evaluated for cell surface FLT3 protein expression, and 78% were found positive for FLT3, as shown in the figure below. This broad expression of FLT3 in AML patients suggests that targeting FLT3 with a biologic agent, namely a T cell engaging bispecific antibody that recruits T cells to kill tumor cells expressing FLT3 on the cell surface, could address a larger AML patient population than the targeted small molecule inhibitors targeting mutated version of the intracellular signaling domain of FLT3 that are approved or in development. Compared to other tumor surface antigens identified in AML, such as CD33 and CD123, FLT3 expression is generally restricted to a subpopulation of bone marrow HSPCs and circulating dendritic cells. FLT3 plays a key role in driving leukemogenesis and malignant progression of AML, promoting leukemic cell proliferation and survival. We believe that the expression of FLT3 on the surface of leukemic blasts in most AML patients and its role as a known oncogenic driver make it an attractive therapeutic target for a T cell engager approach.
Approximately 80% of AML Patients Show Positive Cell Surface FLT3 Protein Expression
   
CLN-049
CLN-049 is a humanized bispecific antibody construct comprised of two FLT3-binding domains, an Fc-silenced humanized IgG1 backbone, and CD3-binding single-chain Fv domains, or scFvs, fused to the C-terminus of the antibody’s heavy chain. In multiple preclinical studies, CLN-049 has demonstrated the ability to redirect T cells to lyse FLT3-expressing AML cells in vitro and potent antitumor activity in vivo. By targeting extracellular FLT3, regardless of mutant or wild type status, we believe CLN-049 has the potential to address up to approximately 80% of AML patients, a broader patient population than existing small molecule FLT3 kinase inhibitors acting on the intracellular domain, which are limited to a subset of approximately 25% of AML patients with FLT3 mutations.
Preclinical Data
Given the observed variability in FLT3 expression levels among patients, we characterized the killing potential of CLN-049 across multiple cell lines expressing differing levels of FLT3 on the cell surface. As shown in the figures below, CLN-049 was observed to mediate robust target-dependent cell killing in vitro across all AML cell lines tested. Importantly, we observed that the EC50 value, i.e., the drug concentration at which 50% of target cells are killed, was in the sub-nM range and did not seem to be dependent on the number of FLT3 receptor molecules found on AML target cells. In particular, we observed potent target cell killing even when those cells expressed fewer than 100 copies of the FLT3 receptor per cell. We also observed potent redirected lysis of AML cell lines with WT or mutant FLT3 expression. Based on these results, we believe CLN-049 may effectively kill AML target cells with even low levels of FLT3 expression, regardless of WT or mutant origin, which could potentially translate into deeper and more durable responses in the clinic and may allow us to treat a larger subset of AML patients.

FLT3 is not widely expressed on normal immune cells, but rather is restricted to certain hematopoietic stem cell precursors in the bone marrow and dendritic cell subsets in the periphery. As shown in the figure below, a recent study found that the expression level of FLT3 transcript was significantly higher on AML cells compared to normal tissues.

FLT3 Transcript Level is Higher on AML Cells Than on Normal Human Solid Tissues
   
Importantly, we observed that CLN-049 treatment in vitro did not lead to a significant reduction in CD34+ bone marrow cells, as shown in the figure below, supporting our hypothesis that CLN-049 preferentially kills FLT3-expressing leukemic cells while sparing normal cells.
CLN-049 Treatment Did Not Result in Significant Killing of Normal CD34+ Bone Marrow Cells In Vitro
   
 CLN-049 has two CD3-binding arms that can potentially crosslink CD3 on T cells, which may result in target cell-independent T cell activation and systemic cytokine-related toxicities. In preclinical studies, we examined whether CLN-049 can lead to spurious T cell activation in the absence of target cells. As shown below, incubation of purified human T cells with CLN-049 in the absence of target-expressing cells did not induce T cell activation markers CD25 and CD69 on either CD4+ or CD8+ T cells as opposed to positive control anti-CD3 antibodies OKT3 and UCHT1 (CLN-049 parental anti-CD3 antibody) that induced T cell activation.
CLN-049 Did Not Trigger the Upregulation of Activation Marker CD69 On Purified Human CD4+ or
 CD8+ T Cells in the Absence of FLT3 Expressing Target Cells


The potential efficacy of CLN-049 was evaluated in a humanized mouse model where a human AML cell line was implanted systemically. As shown in the figure below, CLN-049 controlled AML leukemic burden in the engrafted human PBMC (DHC23) mice and led to the extension of the animals’ survival in a dose-dependent manner. We believe CLN-049 effected this result by redirecting the T cells in the human PBMC population to kill the target AML cells.
Dose-dependent Effect of CLN-049 on the Survival of Mice with Disseminated Leukemic AML Cells


 The anti-leukemic activity of CLN-049 was also evaluated using patient-derived AML blasts and PBMCs in a disseminated humanized mouse model. As shown in the figure below, treatment with CLN-049 resulted in a significant reduction in the overall leukemic burden in the bone marrow of both the primary AML blast (left panel) and ALL blast model (right panel). In contrast, a control T cell engaging bispecific antibody having the same format as CLN-049 but containing a non-specific target-binding domain did not impact the leukemic burden as compared to untreated control.
CLN-049 Demonstrated Anti-Leukemic Activity in Humanized Mouse Models with Primary AML and ALL Cells

   
To further evaluate the safety of CLN-049 in vivo, CLN-049 was administered in a humanized mouse model inoculated with human PBMC. This study was specifically designed to test possible off-target effects of CLN-049. As shown in the figure below, the administration of CLN-049 did not cause meaningful body weight loss in the treated mice, with the overall body weight profiles being comparable to those of the control group. In contrast, administration of a bivalent cross-linking anti-CD3 antibody, the parental CD3 antibody UCHT1 from which the scFv domains of CLN-049 were derived, led to significant body weight loss (left panel) and the release of the cytokine interferon gamma in serum (right panel), as shown below.

Effect of CLN-049 on Body Weight and Cytokine Release in Humanized Mice

   
This result further supports our hypothesis that, in vivo, the two CD3 binding domains in CLN-049 cannot cross-link CD3 and therefore CLN-049 does not activate T cells in the absence of human FLT3-expressing target cells.
In December 2021, we initiated a Phase 1 clinical trial evaluating a single ascending dose of CLN-049 in r/r AML patients. The study is designed to primarily evaluate the PK and safety of the intravenous administration of CLN-049.
CLN-619
Our third clinical stage product candidate, CLN-619, is a MICA/B-targeted, humanized IgG1 monoclonal antibody that we intend to initially develop for the treatment of solid tumors. CLN-619 was designed to promote an antitumor response through multiple mechanisms of action, including inhibition of MICA/B shedding, ADCC mediation, enhancement of NKG2D receptor binding, and prevention of decoy NKG2D by shed MICA/B. The MICA/B receptor, NKG2D, is expressed in both innate and adaptive immune cell populations. Although several companies have disclosed preclinical MICA/B targeting programs, we are unaware of any clinical stage, antibody-based programs engaging this target, implying CLN-619 has first-in-class potential. In multiple in vivo preclinical tumor models, CLN-619 administration as a single agent was associated with antitumor activity and reduced levels of serum MICA/B.
We believe CLN-619 has the potential to become a novel backbone agent for immuno-oncology therapy given the broad expression of MICA/B across tumor types and the biological rationale for combining CLN-619 with other agents. We are currently evaluating CLN-619 in an ongoing clinical trial for patients with advanced solid tumors. The trial design includes parallel evaluation of CLN-619 as a monotherapy and in combination with checkpoint inhibitor therapy modules.
Background on NKG2D and MICA/B
NKG2D is a key activating receptor on NK cells responsible for cytolysis upon binding to ligands expressed on target cells. NKG2D is also expressed on other types of immune cells, including CD8+ ß T cells, natural killer T, or NKT, cells, and T cells, and can prime such cells for activation and enhance their antitumor activity as a co-activating receptor. Healthy cells do not normally express ligands of NKG2D, but will do so in response to cellular stress, such as oxygen or nutrient deprivation, radiation, viral infection, or oncogenic transformation. As illustrated below, there are eight NKG2D ligands in humans: MICA and MICB; UL16 binding protein, or ULBP 1, 2, and 3; and Retinoic Acid Early Transcript, or RAET, 1E, 1G, and 1L (also known as ULBP 4, 5, and 6). All NKG2D ligands comprise an 12 extracellular major histocompatibility complex, or MHC, Class I-like superdomain that functionally interacts with the homo-dimeric NKG2D receptor.
Overview of NKG2D Ligands



MICA/B proteins are broadly recognized by NK cells,  T cells, and CD8+ ß T cells via the NKG2D receptor. The engagement between the NKG2D receptor and MICA/B proteins triggers the effector cytolytic responses of NK cells and  T cells against tumor cells expressing MICA/B. In the case of CD8+ ß T cells, effector responses mediated by the T cell receptor are enhanced by NKG2D-MICA/B interactions. NKG2D-mediated stimulation also results in the induction of cytokines, which further promotes the recruitment and the proliferation of immune cells and bolsters the immune response.
 To evade potential cytotoxic destruction by NK cells and T cells, tumor cells expressing MICA/B have adopted shedding of MICA/B from their cell surface as a key evasion mechanism. The MICA/B alpha-3 domain contains a stretch of amino acids that allows for protease cleavage of an extracellular portion of MICA/B and subsequent release from the cell surface, thereby reducing the ability of MICA/B to interact with NKG2D and resulting in decreased NKG2D-mediated killing of tumor cells. This mechanism also concomitantly increases the amount of circulating serum MICA/B, or sMICA/B. Soluble NKG2D ligands have also been shown to contribute to an immunosuppressive microenvironment. The mechanisms underlying this biology are illustrated below. Below, Panel A shows the normal mechanism by which tumor-associated ligands of NKG2D, such as MICA/B, can induce tumor cell killing. Panel B shows how tumor cells, through the proteolytic cleavage of MICA/B, can escape immune surveillance and immune cell-mediated killing.

Role of NKG2D Ligands, MICA/B, in Immune Cell-Mediated Killing of Tumor Cells
      
Panel A | Panel B

    
Given that proteolytic shedding of NKG2D ligands is an important immune escape mechanism, soluble levels of NKG2D ligands, such as sMICA, in a patient’s serum may serve as an important indicator of prognosis. Several studies have shown that cancer patients with high levels of sMICA have a significantly worse prognosis than those patients with low levels of sMICA. The prognostic role of sMICA has been observed across patients with multiple distinct tumor types, including melanoma, NSCLC, pancreatic cancer, colorectal cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, and multiple myeloma. Across 19 studies that included more than 2,500 patients, a meta-analysis showed that high sMICA levels were associated with poor prognosis of patients with high statistical significance.
Conversely, multiple studies have shown that the levels of sMICA in healthy individuals are low, usually less than 100 pg/mL, as compared to cancer patients who have high levels of sMICA that can exceed 1,000 pg/mL. However, in the majority of cancer patients, sMICA levels are usually between 100 to 1,000 pg/mL, as shown in the figure below. This data suggests that levels of sMICA/B in a patient’s serum may have the potential to be used as a biomarker to evaluate the therapeutic effectiveness of antibodies designed to block proteolytic cleavage of MICA/B from the tumor cell surface.
In the figure below, Panel A compares the levels of sMICA in normal healthy individuals to those with benign disease and those with cancer. Panel B shows sMICA levels in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma, or HCC, induced by hepatitis B virus, or HBV, relative to healthy controls. Panel C shows sMICA levels in healthy controls, or HC, compared to patients with chronic hepatitis, or CH, liver cirrhosis, or LC, or HCC.

Three Independent Studies Demonstrate Elevated Levels of sMICA in Cancer Patients
   
Panel A | Panel B | Panel C

 In a study of 60 patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma and different serum levels of MICA, patients in the high serum MICA level group (>1 ng/ml) exhibited poorer survival than patients in the low serum MICA group (1 ng/ml). The results suggest that higher serum MICA levels relate to poor prognosis in advanced hepatocellular carcinoma.

 An analysis of the expression of the NKG2D ligands in The Cancer Genome Atlas, or TCGA, shows that MICA and MICB are the two ligands for NKG2D that are most frequently expressed across a wide range of tumor types. In the results of the TCGA analysis shown below, the red shading indicates high expression levels of NKG2D ligands and blue shading indicates low expression levels. We believe the positive expression profile of MICA/B in many tumor types provides attractive development opportunities across a wide range of indications.

 CLN-619
CLN-619 is a MICA/B-targeted humanized IgG1 antibody with an antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity-, or ADCC-, competent Fc gamma 1 domain capable of mediating effector cell functions through binding to Fc gamma receptors on cytotoxic innate immune cells.
We believe CLN-619 may affect antitumor activity through a multi-pronged mechanism of action. First, we believe that CLN-619 may shield the proteolytic cleavage sites of MICA and MICB on cancer cells from proteases commonly found in the tumor microenvironment (noted as “1” in the figure below). This mechanism would enable the accumulation of MICA/B on the surface of cancer cells and the reduction of shed soluble MICA/B circulating in the serum. In preclinical studies, treatment with parental CLN-619 clones resulted in increased cell surface expression and reduced serum levels of MICA/B in various tumor cell lines, while CLN-619 treatment in vivo led to reduced serum levels of MICA/B. Elevated expression of MICA/B on the surface of cancer cells is expected to enhance killing of cancer cells by NK cells via binding of their NKG2D to MICA/B. MICA/B also interacts with NKG2D expressed on gamma delta T cells and NKT cells, where NKG2D can play the role of a co-activating receptor, lowering the threshold for T cell-mediated cancer cell lysis. Second, CLN-619 has a human IgG1 backbone with a wild-type Fc gamma domain, which allows it to engage NK cells by binding to their Fc gamma receptor III/CD16/A, leading to ADCC (noted as “2” in the figure below). In preclinical studies, treatment with CLN-049 was shown to induce ADCC in vitro. Third, our preliminary preclinical data suggests that CLN-619 may have the potential to enhance the binding of MICA/B to NKG2D receptors on NK cells or other immune cells to provide for improved cancer cell lysis (noted as “3” in the figure below). Finally, by preventing the shedding of MICA/B, CLN-619 can potentially prevent the decoy of NKG2D by shed MICA/B circulating in serum (noted as “4” in the figure below). We believe that all of these mechanisms may be acting in a coordinated and unique manner to engage NK cells, which could result in the cancer cell lysis observed in the preclinical studies described below.
Three CLN-619 Modes of Action


Preclinical Data
The key mechanistic underpinning of CLN-619’s antitumor activity is its ability to stabilize and prevent the shedding of MICA/B expressed on the surface of cancer cells. In preclinical studies, CLN-619 prevented shedding across a variety of cancer cell lines. In a representative hepatoma PLC/PRF/5 cell line, soluble MICA in the supernatant decreased, and correspondingly, surface MICA levels increased, in a dose-dependent manner, following treatment with CLN-619. CLN-619 was more potent than other antibody candidates (Ab1 and Ab2) in preventing MICA shedding as shown in the figure below.
Parental Clone of CLN-619 Reduced Serum MICA and Increased Surface MICA Levels in Hepatoma
PLC/PRF/5 Cell Lines


 CLN-619 also demonstrated the ability to enhance NK cell-mediated killing of MICA/B expressing cancer cells in vitro. In an ADCC reporter bioassay, the parental clone of CLN-619, which has antibody variable region sequences from a mouse hybridoma from which CLN-619 was derived, induced ADCC in a dose-dependent and MICA/B binding-dependent manner, as shown in the figure below, where killing activity was measured by the relative luminescence units, or RLU. Such ADCC activity was abrogated when mutations in the Fc region were introduced into h3F9-DANA, which eliminated the binding to FcRIIIa on NK cells that is key to mediating ADCC. An isotype control also failed to trigger ADCC, demonstrating the requirement of MICA/B target engagement.
Parental Clone of CLN-619 Induced ADCC In Vitro
      In an in vitro assay using human NK-92 cells and PLC/PRF/5 cancer cells, the parental clone of CLN-619 enhanced the killing of MICA/B-specific cancer cells by NK cells. As shown in the figure below, the parental clone of CLN-619, at both low and high effector to target, or E:T, ratios, significantly enhanced the extent of target cell killing compared to a control antibody.
In Vitro Assay Using Human NK-92 Cells and PLC/PRF/5 Cancer Cells
       The antitumor activity of CLN-619 was further evaluated in multiple mouse tumor models. In a representative PLC/PRF/5 liver cancer xenograft model, CLN-619 treatment as a single agent resulted in tumor regression at all doses tested, as shown in the left panel of the figure below. In addition, the body weight profiles of treatment groups were comparable to the control group. Importantly, near complete suppression of MICA shedding as measured by soluble MICA levels in the serum was observed, as shown in the right panel of the figure below.

Similarly, in a representative lung cancer xenograft model, CLN-619 treatment as a single agent resulted in tumor growth inhibition at all doses tested, as shown in the left panel of the figure below. We also observed near complete suppression of MICA shedding at all doses tested as measured by soluble MICA serum levels, as shown in the right panel of the figure below.

 Clinical Development Plan
We are currently evaluating CLN-619 in a clinical trial in patients with advanced solid tumors. The trial design includes initial evaluation of CLN-619 as a monotherapy and in combination with checkpoint inhibitor therapy in dose escalation cohorts. Upon establishing a recommended phase 2 dose, or RP2D, the trial design includes several expansion cohorts to evaluate the preliminary efficacy of CLN-619 as both a monotherapy and in combination with checkpoint inhibitor therapy in patients with multiple solid tumor types. In addition, we will collect and analyze biomarkers, including sMICA, to inform the future development of CLN-619.
 CLN-617
CLN-617 is a fusion protein uniquely combining, in a single agent, two potent antitumor cytokines, IL-2 and IL-12, with a collagen-binding domain for the treatment of solid tumors. The combination of IL-2 and IL-12 therapeutic administration has previously been shown to synergistically enhance T and NK cell functions in vitro and mediated pronounced therapeutic activity in preclinical tumor models, even in well-established mouse models with primary and/or metastatic tumors. For nearly five decades, clinical researchers have studied the powerful role cytokines play in stimulating an immune response to cancer. However, severe toxicities associated with systemic cytokine administration and a short serum half-life have hindered their clinical development and broader commercial uptake. Despite numerous advancements in protein engineering, delivery and targeting mechanisms, there are currently only two FDA-approved cytokine-based cancer therapies, with the most recent approval occurring over twenty years ago.
We have included multiple differentiating features in CLN-617’s design in order to address the historical limitations of cytokine-based therapy. First, the structure of CLN-617 contains a collagen-binding domain that is designed to enable the retention of cytokines in the local tumor microenvironment following intratumoral administration. Collagen binding may help minimize the systemic dissemination and associated toxicities of IL-2 and IL-12 and prolong their immunostimulatory antitumor activity. Second, we believe that CLN-617 is the only product candidate to our knowledge that co-delivers IL-2 and IL-12 proteins, functionally enabling synergistic T and NK cell activation. Third, CLN-617’s construct uses wild type cytokines, which potentially reduces immunogenicity risk associated with engineered cytokines. Finally, unlike other intratumoral cytokine-based therapies, CLN-617 does not rely on viral or nucleic acid for in situ expression and activity.
In preclinical studies, murine surrogates of CLN-617 demonstrated robust single agent antitumor activity in both injected and non-injected contralateral tumors without inducing systemic toxicity, as measured by reduction in body weight. Given the broad expression of collagen across multiple tumor types and the well-validated antitumor activity of cytokine-based therapies, we believe CLN-617 may have utility across a broad range of solid tumors. We believe that CLN-617 is a first-in-class opportunity given it is the only anti-cancer product candidate we are aware of that is designed to co-deliver IL-2 and IL-12 cytokines and retain them in the tumor microenvironment. We are currently advancing CLN-617 through IND-enabling studies and expect to submit an IND by the end of the first half of 2023.
The collagen-binding retention technology used in CLN-617 is based on technology that originated in the laboratory of Professor Dane Wittrup at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, or MIT. We have further developed and refined this technology to create our AMBER platform, which we believe represents a novel platform with the potential to broaden the therapeutic window of cytokines and other immunostimulatory agents, with substantially reduced systemic toxicity.

Preclinical Data
 We have generated a variety of multifunctional AMBER-based constructs containing both IL-2 and IL-12 fused to various collagen-binding domains, and we refer to the murine surrogates of these constructs as AMBER-m1, AMBER-m2, AMBER-m3, AMBER-m4, etc. While Professor Wittrup’s foundational study focused on lumican, we evaluated collagen-binding domains with different affinities including other proteins that bind to collagen in the tumor microenvironment to enhance retention of the cytokines.
Our murine surrogate AMBER constructs have been assessed for productivity, product quality, and bioactivity. We tested the bioactivity of both IL-2 and IL-12 cytokines by measuring proliferation of respective cell lines in response to IL-2 and IL-12. We compared our constructs with collagen-binding domains to native cytokines in the presence and absence of collagen. As shown below, cytokine activity, measured by optical density, or OD, is maintained in the multifunctional AMBER-m1 and AMBER-m2 constructs and activity is comparable in both the absence and presence of collagen.
In AMBER Constructs, Cytokine Activity Was Fully Retained after Fusion to Collagen-Binding Domain


 Based on these results, we further assessed the antitumor activity and tolerability of AMBER-m2 in vivo in C57BL/6 mice bearing B16F10 tumors. We compared intratumoral administration of AMBER-m2 to a combination of MSA-IL2 and IL12-MSA, which lack collagen-binding domains. As expected, treatment with MSA-IL2 and IL12-MSA led to systemic toxicity, as measured by reduction in body weight (left panel of figure below). In contrast, AMBER-m2 exhibited single-agent antitumor activity without inducing systemic toxicity, as measured by survival (right panel of figure below). Based on these results, we believe that AMBER-m2, which is presumably retained in the tumor microenvironment, may have the potential to mitigate the systemic toxicity associated with IL-2 and IL-12 therapy, thus potentially improving the therapeutic index while delivering antitumor activity.

Antitumor Activity and Tolerability of MSA-IL2 + IL12-MSA or AMBER


In the experiments above, body weight changes are no longer recorded following animal death, accounting for the difference in days duration between the left and right figures for the MSA-IL2 + IL12-MSA treated animals.
 We hypothesized that in addition to mediating local antitumor activity, AMBER-m2 may be capable of generating responses against non-injected contralateral tumors due to the induction of systemic immunity, also known as an abscopal effect. To test our hypothesis, we utilized C57BL/6 mice bearing two B16F10 tumors: an ipsilateral tumor that was directly injected with AMBER-m2 and a contralateral tumor that was implanted 10 days later and never treated with AMBER-m2. Tumor control was observed in both the treated and untreated distal tumors, thus demonstrating an abscopal effect.
AMBER-m2 Inhibits Tumor Growth in Both Injected (Ipsilateral) and Uninjected (Contralateral)
B16F10 Tumors, Providing Evidence for an Abscopal Effect
      
We have also evaluated the dose responsiveness of AMBER-m2 in the B16F10 model. Increasing dose levels of AMBER-m2 led to increased tumor growth control (left panel of figure below), and all doses did so without inducing significant body weight loss (right panel of figure below). Notably, the highest tested dose of 1,000 pmol is an equivalent dose of 6.4 mpk of body weight, which translates to 0.7 mpk of IL-2 and 2.3 mpk of IL-12. In comparison, only 100 pmol of MSA-IL2 and IL12-MSA led to lethal body weight loss.

Impact of AMBER-m2 on Tumor Growth and Body Weight in the B16F10 Model
      
We have also evaluated our AMBER murine constructs in the CT26 and MC38 syngeneic mouse models. As shown in the left panel below, treatment with AMBER-m4 led to statistically significant survival increases relative to control and anti-PD1 arms in the MC38 model. Subsequently, we re-injected tumors into animals that achieved a complete response following treatment with AMBER-m4. As shown in the right panel below, nine out of ten mice previously treated with AMBER-m4 rejected the newly injected tumors. Similar results were achieved in the CT26 syngeneic model.
 Impact of AMBER-m4 on Survival and Tumor Re-Challenge in the MC38 Model
 


In addition, preclinical results show the synergistic effect of combining a checkpoint inhibitor with AMBER murine constructs. Below is an example of combination treatment with anti-PD1 and one of our AMBER constructs in the MC38 model.

Impact of AMBER-m2 as Monotherapy or in Combination
with Anti-PD1 on Tumor Growth in the MC38 Model

Based on the results of our preclinical studies, we believe that the inclusion of a collagen-binding domain by our AMBER platform has the potential to allow for the safe retention of high levels of cytokines in the tumor microenvironment. While remarkable progress has been made in the treatment of cancer with the adoption of checkpoint inhibitors, including pembrolizumab, ipilimumab, and nivolumab, only a fraction of patients with solid tumors respond to these therapies. We believe a well-tolerated agent that can deliver the functional synergies of IL-2 and IL-12 has the potential to treat a broad range of solid tumors, including those that are not responsive to checkpoint inhibitors.
 CLN-978
CLN-978 is a half-life extended, humanized, single-chain bispecific antibody designed to simultaneously engage CD19 on cancer cells and CD3 on T cells, triggering redirected T cells to lyse the target cancer cells. In addition, CLN-978 has a human serum albumin, or HSA, binding domain designed to prolong its serum half-life. CLN-978, referred to as NexGem in the figures below, mediated CD19-dependent target cell lysis in vitro on target cell lines with a range of CD19 target expression levels. In preclinical in vivo studies, treatment with NexGem, at extremely low and infrequent doses, led to inhibition of tumor growth and tumor regression in a human CD3 transgenic syngeneic lymphoma mouse model. We intend to initially evaluate CLN-978 as a novel treatment for B-cell malignancies, and are currently undertaking IND-enabling pharmacology, pharmacokinetic, and safety studies.
We designed CLN-978 based on a BiTE-like format using tandemly arranged scFvs for CD19 and CD3, similar to blinatumomab. In addition, we incorporated a third domain in the form of a single-domain antibody, or VHH, for binding to HSA. We believe that binding of CLN-978 to albumin has the potential to extend its serum half-life, potentially addressing limitations related to blinatumomab’s dosing regimen. An illustration of the CLN-978 structure is shown in the following figure.
Design of CLN-978, a CD19/CD3-bispecific T Cell Engager with Extended Serum Half-life
      

 We have collaborated with Adimab LLC to generate antibody-derived binding domains specific for CD19, CD3, and HSA with optimized biophysical and biochemical properties, tailored binding affinities as well as other parameters that are key to developability, manufacturability and preclinical testing of drug candidates. In multiple head-to-head preclinical comparison studies, NexGem has demonstrated improved activity compared to blinatumomab both in terms of redirecting of T cells to lyse CD19-expressing cells in vitro and enhanced tumor growth inhibition in vivo. Although comparative data from preclinical studies must be interpreted with caution and we may not observe the same differential effect in clinical trials, we believe these preclinical results support further evaluation of CLN-978 for its potential to improve upon the clinical efficacy observed with blinatumomab and for its potential to offer a more convenient dosing profile. In addition to convenience, we believe the ability to target cells with low CD19 expression would potentially enable us to address patients that are not yet adequately addressed by blinatumomab, such as those with CD19-low non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma or those patients that progress following CAR-T therapy.
We expect the properties of CLN-978 may facilitate our efforts on manufacturing processes and IND-enabling studies, as we believe they will enable us to leverage standard cell line development and purification technologies for GMP manufacturing and conventional non-human primate models for GLP toxicology assessment. We are currently advancing CLN-978 through IND-enabling studies and expect to submit an IND by the end of the first half of 2023.
  Preclinical Data
Our NexGem candidates incorporate a CD19 binding domain that was engineered to achieve 100x enhanced binding affinity to CD19 compared to blinatumomab as measured using plasmon resonance, which we believe may contribute to improved cytolytic potency in an in vitro model. As shown in the figure below, NexGem outperformed blinatumomab in the cell lines evaluated as measured by both the EC50 value of redirected cell lysis and the maximum percentage of lysis. Notably, the relative improvement in cytolytic potency of CLN-978 as compared to blinatumomab was the highest in target cells expressing relatively low levels of CD19. We believe this observation supports our hypothesis that CLN-978 may have the potential to more adequately address the patient population with lower levels of CD19 expression and/or patients in which CD19 expression is downregulated as a resistance mechanism to CD19-targeted therapies. It was also shown that the robust lysis of target cells was dependent on CD19 expression, as the EMT6 parental cell line, which lacks CD19 expression, was not susceptible to lysis at any of the drug concentrations tested.
Comparison of NexGem Versus Blinatumomab in vitro Cytotoxicity Assays
      
NexGem has also demonstrated antitumor activity in vivo compared to blinatumomab in a human CD3 transgenic model, where the mice were implanted with a syngeneic tumor engineered to express human CD19. As shown in the figure below, NexGem outperformed blinatumomab in tumor growth inhibition at every dose level tested. Furthermore, at the 0.1 mg/kg dose level, NexGem treatment resulted in a complete response in 40% of mice compared to only 10% of mice treated with blinatumomab.

       Our Other Preclinical Programs
In addition to the programs described above, we are actively developing three additional preclinical oncology programs: Jade, Opal and a discovery collaboration with Mt Sinai to develop HPK1 degraders.
We are developing our Jade program as part of an ongoing collaboration with the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, a world leader in finding self-reactive, human T cells of high affinity. Our goal is to develop a TCR-T cell therapy targeting a novel senescence and cancer-related protein. We are collaborating with Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center to search for and optimize naturally occurring TCRs against this target.
For our Opal program, we are exploring a construct that combines checkpoint inhibition and immune co-stimulatory receptor activation in a single protein. We are evaluating various single-chain fusion protein formats using an affinity optimized PD-1 extracellular domain and a single-chain 4-1BBL designed to preferentially activate the 4-IBB/CD137 pathway on T cells inside tumors. We believe that the combination of these natural binding elements could potentially drive synergistic antitumor immune mobilization while reducing the toxicity often associated with untargeted co-stimulatory immune agonists. We are designing our lead construct such that the activation of the co-stimulatory receptor is dependent on the binding to immune checkpoint ligands, which have generally higher expression levels in tumor tissues compared to normal tissues. We also believe that our approach has the potential to demonstrate advantages over antibody-based bispecific constructs that typically require selection of format specific epitopes and appropriate affinities for target binding.
HPK1 (MAP4K1) is a T cell specific kinase that negatively regulates T cell activation and TCR signaling. HPK1-/- T cells produce elevated levels of pro-inflammatory TH1 cytokines, including IFNg, TNFa and CCL3. We are collaborating with Mt. Sinai to optimize and develop HPK1 protein degraders with best- and/or first-in-class potential. We believe that a degrader approach may control tumor growth more effectively compared to inhibiting HPK1 kinase activity. The Mt. Sinai team includes, Dr. Steven Burakoff, who validated HPK1 as an immuno-oncology target and Dr. Jian Jin, an expert in degrader chemistry. We have an exclusive option for any intellectual property that arises from this collaboration.
 Competition
The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by the rapid evolution of technologies and understanding of disease etiology, intense competition and a strong emphasis on intellectual property. We believe that our differentiated business model, approach, scientific capabilities, know-how and experience provide us with competitive advantages. However, we face, and will continue to face, competition from companies focused on more traditional therapeutic modalities, such as small molecule inhibitors. We expect substantial competition from multiple sources, including major pharmaceutical, specialty pharmaceutical, and existing or emerging biotechnology companies, academic research institutions, governmental agencies and public and private research institutions worldwide. Many of our competitors, either alone or through collaborations, have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing approved products than we do. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. These companies also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel, establishing clinical trial sites and recruiting patients in clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs. As a result, our competitors may discover, develop, license or commercialize products before or more successfully than we do.

We also face competition more broadly across the oncology market for cost-effective and reimbursable cancer treatments. The most common methods of treating patients with cancer are surgery, radiation and drug therapy, including chemotherapy, hormone therapy, biologic therapy, such as monoclonal and bispecific antibodies, immunotherapy, cell-based therapy and targeted therapy, or a combination of any such methods. There are a variety of available drug therapies marketed for cancer. In many cases, these drugs are administered in combination to enhance efficacy. While our product candidates, if any are approved, may compete with these existing drugs and other therapies, to the extent they are ultimately used in combination with or as an adjunct to these therapies, our product candidates may not be competitive with them. Some of these drugs are branded and subject to patent protection, and others are available on a generic basis. Insurers and other third-party payors may also encourage the use of generic products or specific branded products. As a result, we may face challenges in obtaining market acceptance of, and gaining significant share of the market for, any of our product candidates that we successfully introduce to the market. In addition, many companies are developing new oncology therapeutics, and we cannot predict what the standard of care will be as our product candidates progress through clinical development.
 With respect to our lead product candidate, CLN-081, we are aware of other EGFR inhibitors that have accelerated approval or are in clinical development for the treatment of NSCLC patients harboring EGFRex20ins mutations. In May 2021, Rybrevant (amivantimab), an EGFR/cMET bispecific antibody that was developed and is now marketed by Johnson & Johnson obtained accelerated approval from the FDA for adult patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC with EGFRex20ins mutations whose disease has progressed on or after platinum-based chemotherapy. Additionally, in September 2021, Exkivity (mobocertinib), which was developed and is now marketed by Takeda Pharmaceuticals, Inc., obtained accelerated approval from the FDA for adult patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC with EGFRex20ins mutations whose disease has progressed on or after platinum-based chemotherapy. We believe that the most advanced clinical stage program is DZD9008 from Dizal Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. Other clinical-stage EGFR ex20ins TKI programs include poziotinib from Spectrum Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Black Diamond’s Therapeautics, Inc., BDTX-189, Oric Pharmaceuticals, Inc.’s ORIC-114 (Voronoi, Inc., in People’s Republic of China, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan) and Blueprint Medicine Corporation’s LNG-451.
With respect to CLN-049, we are aware of several companies that are developing bispecifics for the treatment of AML, including those targeting CD3 and CD33 (Amgen Inc., or Amgen and Amphivena Therapeutics, Inc.), CD123 (Macrogenics, Inc. and Xencor, Inc.), and CCL1/CLEC12A (Merus N.V. and Genentech, Inc.). These agents are limited to a subset of AML blasts that express CD33, CD123, and CCL1, whereas multiple published studies have demonstrated that FLT3 is expressed in approximately 80% of AML blasts. Amgen is developing a bispecific T cell engager targeting FLT3 for AML. There are also several targeted small molecule therapies approved for the treatment of r/r or first-line AML, including for AML with FLT3 mutations, such as Astellas Pharma Inc.’s XOSPATA (gilteritinib) and Novartis International AG’s RYDAPT (midostaurin). We are also aware of other small molecules that are approved or in development for AML patients with FLT3 mutations, including IDH inhibitors, such as TIBSOVO (ivosidenib) by Servier Pharmaceuticals and IDHIFA (enasidenib) by Agios Pharmaceuticals, BCL2 inhibitors, such as VENCLEXTA (ventoclax) by AbbVie, and hedgehog pathway inhibitors, such as DAURISMO (glasdegib) by Pfizer.
With respect to CLN-619, we are aware of several companies that are developing cancer therapies targeting MICA/B as a monotherapy and/or in combination with other agents, including: Fate Therapeutics, Inc., Innate Pharma, Inc. (in collaboration with AstraZeneca Inc.), CanCure LLC, Genentech Inc., Novartis International AG, or Novartis, and Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, or Bristol-Myers Squibb. To our knowledge, none of them has entered clinical development.
With respect to CLN-617, we are not aware of any other drug candidates currently under development that integrate both IL-2 and IL-12 into a single multi-functional construct and stimulate the immune system in a tumor-specific manner. We are aware of several companies actively developing clinical-stage programs as either individual IL-2 or IL-12 therapies, including: Nektar Therapeutics, Inc., Alkermes plc, Sanofi, Philogen S.p.A., Roche AG, Apeiron Biologics AG and Dragonfly Therapeutics Inc.
With respect to our CLN-978 program, we are aware of a number of companies developing product candidates that target CD19 or other tumor antigens relevant to B-cell ALL and NHL using immune cells or other cytotoxic modalities. These mainly include immune cell redirecting therapeutics (e.g., T cell engagers), adoptive cellular therapies (e.g., CAR-Ts) and antibody drug conjugates. Companies developing cell therapies or antibodies targeting CD19 include Morphosys AG, Novartis, Gilead Sciences Inc., Bristol-Myers Squibb, Allogene Therapeutics Inc., Nkarta Inc. and Amgen.

If our competitors develop and commercialize drugs that are safer, more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient to administer, are less expensive or with a more favorable label than our product candidates, we could see a reduction or elimination in our commercial opportunity. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their drugs more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market. The key competitive factors affecting the success of all of our product candidates, if approved, are likely to be their efficacy, safety, convenience, price, the level of generic competition and the availability of reimbursement from government and other third-party payors.
License Agreements
Taiho License Agreement
In February 2019, our partially-owned subsidiary Cullinan Pearl Corp., or Cullinan Pearl, entered into a License and Collaboration Agreement, or the Taiho License Agreement, with Taiho Pharma. Pursuant to the Taiho License Agreement, Cullinan Pearl obtained an exclusive, royalty-bearing worldwide license (excluding Japan) to develop, manufacture, commercialize and, subject to certain limitations, sublicense CLN-081 and products containing CLN-081, for use worldwide outside Japan, under the licensed patent rights and know-how.
Under the Taiho License Agreement, Cullinan Pearl agreed to conduct all development activities in accordance with a target product profile and a development plan intended to generate data to seek regulatory approval of CLN-081 from the FDA and European Medicines Agency, or EMA, and make such data available to Taiho Pharma for use to seek regulatory approval in Japan. Certain of these development activities require using commercially reasonable efforts. Cullinan Pearl must disclose experimental data, results or similar know-how to Taiho Pharma and grant a non-exclusive, royalty free, worldwide license, with the right to sublicense, to Taiho Pharma to develop, manufacture and commercialize CLN-081 and its products in Japan. Cullinan Pearl, and in certain cases Taiho Pharma, are obligated to provide progress reports to each other on development efforts before and, for so long as such party is developing a licensed product, after the first commercial sale of CLN-081. Taiho Pharma also has right of negotiation with Cullinan Pearl in the event Cullinan Pearl decides to commence negotiations with or if Cullinan Pearl receives a bona fide term sheet from a third-party regarding the license, sale, assignment, transfer or material disposition of rights with respect to the licensed product.
As partial consideration for the license, Cullinan Pearl paid an initial, non-refundable, non-creditable license fee of $2.5 million and issued Taiho Pharma 1,860,000 shares of Cullinan Pearl common stock. In addition, Cullinan Pearl is obligated to pay non-refundable, non-creditable research and development, regulatory and sales milestone payments upon the occurrence of certain milestone events in an aggregate amount of up to $154.5 million for development, regulatory and sales milestones. Each milestone is payable only once. No milestones have been achieved to date under the Taiho License Agreement.
Furthermore, on a country-by-country and product-by-product basis, Cullinan Pearl is required to pay running mid-single digit to low tens digits royalty percentages of annual aggregate net sales worldwide outside Japan, during the royalty term (such royalty term determined on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis), subject to certain offsets, deductions or reductions related to loss or impairment of exclusivity in the territory. Such royalty obligations will expire on a country-by-country and product-by-product basis upon the latest of (a) the expiration of the last patent which covers a product in such country, (b) the expiration of the applicable exclusivity granted by a regulatory authority and (c) ten years following the first commercial sale of the product in such country.
In the event (i) Taiho Pharma does not exercise its right of negotiation with respect to a licensed product or (ii) Taiho Pharma does exercise its right of negotiation, but the parties do not consummate a transaction, then at the time Cullinan Pearl enters into a subsequent transaction with a third-party for (a) less than all or less than substantially all of Cullinan Pearl’s rights in a licensed product, Cullinan Pearl is obligated to pay Taiho Pharma a mid-single digit percentage of revenue from such transactions or (b) all or substantially all of Cullinan Pearl’s rights in a licensed product, Cullinan Pearl is obligated to pay Taiho Pharma a low single digit percentage of revenue from such transactions, provided, however, that such payment under (b) shall not be required following the consummation of an initial public offering of Cullinan Pearl meeting certain requirements.
In December 2020, Cullinan Pearl entered into a license agreement, or the Zai License Agreement, with Zai Lab. Pursuant to the terms of the Taiho License Agreement, we are obligated to pay Taiho a mid-teen percentage of the $20.0 million upfront payment received from Zai Lab, as well as a mid-teen percentage of potential future milestone revenue received from Zai Lab under the Zai License Agreement. In the first quarter of 2021, Zai Lab paid the upfront fee to Cullinan Pearl and Cullinan Pearl recorded the corresponding transaction payment due to Taiho Pharma within research and development expenses.


Either party may terminate the Taiho License Agreement upon a material breach by the other party or bankruptcy of the other party. Cullinan Pearl may terminate the Taiho License Agreement at any time and for any commercially reasonable justification. Unless earlier terminated, the Taiho License Agreement continues in effect on a product-by-product basis until it expires upon the expiration of all applicable royalty terms with respect to all products in all countries worldwide.
 Zai License Agreement
In December 2020, Cullinan Pearl entered into the Zai License Agreement with Zai Lab. Pursuant to the Zai License Agreement, Cullinan Pearl granted Zai Lab an exclusive, royalty-bearing license to research, develop, commercialize and manufacture CLN-081 and products containing CLN-081 in the field in China, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan, or collectively, the Territory. Cullinan Pearl has also granted Zai Lab the right to grant sublicenses in multiple tiers in accordance with the Zai License Agreement, under the licensed technology and any improvements discovered or created during the term, to exploit the products in the field in the Territory.
Cullinan Pearl retained (i) all rights under the licensed technology to fulfill its obligations under the Zai License Agreement, (ii) the exclusive rights to exploit the licensed compound and products outside the Territory, (iii) the non-exclusive rights under the licensed technology to conduct global studies in accordance with the Zai License Agreement and (iv) the non-exclusive rights to manufacture or have manufactured the licensed compound or product in the Territory, solely to support (x) the manufacture, development and commercialization of the licensed compound and products outside of the Territory and (y) the manufacture, development and commercialization of the product by Zai Lab in the Territory.
Pursuant to the terms of the Zai License Agreement, Zai Lab shall use commercially reasonable efforts to develop the products in the field in the Territory, including the conduct of all development activities of the products in the field in the Territory in accordance with the development plan.
As partial consideration for the license and rights, Zai Lab paid will pay Cullinan Pearl an upfront, one-time, irrevocable, non-refundable, non-creditable license fee of $20.0 million within 40 days of the execution of the Zai License Agreement. In addition, Zai Lab is obligated to pay Cullinan Pearl non-refundable, non-creditable research and development, regulatory and sales milestone payments upon the occurrence of certain milestone events in an aggregate amount of up to $211.0 million. Each milestone is payable only once. No milestones have been achieved to date under the Zai License Agreement.
Furthermore, on a region-by-region and product-by-product basis, Zai Lab is required to pay tiered royalties from high single digit to low teen digit royalty percentages on annual aggregate net sales of all future products in the Territory in a calendar year, during the royalty term (such royalty term determined on a product-by-product and region-by-region basis), subject to certain offsets, deductions or reductions related to the expiration of the last-to-expire valid claim in such region, such time as generic competition with respect to such product occurs in such region or in connection with obtaining a license for any patents owned or controlled by a third-party in order to commercialize the licensed product; provided, however, that the royalties due to Cullinan Pearl shall not be reduced by more than fifty percent (50%). Such royalty obligations will be payable on a region-by-region and product-by-product basis from the first commercial sale of the applicable product in such region until the latest of (a) the date the last-to-expire valid claim in such region expires and (b) the tenth anniversary following the first commercial sale of such product in such region. Upon the expiration of the royalty terms, the licenses granted by Cullinan Pearl to Zai Lab in such region with respect to such product in the field shall become fully paid-up, perpetual, irrevocable and sublicensable in multiple tiers.

Either party may terminate the agreement on a region-by-region basis or in its entirety upon a material breach by the other party or bankruptcy of the other party. Zai Lab may terminate the Zai License Agreement in its entirety or on a product-by-product basis at any time and for any or no reason, provided, however, that Zai Lab will terminate the Zai License Agreement upon prior written notice to Cullinan Pearl if it determines that it shall discontinue all development and commercialization activities with respect to the products. Furthermore, Cullinan Pearl may terminate the Zai License Agreement in its entirety, if Zai Lab or its affiliates commence a legal, administrative or other action challenging the validity, enforceability or scope of any licensed patent or patent (other than the licensed patent) owned or controlled by Cullinan Pearl and its affiliates. In addition, if no active development activities have been conducted by Zai Lab and its affiliates or a permitted sublicensee within 10 months of the execution of the Zai License Agreement and such inactivity is not caused by a serious adverse event or serious adverse drug reaction, a force majeure event or Cullinan Pearl’s failure to supply sufficient quantities of clinical supply product, then Zai Lab will be deemed to have abandoned development for the product and Cullinan Pearl shall have the right to terminate the Zai License Agreement upon written notice, unless Zai Lab has cured such abandonment within 60 days of such written notice. The agreement may also be terminated by mutual written agreement. Unless earlier terminated, the Zai License Agreement continues in effect on a product-by-product basis until the expiration of all applicable royalty terms with respect to all products in any region in the territory.
DKFZ/Tübingen License Agreement
In August 2020, our partially owned subsidiary Cullinan Florentine Corp., or Cullinan Florentine, entered into an Exclusive License Agreement, or the DKFZ/Tübingen License Agreement, with Deutsches Krebsforschungszentrum, or DKFZ, Eberhard Karls University of Tübingen, Faculty of Medicine, or University of Tübingen, and Universitätsmedizin Gesellschaft für Forschung und Entwicklung mbH, Tübingen, or UFE. Pursuant to the DKFZ/Tübingen License Agreement, DKFZ and University of Tübingen, collectively referred to as the Licensor, granted to Cullinan Florentine an exclusive (even as to Licensor, UFE and its and their affiliates), worldwide, milestone- and royalty-bearing, license under certain licensed patent rights, applications, technical information and know-how, with the right to grant sublicenses through multiple tiers to research, develop, commercialize or otherwise exploit licensed products, itself and through its affiliates and third parties, within the field. Cullinan Florentine has the sole right, but not the obligation, to prosecute and maintain all licensed patent rights worldwide, provided that Licensor may take over or continue such prosecution and maintenance if Cullinan Florentine elects to cease the prosecution or maintenance of a licensed patent right.
Under the DKFZ/Tübingen License Agreement, Cullinan Florentine is obligated to achieve certain regulatory and research and development performance benchmarks, or collectively, the Performance Benchmarks, by certain specified dates, or collectively, the Performance Dates. If a Performance Benchmark is not achievable by the applicable Performance Date, Cullinan Florentine may extend the Performance Date for any single Performance Benchmark by a mid-single digit amount of months by providing written notice to Licensor and paying a non-refundable, non-creditable extension fee per each such extension. Cullinan Florentine may extend the Performance Date for any single Performance Benchmark up to a low single digit amount of times, provided that Cullinan Florentine may only request an extension a mid-single digit amount of times. If Cullinan Florentine is unable to seek a further extension per the preceding sentence, then Cullinan Florentine may seek a further extension by providing written notice to Licensor and any such extension shall be subject to the prior written approval of the Licensor, such approval not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed. As of December 31, 2021, Cullinan Florentine has met the first performance benchmark to create a master cell bank.
Cullinan Florentine paid to Licensor an upfront non-refundable, non-creditable option exercise fee of $600,000 and, as partial consideration for the licenses, has issued 758,246 and 348,682 shares of its common stock to DKFZ and University of Tübingen, respectively, who together own 5.19% of Cullinan Florentine’s fully diluted shares outstanding as of December 31, 2021. DKFZ and UFE were also granted the right to appoint one representative to the board of directors of Cullinan Florentine for so long as DFKZ and UFE in aggregate hold a mid-double digit percentage of shares of Cullinan Florentine common stock issued pursuant to the DFKZ/Tubingen License Agreement or until a financing threshold representing the aggregate investment in Cullinan Florentine is reached.
Additionally, Cullinan Florentine shall pay certain non-refundable, non-creditable milestone payments to Licensor upon the occurrence of certain clinical and regulatory events by a licensed product, whether triggered by Cullinan Florentine, its affiliates or sublicensees. Each milestone payment is paid one time only up to an aggregate of $28.0 million. No milestones have been achieved to date under the DKFZ/Tübingen License Agreement.

Furthermore, Cullinan Florentine is required to pay running low to mid-single digit royalty percentage on net sales of each licensed product on a country-by-country and product-by-product basis during the royalty term, subject to certain offsets or reductions. The aggregate, worldwide royalties due to Licensor for net sales of any licensed product in a calendar year shall not be reduced to an amount less than low to mid-single digit percentages. Such royalty obligations will expire on a country-by-country and product-by-product basis upon the later of (a) the expiration of the last valid claim of a patent which covers a product in such country and (b) a low double digit anniversary following the first commercial sale of a product in such country. Under certain conditions upon a first change in control, Cullinan Florentine shall pay a non-refundable, non-creditable mid-single digit percent of sale proceeds, provided, however, that such payment shall not be required following consummation of an initial public offering of Cullinan Florentine.
Either party may terminate the agreement upon a material breach by the other party or insolvency of the other party. Cullinan Florentine may terminate the DKFZ/Tübingen License Agreement for any or no reason after the first filing of an investigational new drug application or clinical trial agreement, or CTA, by providing prior written notice. Licensor may terminate the agreement by providing prior written notice, if Cullinan Florentine or any of its affiliates challenges the validity of certain patent rights. Unless earlier terminated, the DKFZ/Tübingen License Agreement continues on a perpetual basis.
MIT Exclusive Patent License Agreement
In December 2019, our partially-owned subsidiary Cullinan Amber Corp., or Cullinan Amber, entered into an Exclusive Patent License Agreement, or the MIT License Agreement, with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, or MIT. Pursuant to the MIT License Agreement, MIT granted to Cullinan Amber an exclusive, worldwide, milestone-, equity- and royalty-bearing license under certain licensed patent rights and applications, with the right to grant sublicenses through three tiers (so long as Cullinan Amber remains an exclusive licensee of the patent rights in the field worldwide) to develop, make, have made, use, sell, have sold, offer to sell, lease, and import licensed products containing specific fusion proteins in the field of diagnosis, prognosis, prophylaxis or treatment of cancer in humans or other animals. MIT shall prepare, file, prosecute and maintain all of the patent rights, and Cullinan Amber shall cooperate with the prosecution, provide comments on patent prosecution documents, and pay all fees and costs relating to such prosecution and maintenance.
Cullinan Amber paid MIT an upfront license issue fee of $50,000 and shall reimburse MIT for certain documented, out-of-pocket expenses incurred by MIT in connection with the preparation, filing, prosecution, maintenance and defense of the patent rights. As of December 31, 2021, Cullinan Amber has reimbursed MIT for $0.1 million in connection with out-of-pocket expenses incurred by MIT in connection with the preparation, filing, prosecution, maintenance and defense of patent rights. In addition, as partial consideration, Cullinan Amber has issued 200,066 shares of common stock of Cullinan Amber to MIT, which owns five percent (5%) of Cullinan Amber’s fully diluted shares outstanding as of December 31, 2021. The MIT License Agreement also provides for anti-dilution adjustments, requiring Cullinan Amber to issue MIT additional shares to ensure the shares issued to MIT do not equal less than the mid-single digit percentage amount until a financing threshold representing the aggregate investment in Cullinan Amber is reached. MIT was also granted participation rights, up to a low double-digit percentage of the securities issued, in any proposed financings of Cullinan Amber. Cullinan Amber is also responsible for paying non-refundable, creditable annual license maintenance fees in an increasing amount over a certain number of years of the license and a fixed amount subsequent to this period of time. In addition, MIT granted to Cullinan Amber an exclusive option to amend the definition of field to include expansion fields, and each such amendment would trigger the payment to MIT of an amendment fee and cause an amendment, to be negotiated upon exercise of the option, to Cullinan Amber’s financial obligations with respect to the licensed products to reflect the additional rights and value being added.
Additionally, Cullinan Amber shall pay certain non-refundable, non-creditable milestone payments to MIT upon the achievement by itself or its sublicensees of certain clinical and regulatory milestones in an aggregate amount up to $7.0 million for each distinct licensed product. Each milestone payment is paid one time only up to a certain payment amount, except there are separate milestone payments payable for a second and third indication of a licensed product in an aggregate amount up to $5.5 million per product. Cullinan Amber shall also pay to MIT certain one-time milestone payments for the achievement of certain commercial milestones based on the calculation of net sales across all licensed products in all indications in an aggregate amount up to $12.5 million. No milestones have been achieved to date under the MIT License Agreement.
Under certain conditions upon a change in control, Cullinan Amber is required to pay a specified change in control fee and Cullinan Amber’s clinical and regulatory milestone payments shall be increased by a certain low three-digit percentage amount.

Furthermore, Cullinan Amber is required to pay a running mid-single digit royalty percentage on net sales of all licensed products for each reporting period, subject to certain offsets or reductions. The royalties due to MIT for net sales of all licensed products shall not be reduced by more than fifty percent (50%). Cullinan Amber is also required to share any income from sublicensing the licensed products, with the percentage to be determined by the clinical phase of the licensed product, no greater than low-to-mid double-digit percentages. Such royalty obligations will expire on a country-by-country and product-by-product basis upon the expiration or abandonment of all issued patents and filed patent applications within the patent rights.
Under the MIT License Agreement, MIT must notify Cullinan Amber of certain patentable inventions conceived and reduced to practice during a certain period of time, or Improvements, and Cullinan Amber has the option to acquire rights to those improvements upon MIT’s approval of a business and development plan, not to be unreasonably withheld, for a specified fee. In addition to this specified fee, Cullinan Amber’s financial obligations with respect to the Improvements may be amended to reflect the value being added, such as by adding an upfront fee, maintenance fees, and milestone payments.
Cullinan Amber may voluntarily terminate the MIT License Agreement for any reason after providing written notice within a specified period of time in advance, provided that all amounts due to MIT have been paid. MIT has the right to terminate the MIT License Agreement upon written notice to Cullinan Amber if Cullinan Amber ceases to carry out its business related to the MIT License Agreement. Either party may terminate the MIT License Agreement upon a material breach by the other party. Unless earlier terminated, the MIT License Agreement shall remain in effect until the expiration or abandonment of all issued patents and the filed patent application within the patent rights.
Adimab Collaboration Agreement
In November 2018, we entered into a Collaboration Agreement, or the Adimab Collaboration Agreement, with Adimab, LLC, or Adimab. Pursuant to the Adimab Collaboration Agreement, we selected a single-digit number of biological targets against which Adimab used its proprietary platform technology to discover and/or optimize antibodies based upon mutually agreed upon research plans. Under the Adimab Collaboration Agreement, we have the ability to select a specified low single-digit number of additional biological targets against which Adimab will provide additional antibody discovery and optimization services.
During the research term and evaluation term for a given research program with Adimab, we have a non-exclusive worldwide license under Adimab’s technology to perform certain research activities and to evaluate the program antibodies to determine whether we want to exercise its option to obtain a royalty-free, fully paid, non-exclusive license under Adimab’s background patent rights to exploit such antibodies sublicensable through multiple tiers, or the Adimab Option. In the event we exercise the Adimab Option, we will pay an option fee for each target subject to certain adjustments.
Under the Adimab Collaboration Agreement, we paid a one-time, non-creditable, non-refundable technology access fee. We are also required to pay an annual access fee and research funding fees in connection with Adimab’s full-time employees’ compensation for performance of Adimab’s obligations under the Adimab Collaboration Agreement. We are also obligated to make certain research delivery, clinical and sales milestone payments to Adimab in an aggregate amount of up to $15.8 million for each product, on a product-by-product basis, subject to certain reductions and discounts.
Furthermore, we are obligated to pay certain royalty payments on a product-by-product basis at a low single-digit percentage of annual aggregate worldwide net sales. Such royalty obligations will expire on a country-by-country and product-by-product basis upon the later of (a) a certain low double-digit number of years after the first commercial sale of such product in such country and (b) the expiration of the last issued and not expired, permanently revoked, or invalid claim within a program patent covering such product as defined in the agreement.
We may terminate the Adimab Collaboration Agreement at any time, for any reason, upon a specified period advance written notice. The term of the Adimab Collaboration Agreement expires upon the last research program’s evaluation term in the event no Adimab Option is exercised or, in the event an Adimab Option is exercised, after the royalty term thereof expires at the later of a specified period or invalid patent coverage of the relevant product.
Intellectual Property
Our intellectual property is critical to our business and we strive to protect it, including by obtaining, maintaining, defending, and enforcing patents and other intellectual property, in the United States and internationally, for our proprietary therapeutic molecules, technology, improvements, platforms, product candidates and components thereof, novel biological discoveries, new therapeutic approaches and potential indications, and other inventions that are important to our business. For our product candidates, generally we initially pursue patent protection covering compositions of matter, methods of use, and methods of production. Throughout the development of our product candidates, we will seek to identify additional means of obtaining patent protection that would potentially enhance commercial success, including improvement to pharmaceutical formulations, methods of use and production.
As of December 31, 2021, our patent portfolio includes 10 patent families, including both patent applications we own, and issued patents and patent applications exclusively in-licensed from external technology originators in a respective field. Specifically, we have exclusively in-licensed at least 2 issued US patents, 38 patents issued in foreign jurisdictions, and 129 patent applications pending worldwide. Our earliest issued patents are expected to expire in 2034. Later patents, that may issue from our pending patent applications, are expected to expire between 2037 and 2041, excluding any patent term adjustments or extensions, if applicable, that may be available. As to the patent term extension to restore patent term effectively lost following patent grant but during the FDA regulatory review process, the restoration period cannot be longer than five years and the total patent term including the restoration period must not exceed 14 years following FDA approval.
Our portfolio related to our CLN-081 product candidate includes five patent families directed to compositions, and methods of using such compositions therapeutically. The first family, which is in-licensed from Taiho Pharma, covers compositions with claims directed to our CLN-081 product candidate. This patent family includes issued patents in the U.S., major European countries and China, and such patents are expected to expire in 2034, excluding any patent term adjustments or extensions, if applicable. Within this family, patent application were filed in Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Hong Kong, Macau, European Patent Office, Austria, Belgium, Switzerland, Czech Republic, Germany, Denmark, Spain, Finland, France, United Kingdom, Greece, Hungry, Ireland, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Sweden, Turkey, Indonesia, India, Japan, Korea, Mexico, Malaysia, Philippines, Russian Federation, Singapore, Thailand, Taiwan, United States of America, and Vietnam. Three families, also in-licensed from Taiho Pharma, include both issued patents and pending patent applications with claims directed to methods of using the CLN-081 product candidate in treating additional diseases where we believe CLN-081 has potential to be active. The first of these three families, titled “Selective Inhibitor of Exon20 Insertion Mutant EGFR”, is expected to expire in 2037, excluding any patent term adjustments or extensions, if applicable, that may be available. Within this family, patent applications have so far been filed in Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, European Patent Office, Indonesia, Israel, Japan, Jordan, Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Philippines, Russian Federation, Singapore, Thailand, United States of America, Vietnam, South Africa, and Taiwan. The second of these three families, titled “Selective Inhibitor of Exon 18 and Exon 21 Mutant EGFR”, is expected to expire in 2038, excluding any patent term adjustments or extensions, if applicable, that may be available. Within this family, patent applications have so far been filed in Australia, Canada, China, European Patent Office, Israel, Korea, Taiwan, Singapore, and United States of America. The third of these three families, titled “L718 and/or L792 mutant type treating resistance EGFR inhibitor”, is expected to expire in 2039, excluding any patent term adjustments or extensions, if applicable, that may be available. An international application has been filed under this family. We own a fifth application, which is directed to certain methods of use and dosing protocols. This family is expected to expire in 2041, excluding any patent term adjustments or extensions, if applicable, that may be available. A PCT application and an application in Taiwan have been filed under this family.
We, through our subsidiary Cullinan MICA, own three patent families related to our CLN-619 product candidate, including patent families directed to compositions, and methods of using such compositions therapeutically. The family of patent applications with claims directed to CLN-619 compositions, if issued, are expected to expire in 2039, excluding any patent term adjustments or extensions, if applicable. For the first of these patent families, patent applications have so far been filed in Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, European Patent Office, India, Indonesia, Israel, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Philippines, Russian Federation, Singapore, Thailand, United States of America, Vietnam and South Africa. A family of patent applications with claims directed to additional anti-MICA antibody compositions, if issued, are expected to expire in 2039, excluding any patent term adjustments or extensions, if applicable. Patent applications have so far been filed for this family in Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, European Patent Office, India, Israel, Japan, Korea, Mexico, New Zealand, Russian Federation, United States of America, South Africa and Hong Kong. A patent family with claims directed to additional anti-MICA antibody compositions and methods of use, if issued, is expected to expire in 2043, excluding any patent term adjustments or extensions, if applicable. A United States provisional application has been filed under this family.

Our portfolio related to our CLN-049 product candidate includes one patent family, in-licensed from the University of Tubingen, directed to compositions, and methods of using such compositions therapeutically. This family of patent applications contain claims directed to CLN-049 compositions, which, if issued, are expected to expire in 2039, excluding any patent term adjustments or extensions, if applicable. Patent applications have so far been filed for this family in the United States, Europe, China, Australia, Brazil, Canada, Indonesia, Israel, India, Mexico, New Zealand, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, South Korea, Vietnam, South Africa, Russia, Japan, Malaysia and Hong Kong.
Our portfolio related to our CLN-617 product candidate and Cullinan Amber program includes two patent families. The first family was in-licensed from MIT, directed to compositions, and methods of using such compositions therapeutically. This family of patent applications contain claims covering Cullinan Amber related compositions, which, if issued, are expected to expire in 2039, excluding any patent term adjustments or extensions, if applicable. An international application has been filed under this family. The second family is a PCT application owned by Cullinan Amber, which is directed to certain compositions, and methods of using such compositions therapeutically. This family contains claims covering additional Cullinan Amber related compositions, which, if issued, are expected to expire in 2041, excluding any patent term adjustments or extensions, if applicable.
 Individual patents extend for varying periods depending on the date of filing of the patent application or the date of patent issuance and the legal term of patents in the countries in which they are obtained. Generally, patents issued for regularly filed applications in the United States are granted a term of 20 years from the earliest effective non-provisional filing date. In addition, in certain instances, a patent term can be extended to recapture a portion of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or the USPTO, review period in issuing the patent as well as a portion of the term effectively lost as a result of the FDA regulatory review period.
Manufacturing
We do not own or operate, and currently have no plans to establish, any Good Manufacturing Practice, or GMP, manufacturing facilities. We rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the manufacture of our product candidates for preclinical and clinical testing, as well as for commercial manufacture if any of our product candidates obtain marketing approval. We also rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties to package, label, store and distribute our investigational product candidates and, if marketing approval is obtained, our commercial products. We believe this strategy allows us to maintain a more efficient infrastructure by eliminating the need for us to invest in our own manufacturing facilities, equipment and personnel while also enabling us to focus our expertise and resources on the development of new product candidates.
We receive material from our contract manufacturing organizations, or CMOs, for preclinical testing. We receive clinical supply material manufactured in compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practice requirements, or cGMPs, and we conduct audits before and during the trial, in cooperation with a CMO, to ensure compliance with the mutually agreed process descriptions and cGMP regulations.
Our lead product candidate, CLN-081, is a small molecule that is manufactured in synthetic processes from available starting materials. The chemistry appears amenable to scale-up and does not currently require unusual equipment in the manufacturing process. We generally expect to rely on third parties for the manufacture of companion diagnostics, which are assays or tests that identify an appropriate patient population for CLN-081. Depending on the technology solutions we choose, we may rely on multiple third parties to manufacture and sell a single test.
To date, we have obtained drug substance, or DS, for CLN-049 and CLN-619, our most advanced biologic candidates, from single-source third-party contract manufacturers, WuXi Biologics, WuXi, and Abzena, respectively. While any reduction or halt in supply of DS from these contract manufacturers could limit our ability to develop our product candidates until we find a qualified replacement contract manufacturer, we have procured sufficient DS to initiate our planned clinical studies for both CLN-049 and CLN-619. WuXi has also supplied CLN-049 drug product, or DP, and we have procured sufficient CLN-049 DP for our planned clinical studies. We have engaged a separate contract manufacturer to produce CLN-619 DP, Vetter, which has manufactured sufficient DP to initiate our planned clinical studies. We intend to put in place agreements under which our third-party contract manufacturers will generally provide us with necessary quantities of DS and DP on a project-by-project basis, based on our projected development and commercial supply needs.

Our CLN-049 and CLN-619 product candidates are manufactured from a vial of a master cell bank, or MCB, from the respective production cell lines. We have one MCB for each program that was produced and tested in accordance with cGMPs and applicable regulations. For CLN-049, the MCB is stored in one location, and we are making plans to store at a second location. The research cell bank, or RCB, for CLN-049 is stored at a different location from the MCB. For CLN-619, the MCB is stored at two independent sites, and the RCB is stored at a separate location from the RCB locations. We intend to produce working cell banks for each product candidate later in product development. It is possible that we could lose multiple cell banks from multiple locations and have our manufacturing severely impacted by the need to replace the cell banks. However, we believe we have adequate backup should any particular cell bank be lost in a catastrophic event.
Governmental Regulation
United States Food and Drug Administration Regulation
The United States Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, and other U.S. regulatory authorities at federal, state and local levels, as well as in foreign countries, extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, safety, efficacy, import, export, labeling, packaging, storage, distribution, record keeping, approval, advertising, promotion, marketing, post-approval monitoring and post-approval reporting of drugs and biologics such as those we are developing. We, along with our vendors, collaboration partners, clinical research organizations, or CROs, clinical trial investigators, and CMOs will be required to navigate the various preclinical, clinical, manufacturing and commercial approval requirements of the governing regulatory agencies of the countries in which we wish to conduct studies or seek approval of our product candidates. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals of drugs and ensuring subsequent compliance with appropriate United States federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable regulatory requirements at any time during the product development process or post-approval may subject an applicant to delays in development or approval, as well as administrative and judicial sanctions.
In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the FDCA, and biologics under the FDCA and the Public Health Service Act, or PHSA, and their implementing regulations. Both drugs and biologics are also subject to other federal, state and local statutes and regulations. Our product candidates are early-stage and have not been approved by the FDA for marketing in the United States.
Our product candidates must be approved for therapeutic indications by the FDA before they may be marketed in the United States. For our drug product candidates regulated under the FDCA, such as CLN-081, FDA must approve a New Drug Application, or NDA. For our biologic product candidates regulated under the FDCA and PHSA, such as CLN-049 and CLN-619, FDA must approve a Biologics License Application, or BLA. The process is similar and generally involves the following:
•completion of extensive preclinical studies in accordance with applicable regulations, including studies conducted in accordance with Good Laboratory Practice, or GLP, requirements; 
 •submission to the FDA of an Investigational New Drug, or IND application which must become effective before clinical trials may begin and must be updated annually and when certain changes are made; 
 •approval by an Institutional Review Board, or IRB, or independent ethics committee at each clinical trial site before each trial may be initiated; 
 •performance of adequate and well-controlled clinical trials in accordance with Good Clinical Practice, or GCP, requirements and other clinical trial-related regulations to establish the safety and efficacy of the investigational product for each proposed indication; 
 •preparation and submission to the FDA of an NDA or BLA; 
 •payment of user fees for FDA review of the NDA or BLA, unless waived;
 •a determination by the FDA within 60 days of its receipt of an NDA or BLA to file the application for review; 
 •satisfactory completion of one or more FDA pre-approval inspections of the manufacturing facility or facilities where the product will be produced to assess compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMPs to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to ensure and preserve the drug or biological product’s identity, strength, quality and purity; 
 •satisfactory completion of any FDA audits of the clinical trial sites that generated the data in support of the NDA or BLA; and 


•FDA review and approval of the NDA or BLA, including, where applicable, consideration of the views of any FDA advisory committee, prior to any commercial marketing or sale of the drug or biologic in the United States. 
 Preclinical and Clinical Trials
Before testing any drug or biologic in humans, the product candidate must undergo rigorous preclinical testing. Preclinical studies include laboratory evaluations of chemistry, formulation and stability, as well as in vitro and animal studies to assess safety and in some cases to establish the rationale for therapeutic use. The conduct of preclinical studies is subject to federal and state regulations and requirements, including GLP requirements for safety and toxicology studies. In the United States, the results of the preclinical studies, together with manufacturing information and analytical data must be submitted to the FDA as part of an IND.
An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational product to humans and must become effective before clinical trials may begin. The central focus of an IND submission is on the general investigational plan and the protocol(s) for clinical studies. The IND also includes results of animal and in vitro studies assessing the toxicology, pharmacokinetics, pharmacology and pharmacodynamic characteristics of the product; chemistry, manufacturing and controls information; and any available human data or literature to support the use of the investigational product. In the United States, the IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30-day time period, raises concerns or questions about the conduct of the clinical trial, including concerns that human research subjects will be exposed to unreasonable health risks and imposes a clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. Some long-term preclinical testing may continue after the IND is submitted. Accordingly, submission of an IND may or may not result in FDA authorization to begin a trial.
The clinical stage of development involves the administration of the product candidate to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of qualified investigators, generally physicians not employed by or under the trial sponsor’s control, in accordance with GCP requirements, which include the requirements that all research subjects provide their informed consent for their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria and the parameters and criteria to be used in monitoring safety and evaluating effectiveness, including stopping rules that assure a clinical study will be stopped if certain adverse events should occur. Each protocol, and any subsequent amendments to the protocol, must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Furthermore, each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an IRB, either centrally or at each institution at which the clinical trial will be conducted, to ensure that the risks to individuals participating in the clinical trials are minimized and are reasonable related to the anticipated benefits. The IRB also approves the informed consent form that must be provided to each clinical trial subject or his or her legal representative and must monitor the clinical trial until completed.
The FDA may, at any time during the initial 30-day IND review period or while clinical trials are ongoing under the IND, impose a partial or complete clinical hold based on concerns for patient safety and/or noncompliance with regulatory requirements. This order issued by the FDA would delay a proposed clinical study or cause suspension of an ongoing study until all outstanding concerns have been adequately addressed, and the FDA has notified the company that investigations may proceed. Imposition of a clinical hold could cause significant delays or difficulties in completing planned clinical studies in a timely manner. In addition, the IRB, or the sponsor may suspend or discontinue a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Some studies also include oversight by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical study sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board, which provides authorization for whether or not a study may move forward at designated check points based on access to certain data from the study and may halt the clinical trial if it determines that there is an unacceptable safety risk for subjects or other grounds, such as no demonstration of efficacy. There also are requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical trials and completed clinical trials to public registries. In the United States, information about applicable clinical trials, including clinical trials results, must be submitted within specific timeframes for publication on the www.clinicaltrials.gov website.
A sponsor who wishes to conduct a clinical trial outside of the United States may, but need not, obtain FDA authorization to conduct the clinical trial under an IND. The FDA will accept a well-designed and well-conducted foreign clinical study not conducted under an IND if the study was conducted in accordance with GCP requirements, and the FDA is able to validate the data through an onsite inspection if deemed necessary.

Clinical trials to evaluate therapeutic indications to support NDAs and BLAs for marketing approval are typically conducted in three sequential phases, which may overlap.
•Phase 1—Phase 1 clinical trials involve initial introduction of the investigational product in a limited population of healthy human volunteers or patients with the target disease or condition in the case of some products for severe or life-threatening diseases. These studies are typically designed to test the safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism and distribution of the investigational product in humans, evaluate the side effects associated with increasing doses, and, if possible, to gain early evidence of effectiveness. 
 •Phase 2—Phase 2 clinical trials typically involve administration of the investigational product to a limited patient population with a specified disease or condition to evaluate the preliminary efficacy, optimal dosages and dosing schedule and to identify possible adverse side effects and safety risks. Multiple Phase 2 clinical trials may be conducted to obtain information prior to beginning larger and more expensive Phase 3 clinical trials. 
 •Phase 3—Phase 3 clinical trials typically involve administration of the investigational product to an expanded patient population to further evaluate dosage, to provide substantial evidence of clinical efficacy and to further test for safety, generally at multiple geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. These clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit ratio of the investigational product and to provide an adequate basis for product approval. Generally, two adequate and well-controlled Phase 3 clinical trials are required by the FDA for approval of an NDA or BLA. 
 Post-approval trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These trials are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication and are commonly intended to generate additional safety data regarding use of the product in a clinical setting. In certain instances, the FDA may mandate the performance of Phase 4 clinical trials as a condition of approval of an NDA or BLA. Failure to exhibit due diligence with regard to conducting required Phase 4 clinical trials could result in withdrawal of approval for products.
During all phases of clinical development, regulatory agencies require extensive monitoring and auditing of all clinical activities, clinical data, and clinical study investigators. Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials, among other information, must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and written IND safety reports must be submitted to the FDA and the investigators fifteen days after the trial sponsor determines the information qualifies for reporting for serious and unexpected suspected adverse events, findings from other studies or animal or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk for human participants exposed to the drug or biologic and any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure. The sponsor must also notify the FDA of any unexpected fatal or life-threatening suspected adverse reaction as soon as possible but in no case later than seven calendar days after the sponsor’s initial receipt of the information.
Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the drug or biological characteristics of the product candidate and finalize a process for manufacturing the drug product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and manufacturers must develop, among other things, methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final drug product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested, and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life and to identify appropriate storage conditions for the product candidate.
Expanded Access
Expanded access, sometimes called “compassionate use,” is the use of investigational products outside of clinical trials to treat patients with serious or immediately life-threatening diseases or conditions when there are no comparable or satisfactory alternative treatment options. FDA regulations allow access to investigational products under an IND by the company or the treating physician for treatment purposes on a case-by-case basis for the following groups: individual patients (single-patient IND applications for treatment in emergency settings and non-emergency settings); intermediate-size patient populations; and larger populations for use of the investigational product under a treatment protocol or treatment IND application.

There is no requirement for a company to provide expanded access to its investigational product. However, if a company decides to make its investigational product available for expanded access, FDA reviews each request for expanded access and determines if treatment may proceed. Expanded access may be appropriate when all of the following criteria apply: the patient has a serious or immediately life-threatening disease or condition, and there is no comparable or satisfactory alternative therapy to diagnose, monitor, or treat the disease or condition; the potential benefit justifies the potential risks of the treatment and the potential risks are not unreasonable in the context of the disease or condition to be treated; and providing the investigational product for the requested use will not interfere with the initiation, conduct, or completion of clinical investigations that could support marketing approval of the expanded access use or otherwise compromise the potential development of the expanded access use.
In addition, on May 30, 2018, the Right to Try Act was signed into law. The law, among other things, provides an additional mechanism for patients with a life-threatening condition who have exhausted approved treatments and are unable to participate in clinical trials to access certain investigational products that have completed a Phase I clinical trial, are the subject of an active IND, and are undergoing investigation for FDA approval. Unlike the expanded access framework described above, Right to Try does not require FDA to review or approve requests for use of the investigational product. There is no obligation for a company to make its investigational products available to eligible patients under the Right to Try Act.
Under the FDCA, sponsors of one or more investigational products for the treatment of a serious disease or condition must make publicly available their policy for evaluating and responding to requests for expanded access for individual patients. Sponsors are required to make such policies publicly available upon the earlier of initiation of a Phase 2 or Phase 3 study, or 15 days after the investigational drug or biologic receives designation as a breakthrough therapy, fast track product, or regenerative medicine advanced therapy. There is no obligation for a sponsor to make its investigational products available to eligible patients as a result of the Right to Try Act, but the sponsor must develop an internal policy and respond to patient requests according to that policy.
FDA Marketing Application Review and Approval Process
Assuming successful completion of the required clinical testing, the results of the preclinical studies and clinical trials, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacture, controls and proposed labeling, among other things, are submitted to the United States FDA as part of an NDA or BLA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. An NDA is a request for approval to market a new drug for one or more specified indications, and a BLA is a request for approval to market a new biologic for one or more specified indications. The NDA or BLA must include all relevant data available from pertinent preclinical studies and clinical studies, including negative or ambiguous results as well as positive findings, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacturing, controls, and proposed labeling, among other things. Data may come from company-sponsored clinical trials intended to test the safety and efficacy of a product’s use or from a number of alternative sources, including studies initiated by investigators. To support marketing approval, the data submitted must be sufficient in quality and quantity to establish the safety and efficacy of the investigational drug, or the safety, purity and potency of the investigational biologic, to the satisfaction of the FDA. FDA approval of an NDA or BLA must be obtained before a drug or biologic may be marketed in the United States.
In addition, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, or PREA, certain NDAs and BLAs and certain supplements to an NDA or BLA must contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug or biological product candidate for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act requires that a sponsor who is planning to submit a marketing application or supplement to an application for a drug or biological product that includes a new active ingredient or clinically active component, new indication, new dosage form, new dosing regimen or new route of administration submit an initial Pediatric Study Plan within 60 days after an end-of-Phase 2 meeting or as may be agreed between the sponsor and FDA. Unless otherwise required by regulation, PREA does not apply to a drug or biological product for an indication for which orphan designation has been granted.

In the United States, the FDA reviews all submitted NDAs and BLAs to ensure they are sufficiently complete to permit substantive review before it accepts them for filing and may request additional information rather than accepting the NDA or BLA for filing. The FDA makes a decision on accepting an NDA or BLA for filing within 60 days of receipt, and such decision could include a refusal to file by the FDA. The FDA may refuse to file any BLA that it deems incomplete or not properly reviewable at the time of submission and may request additional information. In this event, the BLA must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application also is subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review of the application. The FDA reviews an NDA or BLA to determine, among other things, whether the product is safe and effective and whether the facility in which it is manufactured, processed, packaged or held meets standards, including cGMP requirements, designed to assure and preserve the product’s identity, strength, quality and purity. Under the goals and polices agreed to by the FDA under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, the FDA targets ten months, from the filing date, in which to complete its initial review of an original NDA or BLA and respond to the applicant, and six months from the filing date of an original NDA or BLA filed for priority review. The FDA does not always meet its PDUFA goal dates for standard or priority NDAs or BLAs, and the review process is often extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification.
Further, under PDUFA, as amended, each NDA or BLA must be accompanied by a user fee, and the sponsor of an approved NDA or BLA is also subject to an annual program fee. FDA adjusts the PDUFA user fees on an annual basis. Fee waivers or reductions may be available in certain circumstances, including a waiver of the application fee for the first application filed by a small business. Additionally, no user fees are assessed on NDAs or BLAs for products designated as orphan drugs, unless the product also includes a non-orphan indication.
The FDA may refer an application for a drug or biologic to an advisory committee. An advisory committee is a panel of independent experts, including clinicians and other scientific experts, which reviews, evaluates and provides a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions.
Before approving an NDA or BLA, the FDA typically will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving an NDA or BLA, the FDA may inspect one or more clinical trial sites to assure compliance with GCP and other requirements and the integrity of the clinical data submitted to the FDA. To assure GMP and GCP compliance, an applicant must incur significant expenditure of time, money and effort in the areas of training, record keeping, production, and quality control.
 After evaluating the application and all related information, including the advisory committee recommendation, if any, and inspection reports regarding the manufacturing facilities and clinical trial sites, the FDA may issue an approval letter, or, in some cases, a Complete Response Letter. A Complete Response Letter indicates that the review cycle of the application is complete and the application is not ready for approval. A Complete Response Letter will usually describe all of the deficiencies that the FDA has identified in the NDA or BLA, except that where the FDA determines that the data supporting the application are inadequate to support approval, the FDA may issue the Complete Response Letter without first conducting required inspections, testing submitted product lots, and/or reviewing proposed labeling. In issuing the Complete Response Letter, the FDA may recommend actions that the applicant might take to place the NDA or BLA in condition for approval, including requests for additional information or clarification. Even with submission of this additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval. If and when those conditions have been met to the FDA’s satisfaction, the FDA will typically issue an approval letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the product with specific prescribing information for specific indications.
Even if the FDA approves a product, depending on the specific risk(s) to be addressed, the FDA may limit the approved indications for use of the product, require that contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling, require that post-approval studies, including Phase 4 clinical trials, be conducted to further assess a product’s safety or efficacy after approval, require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the product after commercialization, or impose other conditions, including distribution and use restrictions or other risk management mechanisms under a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or REMS, which can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the product. REMS can include medication guides, communication plans for healthcare professionals, and elements to assure safe use, or ETASU. ETASU can include, but are not limited to, special training or certification for prescribing or dispensing, dispensing only under certain circumstances, special monitoring, and the use of patent registries. The FDA may prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of post-marketing studies or surveillance programs. After approval, some types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes, and additional labeling claims, are subject to further testing requirements and FDA review and approval.

Orphan Drug Designation and Exclusivity
Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan drug designation, or ODD, to a drug or biologic intended to treat a rare disease or condition, defined as a disease or condition with either a patient population of fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or a patient population of greater than 200,000 individuals in the United States when there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making available the drug or biologic in the United States will be recovered from sales in the United States of that drug or biologic. ODD must be requested before submitting an NDA or BLA. After the FDA grants ODD, the generic identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. The granting of ODD does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process.
 If a product that has received ODD and subsequently receives the first FDA approval for that drug for the disease for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan product exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications, including a full NDA or BLA, to market the same drug or biologic for the same indication for seven years from the approval of the NDA or BLA, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan drug exclusivity or if the FDA finds that the holder of the orphan drug exclusivity has not shown that it can assure the availability of sufficient quantities of the orphan drug to meet the needs of patients with the disease or condition for which the drug was designated. Orphan drug exclusivity does not prevent the FDA from approving a different drug or biologic for the same disease or condition, or the same drug or biologic for a different disease or condition. Among the other benefits of ODD are tax credits for certain research and a waiver of the NDA or BLA application user fee.
A designated orphan drug may not receive orphan drug exclusivity if it is approved for a use that is broader than the indication for which it received ODD. In addition, orphan drug exclusive marketing rights in the United States may be lost if the FDA later determines that the request for designation was materially defective or if the manufacturer is unable to assure sufficient quantities of the product to meet the needs of patients with the rare disease or condition.
Expedited Development and Review Programs
The FDA maintains several programs intended to facilitate and expedite development and review of new drugs and biologics to address unmet medical needs in the treatment of serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions. These programs include Fast Track designation, Breakthrough Therapy designation, priority review and accelerated approval. Fast Track designation, Breakthrough Therapy designation, priority review and accelerated approval do not change the standards for approval but may expedite the development or approval process.
 A new drug or biologic is eligible for Fast Track designation if it is intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and demonstrates the potential to address unmet medical needs for such disease or condition. Fast track designation applies to the combination of the product and the specific indication for which it is being studied. Fast Track designation provides increased opportunities for sponsor interactions with the FDA during preclinical and clinical development, in addition to the potential for rolling review once a marketing application is filed, meaning that the FDA may initiate review of sections of a Fast Track product’s application before the application is complete upon satisfaction of certain conditions.
In addition, a new drug or biological product may be eligible for Breakthrough Therapy designation if it is intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug or biologic, alone or in combination with or more other drugs or biologics, may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. Breakthrough Therapy designation provides all the features of Fast Track designation in addition to intensive guidance on an efficient development program beginning as early as Phase 1, and FDA organizational commitment to expedited development, including involvement of senior managers and experienced review staff in a cross-disciplinary review, where appropriate.
Any product submitted to the FDA for approval, including a product with Fast Track, or Breakthrough Therapy designation, may also be eligible for priority review. A product is eligible for priority review if it is intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and if approved, would provide a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness. For original NDAs and BLAs, priority review designation means the FDA’s goal is to take action on the marketing application within six months of the 60-day filing date (compared with ten months under standard review).

The FDA may grant accelerated approval to a product intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition that generally provides a meaningful therapeutic advantage to patients over available treatments, and demonstrates an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, or IMM, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on IMM or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments.
For drugs granted accelerated approval, the FDA generally requires sponsors to conduct, in a diligent manner, adequate and well-controlled post-approval confirmatory studies to verify and describe the product’s clinical benefit. Failure to conduct required post-approval studies with due diligence, failure to confirm a clinical benefit during the post-approval studies, or dissemination of false or misleading promotional materials would allow the FDA to withdraw the product approval on an expedited basis. All promotional materials for product candidates approved under accelerated approval are subject to prior review by the FDA unless FDA informs the applicant otherwise.
FDA Approval or Clearance of Companion Diagnostics
In August 2014, the FDA issued final guidance clarifying the requirements that will apply to the development and approval of therapeutic products intended for use with in vitro companion diagnostics. According to the guidance, for novel drugs and biologics, a companion diagnostic device and its corresponding therapeutic should be approved or cleared contemporaneously by the FDA for the use indicated in the therapeutic product’s labeling. Approval or clearance of the companion diagnostic device will ensure that the device has been adequately evaluated and has adequate performance characteristics in the intended population. In July 2016, the FDA issued a draft guidance intended to assist sponsors of the therapeutic products and in vitro companion diagnostic devices on issues related to co-development of the products.
Under the FDCA, in vitro diagnostics, including companion diagnostics, are regulated as medical devices. In the United States, the FDCA and its implementing regulations, and other federal and state statutes and regulations govern, among other things, medical device design and development, preclinical and clinical testing, premarket clearance or approval, registration and listing, manufacturing, labeling, storage, advertising and promotion, sales and distribution, export and import, and post-market surveillance. Unless an exemption applies, diagnostic tests require marketing clearance or approval from the FDA prior to commercial distribution.
The FDA previously has required in vitro companion diagnostics intended to select the patients who will respond to a product candidate to obtain pre-market approval, or PMA, simultaneously with approval of the therapeutic product candidate. The PMA process, including the gathering of clinical and preclinical data and the submission to and review by the FDA, can take several years or longer. It involves a rigorous premarket review during which the applicant must prepare and provide the FDA with reasonable assurance of the device’s safety and effectiveness and information about the device and its components regarding, among other things, device design, manufacturing and labeling. PMA applications are subject to an application fee.
 A clinical trial is typically required for a PMA application and, in a small percentage of cases, the FDA may require a clinical study in support of a 510(k) submission. A manufacturer that wishes to conduct a clinical study involving the device is subject to the FDA’s investigational device exemption, or IDE, regulation. The IDE regulations distinguish between significant and non-significant risk device studies and the procedures for obtaining approval to begin the study differ accordingly. Also, some types of studies are exempt from the IDE regulations. A significant risk device presents a potential for serious risk to the health, safety, or welfare of a subject. Significant risk devices are devices that are substantially important in diagnosing, curing, mitigating, or treating disease or in preventing impairment to human health. Studies of devices that pose a significant risk require both FDA and an IRB approval prior to initiation of a clinical study. Many companion diagnostics are considered significant risk devices due to their role in diagnosing a disease or condition. Non-significant risk devices are devices that do not pose a significant risk to the human subjects. A non-significant risk device study requires only IRB approval prior to initiation of a clinical study.
After a device is placed on the market, it remains subject to significant regulatory requirements. Medical devices may be marketed only for the uses and indications for which they are cleared or approved. Device manufacturers must also establish registration and device listings with the FDA.

In the United States, device manufacturers are also subject to FDA’s medical device reporting regulations, which require that a manufacturer report to the FDA if a device it markets may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury, or has malfunctioned and the device or a similar device that it markets would be likely to cause or contribute to a death or serious injury, if the malfunction were to recur, and FDA’s correction and removal reporting regulations, which require that manufacturers report to the FDA corrections or removals if undertaken to reduce a risk to health posed by the device or to remedy a violation of the FDCA that may present a risk to health. A medical device manufacturer’s manufacturing processes and those of its suppliers are required to comply with the applicable portions of the Quality System Regulation, which covers the methods and documentation of the design, testing, production, processes, controls, quality assurance, labeling, packaging and shipping of medical devices. Domestic facility records and manufacturing processes are subject to periodic unscheduled inspections by the FDA. The FDA also may inspect foreign facilities that export products to the United States.
Post-Approval Requirements for Drugs and Biologics in the United States
In the United States, drugs and biologics manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to recordkeeping, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, reporting of adverse experiences with the product, complying with promotion and advertising requirements, which include restrictions on promoting products for unapproved uses or patient populations (known as “off-label use”) and limitations on industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities. Although physicians may prescribe approved products for off-label uses, manufacturers may not market or promote such uses. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, including not only by Company employees but also by agents of the Company or those speaking on the Company’s behalf, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability. Failure to comply with these requirements can result in, among other things, adverse publicity, warning letters, corrective advertising and potential civil and criminal penalties, including liabilities under the False Claims Act where products carry reimbursement under federal health care programs. Promotional materials for approved drugs and biologics must be submitted to the FDA in conjunction with their first use or first publication. Further, if there are any modifications to the product, including proposed changes to the indication, labeling or manufacturing processes or facilities, the applicant may be required to submit and obtain FDA approval of a new or supplemental NDA or BLA, which may require the development of additional data or preclinical studies and clinical trials.
The FDA may impose a number of post-approval requirements as a condition of approval of an NDA or BLA. For example, the FDA may require post-market testing, including Phase 4 clinical trials, and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product’s safety and effectiveness after commercialization.
 In addition, drug and biologics manufacturers and their subcontractors involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved products are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with ongoing regulatory requirements, including cGMP, which impose certain procedural and documentation requirements upon us and our CMOs. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated, and, depending on the significance of the change, may require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting requirements upon us and any third-party manufacturers that we may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMP and other aspects of regulatory compliance Failure to comply with statutory and regulatory requirements can subject a manufacturer to possible legal or regulatory action, such as warning letters, suspension of manufacturing, product seizures, injunctions, civil penalties or criminal prosecution. There is also a continuing, annual program fee for any marketed product.
The FDA may withdraw approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information, requirements for post-market studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks, or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a REMS. Other potential consequences include, among other things:
•restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls; 
 •safety alerts, Dear Healthcare Provider letters, press releases or other communications containing warnings or other safety information about the product; 
 •mandated modification of promotional materials and labeling and issuance of corrective information; 


•fines, warning letters, or untitled letters; 
 •holds on clinical trials; 
 •refusal of the FDA to approve applications or supplements to approved applications, or suspension or revocation of product approvals; 
 •product recall, seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; 
 •injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties; and 
 •consent decrees, corporate integrity agreements, debarment or exclusion from federal healthcare programs. 
 United States Patent Term Restoration and Marketing Exclusivity
Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of FDA approval of our future product candidates, some of our United States patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, commonly referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Amendments. The Hatch-Waxman Amendments permit restoration of the patent term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during the FDA regulatory review process. Patent-term restoration, however, cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date and only those claims covering such approved drug product, a method for using it or a method for manufacturing it may be extended. The patent-term restoration period is generally one-half the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of an NDA or BLA plus the time between the submission date of an NDA or BLA and the approval of that application, except that the review period is reduced by any time during which the applicant failed to exercise due diligence. Only one patent applicable to an approved drug is eligible for the extension and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent. The USPTO, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration. In the future, we may apply for restoration of patent term for our currently owned or licensed patents to add patent life beyond its current expiration date, depending on the expected length of the clinical trials and other factors involved in the filing of the relevant NDA or BLA.
Regulatory exclusivity provisions under the FDCA also can delay the submission or the approval of certain applications. The FDCA provides a five-year period of non-patent marketing exclusivity within the United States to the first applicant to gain approval of an NDA for a new chemical entity. A drug is a new chemical entity if the FDA has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the action of the drug substance. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not accept for review an ANDA, or a 505(b)(2) NDA submitted by another company for another version of such drug where the applicant does not own or have a legal right of reference to all the data required for approval. However, an application may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement.
The FDCA also provides three years of exclusivity for an NDA, 505(b)(2) NDA or supplement to an existing NDA if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application, for example, new indications, dosages or strengths of an existing drug. This three-year exclusivity covers only the conditions of use associated with the new clinical investigations and does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs for drugs containing the original active agent for other conditions of use. Five-year and three-year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a full NDA. However, an applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to all of the preclinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness.
In addition, both drugs and biologics can also obtain pediatric exclusivity in the United States. Pediatric exclusivity, if granted, adds six months to existing exclusivity periods and patent terms. This six-month exclusivity, which runs from the end of other exclusivity protection or patent term, may be granted based on the voluntary completion of a pediatric study in accordance with an FDA-issued “Written Request” for such a study.
United States Biosimilars and Exclusivity
The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, or collectively, the ACA, signed into law in 2010, includes a subtitle called the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act, or BPCIA, which created an abbreviated approval pathway for biological products that are biosimilar to or interchangeable with an FDA-licensed reference biological product. The FDA has issued several guidance documents outlining an approach to review and approval of biosimilars in the United States. Biosimilarity, which requires that there be no clinically meaningful differences between the biological product and the reference product in terms of safety, purity, and potency, can be shown through analytical studies, animal studies, and a clinical study or studies. Interchangeability requires that a product is biosimilar to the reference product and the product must demonstrate that it can be expected to produce the same clinical results as the reference product in any given patient and, for products that are administered multiple times to an individual, the biologic and the reference biologic may be alternated or switched after one has been previously administered without increasing safety risks or risks of diminished efficacy relative to exclusive use of the reference biologic.
Under the BPCIA, a reference biological product is granted 12 years of data exclusivity from the time of first licensure of the product, and an application for a biosimilar product may not be submitted to the FDA until four years following the date that the reference product was first licensed by the FDA. In addition, the approval of a biosimilar product may not be made effective by the FDA until 12 years from the date on which the reference product was first licensed. During this 12-year period of exclusivity, another company may still market a competing version of the reference product if the FDA approves a full BLA for the competing product containing that applicant’s own preclinical data and data from adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to demonstrate the safety, purity and potency of its product. The BPCIA also created certain exclusivity periods for biosimilars approved as interchangeable products. At this juncture, it is unclear whether products deemed “interchangeable” by the FDA will, in fact, be readily substituted by pharmacies, which are governed by state pharmacy law.
The BPCIA is complex and continues to be interpreted and implemented by the FDA. In addition, government proposals have sought to reduce the 12-year reference product exclusivity period. Other aspects of the ACA, some of which may impact the BPCIA exclusivity provisions, have also been the subject of recent litigation. As a result, the ultimate impact, implementation, and regulatory interpretation of the BPCIA remain subject to significant uncertainty.
 Other United States Regulatory Matters
Manufacturing, sales, promotion and other activities of product candidates following product approval, where applicable, or commercialization are also subject to regulation by numerous regulatory authorities in the United States in addition to the FDA, which may include the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, other divisions of the Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, the Department of Justice, the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Consumer Product Safety Commission, the Federal Trade Commission, the Occupational Safety & Health Administration, the Environmental Protection Agency and state and local governments and governmental agencies.
Other Healthcare Laws in the United States
In the United States, healthcare providers, physicians, and third-party payors will play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of any products for which we obtain marketing approval. Our business operations and any current or future arrangements with third-party payors, healthcare providers and physicians may expose us to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations that may constrain the business or financial arrangements and relationships through which we develop, market, sell and distribute any drugs for which we obtain marketing approval. In the United States, these laws include, without limitation, state and federal anti-kickback, false claims, physician transparency, and patient data privacy and security laws and regulations, including but not limited to those described below.

•The federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons and entities from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, paying, receiving or providing any remuneration (including any kickback, bride, or certain rebate), directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward, or in return for, either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, any good or service, for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, under a federal healthcare program such as Medicare and Medicaid; a person or entity need not have actual knowledge of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. On December 2, 2020, OIG published further modifications to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute. Under the final rules, OIG added safe harbor protections under the Anti-Kickback Statute for certain coordinated care and value-based arrangements among clinicians, providers, and others, although the portion of the rule eliminating safe harbor protection for certain rebates related to the sale or purchase of a pharmaceutical product from a manufacturer to a plan sponsor under Medicare Part D was delayed to January 2026 under the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act. Implementation of the this change and new safe harbors for point-of-sale reductions in price for prescription pharmaceutical products and pharmacy benefit manager service fees are currently under review by the Biden administration and may be amended or repealed. We continue to evaluate what effect, if any, these rules will have on our business; 
 •The federal civil and criminal false claims laws, including the civil False Claims Act, or FCA, which prohibit individuals or entities from, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, to the federal government, claims for payment or approval that are false, fictitious or fraudulent; knowingly making, using, or causing to be made or used, a false statement or record material to a false or fraudulent claim or obligation to pay or transmit money or property to the federal government; or knowingly concealing or knowingly and improperly avoiding or decreasing an obligation to pay money to the federal government; 
 •Manufacturers can be held liable under the FCA even when they do not submit claims directly to government payors if they are deemed to “cause” the submission of false or fraudulent claims. In addition, the government may assert that a claim that includes items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the civil False Claims Act. The FCA also permits a private individual acting as a “whistleblower” to bring actions on behalf of the federal government alleging violations of the FCA and to share in any monetary recovery; 
 •The federal civil monetary penalties laws, which impose civil fines for, among other things, the offering or transfer or remuneration to a Medicare or state healthcare program beneficiary if the person knows or should know it is likely to influence the beneficiary’s selection of a particular provider, practitioner, or supplier of services reimbursable by Medicare or a state health care program, unless an exception applies; 
 •The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, imposes criminal and civil liability for knowingly and willfully executing a scheme, or attempting to execute a scheme, to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private payors, knowingly and willfully embezzling or stealing from a healthcare benefit program, willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a healthcare offense, or falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false statements in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity need not have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation; 
 •HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009, or HITECH, and their respective implementing regulations, imposes, among other things, specified requirements on covered entities and their business associates relating to the privacy and security of individually identifiable health information including mandatory contractual terms and required implementation of technical safeguards of such information. HITECH also created new tiers of civil monetary penalties, amended HIPAA to make civil and criminal penalties directly applicable to business associates in some cases, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorneys’ fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions; 
 •The Physician Payments Sunshine Act, enacted as part of the ACA, imposed new annual reporting requirements for certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics, and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid, or the Children’s Health Insurance Program, for certain payments and “transfers of value” provided to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors), physician assistants, nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, certified registered nurse anesthetists and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. In addition, many states also require reporting of payments or other transfers of value, many of which differ from each other in significant ways, are often not pre-empted, and may have a more prohibitive effect than the Sunshine Act, thus further complicating compliance efforts; and 


•Analogous state and foreign laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws, which may apply to sales or marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by non-governmental third party-payors, including private insurers, and may be broader in scope than their federal equivalents; state and foreign laws require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government or otherwise restrict payments that may be made to healthcare providers; state and foreign laws that require drug manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers, and restrict marketing practices or require disclosure of marketing expenditures and pricing information; state and local laws that require the registration of pharmaceutical sales representatives; state and foreign laws that govern the privacy and security of health information in some circumstances. These data privacy and security laws may differ from each other in significant ways and often are not pre-empted by HIPAA, which may complicate compliance efforts. 
  In addition, pharmaceutical manufacturers may also be subject to United States federal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws and regulations, which broadly regulate marketplace activities and that potentially harm consumers.
The distribution of drugs and biological products is subject to additional requirements and regulations, including extensive record-keeping, licensing, storage and security requirements intended to prevent the unauthorized sale of pharmaceutical products.
The full scope and enforcement of each of these laws is uncertain and subject to rapid change in the current environment of healthcare reform. Federal and state enforcement bodies have continued to increase their scrutiny of interactions between healthcare companies and healthcare providers, which has led to a number of investigations, prosecutions, convictions and settlements in the healthcare industry. It is possible that governmental authorities will conclude that our business practices do not comply with current or future statutes, regulations or case law involving applicable fraud and abuse or other healthcare laws and regulations. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of these laws or any other related governmental regulations that may apply to us, we may be subject to significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, fines, imprisonment, disgorgement, exclusion from government funded healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, reputational harm, additional oversight and reporting obligations if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or similar settlement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations. If any of the physicians or other healthcare providers or entities with whom we expect to do business is found to be not in compliance with applicable laws, they may be subject to similar actions, penalties and sanctions. Ensuring business arrangements comply with applicable healthcare laws, as well as responding to possible investigations by government authorities, can be time- and resource-consuming and can divert a company’s attention from its business.
 United States Coverage and Reimbursement
In the United States and markets in other countries, patients who are prescribed treatments for their conditions and providers performing the prescribed services generally rely on third-party payors to reimburse all or part of the associated healthcare costs. Thus, even if a product candidate is approved, sales of the product will depend, in part, on the extent to which third-party payors, including government health programs in the United States such as Medicare and Medicaid, commercial health insurers and managed care organizations, provide coverage, and establish adequate reimbursement levels for, the product. In the United States, no uniform policy of coverage and reimbursement for drug products exists among third-party payors. Therefore, coverage and reimbursement for drug products can differ significantly from payor to payor. The process for determining whether a third-party payor will provide coverage for a product may be separate from the process for setting the price or reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the product once coverage is approved. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged, examining the medical necessity, and reviewing the cost-effectiveness of medical products and services and imposing controls to manage costs. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific products on an approved list, also known as a formulary, which might not include all of the approved products for a particular indication.

In order to secure coverage and reimbursement for any product that might be approved for sale, a company may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of the product, in addition to the costs required to obtain FDA or other comparable regulatory approvals. Factors payors consider in determining reimbursement are based on whether the product is a covered benefit under its health plan; safe, effective and medically necessary; appropriate for the specific patient; cost-effective; and neither experimental nor investigational. Additionally, companies may also need to provide discounts to purchasers, private health plans or government healthcare programs. Nonetheless, product candidates may not be considered medically necessary or cost effective. A decision by a third-party payor not to cover a product could reduce physician utilization once the product is approved and have a material adverse effect on sales, our operations and financial condition. Additionally, a third-party payor’s decision to provide coverage for a product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Further, one payor’s determination to provide coverage for a product does not assure that other payors will also provide coverage and reimbursement for the product, and the level of coverage and reimbursement can differ significantly from payor to payor.
 The containment of healthcare costs has become a priority of federal, state and foreign governments, and the prices of products have been a focus in this effort. Governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit a company’s revenue generated from the sale of any approved products. Coverage policies and third-party payor reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which a company or its collaborators receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.
Healthcare Reform
In the United States and some foreign jurisdictions, there have been, and likely will continue to be, a number of legislative and regulatory changes and proposed changes regarding the healthcare system directed at broadening the availability of healthcare, improving the quality of healthcare, and containing or lowering the cost of healthcare. For example, in March 2010, the United States Congress enacted the ACA, which, among other things, subjected biologic products to potential competition by lower-cost biosimilars; addressed a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected; increased the minimum Medicaid rebates owed by most manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program; extended the Medicaid Drug Rebate program to utilization of prescriptions of individuals enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations; subjected manufacturers to new annual fees and taxes for certain branded prescription drugs; created a new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program, in which manufacturers must agree to offer 50% (increased to 70% pursuant to the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, effective as of January 1, 2019) point-of-sale discounts off negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition for the manufacturer’s outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D; and provided incentives to programs that increase the federal government’s comparative effectiveness research.
 Since its enactment, there have been numerous judicial, administrative, executive, and legislative challenges to certain aspects of the ACA, and we expect there will be additional challenges and amendments to the ACA in the future. Various portions of the ACA are currently undergoing legal and constitutional challenges in the United States Supreme Court and members of Congress have introduced several pieces of legislation aimed at significantly revising or repealing the ACA. The United States Supreme Court is expected to rule on a legal challenge to the constitutionality of the ACA in early 2021. The implementation of the ACA is ongoing, the law appears likely to continue the downward pressure on pharmaceutical pricing, especially under the Medicare program, and may also increase our regulatory burdens and operating costs. Litigation and legislation related to the ACA are likely to continue, with unpredictable and uncertain results.
 Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the ACA was enacted. In August 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011, among other things, included aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect in April 2013 and, due to subsequent legislative amendments to the statute, will remain in effect through 2030 unless additional Congressional action is taken. These will be suspended from May 1, 2020 through March 31, 2022 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, with a 1% reduction being reinstated from April 2022 through June 2022 and the full 2% reduction resuming thereafter, . In January 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 was signed into law, which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals, imaging centers and cancer treatment centers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years.

Moreover, payment methodologies may be subject to changes in healthcare legislation and regulatory initiatives. For example, in the United States, CMS may develop new payment and delivery models, such as bundled payment models. In addition, recently there has been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their commercial products, which has resulted in several Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted state and federal legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for pharmaceutical products. On March 10, 2020, the Trump administration sent “principles” for drug pricing to Congress, calling for legislation that would, among other things, cap Medicare Part D beneficiary out-of-pocket pharmacy expenses, provide an option to cap Medicare Part D beneficiary monthly out-of-pocket expenses, and place limits on pharmaceutical price increases. Further, the Trump administration previously released a “Blueprint” to lower drug prices and reduce out of pocket costs of drugs that contained proposals to increase drug manufacturer competition, increase the negotiating power of certain federal healthcare programs, incentivize manufacturers to lower the list price of their products, and reduce the out of pocket costs of drug products paid by consumers. HHS has already implemented certain measures. For example, in May 2019, CMS issued a final rule to allow Medicare Advantage Plans the option of using step therapy, a type of prior authorization, for Part B drugs beginning January 1, 2020. This final rule codified CMS’s policy change that was effective January 1, 2019. However, it is unclear whether the Biden administration will challenge, reverse, revoke or otherwise modify these executive and administrative actions. In addition, individual states in the United States have also increasingly passed legislation and implemented regulations designed to control pharmaceutical product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. In addition, it is possible that additional governmental action is taken to address the COVID-19 pandemic.
 Outside the United States, ensuring coverage and adequate payment for a product also involves challenges. Pricing of prescription pharmaceuticals is subject to government control in many countries. Pricing negotiations with government authorities can extend well beyond the receipt of regulatory approval for a product and may require a clinical trial that compares the cost-effectiveness of a product to other available therapies. The conduct of such a clinical trial could be expensive and result in delays in commercialization.
In the European Union, pricing and reimbursement schemes vary widely from country to country. Some countries provide that products may be marketed only after a reimbursement price has been agreed. Some countries may require the completion of additional studies that compare the cost-effectiveness of a particular product candidate to currently available therapies or so-called health technology assessments, in order to obtain reimbursement or pricing approval. For example, the European Union provides options for its member states to restrict the range of products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. European Union member states may approve a specific price for a product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the product on the market. Other member states allow companies to fix their own prices for products but monitor and control prescription volumes and issue guidance to physicians to limit prescriptions. Recently, many countries in the European Union have increased the amount of discounts required on pharmaceuticals and these efforts could continue as countries attempt to manage healthcare expenditures, especially in light of the severe fiscal and debt crises experienced by many countries in the European Union. The downward pressure on healthcare costs in general, particularly prescription products, has become intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. Political, economic and regulatory developments may further complicate pricing negotiations, and pricing negotiations may continue after reimbursement has been obtained. Reference pricing used by various European Union member states, and parallel trade, i.e., arbitrage between low-priced and high-priced member states, can further reduce prices. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any products, if approved in those countries.
Compliance with Other Federal and State Laws or Requirements; Changing Legal Requirements
If any products that we may develop are made available in the United States to authorized users of the Federal Supply Schedule of the General Services Administration, additional laws and requirements apply. Products must meet applicable child-resistant packaging requirements under the U.S. Poison Prevention Packaging Act. Manufacturing, labeling, packaging, distribution, sales, promotion and other activities also are potentially subject to federal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws, among other requirements to we may be subject.
The distribution of pharmaceutical products is subject to additional requirements and regulations, including extensive record-keeping, licensing, storage and security requirements intended to prevent the unauthorized sale of pharmaceutical products.

The failure to comply with any of these laws or regulatory requirements subjects firms to possible legal or regulatory action. Depending on the circumstances, failure to meet applicable regulatory requirements can result in criminal prosecution, fines or other penalties, injunctions, exclusion from federal healthcare programs, requests for recall, seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production, denial or withdrawal of product approvals, relabeling or repackaging, or refusal to allow a firm to enter into supply contracts, including government contracts. Any claim or action against us for violation of these laws, even if we successfully defend against it, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert our management’s attention from the operation of our business. Prohibitions or restrictions on marketing, sales or withdrawal of future products marketed by us could materially affect our business in an adverse way.
Changes in regulations, statutes or the interpretation of existing regulations could impact our business in the future by requiring, for example: (i) changes to our manufacturing arrangements; (ii) additions or modifications to product labeling or packaging; (iii) the recall or discontinuation of our products; or (iv) additional record-keeping requirements. If any such changes were to be imposed, they could adversely affect the operation of our business.
European Drug Development
In the European Union, our future products also may be subject to extensive regulatory requirements. As in the United States, medicinal products can be marketed only if a marketing authorization from the competent regulatory agencies has been obtained.
Similar to the United States, the various phases of preclinical and clinical research in the European Union are subject to significant regulatory controls. Although the EU Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC has sought to harmonize the EU clinical trials regulatory framework, setting out common rules for the control and authorization of clinical trials in the European Union, the EU Member States have transposed and applied the provisions of the Directive differently. This has led to significant variations in the Member State regimes. Under the current regime, before a clinical trial can be initiated it must be approved in each of the EU countries where the trial is to be conducted by two distinct bodies: the National Competent Authority, or NCA, and one or more Ethics Committees, or ECs. Under the current regime all suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions to the investigated drug that occur during the clinical trial have to be reported to the NCA and ECs of the Member State where they occurred.
The EU clinical trials legislation currently is undergoing a transition process mainly aimed at harmonizing and streamlining clinical-trial authorization, simplifying adverse-event reporting procedures, improving the supervision of clinical trials and increasing their transparency. In April 2014, the EU adopted a new Clinical Trials Regulation (EU) No 536/2014, which is set to replace the current Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC. It is expected that the new Clinical Trials Regulation (EU) No 536/2014 will apply following confirmation of full functionality of the Clinical Trials Information System (CTIS), the centralized EU portal and database for clinical trials foreseen by the Regulation, through an independent audit, currently expected to occur in December 2021. The new Regulation will be directly applicable in all Member States (and so does not require national implementing legislation in each Member State), and aims at simplifying and streamlining the approval of clinical studies in the EU, for instance by providing for a streamlined application procedure via a single point and strictly defined deadlines for the assessment of clinical study applications.
 We are in the process of applying to renew our status with EMA as a small and medium-sized enterprise, or SME. If we obtain SME status with EMA, it will provide access to administrative, regulatory and financial support, including fee reductions for scientific advice and regulatory procedures.

Much like the Anti-Kickback Statue prohibition in the United States, the provision of benefits or advantages to physicians to induce or encourage the prescription, recommendation, endorsement, purchase, supply, order or use of medicinal products is also prohibited in the European Union. The provision of benefits or advantages to induce or reward improper performance generally is governed by the national anti-bribery laws of European Union Member States, and the Bribery Act 2010 in the U.K. Infringement of these laws could result in substantial fines and imprisonment. EU Directive 2001/83/EC, which is the EU Directive governing medicinal products for human use, further provides that, where medicinal products are being promoted to persons qualified to prescribe or supply them, no gifts, pecuniary advantages or benefits in kind may be supplied, offered or promised to such persons unless they are inexpensive and relevant to the practice of medicine or pharmacy. This provision has been transposed into the Human Medicines Regulations 2012 and so remains applicable in the UK despite its departure from the EU.

Payments made to physicians in certain European Union Member States must be publicly disclosed. Moreover, agreements with physicians often must be the subject of prior notification and approval by the physician’s employer, his or her competent professional organization and/or the regulatory authorities of the individual EU Member States. These requirements are provided in the national laws, industry codes or professional codes of conduct, applicable in the EU Member States. Failure to comply with these requirements could result in reputational risk, public reprimands, administrative penalties, fines or imprisonment.
European Drug Review and Approval
In the European Economic Area, or EEA, which is comprised of the Member States of the European Union together with Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein, medicinal products can only be commercialized after obtaining a marketing authorization, or MA. There are two types of marketing authorizations.
•The centralized MA is issued by the European Commission through the centralized procedure, based on the opinion of the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, or CHMP, of the EMA, and is valid throughout the entire territory of the EEA. The centralized procedure is mandatory for certain types of products, such as biotechnology medicinal products, orphan medicinal products, advanced-therapy medicinal products (gene-therapy, somatic cell-therapy or tissue-engineered medicines) and medicinal products containing a new active substance indicated for the treatment of HIV, AIDS, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, diabetes, auto-immune and other immune dysfunctions and viral diseases. The centralized procedure is optional for products containing a new active substance not yet authorized in the EEA, or for products that constitute a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation or which are in the interest of public health in the European Union. Under the centralized procedure, the maximum timeframe for the evaluation of a MA application by the EMA is 210 days, excluding clock stops, when additional written or oral information is to be provided by the applicant in response to questions asked by the CHMP. Clock stops may extend the timeframe of evaluation of a MA application considerably beyond 210 days. Where the CHMP gives a positive opinion, the EMA provides the opinion together with supporting documentation to the European Commission, who make the final decision to grant a marketing authorization, which is issued within 67 days of receipt of the EMA’s recommendation. Accelerated assessment might be granted by the CHMP in exceptional cases, when a medicinal product is expected to be of a major public health interest, particularly from the point of view of therapeutic innovation. The timeframe for the evaluation of a MA application under the accelerated assessment procedure is of 150 days, excluding stop-clocks, but it is possible that the CHMP may revert to the standard time limit for the centralized procedure if it determines that the application is no longer appropriate to conduct an accelerated assessment.
 •National MAs, which are issued by the competent authorities of the Member States of the EEA and only cover their respective territory, are available for products not falling within the mandatory scope of the centralized procedure. Where a product has already been authorized for marketing in a Member State of the EEA, this national MA can be recognized in other Member States through the mutual recognition procedure. If the product has not received a national MA in any Member State at the time of application, it can be approved simultaneously in various Member States through the decentralized procedure. Under the decentralized procedure, an identical dossier is submitted to the competent authorities of each of the Member States in which the MA is sought, one of which is selected by the applicant as the Reference Member State, or RMS. The competent authority of the RMS prepares a draft assessment report, a draft summary of the product characteristics, or SmPC, and a draft of the labeling and package leaflet, which are sent to the other Member States (referred to as the Concerned Member States, or CMSs) for their approval. If the Member States Concerned raise no objections, based on a potential serious risk to public health, to the assessment, SmPC, labeling, or packaging proposed by the RMS, the product is subsequently granted a national MA in all the Member States (i.e., in the RMS and the CMSs). 
 Under the procedures described above, before granting the MA, the EMA or the competent authorities of the Member States of the EEA make an assessment of the risk-benefit balance of the product on the basis of scientific criteria concerning its quality, safety and efficacy.


Now that the UK (which comprises Great Britain and Northern Ireland) has left the EU, Great Britain will no longer be covered by centralized MAs (under the Northern Irish Protocol, centralized MAs will continue to be recognized in Northern Ireland). All medicinal products with a current centralized MA were automatically converted to Great Britain MAs on January 1, 2021. For a period of two years from January 1, 2021, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency, or MHRA, the UK medicines regulator, may rely on a decision taken by the European Commission on the approval of a new marketing authorization in the centralized procedure, in order to more quickly grant a new Great Britain MA. A separate application will, however, still be required.
European Data and Marketing Exclusivity
In the EEA, innovative medicinal products (including both small molecules and biological medicinal products), sometimes qualify for eight years of data exclusivity upon marketing authorization and an additional two years of market exclusivity. The data exclusivity, if granted, prevents generic or biosimilar applicants from referencing the innovator’s preclinical and clinical trial data contained in the dossier of the reference product when applying for a generic or biosimilar marketing authorization, for a period of eight years from the date on which the reference product was first authorized in the EEA. During the additional two-year period of market exclusivity. During the additional two-year period of market exclusivity, a generic or biosimilar marketing authorization can be submitted, and the innovator’s data may be referenced, but no generic or biosimilar product can be marketed until the expiration of the market exclusivity period. The overall ten-year period will be extended to a maximum of 11 years if, during the first eight years of those ten years, the marketing authorization holder obtains an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications which, during the scientific evaluation prior to their authorization, are determined to bring a significant clinical benefit in comparison with currently approved therapies.
European Orphan Designation and Exclusivity
In the EEA, the EMA’s Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products grants orphan drug designation to promote the development of products that are intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of life-threatening or chronically debilitating conditions which either affect not more than 5 in 10,000 persons in the European Union community, or where it is unlikely that the development of the medicine would generate sufficient return to justify the necessary investment in its development. In each case, no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention or treatment must have been authorized (or, if such a method exists, the product in question would be of significant benefit to those affected by the condition).
In the EEA, orphan drug designation entitles a party to financial incentives such as reduction of fees or fee waivers and ten years of market exclusivity is granted following marketing approval for the orphan product. This period may be reduced to six years if, at the end of the fifth year, it is established that the orphan drug designation criteria are no longer met, including where it is shown that the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity. During the period of market exclusivity, marketing authorization may only be granted to a “similar medicinal product” for the same therapeutic indication if: (i) a second applicant can establish that its product, although similar to the authorized product, is safer, more effective or otherwise clinically superior; (ii) the marketing authorization holder for the authorized product consents to a second orphan medicinal product application; or (iii) the marketing authorization holder for the authorized product cannot supply enough orphan medicinal product. A “similar medicinal product” is defined as a medicinal product containing a similar active substance or substances as contained in an authorized orphan medicinal product, and which is intended for the same therapeutic indication. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an application for marketing approval. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process.
European Pediatric Investigation Plan
In the EEA, companies developing a new medicinal product must agree upon a pediatric investigation plan, or PIP, with the EMA’s Pediatric Committee, or PDCO, and must conduct pediatric clinical trials in accordance with that PIP, unless a waiver applies. The PIP sets out the timing and measures proposed to generate data to support a pediatric indication of the drug for which marketing authorization is being sought. The PDCO can grant a deferral of the obligation to implement some or all of the measures of the PIP until there are sufficient data to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of the product in adults. Further, the obligation to provide pediatric clinical trial data can be waived by the PDCO when this data is not needed or appropriate because the product is likely to be ineffective or unsafe in children, the disease or condition for which the product is intended occurs only in adult populations, or when the product does not represent a significant therapeutic benefit over existing treatments for pediatric patients. Products that are granted a marketing authorization with the results of the pediatric clinical trials conducted in accordance with the PIP (even where such results are negative) are eligible for six months’ supplementary protection certificate extension (if any is in effect at the time of approval). In the case of orphan medicinal products, a two year extension of the orphan market exclusivity may be available. This pediatric reward is subject to specific conditions and is not automatically available when data in compliance with the PIP are developed and submitted.
Brexit and the Regulatory Framework in the United Kingdom
In June 2016, the electorate in the UK voted in favor of leaving the EU (commonly referred to as “Brexit”). Thereafter, in March 2017, the country formally notified the EU of its intention to withdraw pursuant to Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty and the UK formally left the EU on January 31, 2020. A transition period began on February 1, 2020, during which EU pharmaceutical law remained applicable to the UK, which ended on December 31, 2020. Since the regulatory framework in the UK covering the quality, safety and efficacy of medicinal products, clinical trials, marketing authorization, commercial sales and distribution of medicinal products is derived from EU Directives and Regulations, Brexit could materially impact the future regulatory regime which applies to products and the approval of product candidates in the UK, as UK legislation now has the potential to diverge from EU legislation. It remains to be seen how Brexit will impact regulatory requirements for product candidates and products in the UK in the long-term. The MHRA, the UK medicines and medical devices regulator, has recently published detailed guidance for industry and organizations to follow from January 1, 2021 now the transition period is over, which will be updated as the UK’s regulatory position on medicinal products evolves over time.
 European Data Collection
The collection and use of personal health data in the European Economic Area, or the EEA, governed by the GDPR, which became effective May 25, 2018. The GDPR applies to any company established in the EEA and to companies established outside the EEA that process personal data in connection with the offering of goods or services to data subjects in the EU or the monitoring of the behavior of data subjects in the European Union. The GDPR enhances data protection obligations for data controllers of personal data, including stringent requirements relating to the consent of data subjects, expanded disclosures about how personal data is used, requirements to conduct privacy impact assessments for “high risk” processing, limitations on retention of personal data, special provisions for “sensitive information” including health and genetic information of data subjects, mandatory data breach notification and “privacy by design” requirements, and direct obligations on service providers acting as data processors. The GDPR also imposes strict rules on the transfer of personal data outside of the EEA to countries that do not ensure an adequate level of protection, like the U.S. Failure to comply with the requirements of the GDPR and the related national data protection laws of the EEA Member States may result in fines up to 20 million euros or 4% of a company’s global annual revenues for the preceding financial year, whichever is higher. Moreover, the GDPR grants data subjects the right to request deletion of personal information in certain circumstances, and claim material and non-material damages resulting from infringement of the GDPR. Given the breadth and depth of changes in data protection obligations, maintaining compliance with the GDPR, will require significant time, resources and expense, and we may be required to put in place additional mechanisms ensuring compliance with the new data protection rules. This may be onerous and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects.
