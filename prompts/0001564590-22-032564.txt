Item 1. | Business
--------+---------

Overview
 
We are a global multi-crop, middle-market agricultural company. We are market leaders in the breeding, production and sale of alfalfa seed and sorghum seed. We also have a commercial market presence in sunflower, wheat and pasture seed and maintain an active stevia development program.
 Our seed platform develops and supplies high quality germplasm designed to produce higher yields for farmers worldwide. We sell over 500 seed products in more than 40 countries. We maintain an active product pipeline and expect to introduce more than 20 new products during the fiscal year 2023.
 Founded in 1980, we began our operations as a limited producer of non-dormant alfalfa seed varieties bred for warm climates and high-yields, including varieties that can thrive in poor, saline soils. Over the years we have built a diversified, global agricultural platform through a combination of organic growth and strategic acquisitions and collaborations, including:
 
 
• | Our 2012 acquisition of Imperial Valley Seeds, Inc., which enabled us to expand production of non-GMO alfalfa seed into California's Imperial Valley, thereby ensuring a non-GMO uncontaminated source of alfalfa seed due to the prohibition on growing GMO crops in the Imperial Valley, as well as enabling us to diversify our production areas and distribution channels;

• | Our 2012 acquisition of a portfolio of dormant alfalfa germplasm, which launched our entry into the dormant alfalfa market;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Our 2013 acquisition of Seed Genetics International Pty Ltd (now S&W Seed Company Australia Pty Ltd, or S&W Australia), the leading producer of non-dormant alfalfa seed in South Australia, which made us the largest non-dormant alfalfa seed company in the world, with production capabilities in both hemispheres;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Our 2014 acquisition of alfalfa production and research facility assets and conventional (non-GMO) alfalfa germplasm from Pioneer Hi-Bred International, Inc., or Pioneer (now a subsidiary of Corteva Agriscience, Inc., or Corteva), which substantially broadened and improved our dormant alfalfa germplasm portfolio and deepened our production, research and product development capabilities;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Our 2016 acquisition of the business and assets of SV Genetics Pty Ltd, a developer of proprietary hybrid sorghum and sunflower seed germplasm, which expanded our crop focus into two areas which we believe have global growth potential;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Our 2018 acquisition of the assets of Chromatin, Inc. and related companies, which positioned us to become a global leader in the hybrid sorghum seed market and enhanced our distribution channels both internationally and within a U.S.-based dealer and distributor network;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Our 2018 joint venture with AGT Foods Africa Proprietary Limited and 2019 joint venture with Zaad Holdings Limited, both based in South Africa, each of which were formed to produce our hybrid sunflower, grain sorghum and forage sorghum seed in Africa for sale in Africa, the Middle East and Europe;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Our 2019 license of commercialized and developmental wheat germplasm from Corteva, through which we entered the largest grain crop market in Australia;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Our 2020 acquisition of Pasture Genetics Pty Ltd., or Pasture Genetics, the third largest pasture seed company in Australia, which further diversified our product offerings in Australia and strengthened our Australian sales team and distribution relationships;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Our 2020 collaboration with ADAMA Ltd., or ADAMA, a subsidiary of China National Chemical Engineering Co Ltd., or ChemChina, to bring to the U.S. sorghum market the Double Team™ post emerge weed management system, consisting of ADAMA’s proprietary herbicides and our non-GMO, herbicide tolerant sorghum hybrids; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Our 2020 licensing agreement with The Agricultural Alumni Seed Improvement Association, Inc., an affiliate of Purdue University in West Lafayette, IN, to develop and commercialize worldwide a non-GMO, dhurrin-

free trait in sorghum species, which aims to eliminate the risk of grazing livestock illness and death from prussic acid that develops naturally in traditional sorghum varieties under certain conditions.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our Strategy
 The global agriculture market is experiencing rapid change driven by population growth, increasing consumer demand and emerging markets, environmental challenges, limited availability of arable land and diverse regulatory requirements. As a result, farmers and other industry participants are facing continuous pressure to cost-effectively increase productivity and output. These and certain other factors have led to strategic realignments and significant consolidation in the seed industry, leaving a small number of large players.
 We believe this environment presents an opportunity to build a global agricultural company focused on crop and market opportunities that large seed companies may overlook, underserve or ineffectively address.
 We believe our core strengths listed below position us to capitalize on this market opportunity:
 
 
• | Strong Germplasm Asset Base and Development Capabilities. We believe we have the largest and most diversified alfalfa and sorghum germplasm pool in the world. Our germplasm pool offers traits sought by farmers who grow forage hay, forage sorghum and grain sorghum, including high yield, drought tolerance and disease tolerance. We continue to invest in research and development programs in the United States, Australia and South America with an emphasis on driving trait improvement across all of our crop categories.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Cost-Efficient Global Supply Chain. We produce seed in the Western United States, Canada, Australia and South Africa under contract with select third-party growers. We currently maintain approximately 200 grower relationships, many of which are longstanding. Our global, but localized, production capabilities allow us to produce seed close to the customer to ensure the seed product is developed specifically for the conditions and requirements of that customer’s region and produced at low cost. We condition and package seed primarily in our own facilities located in Idaho, Texas and Australia. We believe that direct ownership of our production facility assets gives us more flexibility to react to demand changes unique to each geography, greater control over product quality and a lower cost structure.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Global Distribution Capabilities and Relationships. We sell our seed through one of the industry’s largest networks of distributors and dealers, reaching more than 40 countries. In the United States, we believe that our dealer and distributor network, unique among middle-market seed companies, provides a platform to support sales growth across crop categories. In Australia, we recently enhanced our sales and distribution capabilities through our acquisition of Pasture Genetics. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Deep Industry Expertise. We believe that our management team has deep industry experience and a demonstrated record of success that is unmatched for a seed industry company of our size. Our leadership team includes both proven industry executives recruited to our company and top talent acquired through our various acquisitions. Mark Wong, our Chief Executive Officer, has over 40 years of senior executive experience in the agriculture industry and has successfully built, operated, and sold multiple seed companies to industry leaders across multiple crops, including sorghum, corn, soybeans, and vegetables.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Our goal is to be a leading multi-crop, middle-market agricultural company; delivering value to our customers and strong financial returns to our shareholders.  To reach our goal, we have prioritized the following strategic initiatives:
 
 
• | Focus on Key Products that Address Unmet Market Needs. We expect to introduce more than 20 new products during the fiscal year 2023 across our current crop offerings. We also plan to continue development activities aimed to generate high-value, improved traits in our crops and to begin commercialization of seed products carrying those traits. We completed a Spring 2022 commercial launch of sorghum hybrids incorporating our proprietary, patent-pending herbicide tolerant trait as part of our Double Team™ collaboration with ADAMA. We are also developing and testing new sorghum products absent of dhurrin, a precursor to prussic acid, a known toxin which can negatively impact animal health when sorghum plants are grazed.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Build Our Multi-Channel Distribution Network and Execute on International Cross-Selling Opportunities. Our organization is aligned across geographic lines, as opposed to product lines. We believe that this structure allows us to make the best use of distribution assets like our United States dealer and distributor network and 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

our Australian sales force (recently expanded by our acquisition of Pasture Genetics) and to unlock potential sales synergies through international cross-selling of products. We believe that a robust, diverse distribution network will allow us to continue to evolve beyond our historical dependence on certain geographical markets which carry higher political, regulatory and economic risks.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Exploit International Production Capability for Best-In Class Cost Structure. Our streamlined international supply chain provides us with flexibility in sourcing product to meet customer needs. We are focused on exploiting this ability to shift production to low-cost areas to both support our competitive position and improve our margins.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Commercialize Stevia. We believe that an opportunity exists to bring to market new stevia varieties that can both meet consumer taste requirements and have yield quality that would enable farmers to profitably grow stevia in North and South America. We plan to leverage our proprietary stevia germplasm to form collaborations and commercial agreements with supply chain partners to create a U.S.-based stevia production industry for high-quality stevia sweetener with superior taste profiles that would supply major customers in the U.S. market.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Enter the Camelina Market. We are an integrated global seed company with specific expertise in breeding, production, sales and distribution of small seeded and specialty crops, including camelina, which we believe are highly desirable for biofuel production. We expect to plant 300 acres of camelina in calendar year 2022 for seed harvest in 2023. It is our goal to enter the camelina market as a seed and technology provider; the industry has seen multiple transactions that we believe provide a potential future roadmap for S&W.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our Current Crops
 
Alfalfa 
 
The Alfalfa Market. Alfalfa seed is primarily used for growing alfalfa hay, which is grown throughout the world as “forage” for livestock, including dairy and beef cattle, horses and sheep. The alfalfa industry (and therefore the alfalfa seed industry) is highly dependent on the dairy industry, which is the largest consumer of alfalfa hay. As the global middle class expands and emerging markets adopt a diet with higher protein consumption, we expect the demand for alfalfa production around the world to increase.
 We estimate that current global alfalfa hay crop production is 200 million metric tons per year and that global annual alfalfa seed sales are approximately $500 million.   
 S&W’s Alfalfa Seed Portfolio. Our current portfolio of over 200 commercialized alfalfa seed products spans both non-dormant varieties, which grow year-round, and dormant varieties, which have adapted to cold climates by going dormant during periods when frost or snow conditions would otherwise kill them. Our specialty is high-yield alfalfa varieties with a wide range of adaptation across many growing environments. Our alfalfa seed products include varieties that exhibit the traits that farmers most value, such as high yield, root rot resistance, lodging resistance, salt tolerance, drought tolerance, leafhopper resistance and stem nematode resistance.
 Over the past several years dormant alfalfa replant acreage in North America has trended downward, resulting in lower market size and corresponding seed sales for all companies in the sector. As a result, we have reduced our R&D expenditures in support of the dormant alfalfa market and have diverted those R&D assets towards bioenergy/cover crop development.
 Sorghum
 The Sorghum Market. Sorghum comes in two types, forage and grain. Forage sorghum utilizes the whole plant fed to livestock through grazing, dried hay or sileage. Grain sorghum is bred and managed to maximize production of the seed or grain. While grain from sorghum has been traditionally used for livestock feed and in ethanol production, sorghum is gaining popularity as a substitute for wheat and other grains in food products due to its gluten-free characteristics, as well as its antioxidant, high protein, low fat, high fiber and non-GMO properties. Additionally, the pet food industry has been increasing its use of grain sorghum due to its nutritional benefits and enhanced digestibility. Sorghum requires less water to grow than many other crops and is generally used as a replacement for 
 5


corn and other grains in areas where water is scarce. S&W’s primary markets are currently in the Americas, Europe and Australia where sorghum is grown commercially and requires high quality hybrid seed.
 Global sorghum crop production is estimated to be 60 million metric tons per year.  Approximately half of this production is in Africa and South Asia using farmer-saved seed and the remainder produced in the Americas, Europe and Australia using commercial hybrid seed. We estimate that global annual sorghum seed sales are approximately $500 million.
 S&W’s Sorghum Portfolio. Our current portfolio of approximately 40 commercialized sorghum seed products includes both forage and grain sorghum. We believe that many of our sorghum hybrids are unmatched and consistently out-yield competitor products in select markets.
 We plan to launch two new conventional grain sorghum hybrids in fiscal year 2023 to replace aging products in our portfolio. For our technology trait product lines, we plan to launch in fiscal year 2023 at least one new dhurrin-free hybrid in collaboration with The Agricultural Alumni Seed Improvement Association, Inc., an affiliate of Purdue University in West Lafayette, Indiana. We plan to offer four Double Team™ grain sorghum hybrids with sufficient supply to address the potential significant growth in the herbicide trait sector. 
 Sunflower
 The Sunflower Market. Sunflowers have multiple uses including oil, birdseed and human consumption. Our current sunflower seed focus is on hybrids best suited for the oil market. Sunflower oil is light in taste and appearance and supplies more Vitamin E than any other vegetable oil. It is a combination of monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats with low saturated fat levels. The versatility of this healthy oil is recognized by cooks internationally, valued for its frying performance and health benefits. With multiple types of sunflower oils available, it meets the needs of consumer and food manufacturers alike for a healthy and high performance non-transgenic vegetable oil. Additionally, sunflower is being sought after as a source of non-GMO oils. 
 The USDA projects global sunflower seed production for 2022/2023 at 50 million metric tons per year. We estimate that global annual sunflower seed sales are approximately $750 million to $1 billion.
 S&W’s Sunflower Portfolio. We currently have approximately six high-yield sunflower hybrids in the market. As part of our strategic review of our operations announced in May 2022, during fiscal year 2022 we ceased our sunflower research and development program in Europe and scaled back our program in Australia.
Australian Wheat
 The Wheat Market in Australia. Wheat is Australia's largest grain crop. Australia produces around 24.3 million tons of wheat annually, with approximately 70% exported to Southeast Asian countries and the Middle East and North Africa region.
 The wheat market in Australia operates under an end point royalty, or EPR, system in which the wheat variety owner earns a fixed royalty on every ton of grain produced. The applicable EPR varies by variety, but typically ranges from $2 to $4 per metric ton. Under EPR systems, variety owners such as us do not produce or hold commercial seed inventories or sell seed. Industry partners increase commercial quantities of planting seed and distribute to growers. Varieties are tracked along the supply chain and, when grain is ultimately delivered to the grain buyer or end user, the EPR is collected and delivered to the variety owner.
 We estimate that total end point royalties paid to wheat variety owners in Australia are approximately $70 million per year.
 S&W’s Wheat Portfolio. In 2019, under an exclusive, prepaid license from Corteva Agriscience, S&W acquired rights to a group of commercialized and development wheat varieties which are the result of an estimated $17 million development program investment. We currently have six wheat varieties commercially available in the Australian market. Our breeding program is focused on new dual purpose varieties which we believe have the potential to offer a number of benefits to Australian wheat growers as compared to existing commercial varieties, including forage potential, superior disease resistance, superior yields and grain quality to suit the diverse Australian conditions.

In May 2022, we entered into preliminary, nonbinding discussions with Trigall Genetics, a leader in transgenic wheat, to potentially combine our wheat operations through the creation of a joint venture in Australia. While we believe this joint venture could be beneficial in a number of respects, there can be no assurance that these preliminary, nonbinding discussions will result in a consummated transaction.
 Pasture Seeds
 The Pasture Seed Market in Australia. In addition to alfalfa, the pasture seed market in Australia includes medic, clovers, vetch, forage cereals, and certain grasses. Key customers include beef cattle, sheep and dairy farmers, silage, hay and chaff producers. We estimate that annual pasture seed sales in Australia are approximately $100 million.
 S&W’s Pasture Seed Portfolio. After our February 2020 acquisition of Pasture Genetics, we currently offer over 300 pasture seed products in the Australian market.   
 Stevia
 Stevia and the Sweetener Industry. Stevia leaf and its refined products are a natural, non-caloric high intensity sweetener. The incorporation of stevia-derived extracts into foods and beverages in the U.S. has seen a rapid increase since the beginning of 2009, when stevia was first introduced as a sweetener alternative to sugar and approved by the FDA as generally recognized as safe. In the U.S., approximately 70% of all new products formulated with stevia are beverages, with the remainder split between diverse categories, including dairy products and baked goods. Currently, the majority of global commercial stevia production occurs in Asia (particularly, in China), as current varieties lack adaptive characteristics that would permit farmers to profitably grow them in other global agricultural regions.
 We estimate the annual market value of stevia as an additive to foods and beverages to be $565 million. 
 S&W’s Stevia Program. Since 2009, our stevia research and development program has focused on developing stevia into a U.S.-grown crop. Our program has generated four patented varieties, and we are working closely with potential supply chain collaborators and customers to develop more advanced varieties that can both meet taste requirements of consumers and have field performance that would enable farmers to profitably grow stevia in the United States. In early 2019, we opened a dedicated stevia field breeding station in Tifton, GA to further support the breeding effort and select new varieties adapted to the Southeast growing regions targeted for initial cultivation of stevia in the United States.
 In September 2021, we entered into a Pilot Program Supply Agreement with Ingredion Incorporated to develop a U.S.-based production and supply chain for stevia leaf using S&W’s propriety stevia genetics. The first plantings in the southeastern United States to support that agreement began in October 2021 and will continue to expand over the next several years. Additionally, we house and maintain under a services agreement the stevia genetics program of Heartland Food Products Group at our field breeding station in Tifton, Georgia.
 Camelina
 The Camelina Market in the U.S. Camelina is a short-season crop that can be produced during fallow periods in many row crop rotations. It is a feed stock that can be used to generate biofuel and biodegradable bioplastic, with its oil having one of the lowest carbon intensity scores of diesel feedstock crop alternatives.
 S&W’s Camelina Program. We expect to plant 300 acres of camelina in calendar year 2022 for seed harvest in 2023. It is our goal to enter the camelina market as a seed and technology provider; the industry has seen multiple transactions that we believe provide a potential future roadmap for S&W.

Product Development
 We believe a successful seed business in the modern era should deliver a combination of two types of products: (i) traditional products of high quality seed with genetics for high yield and end-use quality, appropriate disease and insect tolerance, and other agronomic characteristics; and (ii) differentiated products with high value proprietary traits that offer unique value for farmers or consumers and thus capture both market share and higher prices.
 We develop the first product type, which is based on good agronomic performance, in our breeding programs at multiple locations in the United States and Australia and through collaborations in South America and Europe. These programs utilize state of the art equipment and experimental design and data analysis for field evaluation and track important agronomic traits using molecular genetic markers. Developing improved genetics for agronomic performance can take 5 to 15 years, depending on the species and specific genetic improvement targets. By maintaining a full R&D pipeline of genotypes in all stages of development, we believe we can deliver new varieties each year with incremental improvements over previous varieties.
 We develop the second product type, which emphasizes valuable and unique traits, both in-house and through exclusive collaborations. The recently launched Double Team™ product was developed entirely in-house through our DNA and Tissue Culture Lab in Texas. We also developed an improved forage quality alfalfa product through our exclusive arrangement with Calyxt. Our dhurrin-free trait, expected to launch in fiscal 2023 was developed through an exclusive arrangement with The Agricultural Alumni Seed Improvement Association, Inc., an affiliate of Purdue University in West Lafayette, Indiana. Our lab and technology personnel are focused on maintaining a continuous pipeline of traits that can be used to build value and market share in both company and private label brands and through out-licensing to other seed companies on a royalty basis. For example, we completed our first out-license of Double Team™ technology to in June 2022.
 Sales, Marketing and Distribution
 We currently sell over 500 seed products in more than 40 countries. Our principal markets for alfalfa sales are the United States, Canada, Mexico, South America, the Middle East, North Africa, and Australia. Our sorghum sales are focused in the United States, Mexico, Australia, Europe and South Africa. Our sunflower sales are primarily in Europe, Asia and Australia. Our wheat and pasture seed sales are focused in Australia.
 Our organization is structured across geographic lines, as opposed to product lines, which we believe allows us to make the best use of distribution assets (like our U.S. dealer and distributor network and our Australian sales force) and unlock potential sales synergies through international cross-selling of products. 
 Today we primarily sell our seed products under the S&W brand or other brands we own, such as Alfalfa Partners ™ and Sorghum Partners®. Private-label and licensing is an important part of our distribution strategy going forward.
 Our customers are primarily distributors and dealers. Our distributors and dealers, in turn, sell to farmers. We believe that selling through dealers and distributors enables our products to reach growers in areas where there are geographic or other constraints on direct sales efforts. We select dealers and distributors based on shared vision, technical expertise, local market knowledge and financial stability. Over the years, we have built dealer/distributor loyalty through an emphasis on service, access to breeders, ongoing training and promotional material support. We limit the number of dealers and distributors with whom we have relationships in any particular area in order to provide adequate support and opportunity to those with whom we choose to do business.
 Both farmers and dealers use pest-control advisors who recommend the varieties or hybrids that will produce the best results in a particular location. Therefore, a key part of our marketing strategy is to educate the consultants, as well as the farmers, as to benefits of our seed varieties and hybrids.
 8


We believe that our best marketing tool is the dissemination of information regarding the quality and characteristics of our propriety seed products to those persons who make the growing decisions. We continue to place advertisements in trade journals, agriculture publications, social media and participate in seed industry conferences and trade shows and engage in various other educational and outreach programs as we deem appropriate.
 Our sales efforts have historically involved significant in-person interaction with potential customers and distributors. In March 2020, at the beginning of what is typically our most active selling period, many national, state and local governments in our target markets implemented various stay-at-home, shelter-in-place and other quarantine measures in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result, we immediately attempted to shift our sales activities to video conferencing and similar customer interaction models but found these alternative approaches to generally be less effective than in-person sales efforts, and we believe this has contributed to decreased sales and a negative impact on our business and financial results in prior periods. We have since resumed in-person marketing but may be unable to achieve the quality of interactions prior to the start of the pandemic due to the ongoing nature of the pandemic and adjustments in customer and distributor interactions.
 Seed Production
 We produce seed in the United States, Canada, Australia and South Africa under contract with select third-party contract growers. We currently maintain approximately 200 grower relationships. Our network of growers has the expertise needed to successfully grow high quality seed products. We have worked with many of the same growers on a long-term basis, and we believe that we have strong relationships with them. We allocate our seed production among our growers so that we can purchase the proper mix of seed each year. Our contracts with growers have terms ranging from one to seven years, depending on the crop and the production area. Our global, but localized, production capabilities allow us to produce close to the customer to ensure the seed product is developed specifically for the conditions and requirements of that region and is produced at the lowest cost. 
 We condition and package seed primarily in our own facilities located in Idaho, Texas and Australia; although in some markets (for example, California) we use third-party processing services. We believe that direct ownership of production facility assets gives us more flexibility to respond to demand changes unique to each geography, greater control over product quality and a lower cost structure.   
 Seasonality
 We contract with growers based upon our anticipated market demand. We mill, clean and stock the seed during the harvest season and ship from inventory throughout the year. However, our seed business is seasonal. In the Northern hemisphere, production and harvest occurs from March through September and processing and shipping finished goods primarily occurs from October through May. In the Southern hemisphere, production and harvest occurs from October through March and processing and shipping primarily occurs from March through August.
Proprietary Rights
 Ownership of and access to intellectual property rights are important to us. We sell proprietary seed varieties and hybrids that have been specially selected to manifest the traits we deem best suited to particular regions in which our seed is planted. Our ability to compete effectively is dependent upon the proprietary nature of the seeds, seedlings, processes, technologies and materials owned by or used by us or our growers. Our competitive position would be adversely affected if any competitors independently were to develop any technologies that substantially equal or surpass our own. 
 In some cases, we obtain patent protection or plant breeder rights registrations for certain of our seed products.   However, our principal method of guarding our proprietary varieties and hybrids is exercising a high degree of control over the supply chain. As part of this control process, we require our growers to deliver back to us all seed derived from our proprietary varieties and, in the case, of hybrids, limit supply of parent seed that enables hybrid production. Historically, we have found that these control mechanisms have been an effective means to protect our proprietary seed. However, because we often do not have more formal proprietary rights protections, it would be possible for persons with access to our seed or plants grown from our seed to reproduce proprietary seed, which could significantly harm our business and our reputation. 
 9


Competition
 Competition in the seed industry both domestically and internationally is intense, and we believe it is intensifying with industry consolidation. We believe that the key competitive drivers in the industry are proven performance, customer support in the field and value, which takes into account not simply the price of the seed but also performance in the field.
 We face direct competition by other seed companies, including multinational agriculture companies, regional seed companies and small family-owned businesses, as well as subsidiaries or other affiliates of chemical, pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. Our principal competitors include:
  
• | Alfalfa. In the U.S. market, our principal competitors in our alfalfa seed business are Forage Genetics International (a subsidiary of Land O’ Lakes, Inc.), Pioneer and Alforex Seeds (subsidiaries of Corteva), and Pacific International Seed Company, Inc. In the Australian market, competitors in the proprietary alfalfa seed market include the Barenbrug Group and DLF Australia. In Australia, we also face competition from smaller companies offering non-proprietary seed.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Sorghum. Our principal competitors in sorghum are Pioneer, DeKalb (a subsidiary of Bayer), Pacific Seeds (a division of Advanta), and Nuseed.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Sunflower. Our principal competitors in sunflower are Pioneer, Nuseed, Dyna-Gro Seed (a subsidiary of Nutrien Ag Solutions), Syngenta AG, Advanta and Limagrain.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Australian Wheat. Our principal competitors in the Australian wheat market are AGT, LongReach Plant Breeders Pty Ltd., and InterGrain.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Pasture Seed. Our principal competitors in the Australian pasture seed market are the Barenbrug Group, DLF Australia and Seedforce, a subsidiary of RAGT.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Many of our existing and potential competitors have substantially greater research and product development capabilities and financial, marketing and human resources than we do. As a result, these competitors may:
  
• | succeed in developing products that are equal to or superior to our products or potential products or that achieve greater market acceptance than our products or potential products;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | devote greater resources to developing, marketing or selling their products;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies or scientific advances and changes in customer requirements, which could render our products or potential products obsolete or less preferable;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | obtain patents that block or otherwise inhibit our ability to develop and commercialize potential products we might otherwise develop;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | withstand price competition more successfully than we can;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------


• | establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties that enhance their ability to address the needs of our customers or prospective customers; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | take advantage of acquisition or other opportunities more readily than we can.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Environmental and Regulatory Matters
 Our agricultural operations are subject to a broad range of evolving environmental laws and regulations applicable to the markets in which we operate. These environmental laws and regulations are intended to address concerns related to air quality, storm water discharge and management and disposal of agricultural chemicals relating to seed treatment. 
 Compliance with these laws and related regulations is an ongoing process that does not, and is not expected to, have a material effect on our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position. Environmental concerns are, however, inherent in most major agricultural operations, including those conducted by us, and there can be no assurance that the cost of compliance with environmental laws and regulations will not be material. Moreover, it is possible that future developments, such as increasingly strict environmental laws and enforcement policies thereunder, and further restrictions on the use of agricultural chemicals, could result in increased compliance costs.
 10


We also are subject to various laws and regulations relating to the transport, export/import and sale of seed applicable in the markets in which operate.  
 Internationally, we are subject to various government laws and regulations (including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar non-U.S. laws and regulations) and local government regulations. To help ensure compliance with these laws and regulations, we have adopted specific risk management and compliance practices and policies, including a specific policy addressing the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.
 Research and Development
 Research & Development expenses for the year ended June 30, 2022 totaled $7.7 million compared to $8.5 million in the year ended June 30, 2021.
 Employees
 As of September 21, 2022, we had 180 total employees, of which 148 were full-time employees. We also retain consultants for specific purposes when the need arises. None of our employees are represented by a labor union.
