Market Overview and Growth Drivers
 The Company participates in markets that serve the healthcare industry.  Customers include generic drug companies and companies that discover and commercialize small molecule human therapeutics using organic chemistry.
 The aging western population, continued investment in healthcare research and drug development, growth in the world’s developing markets, and the necessity to develop therapeutics to address unmet needs drives business

growth in life sciences companies.  Aging "baby boomers" in the United States, Europe and Japan may provide an enormous healthcare opportunity.  This group typically has more education, a higher socio-economic level and higher demands for healthcare services than previous generations. 
 Demand for Cambrex products and services is dependent upon some of its customers’ continuing access to financial resources to advance their R&D projects for therapeutic candidates from the laboratory to the clinic, and eventually, to the patient. Healthcare investment comes from a variety of sources. Large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies spend billions annually on drug discovery and development and billions more are spent by numerous smaller emerging pharmaceutical companies. Macro-economic conditions can have an impact on the availability of funding for the Company’s customers, especially many of the smaller companies that are often dependent upon venture capital and other private sources of funding.
 Cambrex assists companies in developing robust processes for the manufacture of clinical and commercial quantities. Product testing, analytical methods and quality processes are integrated into the manufacturing process.  Cambrex excels in the manufacture and testing of APIs and FDFs at laboratory, clinical and commercial scale and specializes in scaling up and optimizing manufacturing processes.
 Demand for outsourced services from pharmaceutical companies continues to grow.  Large pharmaceutical companies outsource a portion of the development and manufacturing of APIs and FDF to manage multiple internal priorities, access new technologies or additional capacity, preserve needed capital or ensure multiple sources of supply.  Many emerging pharmaceutical and generic drug companies outsource all process development and manufacturing, and larger pharmaceutical companies typically outsource development and manufacturing.  With large plants and product development resources in both Europe and the U.S., and large teams of professionals with substantial experience in the development, scale-up and operation of pharmaceutical manufacturing processes, Cambrex is particularly well positioned to assist drug companies with these much needed services for APIs and FDF.
 New drugs are typically patented.  When the patent expires, the drug may be manufactured and marketed in its generic form. Growth in the generic drug market is driven by the continuing stream of drug patents that will expire in the future and favorable market forces that encourage the use of generic pharmaceuticals as a more cost effective alternative to higher-priced branded drugs.  In the United States, and many countries in Europe, governments and prescription benefit management companies provide incentives for generic substitution to reduce costs.  Cambrex manufactures approximately 70 generic APIs, typically in relatively small quantities for use in niche therapeutics.  The Company also continuously maintains a portfolio of APIs in development for eventual commercial sale to generic drug companies upon future patent expiration.
 The market for human therapeutics is regulated by the Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) in the United States and other similar regulatory agencies throughout the world.  These agencies oversee and regulate the development, manufacturing and commercialization processes for APIs, regulated intermediates and FDF.  Continuous significant investment in facilities, people and training, along with excellent regulatory and quality systems and extensive experience in pharmaceutical fine chemical scale-up and manufacturing are essential to serve the industry and serve as a barrier to entry for potential new competitors.
 Competitors from developing markets continually increase their capabilities in drug substance manufacturing and finished dosage form drugs.  While overall global demand has been lifted by the rapid growth in certain developing markets, the presence of competitors within these markets, who have lower cost structures and competition in general, have resulted in downward pricing pressure throughout the pharmaceutical supply chain, and especially on generic APIs and early stage development services for clinical phase products.  Pricing pressures due to developing market competitors for later stage clinical projects and supply arrangements for patented products has been limited to date, although these pressures may increase as competitors in developing markets improve their quality, regulatory and manufacturing systems to become more acceptable as suppliers to larger pharmaceutical companies.  Cambrex regularly sources R&D services, raw materials and certain intermediates from developing market companies.

Development of the Business
 In September 2018, the Company completed the acquisition of 100% of Halo Pharma (“Halo”), a finished dosage form Contract Development and Manufacturing Organization. The deal was structured as a stock purchase for consideration of approximately $425,000.  The Company utilized cash on hand and borrowings under the credit facility to pay the purchase price.  Cambrex acquired two GMP compliant facilities, one in Whippany, NJ, and the other in Mirabel, Quebec, Canada.
 In October 2016, Cambrex purchased 100% of PharmaCore, Inc. a privately-held company located in High Point, NC for $24,275, net of cash.  The transaction was structured as a stock purchase.  PharmaCore, which was renamed Cambrex High Point, Inc. (“CHP”), specializes in developing, manufacturing and scaling up small molecule APIs for projects in early clinical phases. With the acquisition of CHP, Cambrex enhanced its capabilities and expertise to efficiently develop early clinical phase products and new technologies, and increased the number of potential late stage and commercial products that could be manufactured at Cambrex’s larger manufacturing sites.
 In late 2015, Cambrex committed to a plan to sell Zenara. On January 30, 2017, the Company transferred the assets and liabilities of Zenara to the buyer for consideration of approximately $2,800, which was held in escrow until approval by Indian regulatory authorities was obtained several months later.  Accordingly, as of January 30, 2017, the Company no longer includes Zenara in its reported results.  Refer to Note 9 to the Company’s consolidated financial statements for further explanation of the sale of Zenara.  
 Products
 The Company uses its technical expertise in a wide range of chemical processes to meet the needs of its customers for high quality products and services for specialized applications.  
 The Company’s business is primarily comprised of the custom development and manufacture of pharmaceutical ingredients derived from organic chemistry and finished dosage form products and services.  Products and services are supplied globally to innovator and generic drug companies.  Products include APIs, pharmaceutical intermediates and FDF. 
 The Company’s products and services are sold to a diverse group of several hundred customers, with one customer, Gilead Sciences, Inc., accounting for 24.8%, 35.1% and 36.9% of 2018, 2017, and 2016 consolidated sales, respectively. Substantially all of the sales to this customer are within the API segment. The Company’s products are sold through a combination of direct sales and independent agents.  One API, an antiviral product, represented 23.5%, 32.8% and 31.6% of 2018, 2017 and 2016 consolidated sales, respectively. 
 
Marketing and Distribution
 Marketing generally requires significant cooperative effort among a highly trained sales and marketing staff, a scientific staff that can assess the technical fit and estimate manufacturing economics, manufacturing and engineering staff to scale up the chemical process or the finished dosage form, and business unit management to determine the strategic and operational fit.  The process to take a client's project from the clinical trial stage to a commercial, approved therapeutic may take from two to ten years.  The Company uses sales agents in those areas where they are deemed to be more effective or economical than direct sales efforts, primarily to access generic API customers in markets outside the U.S. and Western Europe.  
Raw Materials
 The Company uses a wide array of raw materials in its businesses.  For its products, the Company generally will attempt to have a primary and secondary supplier for its critical raw materials. Prices for these raw materials are generally stable, except for the petroleum-based solvents and certain other commodity materials, where prices can vary with market conditions.  The Company has recently experienced difficulties sourcing certain raw materials from China due to increased regulatory requirements in that country.

Research and Development
 The Company's R&D program is designed to increase the Company's competitiveness by improving its technology and developing processes for the manufacture of new products to meet customer requirements.  The goals are to grow our portfolio of generic APIs, introduce innovative and proprietary products, improve manufacturing processes to reduce costs, improve quality and increase our capabilities to compete for business requiring significant technical expertise.  R&D activities are performed at all of the Company's manufacturing facilities.  As of December 31, 2018, 181 employees were at least partially involved in R&D activities worldwide.
Patents and Trademarks
 The Company has patent protection covering processes for manufacturing certain products.  In addition, the Company also relies on know-how and trade secrets (related to many of its manufacturing processes and techniques not generally known to other companies) for developing and maintaining its market position.  As of December 31, 2018, the Company owned 23 issued patents and had one patent application pending in the United States, and owned over 200 patents and had over 23 patent applications pending in foreign countries covering various technologies.  The Company seeks to protect its proprietary technology and prepares new patent applications as it develops new inventions.
 The patent right the Company considers most significant to our business is U.S. Patent No. 7,705,184, which relates to methods of manufacturing amphetamines, expires on May 15, 2029.
 The Company's products and services are sold around the world under trademarks that are owned by the Company.  This includes Profarmaco, which is registered around the world as a word and design mark.  Rights in this trademark will exist at least as long as the Company or its majority owned subsidiaries continue to use the trademark.
 The Company has entered into a worldwide perpetual license agreement with Celgene Corporation and Celgro Corporation that gives the Company the exclusive rights to certain intellectual property, including know-how and technology, relating to the development and manufacture of chirally pure bulk APIs.  This intellectual property is related to amphetamine salts currently sold by the Company.  Under the terms of this agreement, the Company pays no royalties or fees related to its use of this intellectual property.
 Competition
 The Company has numerous FDF and API competitors throughout Western Europe and the United States and many more competitors within various product categories the Company serves, including numerous competitors in Asia, Eastern Europe and other low-cost areas.  It is expected that regulatory compliance, product quality, pricing, and logistics will determine the extent of the long term impact of these competitors in the primary markets that the Company serves.  If the Company perceives significant competitive risk and a need for technical or financial commitment, it generally attempts to negotiate long term contracts or guarantees from its customers.
Environmental and Safety Regulations and Proceedings
 Certain products manufactured by the Company involve the use, storage and transportation of toxic and hazardous materials.  The Company's operations are subject to extensive laws and regulations relating to the storage, handling, emission, transportation and discharge of materials into the environment and the maintenance of safe working conditions.  The Company maintains environmental and industrial safety and health compliance programs and training at its plants and believes that its manufacturing operations are in compliance with all applicable safety, health and environmental laws.
 Prevailing legislation tends to hold companies primarily responsible for the proper disposal of its waste even after transfer to third party waste disposal facilities.  Other future developments, such as increasingly strict environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, and enforcement policies, could result in substantial costs and liabilities to the Company and could subject the Company's handling, manufacture, use, reuse or disposal of substances or pollutants at its plants to more rigorous scrutiny than at present. 
 Known environmental matters that may result in liabilities to the Company and the related estimates and accruals are summarized in Note 21 to the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

The Company’s policy is to comply with all legal requirements of applicable environmental, health and safety laws and regulations.  The Company believes it is in compliance with such requirements and has adequate professional staff and systems in place to remain in compliance.  In some cases, compliance can only be achieved by capital expenditures, and the Company made capital expenditures of $10,791, $9,872 and $6,081 in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, for environmental, health and safety compliance projects.  As the environmental proceedings in which the Company is involved progress from the remedial investigation and feasibility study stage to implementation of remedial measures, related capital and other expenditures may increase.  The Company considers costs for environmental compliance to be a normal cost of doing business and includes such costs in pricing decisions.
 Employees
 At December 31, 2018, the Company had 1,732 employees worldwide (987 of whom were from international operations) compared with 1,228 employees at December 31, 2017 and 1,295 at December 31, 2016.
 Non-U.S. production, administration, scientific and technical employees are represented by various local and national unions.  The Company believes its labor relations are satisfactory.
 Seasonality
 The Company experiences some seasonality primarily due to planned plant shutdowns by the Company and certain customers in the third quarter.  Operating results for any quarter, however, are not necessarily indicative of results for any future period.  In particular, as a result of various factors including, but not limited to, acquisitions, plant shutdowns, and the timing of large contract revenue streams, the Company believes that period-to-period comparisons of its operating results should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance.
 Export and International Sales
 Export sales from the Company’s domestic operations in 2018, 2017 and 2016 amounted to $138,613, $195,193 and $182,215, respectively.  Sales from international operations were $239,628, $213,041 and $220,765 in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.  Refer to Note 19 to the Company’s consolidated financial statements.
