 ITEM 1.BUSINESS
 Overview
 We are an ophthalmic medical technology and pharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of surgical devices and sustained pharmaceutical therapies designed to treat glaucoma, one of the world’s leading causes of blindness. We developed Micro‑Invasive Glaucoma Surgery (MIGS) to serve as an alternative to the traditional glaucoma treatment and management paradigm. We launched the iStent, our first MIGS device, in the United States in July 2012 and we are developing additional products designed to treat a full range of glaucoma progression.
 Glaucoma is a group of eye diseases characterized by progressive, irreversible and largely asymptomatic vision loss caused by optic nerve damage which is most commonly associated with elevated levels of pressure within the eye, or intraocular pressure. Elevated intraocular pressure often occurs when aqueous humor, the thin watery fluid that fills the front part of the eye, is not circulating normally and draining properly. Glaucoma is a chronic condition that progresses slowly over long periods of time and can have a devastating impact on a patient’s vision and quality of life. 
 Reducing intraocular pressure is the only proven treatment for glaucoma. Glaucoma has traditionally been treated through a range of approaches that often require patients to use multiple types of prescription eye drops for the rest of their lives, and sometimes undergo complex and invasive eye surgery. Unfortunately, these medications can be ineffective over time due to patient noncompliance and other factors. Complex and invasive glaucoma surgical options are typically reserved for more advanced glaucoma and have remained largely unchanged since the 1970’s.
 We developed MIGS to address the shortcomings of traditional glaucoma treatment options. MIGS procedures involve the insertion of a micro‑scale device or drug delivery system from within the eye’s anterior chamber through a small corneal incision. Our MIGS devices are designed to reduce intraocular pressure by restoring the natural outflow pathways for aqueous humor. Our MIGS drug delivery systems are designed to reduce intraocular pressure by continuously eluting a glaucoma drug from within the eye, potentially providing sustained pharmaceutical therapy for extended periods of time.
 Our iStent, a micro‑bypass stent that is designed to reduce intraocular pressure by restoring the natural physiologic pathways for aqueous humor, was the first commercially available MIGS treatment solution. Approved by the United States (U.S.) Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for insertion in combination with cataract surgery, the iStent procedure is currently reimbursed by Medicare and all major national private payors. Our next product, the iStent Inject, includes two stents pre‑loaded in an auto‑injection inserter that are also designed to lower intraocular pressure. The iStent Inject was commercially available in 2017 in certain European Union countries, Canada, Australia, Brazil and South Africa. In these markets, it is approved for use in conjunction with cataract surgery or as a standalone procedure, even though reimbursement may not be available for all such procedures. We are currently seeking FDA approval to market the iStent Inject in the U.S.
  We are developing four additional iStent pipeline products: the iStent Inject (in the U.S.), the iStent SA, the iStent Infinite and the iStent Supra. In an effort to obtain approval to market the iStent Inject in the U.S. in conjunction with cataract surgery, we completed a U.S. investigational device exemption (IDE) pivotal trial and submitted a premarket approval application (PMA) for the iStent Inject in 2017. The iStent SA is designed for use as a standalone glaucoma procedure. Similar to the iStent Inject, the iStent SA is a two-stent product that is slightly wider than the iStent Inject and uses a different auto‑injection inserter designed for use in a standalone procedure. The iStent SA is currently being studied in a U.S. pivotal IDE study as a standalone treatment for lowering intraocular pressure in pseudophakic glaucoma patients. We recently submitted an IDE application for the iStent Infinite, which includes three stents pre-loaded in an auto-injection inserter and is intended to lower intraocular pressure in refractory glaucoma patients. The iStent Supra is designed to access an alternative drainage space within the eye and is being evaluated in a U.S. pivotal IDE trial. We completed enrollment for the U.S. pivotal IDE trial for the iStent Supra in 2017.
  We are also pursuing regulatory approval of our first sustained pharmaceutical therapy using our iDose drug delivery system. A U.S. investigational new drug (IND) Phase II study of our initial iDose platform product, iDose

Travoprost, was completed in 2017 and we intend to commence U.S. Phase III clinical trials for this product in the first half of 2018. We are also conducting research and development (R&D) activities to explore other potential drugs that may benefit from the use of the iDose drug delivery system. In addition, other proprietary R&D efforts are underway on early-stage technologies, including, without limitation, an intraocular pressure sensor (IOP) system that is designed to capture and store a glaucoma patient’s short-interval IOP measurements over extended periods of time, and transmit data to the patient’s physician in order to enhance treatment decisions.
     We have a commercial organization which includes a direct sales force in the United States and 16 other countries, as well as distribution partners in regions of Europe, Asia Pacific, Latin America and other targeted international geographies. Information about geographic revenue is set forth in Note 12 of our notes to consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
 Our net sales increased to $159.3 million in 2017 from $114.4 million in 2016 and $71.7 million in 2015, and we incurred a net loss of $0.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared with net income of $4.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, and a net loss of $38.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015.
 Glaucoma Treatment Overview and Limitations
 Glaucoma and the eye’s drainage system
 Glaucoma is a group of eye diseases characterized by progressive, irreversible and largely asymptomatic vision loss in which elevated levels of intraocular pressure are often associated with optic nerve damage. While some glaucoma patients do not experience an increase in intraocular pressure, it is widely considered a major risk factor in glaucoma’s progression and reduction in intraocular pressure is the only clinically proven treatment. Elevated intraocular pressure occurs when aqueous humor is not circulating normally or properly draining from the front part of the eye. Normally, this fluid flows through the trabecular meshwork, an area of spongy mesh‑like tissue in the eye located around the base of the cornea, and into Schlemm’s canal, a circular channel in the eye that collects the aqueous humor and delivers it back into the bloodstream. This trabecular meshwork pathway is also known as the conventional outflow pathway.
 A second outflow pathway is located in the suprachoroidal space, which lies between the sclera and the choroid, where we estimate 20% of the eye’s total aqueous humor outflow occurs. This pathway is also known as the unconventional or uveoscleral pathway. The suprachoroidal space is characterized as an area of less venous resistance to aqueous humor outflow than Schlemm’s canal.

 The following image depicts the blockage of aqueous humor outflow in an eye with open‑angle glaucoma.

 Open‑angle glaucoma is the most common type of glaucoma. In open‑angle glaucoma, structures of the eye may appear normal, but aqueous humor outflow through the trabecular meshwork and into Schlemm’s canal is reduced due to gradual degeneration and obstruction causing a permanent and progressive loss of retinal cells and associated vision loss. Direct causes of this blockage are unknown, but the disease is linked to age, ethnicity and hereditary factors. Loss of aqueous humor drainage leads to increased resistance and thus a chronic, painless buildup of pressure in the eye.
 Glaucoma is a progressive disease that can be categorized based by severity levels ranging from ocular hypertension (or pre‑glaucoma) to severe glaucoma. An eye doctor usually diagnoses glaucoma as part of a comprehensive exam that includes measuring intraocular pressure and corneal thickness, evaluating optic nerve damage and testing visual fields. Intraocular pressure is measured in millimeters of mercury (mm Hg), with normal eye pressures ranging from 10 to 21 mm Hg. Glaucoma is typically characterized by an intraocular pressure greater than 21 mm Hg.
 Glaucoma treatment overview
 The traditional treatment of glaucoma encompasses a variety of medication regimens, laser treatments and surgical procedures to lower intraocular pressure.
     Multiple clinical trials have shown that medications can reduce intraocular pressures to baseline targets that can minimize vision loss. However, poor adherence to and lack of persistence with glaucoma medication regimens have been documented in numerous independent studies, which often place the incidence of patient noncompliance up to or above 50%, particularly in patients on two or more prescription eye drops. Even daily glaucoma single medication use has been associated with noncompliance rates as high as 75%.
 Because glaucoma progresses slowly and with few symptoms, patients often do not adhere to their medication regimens as prescribed until the disease has progressed to the point of significant vision loss. As a result, despite the availability of medication therapies to combat glaucoma, progressive visual loss and blindness still occur. 
 Laser treatments have been developed to provide an alternative to lifelong medication treatments. Typically performed at an outpatient surgical center, these treatments involve the use of lasers to create changes in eye tissue and improve aqueous humor outflow. Ophthalmic surgeons may perform laser procedures as an initial treatment or for patients who are noncompliant with prescription eye drops or whose intraocular pressure is not well controlled by 

 
  3

 
medications. According to Market Scope, selective laser trabeculoplasty (SLT) is the most frequently performed glaucoma laser procedure in the United States. Although SLT can help to lower intraocular pressure, the procedure’s effectiveness often wears off within one to five years according to the Glaucoma Research Foundation. While a second procedure can be performed, the results of repeated laser surgeries are less predictable and less effective than those of the first surgery. Additionally, medication therapy may still be required post‑treatment.
 Where medication therapy and laser treatment are unsuccessful in managing glaucoma, invasive surgical procedures such as trabeculectomies or implantation of tube shunts are performed, usually as outpatient procedures. In a trabeculectomy, the surgeon cuts open the conjunctiva and sclera to create flaps, removes a plug of scleral tissue and sometimes a portion of the trabecular meshwork to create an opening into the anterior chamber. The conjunctiva and scleral flaps are sutured back down and a small blister, or bleb, is created between the conjunctiva and sclera. The surgery results in a new drainage channel that allows increased outflow of aqueous humor into the bleb. While some patients experience significant reductions in intraocular pressure, trabeculectomy failure rates can approach 50% according to published research. A common complication is scarring, which can prevent fluid drainage from the eye and interfere with the proper function of the bleb. If the bleb doesn’t work properly, more surgery may be needed. Among the other complications associated with trabeculectomies are blurred vision, bleeding in the eye, bleb leaks, low intraocular pressure or hypotony, infection, persistent corneal edema, choroidal detachment and cataract development. Implantations of tube shunts, devices that divert the aqueous humor from the anterior chamber, are generally reserved for eyes in which a trabeculectomy has failed or has a poor likelihood of success. A tube shunt surgery is similar to a trabeculectomy, except that the device’s tube is inserted through the scleral channel to maintain the channel and the device’s reservoir end is placed deep under the conjunctiva to maintain the drainage space. While invasive glaucoma surgery often leads to significant reductions in intraocular pressure, it is associated with high long‑term failure rates, long recovery times and significant complication risks. Additionally, as with laser treatment, the effects may dissipate over time, requiring additional procedures, and medication therapy may still be required post‑treatment.
 We believe that because of the limitations of medications and laser treatments, and the morbidity associated with invasive surgical therapies, a clear unmet medical need exists in the management of open‑angle glaucoma patients.
 Our Products
 We pioneered the development of MIGS in order to address the shortcomings of traditional pharmaceutical and surgical options. 
 In contrast to invasive surgical approaches, MIGS procedures access the anterior chamber of the eye through small corneal incisions or penetrations. MIGS devices are designed to reduce intraocular pressure by restoring the natural physiologic pathways for aqueous humor outflow in a procedure that preserves more eye tissue and allows for faster recovery times and fewer complications than invasive glaucoma surgical options.
 iStent trabecular micro-bypass stent. We launched our first micro‑scale MIGS treatment solution, the iStent, in the United States following FDA approval in June 2012. The iStent was the first FDA‑approved surgical device available for insertion in conjunction with cataract surgery for the reduction of intraocular pressure in adult patients with mild‑to‑moderate open‑angle glaucoma. The iStent is a micro‑bypass stent made of surgical‑grade non‑ferromagnetic titanium that is coated with heparin and is 1.0 mm long and 0.33 mm wide. Packaged in a sterile, pre‑loaded configuration, the iStent is inserted through the small corneal incision made during cataract surgery and placed into Schlemm’s canal. Once inserted, the iStent is designed to improve aqueous humor outflow while fitting naturally within Schlemm’s canal. The ergonomic rail design protects and accesses underlying collector channels while the iStent’s three retention arches help ensure secure placement. The iStent is currently approved in the U.S. only for insertion in conjunction with cataract surgery because this was the product usage in the U.S. IDE clinical trial information that was included in the PMA. The iStent is commercially available in the U.S., certain European Union countries, Brazil, Canada, Australia, Japan and other countries.

 The following series of graphics illustrates the effect of iStent in the eye: (left) after placement of the iStent, aqueous humor outflow is restored; (right) close‑up illustration of iStent placement in Schlemm’s canal.
 iStent Inject trabecular micro‑bypass stent (Outside of the U.S). The iStent Inject, which includes two stents pre‑loaded in an auto‑injection inserter, is also designed to lower intraocular pressure. Each iStent Inject stent is approximately one‑third the size of the iStent and relies on a similar fluidic method of action to improve aqueous humor outflow into Schlemm’s canal. Packaged in a two‑stent, pre-loaded, auto‑inject mechanism, the iStent Inject is designed to allow the surgeon to inject these stents into multiple trabecular meshwork locations through a single corneal entry. The iStent Inject has been approved for marketing in the European Union, Canada, Brazil, Australia and certain other countries, primarily in the Middle East. In these markets, it is approved for use in conjunction with cataract surgery or as a standalone procedure. In 2017, the iStent Inject was commercially available in certain European Union countries, Canada, Australia, Brazil and South Africa, even though reimbursement may not be available for all such procedures.

 Our Pipeline
 We are developing five additional pipeline products: the iStent Inject (U.S.), the iStent SA, the iStent Infinite, the iStent Supra and iDose Travoprost.
 iStent Inject trabecular micro bypass stent (in the U.S.). We are seeking FDA approval to market the iStent Inject in the U.S. We submitted a PMA application to the FDA at the end of 2017 after completing the U.S. pivotal IDE clinical trial to evaluate the iStent Inject for the reduction of intraocular pressure in mild‑to‑moderate open‑angle glaucoma in combination with cataract surgery.
 iStent SA trabecular micro-bypass system. The iStent SA is designed for use as a standalone glaucoma procedure. Similar to the iStent Inject, the iStent SA is a two-stent product that is slightly wider than the iStent Inject and uses a different auto‑injection inserter designed for use in a standalone procedure. The system allows the surgeon to inject stents into multiple trabecular meshwork locations through a single corneal entry point and is designed to make its own self‑sealing corneal needle penetration in order to achieve insertion without an incision. A U.S. pivotal IDE trial evaluating the iStent SA for the reduction of intraocular pressure in pseudophakic mild-to-moderate open-angle glaucoma patients is currently underway. Pseudophakic refers to patients who have previously undergone cataract surgery and no longer have a natural crystalline lens. We have not commercialized the iStent SA.
  iStent Infinite trabecular micro-bypass system. The iStent Infinite is designed for use as a standalone procedure in patients with refractory glaucoma (or on maximally tolerated topical glaucoma medications). The iStent Infinite consists of three stents that are pre-loaded in an auto-injection system that allows the surgeon to inject stents across a span of five to six clock hours of Schlemm’s canal. In early 2018, we submitted an IDE application seeking authorization to study the iStent Infinite in order to seek regulatory clearance through a 510(k) pre-market submission. We have not commercialized the iStent Infinite.
  The image below left is a magnified view of two iStent SA devices; the image below center is a magnified view of three iStent Infinite devices; the image below right is a magnified view of the iStent Infinite inserter. 
     iStent Supra suprachoroidal micro‑bypass stent. The iStent Supra is designed to reduce intraocular pressure by accessing the suprachoroidal space in the eye, an area that we estimate is responsible for 20% of its total aqueous outflow. Enrollment for the U.S. pivotal IDE trial for the iStent Supra used in conjunction with cataract surgery was completed in 2017 and the two-year follow-up will conclude in 2019. The iStent Supra device has been approved for

marketing in the European Union and certain other countries, primarily in the Middle East. We have not commercialized the iStent Supra.
 The image below left is a magnified view of the iStent Supra; the image below center illustrates the iStent Supra device implanted into the suprachoroidal space of the eye; the image below right shows the iStent Supra device on the tip of a finger (inside circle).
 iDose. The iDose drug delivery system is a targeted injectable implant that is based on our micro‑scale device-platform designed to be pre‑loaded into a small gauge needle and injected into the eye via a self‑sealing corneal needle penetration, where it is secured within the eye. Once secured in the eye, the iDose implant is designed to continuously deliver therapeutic levels of medication from within the eye for extended periods of time. The titanium implant is similar in size to the Company’s other proprietary MIGS devices. The implant is capped with a membrane that is designed for continuous controlled drug elution into the anterior chamber. When depleted, the implant can be removed and replaced in a similar, subsequent procedure. Glaukos has designed the product to be an alternative to chronic, daily prescription eye drop treatments, which may have high rates of patient noncompliance and cause long‑term ocular surface damage to glaucomatous eyes. 
 In November 2015, the Company submitted an IND application to the FDA seeking authorization to study our initial iDose platform product, iDose Travoprost, for investigational use in the reduction of elevated intraocular pressure in patients with glaucoma. In December 2015, the FDA notified the Company that it was allowing the Phase II IND clinical trial to proceed. In this Phase II clinical trial, the iDose Travoprost implant was filled with a special formulation of travoprost, a prostaglandin analog used to reduce elevated intraocular pressure. In 2017, the Company completed the 154-patient, randomized, 12-week masked Phase II clinical trial, which was designed to assess the safety and preliminary efficacy of two models of iDose Travoprost with different travoprost elution rates compared to topical timolol maleate ophthalmic solution, 0.5% and conducted an End-of-Phase II meeting with the FDA. The Company is currently making preparations to initiate Phase III IND clinical trials for iDose Travoprost in the first half of 2018. We have not commercialized the iDose Travoprost.

     Research & Development
 Our research and development efforts are focused primarily on continuous improvement of our iStent devices, iDose drug delivery systems, related injector systems and development of new innovations that are based on our proprietary MIGS surgical and sustained pharmaceutical therapy platforms. Our research and development objectives are:
· | To advance glaucoma patient care through continuous improvement of our MIGS platforms by providing viable MIGS alternatives to lifelong medication regimens and invasive surgical procedures for intraocular pressure management;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | To introduce micro‑scale injectable therapies—including our iStent Inject, iStent SA, iStent Supra, iStent Infinite and iDose Travoprost pipeline products—that can be performed in minor surgical suites or in‑office settings with topical anesthetic; and 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | To leverage our expertise in micro-scale design and continue to expand our core research and development capabilities in order to identify and develop additional micro-invasive ophthalmic innovations that complement our existing product offerings and address important unmet clinical needs.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  As of December 31, 2017, our research and development team consisted of 132 employees. Our research and development process is supported by multiple clinical trials and regulatory affairs activities. Our research and development expenses were approximately $38.9 million, $29.2 million, and $25.0 million in the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. We expect our research and development expenditures to increase as we continue to devote significant resources to clinical trials and regulatory approvals of our new products.
 Sales and Marketing
 In the United States, we sell our products through a direct sales organization that, as of December 31, 2017, consisted of 119 sales professionals, including regional business managers, sales directors, clinical relations personnel and reimbursement specialists. Our sales organization is primarily responsible for training ophthalmic surgeons on the iStent procedure, helping these physicians integrate the technology into their practices and providing resources to support reimbursement, while also identifying and supporting investigational sites for clinical trials of our pipeline technologies. We continue to recruit experienced sales professionals with extensive sales and/or clinical experience in ophthalmic medical technologies. 
 We invest significant time and expense to provide comprehensive training to our sales professionals so that they are proficient in all aspects of our iStent technologies, including features and benefits, procedure techniques and reimbursement. In addition, we provide technical education regarding the eye’s anatomy, glaucoma diagnosis, disease states and treatment, and cataract surgery.
 Outside the United States, we sell our products through direct sales organizations in 16 countries and a network of distribution partners in other markets. As of December 31, 2017, our direct sales organization outside the United States consisted of 87 sales professionals. We continually monitor our international sales progress and consider conversion to a direct sales approach on a country‑by‑country basis, depending on our assessment of market conditions, 

 
  8

 
net sales and profitability trends, reimbursement coding and coverage potential, and other factors. As of December 31, 2017, we had agreements with approximately 18 distributor organizations. No single distributor accounted for more than 10% of our total net sales for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 or 2015.
 Our global sales efforts and promotional activities are currently aimed at ophthalmic surgeons and other eye care professionals. Our primary customers include hospitals and ambulatory surgery centers (ASCs). 
 Reimbursement
 United States reimbursement
 Reimbursement for iStent procedures
 There are three key aspects of reimbursement in the United States:

· | Coding refers to distinct numeric and alphanumeric billing codes that are used by healthcare providers to report the provision of medical procedures and the use of supplies for specific patients to payors. There are different categories of Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes (Category I, II and III) based on the procedure or supply.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Coverage refers to decisions made by individual payors as to whether or not to pay for a specific procedure and related supplies and if so, under what conditions (i.e., for which specific diagnoses and clinical indications). Payors typically base coverage decisions on reviews of the published medical literature.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Payment refers to the amount paid to providers for specific procedures and supplies. Payment is generally determined for the specific billing code and, in addition, there may be separate numeric codes, under which the billing code is classified, to establish a payment amount.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  In 2008, in consultation with and with the approval of the American Academy of Ophthalmology, we applied for and received a temporary Category III CPT code to describe insertion of devices such as the iStent using MIGS procedures.
 Category III codes expire five years after the date they become effective. Prior to expiration, there are two options: submit an application to convert to a Category I code; or submit an application for a five-year extension of Category III status. CPT code 0191T, which describes the insertion of the iStent, as well as the iStent Inject, iStent SA, and iStent Infinite devices, was first effective in 2008 and our most recent application for an additional extension was approved in early 2017 and expires on December 31, 2023. 
 The iStent is approved by the FDA for reduction of intraocular pressure in adult patients with mild‑to‑moderate open‑angle glaucoma undergoing cataract surgery who are currently treated with prescription eye drops. Based on data released by Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) regarding total cataract surgery volume in the Medicare Fee for Service program and data published by Market Scope, we estimate that Medicare pays for approximately 80% of all cataract surgeries performed in the United States. 
 We estimate that 20% of patients who meet the FDA indication for iStent insertion are covered by private health insurance companies and we have secured coverage policies for iStent insertion with all major national private payors. 
 iStent insertion in the United States is almost always performed in an outpatient setting and virtually all U.S. iStent sales are to ASCs and hospital outpatient departments (HOPDs). National payment rates by Medicare to ASCs and HOPDs are determined each year through a complex formula, which takes into account reported costs for each claim submitted. When two procedures are performed in an ASC on the same patient on the same day (e.g., iStent insertion and cataract surgery), Medicare reduces the payment of the lower‑paying procedure by 50%. The ASC facility payment for cataract surgery is generally lower than the payment for iStent insertion. Therefore, when these two procedures are performed together in an ASC, the payment for cataract surgery is reduced by 50%. 
 For iStent insertion and cataract procedures performed in HOPDs, the Medicare fee-for-service facility reimbursement is a single, all‑inclusive payment. We estimate that approximately 25% of U.S. iStent procedures are 

 
  9

 
currently performed in HOPDs and that a majority of these procedures are reimbursed through traditional Medicare fee‑for‑service. 
 Physicians are paid separately from the facility for surgical procedures. Unlike the CPT code used to pay facilities for iStent insertion, there is no published Medicare payment schedule at the national level for the physician payment, leaving the amount of such payment to the discretion of the individual Medicare contractor. Recently, several Medicare contractors have reduced the amount of the physician payment. One of the factors a surgeon evaluates when deciding whether to adopt or to continue to perform procedures is whether or not payment for the procedure adequately covers the surgeon’s time. As with the facility payment, the incremental payment the physician receives for inserting the iStent device in conjunction with cataract surgery over and above what he or she would receive for performing cataract surgery alone plays a role in a surgeon’s decision to adopt or to continue to use the technology.
 Unlike Medicare, commercial payors do not publish fee schedules. In general, based on selected feedback from facilities and surgeons, payments for iStent insertion from the commercial payors who cover the procedure are generally comparable to local Medicare payments.
 Reimbursement for future products
 We have also filed and received approval of applications for CPT codes that describe our pipeline iStent devices. Our application for a CPT code to describe insertion of the iStent Supra was approved by the American Medical Association (AMA), in 2011 resulting in the creation of a Category III CPT code 0253T. Our application for another extension of the Category III status of code 0253T was approved in early 2017 and expires on December 31, 2023. Our application for a CPT code to describe the insertion of additional trabecular meshwork stents (as with the iStent Inject, iStent SA, and iStent Infinite procedures) was approved by the AMA in early 2014 resulting in the creation of Category III CPT code 0376T. While this code was available beginning on January 1, 2015 for the reporting of procedures in which more than one iStent is inserted in the same eye, it currently does not result in any incremental facility or professional fee payment from Medicare. In addition, it is unclear whether any other third‑party payor will provide reimbursement for the insertion of a second stent or that a professional fee payment for a second stent will be adequate. Our application for an extension of the Category III status of code 0376T was approved in early 2017 and expires on December 31, 2023. We have not yet filed any applications for CPT codes that describe our iDose drug delivery system. 
 Reimbursement outside the United States

Outside the United States, reimbursement levels vary significantly by country and by region within some countries. Reimbursement is obtained from a variety of sources, including government-sponsored and private health insurance plans, and combinations of both. Some countries require additional clinical data before granting or expanding coverage and reimbursement for our products. In general, obtaining broad‑based reimbursement and adequate payment for new technologies is more difficult in these markets than in the United States. Many countries require new medical technologies to not only be safe and effective, but also to be able to demonstrate clinical benefits that outweigh the costs when compared to the standard of care.
 In some countries, applications for reimbursement can be approved, but additional approvals or negotiations for payment have to be obtained. For example, in France, our customers can obtain reimbursement from the government by obtaining a code that describes iStent insertion. Certain customers, including hospitals, can obtain an incremental facility fee if the iStent were to be included on the list of devices approved for pass-through payment. In 2013, our application for a code to describe iStent insertion and our application to add the iStent to the list of devices approved for pass-through payment were denied. Following publication of data on iStent Inject, we submitted new applications for both devices in 2014. In November 2015, the French government approved the iStent application for reimbursement, but since the iStent has not been added to the list of devices approved for pass-through payment, the incremental facility payment has never been paid. Thus, as in this situation, obtaining full or even partial reimbursement can be difficult and time consuming and there can be no assurance that full or partial reimbursement will be made even though our products have been approved for reimbursement at some level.

 
  10

 

 In other countries, there are no codes that specifically describe the insertion of a trabecular stent or there is no mechanism to provide incremental payment for the iStent when insertion is in conjunction with cataract surgery. 
 As in the United States, reimbursement decisions can change, resulting in the elimination or reduction of reimbursement payments. For example, in Australia, the iStent and iStent Inject were initially included on the Department of Health’s (ADOH) prosthesis listing, which provided for a separate reimbursement payment for these devices. Last year, the Australian government began a comprehensive review of the approximately 5,600 items on the Medicare Benefits Schedule (MBS), including the prosthesis listing, in an effort to ensure all MBS items were aligned with contemporary clinical evidence and practice and improved health outcomes for patients. In connection with this review, the Company we were advised that effective May 1, 2017, the iStent and iStent Inject would no longer be reimbursed under the current code. Following petitions by the Company, on May 4, 2017, the ADOH created a temporary MBS code for the implantation of iStent and iStent Inject. This temporary code is set to expire on December 31, 2018. Concurrently, we submitted a request to the ADOH for the creation of permanent MBS code for the implantation of iStent and iStent Inject. The ADOH is considering the request for a new permanent MBS procedure code for the implantation of iStent and iStent Inject. Recently, we received correspondence advising us that ADOH’s medical services advisory committee has expressed written support for the inclusion of a permanent MBS code for implantation of iStent and iStent Inject in conjunction with cataract surgery. The advisory committee did not, however, support at this time the inclusion of a permanent code for a standalone procedure. Even though the ADOH has received the recommendations of the advisory committee, it has yet to make a final decision on the Company’s application for the creation of a permanent code. 
 Competition
 Until recently, our iStent was the only MIGS device approved for sale in the United States by the FDA. Thus, we had for several years commercialized the iStent in the United States without any direct MIGS competitors. Alcon, Inc. (which acquired Transcend Medical, Inc., a MIGS competitor) obtained FDA approval and commenced a commercial launch of its CyPass® suprachoroidal implant, a competitive MIGS device, in 2016. The CyPass device is indicated for use in conjunction with cataract surgery for the reduction of IOP in adult patients with mild to moderate primary open-angle glaucoma. Also in 2016, Allergan plc (which acquired AqueSys, Inc., a MIGS competitor) obtained FDA approval and commenced a commercial launch of its Xen® Glaucoma Treatment System for use in the U.S. The Xen device is indicated for the management of refractory glaucoma where previous surgical treatment has failed or in patients with primary open angle glaucoma and pseudoexfoliative or pigmentary glaucoma with open angles that are unresponsive to maximum tolerated medical therapy. We are aware of several other companies, such as Santen Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. (which recently acquired InnFocus, Inc., a MIGS competitor) and Ivantis Inc., that are conducting FDA‑approved IDE clinical trials or have filed for regulatory approval of MIGS devices. If these MIGS products or other products that may be developed receive regulatory approval, we will have additional direct MIGS competitors. These new MIGS products could achieve greater commercial acceptance, demonstrate better safety or effectiveness, clinical results, ease of use or lower costs than our iStent or our other products under development, which may reduce demand for our primary product, the iStent, as well as for our products in development. 
 We also compete with the use of medication therapy for treating glaucoma and with manufacturers of medical devices used in surgical therapy procedures for treating glaucoma, including Alcon, Inc., Johnson & Johnson (through its acquisition of Abbott Medical Optics Inc.), Allergan plc, STAAR Surgical Company, Lumenis Ltd., NeoMedix, Inc., New World Medical, Inc., Iridex Corporation and Ellex Medical Lasers Limited. Alcon, Inc. and Johnson & Johnson (through its acquisition of Abbott Medical Optics Inc.) are the leading manufacturers of aqueous shunts, and Alcon, Inc. also markets the EX‑PRESS Glaucoma Filtration Device. Lumenis Ltd. is a leading manufacturer of selective laser trabeculoplasty equipment. Neomedix, Inc. markets an electrosurgical device. New World Medical, Inc. offers a surgical device. Iridex Corporation offers laser systems. And, Ellex Medical Lasers Limited markets a canaloplasty device that some physicians employ to lower intraocular pressure in glaucoma.
 Many of our current and potential competitors (including MIGS competitors) are large publicly traded companies or divisions of publicly‑traded companies and have several competitive advantages, including:

· | greater financial and human resources for product development, sales and marketing and patent litigation;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | significantly greater name recognition;
--+----------------------------------------

 
 
  11

 


· | longer operating histories;
--+----------------------------


· | established relationships with healthcare professionals, customers and third‑party payors;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | additional lines of products and the ability to offer rebates or bundle products to offer higher discounts or incentives;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | more established sales and marketing programs and distribution networks; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | greater experience in conducting research and development, manufacturing, clinical trials, preparing regulatory submissions and obtaining regulatory clearance or approval for drug and device products and marketing approved products.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  In addition to competing for market share for our products, we also compete against these companies for personnel, including qualified sales representatives that are necessary to grow our business, as well as scientific and clinical personnel from universities and research institutions that are important to our research and development efforts.
 We believe the principal competitive factors in our market include:

· | improved outcomes for glaucoma;
--+--------------------------------


· | acceptance by ophthalmic surgeons;
--+-----------------------------------


· | ease of use and reliability;
--+-----------------------------


· | product price and availability of reimbursement;
--+-------------------------------------------------


· | technical leadership;
--+----------------------


· | effective marketing and distribution; and
--+------------------------------------------


· | speed to market.

  Facilities, Manufacturing and Distribution
 Our corporate headquarters and our manufacturing operations are located in an approximately 86,000 square foot campus in San Clemente, California which is comprised of two main buildings. This location serves as our sole manufacturing location where we manufacture, inspect, package, release and ship nearly all of our final products. All of our headquarters‑based employees, including our manufacturing and distribution employees, work at this campus. While these facilities are sufficient for our current needs, we will require additional space as our business expands. Our international subsidiaries also lease facilities in Australia, Brazil, Canada, Germany, Japan and the United Kingdom.
 We manufacture, inspect, package and ship finished products from our San Clemente facility. We source components used in our proprietary manufacturing process from outside vendors and we assemble them to produce iStent devices and disposable insertion instruments. These components include both off‑the‑shelf materials and custom made parts. The iStent device and some insertion instrument components are supplied by single vendors. While we believe that there are at least several other vendors that could make any one of these items, we strive to maintain a minimum inventory of three to six months’ supply to help mitigate any supply interruptions. We source the heparin used in our iStent heparin coating from one supplier. We maintain a stock of several years’ worth of heparin material and have FDA approval to retest and extend the shelf life of the material indefinitely for U.S. product.
 We have received International Standards Organization (ISO) 13485 certification which includes design control requirements. Our manufacturing processes have been validated as required by the FDA and other regulatory bodies. As a medical device manufacturer, our manufacturing facility and the facilities of our critical suppliers are subject to periodic inspection by the FDA and other regulatory agencies.

 Intellectual Property
 The strength of our competitive position depends substantially upon our ability to obtain and enforce intellectual property rights protecting our technology both domestically and internationally. We rely on a combination of intellectual property rights, including patents, trademarks, service marks, copyrights, trade secrets and other similar intellectual property, as well as customary contractual protections and security measures used to protect our proprietary, trade secret information. 
 In the aggregate, our intellectual property assets are of material importance to our business. We are significantly dependent on our patent and other intellectual property rights and the failure to protect such rights or succeed in litigation could negatively impact our ability to sell current or future products, or prohibit us from enforcing our patents or other intellectual property rights against others. For additional information see “Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property.” 
 As of December 31, 2017, we owned or exclusively licensed in certain fields of use 158 issued patents and 87 pending patent applications, including 64 U.S. patents and 32 U.S. patent applications. We may, from time to time, choose to acquire or license additional patents and patent applications, or we may choose to abandon, sell, or license certain Company patents and patent applications, depending on the needs of the Company. Our issued patents that protect our commercial products and current product pipeline will expire between 2020 and 2034. While we have pursued and continue to pursue patent protection for our existing and pipeline technologies in the U.S. and certain jurisdictions abroad, we do not know how many of our pending patent applications will result in the issuance of patents or the extent to which the examination process could require us to narrow our claims. In addition, any of our issued patents may be successfully challenged and invalidated or found to lack the scope necessary to prevent a competitor from entering the marketplace.
 The ophthalmology industry in which we operate has been subject to a large number of patent filings and patent infringement litigation. Whether we infringe any patent claim owned by a third party will not be known with certainty unless and until a court interprets the patent claim in the context of litigation. If an infringement allegation is made against us, we may seek to invalidate the asserted patent claim and may allege non‑infringement of the asserted patent claim. Also, for business reasons, we may take similar actions before any such infringement allegation is made. In order for us to invalidate a U.S. patent claim, we would need to rebut the presumption of validity afforded to issued patents in the United States with clear and convincing evidence of invalidity, which is a high burden of proof. Similar or greater effort and proof may be required to invalidate foreign patents owned by third parties, including those owned by our competitors.
 In some circumstances, we may rely on trade secrets to protect our technology. However, trade secrets can be difficult to protect. We seek to protect our proprietary technology and manufacturing processes, in part, by confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with employees and certain third-party service providers. 
 We also seek to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of our data and trade secrets by maintaining physical security of our premises and physical and electronic security of our information technology systems. While we have confidence in these individuals, organizations and systems, agreements or security measures may be breached and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors. To the extent that our consultants, contractors or collaborators use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know‑how and inventions.
 Government Regulation
 Our products and operations are subject to extensive and rigorous regulation by the FDA and other federal, state and local authorities, as well as foreign regulatory authorities. The FDA regulates, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacturing, approval, labeling, storage, recordkeeping, advertising, promotion and marketing, distribution, post approval monitoring and reporting and import and export of medical devices (such as our iStent products), as well as combination drug/device products (such as iDose) in the United States to assure the safety and effectiveness of medical products for their intended use. The Federal Trade Commission also regulates the advertising of 

 
  13

 
our products. Further, we are subject to laws directed at preventing fraud and abuse, which subject our sales and marketing, training and other practices to government scrutiny.
 U.S. government regulation—medical devices
 Unless an exemption applies, each new or significantly modified medical device we seek to commercially distribute in the United States will require either a premarket notification to the FDA requesting permission for commercial distribution under Section 510(k) of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (FDCA), also referred to as a 510(k) clearance, or approval from the FDA of a PMA. Both the 510(k) clearance and PMA processes can be expensive, and lengthy, and require payment of significant user fees, unless an exemption is available.
 Device classification
 Under the FDCA, medical devices are classified into one of three classes—Class I, Class II or Class III—depending on the degree of risk associated with each medical device and the extent of control needed to provide reasonable assurances with respect to safety and effectiveness.
 Class I devices are those for which safety and effectiveness can be reasonably assured by adherence to a set of regulations, referred to as General Controls, which require compliance with the applicable portions of the FDA’s Quality System Regulation (QSR), facility registration and product listing, reporting of adverse events and malfunctions, and appropriate, truthful and non‑misleading labeling and promotional materials. Some Class I devices, also called Class I reserved devices, also require premarket clearance by the FDA through the 510(k) premarket notification process described below. Most Class I products are exempt from the premarket notification requirements.
 Class II devices are those that are subject to the General Controls, as well as Special Controls, which can include performance standards, guidelines and postmarket surveillance. Most Class II devices are subject to premarket review and clearance by the FDA. Premarket review and clearance by the FDA for Class II devices is accomplished through the 510(k) premarket notification process. Under the 510(k) process, the manufacturer must submit to the FDA a premarket notification, demonstrating that the device is “substantially equivalent,” as defined in the statute, to either:

· | a device that was legally marketed prior to May 28, 1976, the date upon which the Medical Device Amendments of 1976 were enacted, or
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | another commercially available, similar device that was cleared through the 510(k) process.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  To be “substantially equivalent,” the proposed device must have the same intended use as the predicate device, and either have the same technological characteristics as the predicate device or have different technological characteristics and not raise different questions of safety or effectiveness than the predicate device. Clinical data is sometimes required to support substantial equivalence.
 After a device receives 510(k) clearance, any modification that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a new or major change in its intended use, will require a new 510(k) clearance or, depending on the modification, could require a PMA application. If the FDA disagrees with a manufacturer’s determination regarding whether a new premarket submission is required for the modification of an existing device, the FDA can require the manufacturer to cease marketing and/or recall the modified device until 510(k) clearance or approval of a PMA application is obtained. 
 If the FDA determines that the device is not “substantially equivalent” to a predicate device, or if the device is automatically classified into Class III, the device sponsor must then fulfill the much more rigorous premarketing requirements of the PMA approval process, or seek reclassification of the device through the de novo process. Pursuant to amendments to the statute in 2012, a manufacturer can also submit a petition for direct de novo review if the manufacturer is unable to identify an appropriate predicate device and the new device or new use of the device presents a moderate or low risk.
 Class III devices include devices deemed by the FDA to pose the greatest risk such as life‑supporting or life‑sustaining devices, or implantable devices, in addition to those deemed not substantially equivalent following the 

 
  14

 
510(k) process. These devices are subject to the PMA application process, which is generally more costly and time consuming than the 510(k) process. Through the PMA application process, the applicant must submit data and information demonstrating reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of the device for its intended use to the FDA’s satisfaction. Accordingly, a PMA application typically includes, but is not limited to, extensive technical information regarding device design and development, pre‑clinical and clinical trial data, manufacturing information, labeling and financial disclosure information for the clinical investigators in device studies. The PMA application must provide valid scientific evidence that demonstrates to the FDA’s satisfaction reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of the device for its intended use.
 The investigational device process
 In the United States, absent certain limited exceptions, human clinical trials intended to support medical device clearance or approval require an IDE application. Some types of studies deemed to present “non‑significant risk” are deemed to have an approved IDE once certain requirements are addressed and Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval is obtained. If the device presents a “significant risk” to human health, as defined by the FDA, the sponsor must submit an IDE application to the FDA and obtain IDE approval prior to commencing the human clinical trials. The IDE application must be supported by appropriate data, such as animal and laboratory testing results, showing that it is safe to test the device in humans and that the testing protocol is scientifically sound. The IDE application must be approved in advance by the FDA for a specified number of subjects. Generally, clinical trials for a significant risk device may begin once the IDE application is approved by the FDA and the study protocol and informed consent are approved by appropriate institutional review boards at the clinical trial sites. There can be no assurance that submission of an IDE will result in the ability to commence clinical trials, and although the FDA’s approval of an IDE allows clinical testing to go forward for a specified number of subjects, it does not bind the FDA to accept the results of the trial as sufficient to prove the product’s safety and efficacy, even if the trial meets its intended success criteria.
 All clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with the FDA’s IDE regulations that govern investigational device labeling, prohibit promotion and specify an array of recordkeeping, reporting and monitoring responsibilities of study sponsors and study investigators. Clinical trials must further comply with the FDA’s regulations for institutional review board approval and for informed consent and other human subject protections. Required records and reports are subject to inspection by the FDA. The results of clinical testing may be unfavorable, or, even if the intended safety and efficacy success criteria are achieved, may not be considered sufficient for the FDA to grant marketing approval or clearance of a product. The commencement or completion of any clinical trial may be delayed or halted or be inadequate to support approval of a PMA application for numerous reasons, including, but not limited to, the following:

· | the FDA or other regulatory authorities do not approve a clinical trial protocol or a clinical trial, or place a clinical trial on hold;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | patients do not enroll in clinical trials at the rate expected;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------


· | patients do not comply with trial protocols;
--+---------------------------------------------


· | patient follow‑up is not at the rate expected;
--+-----------------------------------------------


· | patients experience adverse events;
--+------------------------------------


· | patients die during a clinical trial, even though their death may not be related to the products that are part of our trial;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | device malfunctions occur with unexpected frequency or potential adverse consequences;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | institutional review boards and third‑party clinical investigators may delay or reject the trial protocol;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | third‑party clinical investigators decline to participate in a trial or do not perform a trial on the anticipated schedule or consistent with the clinical trial protocol, good clinical practices or other FDA requirements;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | we or third‑party organizations do not perform data collection, monitoring and analysis in a timely or accurate manner or consistent with the clinical trial protocol or investigational or statistical plans;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
 
  15

 


· | third‑party clinical investigators have significant financial interests related to us or our study such that the FDA deems the study results unreliable, or we or investigators fail to disclose such interests;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | regulatory inspections of our clinical trials or manufacturing facilities, which may, among other things, require us to undertake corrective action or suspend or terminate our clinical trials;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | changes in government regulations or administrative actions;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------


· | the interim or final results of the clinical trial are inconclusive or unfavorable as to safety or efficacy; or
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the FDA concludes that our trial design is inadequate to demonstrate safety and efficacy.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  The PMA approval process
 Following receipt of a PMA application, the FDA conducts an administrative review to determine whether the application is sufficiently complete to permit a substantive review. If it is not, the agency will refuse to file the PMA. If it is, the FDA will accept the application for filing and begin the review. The FDA, by statute and by regulation, has 180 days to review a filed PMA application, although the review of an application more often occurs over a significantly longer period of time. During this review period, the FDA may request additional information or clarification of information already provided, and the FDA may issue a major deficiency letter to the applicant, requesting the applicant’s response to deficiencies communicated by the FDA. The FDA considers a PMA or PMA supplement to have been voluntarily withdrawn if an applicant fails to respond to an FDA request for information (e.g., major deficiency letter) within a total of 360 days. Before approving or denying a PMA, an FDA advisory committee may review the PMA at a public meeting and provide the FDA with the committee’s recommendation on whether the FDA should approve the submission, approve it with specific conditions, or not approve it. Prior to approval of a PMA, the FDA may conduct a bioresearch monitoring inspection of the clinical trial data and clinical trial sites and a QSR inspection of the manufacturing facility and processes. Overall, the FDA review of a PMA application generally takes between one and three years, but may take significantly longer. The FDA can delay, limit or deny approval of a PMA application for many reasons, including:

· | the device may not be shown safe or effective to the FDA’s satisfaction;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the data from pre‑clinical studies and clinical trials may be insufficient to support approval;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the manufacturing process or facilities may not meet applicable requirements; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | changes in FDA approval policies or adoption of new regulations may require additional data.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  If the FDA evaluation of a PMA is favorable, the FDA will issue either an approval letter, or an approvable letter, which usually contains a number of conditions that must be met in order to secure final approval of the PMA. When and if those conditions have been fulfilled to the satisfaction of the FDA, the agency will issue a PMA approval letter authorizing commercial marketing of the device, subject to the conditions of approval and the limitations established in the approval letter. If the FDA’s evaluation of a PMA application or manufacturing facilities is not favorable, the FDA will deny approval of the PMA or issue a not approvable letter. The FDA also may determine that additional tests or clinical trials are necessary, in which case the PMA approval may be delayed for several months or years while the trials are conducted and data is submitted in an amendment to the PMA, or the PMA is withdrawn and resubmitted when the data are available. The PMA process can be expensive, uncertain and lengthy and a number of devices for which FDA approval has been sought by other companies have never been approved by the FDA for marketing.
 New PMA applications or PMA supplements may be required for modification to the manufacturing process, labeling, device specifications, materials or design of a device that has been approved through the PMA process. PMA supplements often require submission of the same type of information as an initial PMA application, except that the supplement is limited to information needed to support any changes from the device covered by the approved PMA application and may or may not require as extensive technical or clinical data or the convening of an advisory panel, depending on the nature of the proposed change.

 
  16

 

 In approving a PMA application, the FDA may also require some form of postmarket studies or postmarket surveillance, whereby the applicant follows certain patient groups for a number of years and makes periodic reports to the FDA on the clinical status of those patients when necessary to protect the public health or to provide additional safety and effectiveness data for the device. FDA may also require postmarket surveillance for certain devices cleared under a 510(k) notification, such as implants or life‑supporting or life‑sustaining devices used outside a device user facility. The FDA may also approve a PMA application with other post‑approval conditions intended to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device, such as, among other things, restrictions on labeling, promotion, sale, distribution and use.
 The FDA approved the iStent PMA on June 25, 2012, for the indication for use in combination with cataract surgery for the reduction of intraocular pressure in adult patients with mild‑to‑moderate open‑ angle glaucoma currently treated with prescription eye drops. The FDA imposed conditions of approval, including three postmarket studies (two of which are now completed), and a requirement that we implement a three‑part training program for physicians who will use the iStent device.
 We are required to file new PMA applications or PMA supplement applications for significant modifications to the manufacturing process, labeling and design of a device for which we have received approval through the PMA approval process.
 Post‑approval requirements
 After the FDA permits a device to enter commercial distribution, numerous regulatory requirements apply. These include, but are not limited to:

· | the registration and listing regulation, which requires manufacturers to register all manufacturing facilities and list all medical devices placed into commercial distribution;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the QSR, which requires manufacturers, including third‑party manufacturers, to follow elaborate design, testing, production, control, supplier/contractor selection, complaint handling, documentation and other quality assurance procedures during the manufacturing process;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | labeling regulations and unique device identification requirements;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------


· | advertising and promotion requirements;
--+----------------------------------------


· | restrictions on sale, distribution or use of a device;
--+-------------------------------------------------------


· | PMA annual reporting requirements;
--+-----------------------------------


· | the FDA’s general prohibition against promoting products for unapproved or “off‑label” uses;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the Medical Device Reporting (MDR) regulation, which requires that manufacturers report to the FDA if their device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if it were to reoccur;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | medical device correction and removal reporting regulations, which require that manufacturers report to the FDA field corrections and product recalls or removals if undertaken to reduce a risk to health posed by the device or to remedy a violation of the FDCA that may present a risk to health;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | recall requirements, including a mandatory recall if there is a reasonable probability that the device would cause serious adverse health consequences or death;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | an order of repair, replacement or refund;
--+-------------------------------------------


· | device tracking requirements; and
--+----------------------------------


· | postapproval study and postmarket surveillance requirements.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------

 
 
  17

 

 Our facilities, records and manufacturing processes are subject to periodic unscheduled inspections by the FDA. Failure to comply with the applicable United States medical device regulatory requirements could result in, among other things, warning letters, untitled letters, fines, injunctions, consent decrees, civil penalties, unanticipated expenditures, repairs, replacements, refunds, recalls or seizures of products, operating restrictions, total or partial suspension of production, the FDA’s refusal to issue certificates to foreign governments needed to export products for sale in other countries, the FDA’s refusal to grant future premarket clearances or approvals, withdrawals or suspensions of current product clearances or approvals and criminal prosecution.
 U.S. government regulation—drug delivery implant
 In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs and combination drug/device products under the FDCA and related regulations. Drugs are also subject to other federal, state and local statutes and regulations, which along with the FDCA govern, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, storage, recordkeeping, approval, labeling, advertising, promotion and marketing, distribution, post‑approval monitoring and reporting, and import and export of pharmaceutical products. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. regulatory requirements at any time during the drug product development process, approval process or post‑approval, may subject an applicant to administrative or judicial sanctions, including refusal by the FDA to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, imposition of a clinical hold, issuance of warning letters and other types of letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement of profits, or civil or criminal investigations and penalties brought by FDA and the Department of Justice, or other governmental entities. Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us.
 The steps required before a drug may be approved for marketing in the United States generally include:

· | completion of preclinical laboratory tests and animal tests conducted in compliance with the FDA’s Good Laboratory Practices;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the submission to the FDA of an IND which must become effective before human clinical trials commence in the United States;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | approval by an IRB at each clinical trial site before each trial may be initiated;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | obtaining informed consent from the participants in a clinical trial;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------


· | performance of adequate and well‑controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the product for each intended use and conducted in accordance with Good Clinical Practices (GCP);
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the submission to the FDA of an NDA seeking marketing authorization for the drug product;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | satisfactory completion of an FDA pre‑approval inspection of the facility or facilities at which the product is manufactured to assess compliance with FDA’s current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMPs) to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the drug’s identity, strength, quality and purity;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | satisfactory completion of a potential review by an FDA advisory committee, if applicable; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | FDA acceptance, review and approval of the NDA.
--+------------------------------------------------

  The investigational new drug process
 An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational drug to humans. Such authorization must be obtained prior to administration to humans of any new drug or dosage form, including a new use of a previously approved drug, that is not the subject of an approved NDA, except under limited circumstances.
 To conduct a clinical study of an investigational new drug product, we are required to file an IND with the FDA. The IND submission must include the general investigational plan and the protocol(s) for human studies, as well as results of animal studies or other human studies, as appropriate, analytical data and any available data or literature to 

 
  18

 
support the use of the investigational new drug. An IND must become effective before human clinical trials may begin. An IND will automatically become effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless before that time the FDA raises concerns or questions related to the proposed clinical trials as outlined in the IND. If the FDA raises questions, the IND may be placed on clinical hold and the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns or questions before clinical trials can begin. Accordingly, submission of an IND may or may not result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to begin. A separate submission to an existing IND must also be made for each successive clinical trial conducted during product development.
 Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational drug to patients under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with GCPs. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the study, how the study will be carried out, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety, and the efficacy criteria to be evaluated. A protocol for each clinical trial and any subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Additionally, approval must also be obtained from the IRB at each clinical site before the trials may be initiated. The IRB will consider, among other things, ethical factors, the safety of human subjects and the possible liability of the institution. The IRB must also monitor the trial until completed. Either FDA or an IRB may suspend or terminate an ongoing clinical trial at any time for a variety of reasons, including safety concerns or lack of protection of patient rights. All participants in our clinical trials must provide their informed consent in writing. In addition, there are requirements and industry guidelines that require the posting of ongoing clinical trials on public registries and the disclosure of designated clinical trial results. The IRB must also review and approve all clinical trial recruitment plans and materials.
 The clinical investigation of an investigational drug product is generally divided into three phases. Although the phases are usually conducted sequentially, they may overlap or be combined. The three phases of investigational new drug investigation are as follows:

· | Phase I. Phase I includes the initial introduction of an investigational new drug into humans. Phase I clinical trials are typically closely monitored and may be conducted in patients with the target disease or condition or healthy volunteers. These studies are designed to evaluate the safety, dosage tolerance, metabolism and pharmacologic actions of the investigational drug product in humans, the side effects associated with increasing doses, and if possible, to gain early evidence on effectiveness. During Phase I clinical trials, sufficient information about the investigational drug’s pharmacokinetics and pharmacological effects may be obtained to permit the design of well‑controlled and scientifically valid Phase II clinical trials. The total number of participants included in Phase I clinical trials varies, but is generally in the range of 20 to 80.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Phase II. Phase II includes the controlled clinical trials conducted to preliminarily evaluate the effectiveness of the investigational drug for a particular indication in patients with the disease or condition under study, to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage, and to identify possible adverse side effects and safety risks associated with the drug product. Phase II clinical trials are typically well‑controlled, closely monitored, and conducted in a limited patient population, usually involving no more than several hundred participants.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Phase III. Phase III clinical trials are generally controlled clinical trials conducted in an expanded patient population generally at multiple clinical trial sites. They are performed after preliminary evidence suggesting effectiveness of the drug product has been obtained and are intended to further evaluate dosage, clinical effectiveness and safety, to establish the overall benefit‑risk profile of the investigational drug product, and to provide an adequate basis for product approval and adequate information for product labeling. Phase III clinical trials usually involve several hundred to several thousand participants. In most cases, the FDA requires two adequate and well‑controlled Phase III clinical trials to demonstrate the efficacy of the drug. The FDA has the legal discretion to approve a drug on the basis of a single well‑controlled clinical trial although this is less common and typically is subject to significant restrictions.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  The FDA’s primary objectives in reviewing an IND are to assure the safety and rights of patients and to help assure that the quality of the investigation will be adequate to permit an evaluation of the drug’s effectiveness and safety. The decision to terminate development of an investigational drug product may be made by either the FDA, an IRB or ethics committee, or by the study sponsor for various reasons. Clinical trials may be overseen by an independent group

of qualified experts organized by the trial sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board or committee. Data safety monitoring boards provide review blinded study data at designated check points for safety risks. Suspension or termination of development during any phase of clinical trials can occur if it is determined that the participants or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable risk to health. Other reasons for suspension or termination may include changes in business objectives or the economic environment.
 The NDA approval process
 In order to obtain approval to market a drug product in the United States, a marketing application must be submitted to the FDA that includes data to establish the safety and effectiveness of the new drug product for the proposed indication. The NDA includes all relevant data available from pertinent preclinical and clinical trials, including negative or ambiguous results as well as positive findings, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacturing, controls and proposed labeling, among other things. The NDA filing must also be accompanied by a substantial user fee, although there may be some instances in which the user fee is waived.
 The FDA has 60 days from its receipt of an NDA to determine whether the application will be accepted for filing based on the agency’s threshold determination that it is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. The FDA has substantial discretion in the approval process and may refuse to accept any incomplete application. Incomplete applications must be resubmitted with any deficiencies corrected and may be subject to an additional user fee. 
 Once the NDA has been accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in‑depth substantive review and sets a Prescription Drug User Fee Act date that informs the applicant of the specific date by which the FDA intends to complete its review. The FDA has agreed to certain performance goals in the review of NDAs through a two‑tiered classification system, Standard Review and Priority Review. Priority Review designation is given to drugs that treat serious diseases or conditions that offer significant improvements over existing therapies. The FDA endeavors to review applications subject to Standard Review within 10 to 12 months, whereas the FDA’s goal is to review Priority Review applications within six to eight months, depending on whether the drug is a new molecular entity. The review process is often extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification. The FDA reviews NDAs to determine, among other things, whether the proposed product is safe and effective for its intended use, and whether the product is being manufactured in accordance with cGMP to assure and preserve the product’s identity, strength, quality and purity. Before approving an NDA, the FDA will review the proposed product labeling and may request changes. FDA will also inspect the facilities at which the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the product unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. In addition, before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP. If the FDA determines the application, manufacturing process or manufacturing facilities are not acceptable, it will communicate the deficiencies to the applicant and often will request additional testing or information, including new clinical trials. Even with the submission of additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory standards for approval.
 After the FDA evaluates the NDA and the manufacturing facilities, it issues either an approval letter or a complete response letter which indicates that the review cycle for an application is complete but that the application is not ready for approval. A complete response letter generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing (including clinical testing), or information, in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. Even with submission of this additional information, the FDA may ultimately decide that an application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval. If, or when, the deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA’s satisfaction in a resubmission of the NDA, the FDA will issue an approval letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications.
 The clinical testing and drug approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, and each may take several years to complete. Data obtained from clinical activities are not always conclusive and may be susceptible to varying interpretations, which could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval. The FDA may not grant approval on a timely basis, or at all. Even if the FDA approves a product, the agency may limit the approved indications for use, impose prominent warnings, or place other conditions on approval that could restrict the commercial application of the products, such as special risk management measures through a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy. After 

 
  20

 
approval, some types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes and additional labeling claims, are subject to further testing requirements and FDA review and pre-approval.
 Section 505 of the FDCA describes three types of NDAs: (1) an application that contains full reports of investigations of safety and effectiveness (section 505(b)(1)); (2) an application that contains full reports of investigations of safety and effectiveness but where at least some of the information required for approval comes from studies not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference (section 505(b)(2)); and (3) an application that contains information to show that the proposed product has the same active ingredient, dosage form, strength, route of administration, labeling, quality, performance characteristics, and intended use, among other things, to a previously approved product (section 505(j)).
 Our iDose implant may be eligible for the Section 505(b)(2) application pathway if and when we are prepared to submit an application for marketing to the FDA. Section 505(b)(2) expressly permits the FDA to rely, in approving an NDA, on data not developed by the applicant. Thus, if a 505(b)(2) applicant can establish that reliance on the FDA’s previous findings of safety and effectiveness is scientifically appropriate, it may eliminate the need to conduct certain preclinical or clinical studies of the new product. We are pursuing a Section 505(b)(2) NDA regulatory strategy for our iDose implant which we expect will allow us to rely in our NDA filing on certain nonclinical and clinical safety findings made by the FDA in previous approvals. For changes to a previously approved drug product, an application may rely on the FDA’s finding of safety and effectiveness of the previously approved drug, coupled with the information needed to support the change from the approved drug product. The additional information could be new studies conducted by the applicant or published data. The FDA may approve the new product candidate for all, or some, of the label indications for which the reference drug has been approved, as well as for any new indication sought by the 505(b)(2) applicant.
 The filing or approval of a Section 505(b)(2) application may be delayed due to patent or exclusivity protections covering an approved product. Section 505(b)(2) applications must include patent certifications and must provide notice of certain patent certifications to the NDA holder and patent owner. A Section 505(b)(2) application may be granted three years of Hatch-Waxman data exclusivity if one or more of the clinical investigations, other than bioavailability/bioequivalence studies, was essential to approval of the application and was conducted or sponsored by the applicant. Such exclusivity would cover only the new condition of use that was supported by the clinical trials that were essential to approval.
 Circumstances could change that may cause a Section 505(b)(2) application for our product to no longer be an appropriate pathway. For example, if an equivalent drug product were approved before our application is submitted, the applicable pathway for our drug product might be an Abbreviated New Drug Application (ANDA). An ANDA seeks approval of a drug product that has the same active ingredient(s), dosage form, strength, route of administration, and conditions of use (labeling) as a so‑called “reference listed drug” approved under an NDA with full supporting data to establish safety and effectiveness. Limited exceptions exist to this ANDA sameness requirement, including certain limited variations approved by the FDA through a special petition process. An ANDA must contain certifications relating to patents for the reference listed drug. An ANDA also generally contains limited clinical data to demonstrate that the product covered by the ANDA is absorbed in the body at the same rate and to the same extent as the reference listed drug, which is known as bioequivalence. In addition, the ANDA must contain information regarding the manufacturing processes and facilities that will be used to ensure product quality, and must contain certifications to patents listed with the FDA for the reference listed drug.
 Post‑approval regulation
 After regulatory approval of a drug or combination drug/device product is obtained under an NDA, we are required to comply with pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to drug listing and registration, recordkeeping, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, advertising, marketing and promotion and reporting of adverse experiences with the product. For example, as a condition of approval of an NDA, the FDA may require post‑marketing testing, including Phase IV clinical trials, and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product’s safety and effectiveness after commercialization. In addition, the holder of an approved NDA would be required to report, among other things, certain adverse events and production problems to the FDA, and to provide updated safety and efficacy information to the FDA. Drugs may be marketed only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label, and even if the FDA approves a product, it may 

 
  21

 
limit the approved indications for use for the product or impose other conditions, including labeling or distribution restrictions or other risk‑management mechanisms. For a combination drug/device product, such as our iDose implant, certain device reporting requirements might also apply, such as MDR requirements and reports of corrections and removal.
 Quality control and manufacturing procedures must continue to conform to cGMP after approval. In addition, medical device quality system regulations would apply to the device component of a combination drug/device product, either all the QSR regulations or particular QSR regulations supplementing the drug cGMP in accordance with FDA regulations in 21 C.F.R. Part 4. The FDA periodically inspects manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with cGMP and QSR. In addition, changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated, and, depending on the significance of the change, may require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP or QSR and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon us and any third‑party manufacturers that we may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMP, QSR, and other aspects of regulatory compliance.
 After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims, as well as some manufacturing and supplier changes, are subject to prior FDA review and approval of a new NDA or an NDA supplement. An NDA supplement for a new indication typically requires clinical data and the FDA uses similar procedures in reviewing NDA supplements as it does in reviewing NDAs. The manufacturer and/or sponsor under an approved NDA are also subject to annual product and establishment user fees, as well as new application fees for certain supplemental applications.
 Discovery of previously unknown problems with a product or the failure to comply with applicable requirements may result in restrictions on a product, manufacturer or holder of an approved NDA, including withdrawal or recall of the product from the market or other voluntary, FDA‑initiated or judicial action that could delay or prohibit further marketing. Other potential consequences include, among other things:

· | fines, warning letters or holds on post‑approval clinical trials;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------


· | refusal of the FDA to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications, or suspension or revocation of product license approvals;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; or
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------

  Newly discovered or developed safety or effectiveness data may require changes to a product’s approved labeling, including the addition of new warnings and contraindications, and also may require the implementation of other risk management measures and/or additional clinical studies. In addition, the FDA strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of products that are placed on the market. Drugs may be promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off‑label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off‑label uses may be subject to significant liability.
 New government requirements, including those resulting from new legislation, may be established, or the FDA’s policies may change, which could delay or prevent regulatory approval of our products under development and/or could significantly impact the requirements imposed on us after approval.
 Available special regulatory procedures
 Formal meetings
 In the United States, there are different types of official meetings that may occur between us and the FDA. Each meeting type is subject to different procedures. Conclusions and agreements from each of these meetings are captured in the official final meeting minutes issued by the FDA.

 
  22

 

 Advice from the FDA is typically provided based on questions concerning quality (chemistry, manufacturing and controls testing), pre‑clinical testing and clinical studies, and pharmacovigilance plans and risk‑management programs. Advice is not legally binding with regard to any future marketing application for the drug product.
 To obtain binding commitments from the FDA on the design and size of clinical trials intended to form the primary basis of an effectiveness claim for a new drug product, Special Protocol Assessment (SPA) procedures are available. Where the FDA agrees to an SPA, the agreement may not be changed by either the sponsor or the FDA except if the sponsor and the FDA agree to a change, or a senior FDA official determines that a substantial scientific issue essential to determining the safety or effectiveness of the product was identified after the testing began. An SPA is not binding if new circumstances arise, and there is no guarantee that a study will ultimately be adequate to support an approval even if the study is conducted according to the terms of an SPA.
 Other healthcare laws
 We are also subject to healthcare regulation and enforcement by the federal government and the states and foreign governments in which we conduct our business. These laws include, without limitation, state and federal anti‑kickback, fraud and abuse, false claims, and physician sunshine laws and regulations.
 The federal Anti‑Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, the offer, receipt, or payment of remuneration in exchange for or to induce the use of products or services that are paid for in whole or part by Medicare, Medicaid or other federal healthcare programs. Remuneration has been broadly defined to include anything of value, including cash, improper discounts, and free or reduced price items and services. The government has enforced the Anti‑Kickback Statute to reach large settlements with healthcare companies based on sham research or consulting and other financial arrangements with physicians. Further, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it. In addition, the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti‑Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal False Claims Act (FCA). Many states have similar laws that apply to their state healthcare programs as well as private payors. Violations of the Anti‑Kickback Statute can result in exclusion from federal healthcare programs and substantial civil and criminal penalties.
 The FCA imposes civil liability on persons who, among other things, present or cause to be presented false or fraudulent claims for payment by a federal healthcare program. The FCA has been used to prosecute persons submitting claims for payment that are inaccurate or fraudulent, that are for services not provided as claimed, or for services that are not medically necessary. Manufacturers can be held liable under these laws if they are deemed to “cause” the submission of false or fraudulent claims by, for example, providing inaccurate billing or coding information to customers or promoting a product off‑label. Actions under the FCA may be brought by the Attorney General or as a qui tam action by a private individual in the name of the government. Violations of the FCA can result in significant monetary penalties and treble damages. The federal government is using the FCA, and the accompanying threat of significant liability, in its investigation and prosecution of device companies throughout the country, for example, in connection with the promotion of products for unapproved uses and other improper sales and marketing practices. The government has obtained multi‑million and multi‑billion dollar settlements under the FCA. In addition, companies have been forced to implement extensive corrective action plans, and have often become subject to consent decrees or corporate integrity agreements, severely restricting the manner in which they conduct their business. 
 In addition, there has been a trend of increased federal and state regulation of payments made to physicians and other healthcare providers. The Affordable Care Act (ACA), among other things, imposed new annual reporting requirements on certain device manufacturers for payments made by them to physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as certain ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Failure to submit required information may result in civil monetary penalties of up to $1 million. Certain states also mandate implementation of commercial compliance programs and/or require the tracking and reporting of gifts, compensation and other remuneration to physicians.
 The shifting commercial compliance environment and the need to build and maintain robust systems to comply with different compliance and/or reporting requirements in multiple jurisdictions increase the possibility that a healthcare company may violate one or more of the requirements. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of such laws or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including, without limitation, 

 
  23

 
civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs and imprisonment, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results.
 Regulation outside the United States
 In addition to regulations in the United States, we are subject to a variety of regulations in other jurisdictions governing clinical trials and commercial sales and distribution of our products. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain authorization before commencing clinical trials or obtain marketing authorization or approval of a product under the comparable regulatory authorities of countries outside the United States before we can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. The approval process varies from country to country and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval. The requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary greatly from country to country.
 Other
 Our operations and many of the products we manufacture or sell are subject to extensive regulation by numerous other governmental agencies, both within and outside the United States. In the United States, apart from the agencies discussed above, our facilities, operations, employees, products (their manufacture, sale, import and export) and services are regulated by Environmental Protection Agency, the Occupational Health & Safety Administration, the Department of Labor, Customs and Border Protection, the Department of Commerce, the Department of Treasury, the Department of Justice and others. Furthermore, because we supply products and services to healthcare providers that are reimbursed by federally funded programs such as Medicare, our activities are also subject to regulation by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and enforcement by the Office of the Inspector General within the Department of Health and Human Services. We are also required to report payments and other transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals, among others. State agencies also regulate our facilities, operations, employees, products and services within their respective states. Government agencies outside the United States also regulate public health, product registration, manufacturing, environmental conditions, labor, exports, imports and other aspects of our global operations. Employees
 As of December 31, 2017, we had 387 employees, with 183 in sales and marketing, 132 in research and development, clinical, regulatory and quality assurance, 44 in general and administrative, and 28 in manufacturing and distribution. We often supplement our research and development and clinical, regulatory and quality assurance departments with independent consultants on a project basis. We believe that our future success will depend in part on our continued ability to attract, hire and retain qualified personnel. None of our employees is represented by a labor union. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good. Available Information
