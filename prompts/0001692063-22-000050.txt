Company Overview
Schneider National, Inc. and its subsidiaries (together “Schneider,” the “Company,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) are among the largest providers of surface transportation and logistics solutions in North America. We offer a multimodal portfolio of services and possess an array of capabilities and resources that leverage artificial intelligence, data science, and analytics to provide innovative solutions that coordinate the movement of customer products timely, safely, and effectively. The Company offers truckload, intermodal, and logistics services to a diverse customer base throughout the continental United States, Canada, and Mexico, thus adding value to their supply chains. We were founded in 1935 and have been a publicly held holding company since our initial public offering in 2017. Our stock is publicly traded on the NYSE under the ticker symbol SNDR.
Our diversified portfolio of complementary service offerings combines truckload services with intermodal and logistics offerings, enabling us to serve the varied needs of our customers. Our service offerings include transportation of full-truckload freight, which we directly transport utilizing either our company-controlled revenue equipment and company drivers or owner-operators under contract with us. We have arrangements with most of the major North American rail carriers to transport freight in containers. We also provide customized freight movement, revenue equipment, labor, systems, and delivery services tailored to meet individual customer requirements and which typically involve long-term contracts. These arrangements are generally referred to as dedicated services and may include multiple pickups and drops, local deliveries, freight handling, specialized equipment, and freight network design. We also provide comprehensive logistics services with a network of thousands of reliable third-party carriers, and through a China-based subsidiary, we offer limited transportation and logistics services in China which consist primarily of brokerage services. We categorize our operations into the following reportable segments:
•Truckload – which consists of freight transported and delivered by our company-employed drivers in company trucks and by owner-operators. These services are executed through either network or dedicated contracts and include standard long-haul and regional shipping services primarily using dry van, bulk, temperature-controlled, and flat-bed equipment, as well as cross dock and customized solutions for high-value and time-sensitive loads with coverage throughout North America.
•Intermodal – which consists of door-to-door container on flat car (“COFC”) service through a combination of rail and dray transportation, in association with our rail carrier providers. Our intermodal service uses company-owned containers, chassis, and trucks with primarily company dray drivers, augmented by third-party dray capacity.
•Logistics – which consists of freight brokerage (including Power Only which leverages our nationwide trailer pools to match capacity with demand), supply chain (including 3PL), warehousing, and import/export services. Our logistics business provides value-added services using both our assets and third-party capacity, augmented by our trailing assets, to manage and move our customers’ freight. 
Our business is seasonal across each of our segments which generally translates to our reported revenues being the lowest in the first quarter and highest in the fourth quarter.
For more information on our reportable segments, see Note 15, Segment Reporting.
Additionally, we lease equipment to third parties through our wholly owned subsidiary Schneider Finance, Inc., which is primarily engaged in leasing trucks to owner-operators, including, but not limited to, owner-operators with whom we contract, and we provide insurance for both company drivers and owner-operators through our wholly owned insurance subsidiary.
Our Mission and Strategy
We are driven by our uncompromising values to safely deliver goods that enhance the lives of people everywhere. We forge long-term relationships with key customers as an integral partner in, and extension of, their supply chains. Our strategy is based on delivering superior experiences to our customers utilizing an integrated, multimodal approach to provide capacity-oriented solutions centered on delivering customer value and industry-leading service. We believe our operating strategy adds value to customers, fuels our earnings, and generates returns to stockholders. We continually analyze opportunities for capital investment and effective capital deployment to provide additional benefits to our customers and increase returns for our shareholders. 
Business DevelopmentsAcquisition
On December 31, 2021, the Company completed the acquisition of MLS, a privately held truckload carrier based in Celina, OH. MLS is a dedicated carrier that primarily serves the central U.S. and complements our growing dedicated operations. Because the acquisition closed on December 31, 2021, MLS did not have an impact on our consolidated results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2021. Refer to Note 2, Acquisition, for additional details.
COVID-19COVID-19 was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization in March 2020. In response to the pandemic, the Company took steps to mitigate the potential risks posed by the pandemic and implemented measures to keep our associates, drivers, and owner-operators safe and minimize unnecessary risk of exposure to COVID-19. Safety and cybersecurity measures remain in place to ensure the well-being of our associates and that our systems are capable of serving our operational needs and providing uninterrupted service to our customers.
Schneider continues to monitor the situation and will take further actions as may be required by federal, state, or local governmental authorities, or that we determine are in the best interests of our associates, customers, and shareholders.
Industry and Competition
Truckload
The trucking industry is at the core of the U.S. economy and moves the vast majority of freight volume in the U.S. It is a highly competitive and fragmented industry, characterized by many small carriers. Increased regulations and initiatives to improve the safety and reduce emissions of the U.S. trucking industry have impacted industry dynamics in recent years and are discussed in the Regulation section below. Our Truckload segment competes with thousands of dry van and specialty equipment carriers. While we compete with many smaller carriers on a regional basis, only a limited number of carriers represent competition in all markets across North America.
Intermodal
The domestic intermodal segment is highly consolidated, where the top three intermodal providers, including our Intermodal segment, operate a significant portion of the U.S. domestic container fleet. Our Intermodal segment competes with intermodal providers and other transportation service companies, including truckload carriers.
Logistics
The logistics industry is a large, fast-growing, and fragmented market that represents an integral part of the global economy. Transportation asset owners often provide logistics services to meet excess demand and provide customers with greater breadth of services which results in our Logistics segment competing with other logistics companies and brokerage businesses and, to a lesser extent, other truckload carriers.
Customers 
During the year ended December 31, 2021, we offered our services to approximately 8,500 customers across our portfolio, including nearly 200 Fortune 500 companies, and 24 of our top 25 customers used services from all three of our reportable segments. Our Logistics segment manages over 50,000 qualified carrier relationships and managed approximately $3.0 billion of third-party freight in 2021. 
Our broad portfolio helps limit customer and industry concentration as we receive revenue from a diversified customer base. We maintain a broad end-market footprint, encompassing over ten distinct industries including general merchandise, chemicals, electronics and appliances, and food and beverage. Our diversified revenue mix and customer base allow for revenue and yield management stability throughout the year, despite the fact that many of our customers are affected by seasonal fluctuations.
Revenue Equipment 
Our company owned revenue equipment fleet was comprised of the following at December 31, 2021:
Revenue Equipment Type | Approximate Number of Units
Over-the-road sleeper cab tractors | 7,100 
Day cab tractors | 1,800 
Other tractors (yard tractors, straight trucks, and training tractors) | 100 
Trailers | 36,700 
Containers | 25,600 
Chassis | 20,600 

The table above excludes approximately 900 tractors and 3,600 trailers owned by MLS, which was acquired effective December 31, 2021.
Human Capital Management
Schneider is committed to promoting a diverse and inclusive culture that values and respects the varied talents and perspectives of our associates. We recognize the advantage of hiring and retaining associates who help us create value for our shareholders.
Associates and Workforce 
As of December 31, 2021, we employed approximately 16,050 associates (exclusive of MLS associates), 67% of whom are drivers with the remaining 33% consisting of mechanics and warehouse personnel, managers, and other corporate office associates. With the acquisition of MLS on December 31, 2021, roughly 1,000 associates were added. Approximately 16% of our associates are based at our headquarters in Green Bay, Wisconsin. We have not experienced any work stoppages and consider our associate relations to be good. Currently, five of our company drivers are members of an organized labor union, as a result of a commitment we made in the 1980s to allow this group of drivers to finish their careers at Schneider while remaining union members. None of our other associates are represented by a labor union.
As a result of our performance, integrity, and collaborative culture, we have a highly engaged workforce deployed over a diverse set of positions across our segments, geographies, and businesses. Where consistent with our operational needs, we offer a variety of flexible working arrangements to associates, including remote and blended work configurations.
Associate Recruitment, Development, and Retention
•Company drivers - As a result of retirements, high turnover rates, and the challenges of attracting new drivers, the industry and the long-haul truckload sector, in particular, have been characterized by persistent shortages of truck drivers. Recognizing the indispensable role that our drivers play in the ability to serve our customers, we remain focused on making our driver experience the best in the industry. We employ measures to improve retention, and our turnover rate is generally consistent with the industry standard. Those measures include establishing monthly hiring targets, offering drivers competitive salaries and benefits, establishing driver pay scales which provide for increasing pay by experience level and performance, offering both live and remote driver training by experienced driving instructors, maintaining a modern truck fleet with the latest safety technology, and improving the overall driver experience.
•Non-driver Company associates - Our warehouse personnel, managers, and other corporate office associates help to facilitate and coordinate service to customers, ensure equipment is operational and well maintained, and generally support our operations. As we strive to offer best-in-class service to our customers, we focus on hiring top talent and providing them with opportunities for development and growth within their roles and throughout the organization. We utilize a performance management system that incorporates goals and development plans that are assessed semiannually to better position associates for future career growth. Succession planning is regularly performed to help identify and develop a pipeline of talent in critical roles within our organization. Additionally, we routinely conduct market analyses to ensure wages and benefits remain competitive, and we offer associates classroom, virtual, and web-based training options through our comprehensive learning program. 
Associate Engagement
We promote associate engagement throughout our organization. We conduct biennial associate surveys to measure associate satisfaction and garner ideas to improve workforce engagement. Survey results are used to implement programs that will enhance associate connectivity with the Company which is believed to lead to increased innovation, productivity, and profitability.
Diversity and Inclusion
We believe diversity fuels innovation, improves strategic thinking, and cultivates leadership. ‘Respect for All’ is one of our four core values. We embrace and seek out diversity that is inclusive of thought, race, ethnicity, gender, age, religion, sexual orientation, experience, and background. We have established Cultural Connections, an internal group committed to educating ourselves and coworkers on topics that pertain to who we are, and in 2021, we were named a “Top Company for Women to Work for in Transportation” by Redefining the Road, the official magazine of the Women in Trucking Association (WIT).Safety 
“Safety first and always” is a Schneider core value. We believe we have a responsibility to our associates, customers, and the community to operate safely. Our safety culture is built on five key components:
•Driver hiring and drug testing. We hire both experienced drivers and drivers new to the industry through a comprehensive hiring process. As part of that process, we voluntarily choose to use hair follicle testing in addition to mandated urine-based drug testing. While costing more per driver, hair follicle testing is generally more accurate than urine-based testing.
•Military drivers. We have a strong relationship with the U.S. military and employ many drivers with military experience. This experience produces quality truck drivers due to the discipline instilled through military training programs. 
•Training. Initial training is complemented by regularly scheduled follow-up training to sustain and enhance basic skills. We operate company-sponsored driver training facilities and have invested in simulators for both initial and sustainment training.
•Equipment and technology. We invest in trucks that are configured with roll stability, collision mitigation, lane departure warning, and forward-facing cameras. Driving behavior is electronically monitored, alerts are provided to the driver situationally, and performance is documented for subsequent coaching. We also employ electronic logging in an effort to ensure HOS compliance and reduce fatigue occurrences.
•Active management. Driver leaders and safety coordinators have real-time access to activity in the truck, facilitating situational and scheduled coaching. We have invested in predictive analytics that assist in proactively identifying drivers with potential safety issues and recommending a remediation path. 
Truckload carriers share safety performance information in monitored peer-to-peer forums. We have always maintained a satisfactory DOT safety rating, which is the highest available rating.
Owner-Operators
In addition to the company drivers we employ, we enter into contracts with independent contractors who work as “owner-operators”. Owner-operators are small business owners who own and maintain their own trucks, may employ drivers they hire, and provide us with services under a contractual arrangement whereby they are generally responsible for the costs of truck ownership and operating expenses. Owner-operators select their own load assignments, have control over their schedule, and are compensated on a per load basis. Owner-operators tend to be experienced drivers and represented approximately 18% of driver capacity as of December 31, 2021.
Environmental, Social, and Governance
We prioritize doing business responsibly and embrace that we have a role to play in the betterment of society. At Schneider, we define sustainability broadly as safe and responsible practices that strengthen the economy and create a safer world. We seek to accomplish this by maintaining a modern fleet to maximize fuel efficiency, leveraging our intermodal service to convert loads from truck to rail, consolidating freight whenever possible, and introducing technologies to coordinate the movement of products timely, safely, and efficiently. Additionally, we continue to evaluate alternative fuel vehicles, and our efforts to improve overall fleet fuel efficiency and reduce GHG emissions are ongoing. In 2022, we will begin adding a limited number of battery-electric zero emission trucks to our fleet to contribute toward the Company’s goal of cutting its carbon dioxide emissions by 7.5% per mile by 2025 and 60% per mile by 2035. We are an EPA SmartWay® Transport Partner and are proud 
to be one of only four freight carriers to receive the EPA’s SmartWay® Excellence Award each year since the award was created. We were the first company to receive the National Safety Council’s Green Cross for Safety Award for two consecutive years. As always, we continue to ingrain safety into our corporate culture and strive to conduct all of our operations as safely as possible.
Fuel
We actively manage our fuel purchasing network in an effort to maintain adequate fuel supplies. In 2021, we made 99% of our fuel purchases through negotiated volume purchase discounts. We store fuel in underground storage tanks at six locations and in above-ground storage tanks at one location. We believe that we are in substantive compliance with applicable environmental laws relating to the storage of fuel.
In response to fluctuations in fuel prices, we use surcharge programs to adjust fuel costs charged to our customers. We believe the most cost-effective protection against variability in fuel costs is to continue the fuel surcharge programs and invest in a fuel-efficient fleet. However, fuel surcharges may not adequately cover potential future increases in fuel prices. As an additional measure, we leverage fuel consumption metrics in evaluating drivers’ performance, and drivers utilize a fuel optimizer program where they purchase fuel at the most cost-effective locations based on distance to empty and fuel purchase commitments. 
Regulation
Our operations as a for-hire motor carrier are regulated and licensed by various federal, state, and local government agencies in North America, including the U.S. DOT, FMCSA, U.S. DHS, NHTSA, EPA, and OSHA. These regulatory authorities have broad powers over matters relating to authorized motor carrier operations, as well as motor carrier registration, safety and fitness of transportation equipment and drivers, transportation of hazardous materials, certain mergers and acquisitions, and periodic financial reporting. Our driver associates and owner-operators must also comply with enacted governmental regulations regarding safety, equipment, and operating methods. Examples include the DOT regulation of equipment weight, equipment dimensions, driver HOS, drug and alcohol testing of our current and prospective driver associates, as well as other driver eligibility requirements, on-board reporting of operations, and ergonomics. The FMCSA Commercial Driver’s License Drug and Alcohol Clearinghouse rule (“Clearinghouse”) requires employers to report information related to violations of the drug and alcohol regulation for current and prospective driver employees and to query the Clearinghouse for such driver employees before allowing them to operate a commercial motor vehicle on public roads, as well as at least annually for current drivers. In addition, we are subject to compliance with cargo-security and transportation regulations issued by the Transportation Security Administration (“TSA”) and Customs and Border Protection (“CBP”) within the DHS, and our cross-border operations in Canada and Mexico are subject to regulation by each of those countries.
We are subject to various environmental laws and regulations dealing with, among other aspects of our operations, the handling of hazardous materials, underground fuel storage tanks at our terminals, emissions from our vehicles and facilities, engine idling, and discharge and retention of storm water. These laws and regulations have the potential to increase costs, risks, and liabilities associated with our applicable operations. Additionally, we may be impacted by potential future legislation and regulations related to climate change.
We are also subject to a variety of laws and regulations which are targeted at reducing GHG emissions and improving air quality and fuel efficiency at a national level. Prominent among those regulations are certain environmental regulations in effect in the State of California, including the Heavy-Duty Vehicle GHG Emission Reduction Regulation which was issued to reduce GHG emissions from certain long-haul tractor-trailers that operate in California by requiring owners of such vehicles or equipment to retrofit their vehicles with aerodynamic elements and accessories and implement technologies that improve fuel efficiency (regardless of where the vehicle is registered), and the ACT regulation, which requires original equipment manufacturers to begin shifting towards greater production of zero-emission heavy duty tractors beginning in 2024. Under the ACT, every new tractor sold in California will need to be zero-emission by 2045. While the ACT does not apply to those simply operating tractors in California, it could impact the cost and/or supply of traditional diesel tractors and lead to similar legislation in other states or at the federal level. The EPA and the NHTSA have also begun taking coordinated steps in support of a new generation of clean vehicles and engines to reduce GHG emissions. Complying with these and any future GHG regulations enacted by California’s Air Resources Board, the EPA, the NHTSA, and/or any other state or federal governing body has increased and will likely continue to increase the cost of our new tractors, may increase the cost of new trailers, may require us to retrofit certain of our trailers, may increase our maintenance costs, and could impair equipment productivity and increase our operating costs, particularly if such costs are not offset by potential fuel savings. These adverse effects, combined with the uncertainty as to the reliability of the newly designed diesel engines and the residual values of our equipment, could materially increase our costs or otherwise adversely affect our business or operations. We cannot predict, however, the extent to which our operations and productivity will be impacted. We will continue monitoring our compliance with federal and state GHG regulations.
Federal and state lawmakers are considering a variety of other climate-change proposals related to carbon and GHG emissions. The proposals could potentially limit carbon emissions within certain states and municipalities, which would restrict the location and amount of time that diesel-powered tractors may idle. Such proposals could result in a decrease in productivity or increase driver turnover. Regulatory requirements and changes in regulatory requirements may affect our business or the economics of the industry by requiring changes in operating practices that could influence the demand for and increase the costs of providing transportation services. If current regulatory requirements become more stringent or new environmental laws and regulations regarding climate change are introduced, we could be required to make significant capital expenditures or discontinue certain activities.
We believe that our operations are in material compliance with current laws and regulations and do not know of any existing compliance issues or environmental conditions that would reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on our business or operating results. Additionally, we continue to monitor and evaluate the proposed rule makings of the DOT, FMCSA, NHTSA, EPA, State of California, and other federal and state regulatory agencies to determine the expected impact on our operations.
Technology
Our in-cab telematics platform delivers on-board technology through our private application store to enable communication, regulatory compliance, and driver productivity needs. This comprehensive platform includes message capabilities, applications that scan and automate paperwork, and customer and location specific step-by-step work assignments. Our telematics platform is fully integrated with our back-office planning and execution systems and delivers real-time data in our business.

All tractor technology interfaces with the in-cab device and provides the driver and the driver’s leader with real-time performance data.
Our business is executed through an integrated technology platform that encompasses an end-to-end process design which focuses on information accessibility across our value chain. Our platform enables an integrated approach to cash processing including load/order acceptance based on driver and network optimization, vehicle dispatch, continuous quote monitoring, and visibility to the load from pick-up to delivery and customer collection. Proprietary decision support tools are embedded throughout the platform and assist our associates in making the right trade-offs among drivers’ needs for earnings and work-life balance, customers’ needs for reliable capacity and service, and our business and its shareholders’ needs for an adequate return. Decision support tools improve our ability to, among other things, situationally coach drivers, minimize fuel costs, and maintain the fleet in the most cost-effective manner. 
Schneider FreightPower® digitally connects the benefits of Quest with the strength of our trailer network and carrier relationships to service our customers. We continue to expand our business capabilities by extending our foundational Quest platform, making advancements to our in-cab technology, and leveraging mobile applications to better connect with company drivers and customers. One example is a mobile application that prompts our company drivers to rate the shipping, receiving, and driver support locations that they visit. Our gathering and sharing of this information with customers and providers have been well received and are driving action to improve the drivers' experience. Additionally, through our investment in MLSI, in which we are collaborating to develop a Transportation Management System using MLSI’s SaaS technology, we aim to further complement our technology platform and enable enhanced decision making, resource allocation, and visibility with our supply chain partners.
