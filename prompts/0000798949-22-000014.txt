GENERAL
We were founded in 1963 as an oil and natural gas contract drilling company. Today, besides our drilling operations, we have operations in the exploration and production and mid-stream areas. We operate, manage, and analyze our results of operations through our three principal business segments:
•Oil and Natural Gas – carried out by our subsidiary Unit Petroleum Company. This segment explores, develops, acquires, and produces oil and natural gas properties for our account. The company initiated an asset divestiture program at the beginning of 2021 to sell certain non-core oil and gas properties and reserves (the “Divestiture Program”). On October 4, 2021, the company announced that it is expanding the Divestiture Program to now include the potential sale of additional properties, including up to all of UPC’s oil and gas properties and reserves. On January 20, 2022, the company announced that it has retained a financial advisor and launched the process.
•Contract Drilling – carried out by our subsidiary Unit Drilling Company. This segment contracts to drill onshore oil and natural gas wells for others and our account.
•Mid-Stream – carried out by Superior. This segment buys, sells, gathers, processes, and treats natural gas for third parties and our account.
Each company may conduct operations through subsidiaries of its own. We also have several other subsidiaries, none of which conduct material operations.

Emergence From Voluntary Reorganization Under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code
On May 22, 2020, the Debtors filed petitions for reorganization under Chapter 11 of Title 11 of the United States Code (Bankruptcy Code) in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Texas, Houston Division. The Chapter 11 proceedings were jointly administered under the caption In re Unit Corporation, et al., Case No. 20-32740 (DRJ). During the pendency of the Chapter 11 Cases, the Debtors operated their business as "debtors-in-possession" under the authority of the bankruptcy court and under the Bankruptcy Code. 
The Debtors filed their Plan and the related disclosure statement with the bankruptcy court on June 9, 2020. On August 6, 2020, the bankruptcy court entered the “Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order (I) Approving the Disclosure Statement on a Final Basis and (II) Confirming the Debtors’ Amended Joint Chapter 11 Plan of Reorganization” [Docket No. 340] (Confirmation Order) confirming the Plan. On September 3, 2020, the Debtors emerged from the Chapter 11 Cases. 
2021 SEGMENT OPERATIONS HIGHLIGHTS

•Revenues before eliminations increased by 69% from 2020 primarily due to higher average commodity pricing, partially offset by lower production volumes.
•Operating costs before eliminations decreased 43% from 2020.
•Capital expenditures increased 89% from 2020.
Contract Drilling
•Revenues decreased 18% from 2020 primarily due to the absence of 2020 rig termination and standby fees. Average rig utilization increased 8% to 10.9 rigs during 2021 while there was a 4% decrease in average dayrate to $17,987.
•Operating costs decreased 7% from 2020 primarily due to a decrease in rig fleet from 58 to 21 in 2021.
Mid-Stream 
•Revenues before eliminations increased 87% and operating expenses before eliminations increased 114% from 2020 primarily due to higher commodity pricing, partially offset by lower volumes.
•Acquired a cryogenic processing plant, approximately 1,620 miles of low-pressure gathering pipeline, and related compressor stations located in southern Kansas in November 2021.
FINANCIAL INFORMATION ABOUT SEGMENTS
See Note 23 - Industry Segment Information of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report for information about each of our segment’s revenues, profits or losses, and total assets.
OIL AND NATURAL GAS
General. All our oil and natural gas properties are in the United States. Our producing oil and natural gas properties, unproved properties, and related assets are mainly in Oklahoma and Texas, and to a lesser extent Kansas, Louisiana, Montana, North Dakota, Utah, and Wyoming.
When we are the operator of a property, we try to use one of our drilling rigs to drill any wells on the property, and we also use our mid-stream segment to gather our gas if it is economical to do so.
This table presents certain information regarding our oil and natural gas operations as of December 31, 2021:

Dispositions. The company initiated an asset divestiture program at the beginning of 2021 to sell certain non-core oil and gas properties and reserves (the “Divestiture Program”). On October 4, 2021, the company announced that it is expanding the Divestiture Program to now include the potential sale of additional properties, including up to all of UPC’s oil and gas properties and reserves. On January 20, 2022, the company announced that it has retained a financial advisor and launched the process.
On March 8, 2022, the company closed on the sale of wells and related leases located near the Oklahoma Panhandle for $5.0 million, subject to customary closing and post-closing adjustments with an effective date of December 1, 2021. No gain or loss was recognized as the sale of these assets did not result in a significant alteration of the full cost pool.
On August 16, 2021, the company closed on the sale of substantially all of our wells and related leases located near Oklahoma City, Oklahoma for $19.5 million, subject to customary closing and post-closing adjustments. No gain or loss was recognized as the sale of these assets did not result in a significant alteration of the full cost pool.
On May 6, 2021, the company closed on the sale of substantially all of our wells and related leases located in Reno and Stafford Counties, Kansas for $7.1 million, subject to customary closing and post-closing adjustments. No gain or loss was recognized as the sale of these assets did not result in a significant alteration of the full cost pool.
We also sold $5.0 million of other non-core oil and natural gas assets, net of related expenses, during the year ended December 31, 2021. No gain or loss was recognized as the sale of these assets did not result in a significant alteration of the full cost pool.

_______________________ 
1.Excludes ad valorem taxes and gross production taxes.
 Our Buffalo Wallow field in Hemphill County, Texas, contained 20% and 16% of our total proved reserves in 2021 and 2020, respectively, expressed on an oil-equivalent barrels basis. Our Mendota field, in the Granite Wash play in the Texas Panhandle, contained 15% and 16% of our total proved reserves for those same years also expressed on an oil-equivalent barrels basis. There are no other fields that accounted for over 15% of our proved reserves.
Oil, NGLs, and Natural Gas Reserves. The table below identifies our estimated proved developed and undeveloped oil, NGLs, and natural gas reserves: 

 | Year Ended December 31, 2021
 | Oil(MBbls) | NGLs(MBbls) | | Natural Gas(MMcf) | Total ProvedReserves(MBoe)

Total proved undeveloped | — | | — | | — | — 
Total proved | 9,019 | | 21,525 | | 220,640 | 67,317

Oil, NGLs, and natural gas reserves cannot be measured exactly. Estimates of those reserves require extensive judgments of reservoir engineering data and are generally less precise than other estimates made in financial disclosures. 
Company Reserve Estimation and Technical Qualifications
Our Reservoir Engineering department is responsible for reserve determination for the wells in which we have an interest. Their primary objective is to estimate the wells' future reserves and future net value to us. Data is incorporated from multiple sources including geological, production engineering, marketing, production, land, and accounting departments. The engineers review this information for accuracy as it is incorporated into the reservoir engineering database. Management reviews our internal controls to help provide assurance all the data has been provided. New well reserve estimates are provided to management and the respective operational divisions for additional scrutiny. Major reserve changes on existing wells are reviewed regularly with the operational divisions to confirm completeness and accuracy. As the external audit is being completed, the reservoir department reviews all properties for accuracy of forecasting.
Responsibility for overseeing the preparation of our reserve report is shared by our reservoir engineers Derek Smith and Troy Pickens.
Mr. Smith received a Bachelor of Science in Petroleum Engineering with a Minor in Business from the University of Tulsa in 2005. He then worked for Apache Corporation through 2008 and joined Unit in 2009 as a Corporate Reserves Engineer involved in reserve evaluation, acquisition appraisals, and prospect reviews with increasing levels of responsibility. In 2020, he was given the responsibility of managing the Corporate Reserves. He has been a member of SPE since 2000 and joined the SPEE in 2018.
Mr. Pickens earned a Bachelor of Science degree in Mechanical Engineering with Minors in Math and Entrepreneurship from Baylor University in 2014. He began employment with Unit as an Engineering Intern in the Summers of 2012 and 2013 and joined the company full time as a Production Engineer in 2014. He worked as a production engineer over various company assets with increasing levels of responsibility through 2019. In 2019 he transitioned into a Reservoir Engineering role, where he has been involved in reserve evaluation, project and asset development planning, and acquisition and divestiture assessment.
As part of their continuing education Mr. Smith and Mr. Pickens have attended various seminars and forums to enhance their understanding of current standards and issues for reserves presentation. These forums have included those sponsored by various professional societies and professional service firms including Ryder Scott.
Ryder Scott Audit and Technical Qualifications
We use Ryder Scott to audit the reserves prepared by our reservoir engineers. Ryder Scott has been providing petroleum consulting services internationally since 1937. Their summary report is attached as Exhibit 99.1 to this Form 10-K. The wells or locations for which reserve estimates were audited were taken from our reserve and income projections as of December 31, 2021, and comprised approximately 85% of the total proved developed future net income discounted at 10% (based on the SEC's unescalated pricing policy).
Mr. Robert J. Paradiso was the primary technical person responsible for overseeing the estimate of the reserves prepared by Ryder Scott.
Mr. Paradiso, an employee of Ryder Scott since 2008, is a Vice President and serves as Project Coordinator, responsible for coordinating and supervising staff and consulting engineers in ongoing reservoir evaluation studies worldwide. Before joining Ryder Scott, Mr. Paradiso served in several engineering positions with Getty Oil Company, Texaco, Union Texas Petroleum, Amax Oil and Gas, Inc., Norcen Explorer, Inc., Amerac Energy Corporation, Halliburton Energy Services, Santa Fe Snyder Corp., and Devon Energy Corporation. 
Mr. Paradiso earned a Bachelor of Science degree in Petroleum Engineering from Texas Tech University in 1979 and is a registered Professional Engineer in the State of Texas. He is also a member of the Society of Petroleum Engineers (SPE).
Besides gaining experience and competency through prior work experience, the Texas Board of Professional Engineers requires at least fifteen hours of continuing education annually, including at least one hour in professional ethics, which Mr. Paradiso fulfills. Based on his educational background, professional training and over 41 years of practical experience in the estimation and evaluation of petroleum reserves, Mr. Paradiso has attained the professional qualifications as a Reserves Estimator and Reserves Auditor in Article III of the “Standards Pertaining to the Estimating and Auditing of Oil and Gas Reserves Information” promulgated by the SPE as of June 2019. For more information regarding Mr. Paradiso’s geographic and job-specific experience, please refer to the Ryder Scott Company website at http://www.ryderscott.com/Company/Employees.
Definitions and Other Proved Reserve Information.
For proved reserves, the area of the reservoir considered as "proved" includes:
•The area identified by drilling and limited by any fluid contacts, and
•Adjacent undrilled portions of the reservoir that can, with reasonable certainty, be judged to be continuous with the reservoir and to contain economically producible oil or gas based on available geosciences and engineering data.
Absent data on fluid contacts, proved quantities in a reservoir are limited by the lowest known hydrocarbons as incurred in a well penetration unless geosciences, engineering, or performance data and reliable technology establish a lower contact with reasonable certainty.
Where direct observation from well penetrations has defined a highest known oil elevation and the potential exists for an associated gas cap, proved oil reserves may be assigned in the structurally higher portions of the reservoir only if geosciences, engineering, or performance data and reliable technology establish the higher contact with reasonable certainty.
Reserves which can be produced economically through application of improved recovery techniques (including, but not limited to, fluid injection) are included in the proved classification when:
•Successful testing by a pilot project in an area of the reservoir with properties no more favorable than the reservoir as a whole;
•The operation of an installed program in the reservoir or other evidence using reliable technology establishes reasonable certainty of the engineering analysis on which the project or program was based; and
•The project has been approved for development by all necessary parties and entities, including governmental entities.
Existing economic conditions include prices and costs at which economic producibility from a reservoir is to be determined. The price used is the average of the prices over the 12 months before the ending date of the period covered by the report and is an unweighted arithmetic average of the first day of the month price for each month within the period, unless prices are defined by contractual arrangements, excluding escalations based on future conditions.
Proved Undeveloped Reserves. As of December 31, 2021, we had no proved undeveloped reserves.
Our estimated proved reserves and the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows of the proved reserves at December 31, 2021 and 2020, the changes in quantities, and standardized measure of those reserves for the years then ended, are shown in the Supplemental Oil and Gas Disclosures in Item 8 of this report.
Contracts. Our oil production is sold at or near our wells under purchase contracts at prevailing prices under arrangements customary in the oil industry. Our natural gas production is sold to intrastate and interstate pipelines and independent marketing firms under contracts with terms generally ranging from one month to a year. Few of these contracts contain provisions for readjustment of price as most are market sensitive.
Customers. One customer accounted for 11% of our oil and natural gas revenues during the year ended December 31, 2021 and no other company accounted for over 10% of our oil and natural gas revenues besides our mid-stream segment. Our mid-stream segment purchased $48.0 million of our natural gas and NGLs production and provided gathering and transportation services of $3.3 million. Intercompany revenue from services and purchases of production between our mid-stream segment and our oil and natural gas segment has been eliminated in our consolidated financial statements. 
CONTRACT DRILLING
General. Our contract drilling business is conducted through Unit Drilling Company. Through this company we drill onshore oil and natural gas wells for ourselves and for others. Our drilling operations are mainly in Oklahoma, Texas, and New Mexico.
The following table identifies certain information about our contract drilling segment assets and activity: 

 | Successor | | | Predecessor

_________________________
1.Utilization rate is determined by dividing the average number of drilling rigs used by the average number of drilling rigs available for use during the year. See Drilling Rig Fleet below for discussion on the 2021 reduction in drilling rigs available for use.
2.Represents the total revenues from our contract drilling segment divided by the total days our drilling rigs were used during the year.
Description and Location of Our Drilling Rigs. An on-shore drilling rig is composed of major equipment components like engines, drawworks or hoists, derrick or mast, substructure, mud pumps, blowout preventers, top drives, and drill pipe. Because of the normal wear and tear from operating 24 hours a day, several of the major components, like engines, mud pumps, top drives, and drill pipe, must be replaced or overhauled periodically. Other major components, like the substructure, mast, and drawworks, can be used for extended periods with proper inspections and maintenance. We also own additional equipment used in operating our drilling rigs, including iron roughnecks, automated catwalks, skidding systems, large air compressors, trucks, and other support equipment. The maximum depth capacities of our various drilling rigs range from 9,500 to 40,000 feet allowing us to cover a wide range of our customers' drilling requirements. 
The following table shows certain information about our drilling rigs as of December 31, 2021:

 | Contracted Rigs | Non-Contracted Rigs | | Total Rigs | Average RatedDrilling Depth(ft)
Drilling Rigs | 16 | | 5 | | 21 | 20,238

Fluctuating commodity prices directly affect the number of drilling rigs we can put to work, both positively and negatively. Generally, sustained higher commodity prices lead to greater demand for drilling rigs, while demand and rates tends to fall as commodity prices decline for any extended period. Drilling rig utilization increased during 2021 as commodity prices increased. The number of drilling rigs we can work also depends on several conditions besides demand, including the availability of qualified labor as well as the availability of needed drilling supplies and equipment.
The following table shows the average number of our drilling rigs working by quarter for the years indicated: 

 | 2021 | 2020 | 
First quarter | 9.4 | | 18.7
Second quarter | 10.0 | | 9.1 
Third quarter | 11.0 | | 5.1 
Fourth quarter | 13.2 | | 7.6 

Drilling Rig Fleet. We reduced the number of drilling rigs available for use from 58 at December 31, 2020 to 21 during the second quarter of 2021 in order to focus on utilization of our BOSS drilling rigs and certain SCR rigs that are either currently under contract or candidates for future upgrades. 
Dispositions. We sold non-core contract drilling assets for proceeds of $12.7 million, net of related expenses, resulting in net gains of $10.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2021.
Drilling Contracts. Our third-party drilling contracts are generally obtained through competitive bidding on a well-by-well basis. Contract terms and payment rates vary depending on the type of contract used, the duration of the work, the equipment and services supplied, and other matters. We pay certain operating expenses, including the wages of our drilling rig personnel, maintenance expenses, and incidental drilling rig supplies and equipment. The contracts are usually subject to early termination by the customer subject to the payment of a fee. Our contracts also contain provisions regarding indemnification against certain types of claims involving injury to persons, property, and for acts of pollution. The specific terms of these indemnifications are negotiated on a contract-by-contract basis.
Most of our drilling contracts during 2021 and 2020 were daywork contracts. Under a daywork contract, we provide the drilling rig with the required personnel and the operator supervises the drilling of the well. Our daywork compensation is based on a negotiated rate to be paid for each day the drilling rig is used. 
Most of our contracts are term contracts, with the rest being well-to-well contracts. Term contracts can range from months to multiple years and the rates can either be fixed throughout the term or allow for periodic adjustments.
Customers. Five customers accounted for 79% of our contract drilling revenues during the year ended December 31, 2021. No other third-party customer accounted for 10% or more of our contract drilling revenues.
Our contract drilling segment may also provide drilling services for our oil and natural gas segment. The contract drilling segment did not drill any wells for our oil and natural gas segment in 2021. Depending on the timing of the drilling services performed on our properties, those services may be deemed, for financial reporting purposes, to be associated with acquiring an ownership interest in the property. Revenues and expenses for these services are eliminated in our statement of operations, with any profit recognized reducing our investment in our oil and natural gas properties. 
MID-STREAM
General. Our mid-stream operations are conducted through Superior Pipeline Company, L.L.C. and its subsidiaries, of which we presently own a 50% interest. Superior's operations consist of buying, selling, gathering, processing, and treating natural gas. It operates 3 natural gas treatment plants, 12 processing plants, 18 active gathering systems, and approximately 3,822 miles of pipeline. Superior and its subsidiaries operate in Oklahoma, Texas, Kansas, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia. 
Superior is governed and managed under the Amended and Restated Limited Liability Company Agreement (Agreement) and a Management Services Agreement (MSA). The MSA is between our wholly-owned subsidiary, SPC Midstream Operating, L.L.C. (the Operator) and Superior. As the Operator, we provide services, such as operations and maintenance support, accounting, legal, and human resources to Superior for a monthly service fee of $0.3 million.
The Agreement specifies how future distributions are to be allocated among the Members. Distributions from Available Cash (as defined in the Agreement) were generally split evenly between the Members prior to December 31, 2021, when the three-year period for Unit's commitment to spend $150.0 million (Drilling Commitment Amount) to drill wells in the Granite Wash/Buffalo Wallow area ended. The total amount spent by Unit towards the Drilling Commitment Amount was $24.6 million. Accordingly, SP Investor will receive 100% of Available Cash distributions related to periods subsequent to December 31, 2021 until the $72.7 million Drilling Commitment Adjustment Amount (as defined in the Agreement) is satisfied.
After April 1, 2023, either Member may initiate a sale process of Superior to a third-party or a liquidation of Superior's assets (Sale Event). In a Sale Event, the Agreement generally requires cumulative distributions to SP Investor in excess of its original $300.0 million investment sufficient to provide SP Investor a 7% internal rate of return on its capital contributions to Superior before any liquidation distribution is made to Unit. As of December 31, 2021, liquidation distributions paid first to SP Investor of $361.7 million would be required for SP Investor to reach its 7% Liquidation IRR Hurdle at which point Unit would then be entitled to receive up to $361.7 million of the remaining liquidation distributions to satisfy Unit's 7% Liquidation IRR Hurdle with any remaining liquidation distributions paid as outlined within the Agreement.
Effective March 1, 2022, the employees of the Operator were transferred to Superior and the MSA was amended and restated to remove the operating services the Operator was providing to Superior. There was no change to the monthly service fee for shared services. The power to direct the activities that most significantly affect Superior's operating performance is now shared by the equity holders (Unit Corporation and SP Investor) rather than held by the Operator. Superior no longer qualifies as a VIE subsequent to these amendments and we will no longer consolidate the financial position, operating results, and cash flows of Superior as of March 1, 2022. We will subsequently account for our investment in Superior as an equity method investment under the HLBV method.
The following table presents certain information regarding our mid-stream segment for the periods indicated: 

 | Successor | | Predecessor
 | Year EndedDecember 31, 2021 | Four Months EndedDecember 31, 2020 | | Eight Months EndedAugust 31, 2020
Gas gathered—Mcf/day | 319,394 | | 324,892 | | 388,506
Gas processed—Mcf/day | 130,000 | | 135,615 | | 158,031
NGLs sold—gallons/day | 442,796 | | 441,761 | | 612,301

Dispositions and Acquisitions. In November 2021, we closed on an acquisition for $13.0 million, subject to customary closing and post-closing adjustments, that included a cryogenic processing plant, approximately 1,620 miles of low-pressure gathering pipeline, and related compressor stations located in southern Kansas. 
Impairment. In December 2021, we determined that the carrying value of a gathering system in Pennsylvania was not recoverable and exceeded its estimated fair value due to unfavorable forecasted economics. We recorded non-cash impairment charges of $10.7 million based on the estimated fair value of the asset group. 
Contracts. Our mid-stream segment provides its customers with a full range of gathering, processing, and treating services. These services are usually provided to each customer under long-term contracts (more than one year), but we also have short-term contracts. Our customer agreements include these types of contracts: 
•Fee-Based Contracts. These contracts provide for a set fee for gathering, transporting, compressing, and treating services. Our mid-stream’s revenue is a function of the volume of natural gas and is not directly dependent on the value of natural gas. For the year ended December 31, 2021, 76% of our mid-stream segment’s total volumes and 73% of its operating margins (as defined below) were under fee-based contracts.
•Commodity-Based Contracts. These contracts consist of several contract structure types. Under these contract structures, our mid-stream segment purchases the raw well-head natural gas and settles with the producer at a stipulated price while retaining all sales proceeds from third parties or retains a negotiated percentage of the sales proceeds from the residue natural gas and NGLs it gathers and processes, with the remainder being paid to the producer. For the year ended December 31, 2021, 24% of our mid-stream segment’s total volumes and 27% of operating margins (as defined below) were under commodity-based contracts.
For each of the above contract types, operating margin is defined as total operating revenues less operating expenses and does not include depreciation, amortization, and impairment, general and administrative expenses, interest expense, or income taxes.
Customers. Three customers accounted for 58% of our mid-stream revenues. We believe that there are other customers available to purchase our natural gas and NGLs if we were to lose these customers. Superior purchased $48.0 million of our oil and natural gas segment's natural gas and NGLs production, and provided gathering and transportation services of $3.3 million. Intercompany revenue from services and purchases of production between Superior and our oil and natural gas segment has been eliminated in our consolidated financial statements.
COMPETITION
All our businesses are highly competitive and price sensitive. Competition in the contract drilling business traditionally involves factors such as demand, price, efficiency, the condition of equipment, availability of labor and equipment, reputation, and customer relations.
Our oil and natural gas operations likewise encounter strong competition from other oil and natural gas companies. Many competitors have greater financial, technical, and other resources than we do and have more experience than we do in the exploration for and production of oil and natural gas.
Our drilling success and the success of other activities integral to our operations will depend, in part, during times of increased competition on our ability to attract and retain experienced geologists, engineers, and other professionals. Competition for these professionals can be intense.
Our mid-stream segment competes with purchasers and gatherers of all types and sizes, including those affiliated with various producers, other major pipeline companies, and independent gatherers for the right to purchase natural gas and NGLs, build gathering and processing systems, and deliver the natural gas and NGLs once the gathering and processing systems are established. The principal elements of competition include the rates, terms, and availability of services, reputation, and the flexibility and reliability of service.
HUMAN CAPITAL 
We believe that our employees are critical to our future success, and seek to provide competitive compensation and benefits in order to attract and retain a skilled workforce. We care about the well-being and development of our employees, and aim to provide a culture of respect and collaboration by supporting employee training and development. We are also very focused on maintaining a culture of continuous improvement in safety and environmental practices - safety and environmental stewardship are at the forefront of everything that we do. 
As of March 3, 2022, we had 788 employees, none of whom are members of a union or labor organization. Our workforce includes 478 employees in our contract drilling segment, 136 employees in our oil and natural gas segment, 128 employees in our mid-stream segment, and 46 in our general corporate group. We also periodically utilize the services of independent contractors. We have not experienced any strikes or work-force stoppages.
GOVERNMENTAL REGULATIONS
General. Our business depends on the demand for services from the oil and natural gas exploration and development industry, and therefore our business can be affected by political developments and changes in laws and regulations that control or curtail drilling for oil and natural gas for economic, environmental, or other policy reasons.
Various state and federal regulations affect the production and sale of oil and natural gas. All states in which we conduct activities impose varying restrictions on the drilling, production, transportation, and sale of oil and natural gas. This discussion of certain laws and regulations affecting our operations should not be relied on as an exhaustive review of all regulatory considerations affecting us, due to the multitude of complex federal, state, and local regulations, and their susceptibility to change at any time by later agency actions and court rulings that may affect our operations.
Natural Gas Sales and Transportation. Under the Natural Gas Act of 1938, FERC regulates the interstate transportation and the sale in interstate commerce for resale of natural gas. FERC’s authority over interstate natural gas sales has been substantially modified by the Natural Gas Policy Act under which FERC continued to regulate the maximum selling prices of certain categories of gas sold in “first sales” in interstate and intrastate commerce. Effective January 1, 1993, however, the Natural Gas Wellhead Decontrol Act (the Decontrol Act) deregulated natural gas prices for all “first sales” of natural gas. Because “first sales” include typical wellhead sales by producers, all-natural gas produced from our natural gas properties is sold at market prices, subject to the terms of any private contracts which may be in effect. FERC’s authority over interstate natural gas transportation is not affected by the Decontrol Act.
Our sales of natural gas are affected by intrastate and interstate gas transportation regulation. Beginning in 1985, FERC adopted regulatory changes that have significantly altered the transportation and marketing of natural gas. These changes are intended by FERC to foster competition by, among other things, transforming the role of interstate pipeline companies from wholesale marketers of natural gas to the primary role of gas transporters. All-natural gas marketing by the pipelines must divest to a marketing affiliate, which operates separately from the transporter and in direct competition with all other merchants. Because of the various omnibus rulemaking proceedings in the late 1980s and the later individual pipeline restructuring proceedings of the early to mid-1990s, interstate pipelines must provide open and nondiscriminatory transportation and transportation-related services to all producers, natural gas marketing companies, local distribution companies, industrial end users, and other customers seeking service. Through similar orders affecting intrastate pipelines that provide similar interstate services, FERC expanded the impact of open access regulations to certain aspects of intrastate commerce.
FERC has pursued other policy initiatives that affected natural gas marketing. Most notable are (1) the large-scale divestiture of interstate pipeline-owned gas gathering facilities to affiliated or non-affiliated companies; (2) further development of rules governing the relationship of the pipelines with their marketing affiliates; (3) the publication of standards relating to using electronic bulletin boards and electronic data exchange by the pipelines to make available transportation information timely and to enable transactions to occur on a purely electronic basis; (4) further review of the role of the secondary market for released pipeline capacity and its relationship to open access service in the primary market; and (5) development of policy and promulgation of orders pertaining to its authorization of market-based rates (rather than traditional cost-of-service based rates) for transportation or transportation-related services on the pipeline’s demonstration of lack of market control in the relevant service market. 
Because of these changes, independent sellers and buyers of natural gas have gained direct access to the pipeline services they need and can better conduct business with a larger number of counter parties. These changes generally have improved the access to markets for natural gas while substantially increasing competition in the natural gas marketplace. However, we cannot predict what new or different regulations FERC and other regulatory agencies may adopt or what effect later regulations may have on production and marketing of natural gas from our properties.
Although in the past Congress has been very active in natural gas regulation as discussed above, the more recent trend has been for deregulation and the promotion of competition in the natural gas industry. In addition to “first sales” deregulation, Congress also repealed incremental pricing requirements and natural gas use restraints previously applicable. There continually are legislative proposals pending in the Federal and state legislatures which, if enacted, would significantly affect the petroleum industry. It is impossible to predict what proposals might be enacted by Congress or the various state legislatures and what effect these proposals might have on the production and marketing of natural gas by us. Similarly, and despite the trend toward federal deregulation of the natural gas industry, whether or to what extent that trend will continue or what the ultimate effect will be on the production and marketing of natural gas by us cannot be predicted.
Oil and Natural Gas Liquids Sales and Transportation. Our sales of oil and natural gas liquids currently are not regulated and are at market prices. The prices received from the sale of these products are affected by the cost of transporting these products to market. Much of that transportation is through interstate common carrier pipelines. Effective as of January 1, 1995, FERC implemented regulations generally grandfathering all previously approved interstate transportation rates and establishing an indexing system for those rates by which adjustments are made annually based on the rate of inflation, subject to certain conditions and limitations. These regulations may increase the cost of transporting oil and natural gas liquids by interstate pipeline, although the annual adjustments could cause decreased rates in a given year. These regulations have generally been approved on judicial review. Every five years, FERC examines the relationship between the annual change in the index and the actual cost changes experienced by the oil pipeline industry and makes any necessary adjustment in the index to be used during the ensuing five years. We cannot predict with certainty what effect the periodic review of the index by FERC will have on us.
Exploration and Production Activities. Federal, state, and local agencies also have promulgated extensive rules and regulations applicable to our oil and natural gas exploration, production, and related operations. The states we operate in require permits for drilling operations, drilling bonds, and filing reports about operations and impose other requirements relating to the exploration of oil and natural gas. Many states also have statutes or regulations addressing conservation matters including provisions for the unitization or pooling of oil and natural gas properties, the establishment of maximum rates of production from oil and natural gas wells, and regulating spacing, plugging and, abandonment of such wells. The statutes and regulations of some states limit the rate at which oil and natural gas is produced from our properties. The federal and state regulatory burden on the oil and natural gas industry increases our cost of doing business and affects our profitability. Because these rules and regulations are amended or reinterpreted frequently, we cannot predict the future cost or impact of complying with these laws.
Environmental.
General. Our operations are subject to federal, state, and local laws and regulations governing protection of the environment. These laws and regulations may require acquisition of permits before certain of our operations may be commenced and may restrict the types, quantities, and concentrations of various substances that can be released into the environment. Planning and implementation of protective measures must prevent accidental discharges. Spills of oil, natural gas liquids, drilling fluids, and other substances may subject us to penalties and cleanup requirements. Handling, storage, and disposal of both hazardous and non-hazardous wastes are subject to regulatory requirements.
The federal Clean Water Act, as amended by the Oil Pollution Act, the federal Clean Air Act, the federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), and their state counterparts, are the primary vehicles for imposition of such requirements and for civil, criminal, and administrative penalties and other sanctions for violation of their requirements. In addition, the federal Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA) and similar state statutes impose strict liability, without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct, on certain classes of persons considered responsible for the release of hazardous substances into the environment. Such liability, which may be imposed for the conduct of others and for conditions others have caused, includes the cost of remedial action and damages to natural resources. The Oil Pollution Act of 1990 amends the Clean Water Act and establishes strict liability for owners and operators of
facilities that cause a release of oil into waters of the United States. In addition, this law requires owners and operators of
facilities that store oil above specified threshold amounts to develop and implement spill prevention, control and
countermeasure plans.
Water Discharges. The Federal Water Pollution Control Act, or the Clean Water Act, and comparable state laws impose restrictions and strict controls regarding the discharge of pollutants, including produced waters and other oil and natural gaswastes, into federal and state waters. The discharge of pollutants into regulated waters is prohibited, except in accordance with the terms of a permit issued by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) or a state equivalent agency. The discharge of dredge and fill material in regulated waters, including wetlands, is also prohibited, unless authorized by a permit issued by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps). The scope of the Clean Water Act’s jurisdiction has been the subject of significant uncertainty and litigation in recent years. For example, under the Obama Administration, the EPA and the U.S. Army Corp of Engineers proposed a new expansive definition of the “waters of the United States,” known as the “Clean Water Rule.” However, during the Trump Administration, the EPA and the Corps replaced the Clean Water Rule with the Navigable Waters Protection Rule (NWPR), which narrows the definition of “waters of the United States” to four categories of jurisdictional waters and includes twelve categories of exclusions, including groundwater; however, these rulemakings are currently subject to litigation and it is possible that the Biden Administration could propose a broader definition for these regulated waters. Both the Clean Water Rule and the NWPR are subject to ongoing litigation, with the Clean Water Rule in effect in certain states and the NWPR in effect in others. In addition, in an April 2020 decision defining the scope of the Clean Water Act that was handed down just days after the NWPR was published, the U.S. Supreme Court held that, in certain cases, discharges from a point source to groundwater could fall within the scope of the Clean Water Act and require a permit. The Court rejected the EPA’s and Corps’ assertion that groundwater should be totally excluded from the Clean Water Act. The Court’s decision is expected to bolster challenges to the NWPR.” As a result of these developments, the scope of jurisdiction under the Clean Water Act is uncertain at this time. 
To the extent any rule expands the scope of the Clean Water Act’s jurisdiction in areas where we operate, we could face increased costs and delays with respect to obtaining permits for dredge and fill activities in wetland areas, which could delay the development of our natural gas and oil projects. Similarly, any increased costs or delays for such permits may impact the development of pipeline infrastructure, which may impact our ability to transport our products. Also, pursuant to these laws and regulations, we may be required to obtain and maintain approvals or permits for the discharge of wastewater or storm water and are required to develop and implement spill prevention, control and countermeasure plans, also referred to as “SPCC plans,” in connection with on-site storage of significant quantities of oil. These laws and any implementing regulations provide for administrative, civil and criminal penalties for any unauthorized discharges of oil and other substances in reportable quantities and may impose substantial potential liability for the costs of removal, remediation and damages. 
Hazardous Substances and Waste Management. RCRA and comparable state statutes regulate the generation, transportation, treatment, storage, disposal and cleanup of hazardous and non-hazardous wastes. Pursuant to rules issued by the EPA, individual state governments administer some or all of the provisions of RCRA, sometimes in conjunction with their own, more stringent requirements. Drilling fluids, produced waters and most of the other wastes associated with the exploration, development and production of oil or natural gas are currently regulated under RCRA’s non-hazardous waste provisions. However, it is possible that certain oil, natural gas, and drilling and production wastes now classified as non-hazardous could be classified as hazardous wastes in the future. 
CERCLA, also known as the Superfund law, imposes joint and several liability, without regard to fault or legality of conduct, on classes of persons who are considered to be responsible for the release of a hazardous substance into the environment. These persons include the current and former owners and operators of the site where the release occurred and anyone who disposed or arranged for the disposal of a hazardous substance released at the site. Under CERCLA, such persons may be subject to joint and several liability for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances that have been released into the environment, for damages to natural resources and for the costs of certain health studies. In addition, it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the hazardous substances released into the environment. We generate materials during our operations that may be regulated as hazardous substances. Despite the “petroleum exclusion” of CERCLA, which currently encompasses crude oil and natural gas, we may nonetheless generate or handle hazardous substances within the meaning of CERCLA, or similar state statutes, in the course of our ordinary operations and, as a result, may be jointly and severally liable under CERCLA for all or part of the costs required to clean up sites at which these hazardous substances have been released into the environment. In addition, we currently own, lease, or operate numerous properties that have been used for oil and natural gas exploration, production and processing for many years. Although we believe that we have utilized operating and waste disposal practices that were standard in the industry at the time, hazardous substances, wastes, or hydrocarbons may have been released on, under or from the properties owned or leased by us, or on, under or from other locations, including off-site locations, where such substances have been taken for disposal. Under such laws, we could be required to undertake investigatory, response, or corrective measures, which could include soil and groundwater sampling, the removal of previously disposed substances and wastes, the cleanup of contaminated property, or remedial plugging or pit closure operations to prevent future contamination, the costs of which could be substantial.
Endangered Species Act. The federal Endangered Species Act (ESA) and analogous state laws regulate many activities, including oil and gas development, which could have an adverse effect on species listed as threatened or endangered under the ESA or their habitats. Designating previously unidentified endangered or threatened species could cause oil and natural gas exploration and production operators and service companies to incur additional costs or become subject to operating delays, restrictions or bans in affected areas, which impacts could adversely reduce drilling activities in affected areas. All three of our business segments could be subject to the effect of one or more species being listed as threatened or endangered within the areas of our operations. Numerous species have been listed or are under consideration for protected status under the ESA in areas in which we provide or could undertake operations, such as the dunes sagebrush lizard, lesser prairie chicken, and greater sage grouse. In addition, the Supreme Court held in 2018 that only the actual habitat of an endangered species can be designated critical habitat, meaning that an uninhabited area that otherwise meets the definition of critical habitat should not be so designated. Following this decision, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) and the National Marine Fisheries Service NMFS) issued joint regulations in December 2020 defining critical habitat to mean an area that currently or periodically contains the resources and conditions necessary to support a species listed under the ESA. The Department of Interior (DOI) also finalized rules in January 2021 under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act, which imposes similar restrictions and penalties as those found under the ESA, that limit the imposition of criminal sanctions in instances where only an incidental take of protected birds occurs. The Biden Administration has stated that it plans to review the FWS, NMFS, and DOI regulations and has paused implementation of the DOI rules.The presence of protected species in areas where we provide contract drilling or mid-stream services or conduct exploration and production operations could impair our ability to timely complete or carry out those services and, consequently, hurt our results of operations and financial position.
Air Emissions. The federal Clean Air Act and comparable state laws restrict the emission of air pollutants from many sources, such as tank batteries and compressor stations, through air emissions standards, construction and operating permitting programs and the imposition of other compliance requirements. These laws and regulations may require us to obtain preapproval for the construction or modification of certain projects or facilities expected to produce or significantly increase air emissions, obtain and strictly comply with stringent air permit requirements or utilize specific equipment or technologies to control emissions of certain pollutants. The EPA has also adopted rules under the Clean Air Act that require the reduction of volatile organic compound emissions from certain fractured and refractured natural gas wells for which well completion operations are conducted and further require that most wells use reduced emission completions, also known as “green completions.” These regulations also establish specific new requirements regarding emissions from production-related wet seal and reciprocating compressors and from pneumatic controllers and storage vessels. The EPA expanded on its emission standards for volatile organic compounds in June 2016 with the issuance of first-time standards, known as Subpart OOOOa, to address emissions of methane from equipment and processes across oil and natural gas production, storage, processing and transmission sources, including hydraulically fractured oil natural gas and well completions. 
In September 2020, the Trump Administration finalized regulations that removed the transmission and storage segments from the oil and natural gas source category and rescinded the methane specific requirements of OOOOa across all sources. These changes are currently subject to litigation, and Congress is considering repealing the September 2020 revisions pursuant to the Congressional Review Act. In addition, in January 2021, President Biden signed an executive order calling for the suspension, revision, or rescission of the September 2020 rule and the reinstatement or issuance of methane emissions standards for new, modified, and existing oil and gas facilities. As a result, more stringent regulation of methane emissions from the oil and natural gas industry is expected.
Several states, including Colorado, Pennsylvania, New Mexico and Wyoming, have separately imposed their own regulations on methane emissions from the oil and natural gas sector. These regulations cover a variety of upstream and midstream sources and typically limit the venting and flaring of gas, require the installation of certain types of low-emitting equipment, and impose leak inspection and repair requirements. These and other air pollution control and permitting requirements have the potential to delay the development of oil and natural gas projects, increase our costs of development and operations, and increase costs for well decommissioning and abandonment. 
Climate Change. Climate change continues to attract considerable public and scientific attention. As a result, our operations as well as the operations of our operators are subject to a series of regulatory, political, litigation, and financial risks associated with the production and processing of fossil fuels and emission of greenhouse gases (GHGs). At the federal level, no comprehensive climate change law or regulation has been implemented to date. The EPA has, however, adopted regulations that, among other things, establish construction and operating permit reviews for GHG emissions from certain large stationary sources, and together with the U.S. Department of Transportation, implement GHG emissions limits on vehicles manufactured for operation in the United States. The federal regulation of methane emissions from oil and gas facilities has been subject to controversy in recent years. For more information, see our regulatory disclosure titled “Air Emissions.”
Governmental, scientific, and public concern over the threat of climate change arising from GHG emissions has resulted in increasing political risks in the United States, including climate change related pledges made by the recently elected administration. These have included promises to limit emissions and curtail the production of oil and gas on federal lands, such as through the cessation of leasing public land for hydrocarbon development. For example, in January 2021, President Biden issued an executive order that commits to substantial action on climate change, calling for, among other things, the increased use of zero-emissions vehicles by the federal government, the elimination of subsidies provided to the fossil fuel industry, and increased emphasis on climate-related risk across governmental agencies and economic sectors. Additionally, President Biden has signed executive orders recommitting the United States to the Paris Agreement, which requires member nations to submit non-binding, individually determined GHG emission reduction goals every five years after 2020. The impacts of these orders and the terms of any legislation or regulation to implement the United States’ commitment under the Paris Agreement remain unclear at this time. There are also increasing financial risks for fossil fuel producers as shareholders currently invested in fossil-fuel energy companies may elect in the future to shift some or all of their investments into non-energy related sectors. Institutional lenders who provide financing to fossil-fuel energy companies also have become more attentive to sustainable lending practices and some of them may elect not to provide funding for fossil fuel energy companies. There is also a risk that financial institutions will be required to adopt policies that have the effect of reducing the funding provided to the fossil fuel sector. Recently, the Federal Reserve announced that it has joined the Network for Greening the Financial System, a consortium of financial regulators focused on addressing climate-related risks in the financial sector. Limitation of investments in and financings for fossil fuel energy companies could result in the restriction, delay or cancellation of drilling programs or development or production activities.
The adoption and implementation of new or more stringent international, federal or state legislation, regulations or other regulatory initiatives that impose more stringent standards upon GHG emissions from the oil and natural gas sector could result in increased costs of compliance. Concerns related to the impacts of climate change could also result in reduced demand for oil and natural gas and adversely impact the value of reserves. In addition, increased financial scrutiny of climate risks could result in restrictions on our access to capital. Moreover, there are increasing risks to operations resulting from the potential physical impacts of climate change, such as drought, wildfires, damage to infrastructure and resources from flooding, storms, and other natural disasters and other physical disruptions. One or more of these developments could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operation. 
Hydraulic Fracturing. Our oil and natural gas segment routinely apply hydraulic fracturing techniques to many of our oil and natural gas properties, including our unconventional resource plays in the Granite Wash of Texas and Oklahoma, the Marmaton of Oklahoma, the Wilcox of Texas, and the Mississippian of Kansas. Hydraulic fracturing has been the subject of public scrutiny over the past several years. While states typically have primary authority with respect to regulating oil and natural gas production activities, including hydraulic fracturing, from time to time Congress has considered passing new laws to regulate this practice, and the U.S. Government has asserted regulatory authority over certain aspects of hydraulic fracturing. For example, the EPA finalized rules under the Clean Water Act in June 2016 that prohibit the discharge of wastewater from hydraulic fracturing operations to publicly owned wastewater treatment plants. Most recently, on March 23, 2021 the Fracturing Responsibility and Awareness of Chemicals Act was reintroduced in Congress, which includes resolutions that would authorize the EPA to regulate unconventional drilling activities, including requiring the disclosure of chemicals used, and end various exemptions for hydraulic fracturing in federal laws such as RCRA, the Safe Drinking Water Act, and the federal Clean Air Act. In addition, certain states in which we operate, including Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas, Colorado, and Wyoming have adopted, and other states and municipalities and other local governmental entities in some states, have and others are considering adopting regulations and ordinances that could impose more stringent permitting, require the public disclosure of chemicals in fracking fluids, flaring limitations, waste disposal, and well construction requirements on these operations, and even restrict or ban hydraulic fracturing in certain circumstances. 
In December 2016, the EPA released its final report on the potential impacts of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water resources. The final report concluded that certain activities associated with hydraulic fracturing may impact drinking water resources under certain limited circumstances. Both the EPA and the United States Geological Survey (USGS) have made statements indicating that the disposal of wastes associated with hydraulic fracturing via injection wells may result in induced seismic events. Several states, including Texas, Oklahoma, and Kansas, have adopted measures limiting disposal well operations in areas under certain circumstances.
At the state level, several states, including Texas, have adopted or are considering legal requirements that require oil and natural gas operators to disclose chemical ingredients and water volumes used to hydraulically fracture wells, in addition to more stringent well construction and monitoring requirements. Local governments may also adopt ordinances within their jurisdictions regulating the time, place and manner of drilling activities in general or hydraulic fracturing activities in particular.Any new laws, regulation, or permitting requirements regarding hydraulic fracturing could lead to operational delay, or increased operating costs or third party or governmental claims, and could result in additional burdens that could delay or limit the drilling services we provide to third parties whose drilling operations could be affected by these regulations or increase our costs of compliance and doing business and delay the development of unconventional gas resources from shale formations which are not commercial without using hydraulic fracturing. Restrictions on hydraulic fracturing could also reduce the oil and natural gas we can ultimately produce from our reserves.
Other; Compliance Costs. We cannot predict future legislation or regulations. It is possible that some future laws, regulations, and/or ordinances could increase our compliance costs and/or impose additional operating restrictions on us as well as those of our customers. Such future developments also might curtail the demand for fossil fuels which could hurt the demand for our services, which could hurt our future results of operations. Likewise, we cannot predict with any certainty whether any changes to temperature, storm intensity or precipitation patterns because of climate change (or otherwise) will have a material impact on our operations.
Compliance with applicable environmental requirements has not, to date, had a material effect on the cost of our operations, earnings, or competitive position. However, as noted above in our discussion of the regulation of GHG and hydraulic fracturing, compliance with amended, new, or more stringent requirements of existing environmental regulations or requirements may cause us to incur additional costs or subject us to liabilities that may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.
