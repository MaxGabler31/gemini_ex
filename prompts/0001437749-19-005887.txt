General 
 
Ottawa Bancorp, Inc. (the “Company”) is a Maryland corporation that was incorporated in May 2016 to be the successor to Ottawa Savings Bancorp, Inc. (“Ottawa Savings Bancorp”) upon completion of the second-step conversion of Ottawa Savings Bank (the “Bank”) from the two-tier mutual holding company structure to the stock holding company structure.  Ottawa Savings Bancorp MHC was the former mutual holding company for Ottawa Savings Bancorp prior to completion of the second-step conversion. In conjunction with the second-step conversion, Ottawa Savings Bancorp MHC merged into Ottawa Savings Bancorp (and ceased to exist), and Ottawa Savings Bancorp merged into the Company, with the Company as the surviving entity and unitary savings and loan holding company for Ottawa Savings Bank, a federally chartered savings bank. The second-step conversion was completed on October 11, 2016, at which time the Company sold, for gross proceeds of $23.8 million, a total of 2,383,950 shares of common stock at $10.00 per share, including 190,716 shares purchased by the Bank’s employee stock ownership plan. Capital increased an additional $126,000 due to cash contributed by Ottawa Savings Bancorp MHC upon merging into Ottawa Savings Bancorp, Inc.  Also as part of the second-step conversion, treasury shares held by Ottawa Savings Bancorp were retired and each of the existing outstanding shares of Ottawa Savings Bancorp common stock owned by persons other than Ottawa Savings Bancorp MHC was converted into 1.1921 of a share of Company common stock.  The Company is a publicly traded banking company with assets of $292.8 million at December 31, 2018 and is headquartered in Ottawa, Illinois.
 
Our business activities are primarily conducted through Ottawa Savings Bank, headquartered in Ottawa, Illinois, which is located in north-central Illinois approximately 80 miles southwest of Chicago. Ottawa Savings Bank conducts business from its main office in Ottawa and through its branch offices located in Marseilles and Morris, Illinois and loan production offices located in Shorewood, Sandwich and Peru, Illinois. Ottawa Savings Bank’s market area includes LaSalle County, Grundy County and parts of contiguous counties in Illinois. On December 31, 2014, Ottawa Savings Bancorp acquired Twin Oaks Savings Bank (“Twin Oaks”) and merged Twin Oaks with and into Ottawa Savings Bank, which facilitated Ottawa Savings Bank’s expansion into Grundy County.

Ottawa Savings Bank’s principal business consists of originating one-to-four family residential real estate mortgage loans and home equity lines of credit, and to a lesser extent, non-residential real estate, multi-family and construction loans. We also offer commercial and industrial loans and other consumer loans. We offer a variety of retail deposits to the general public in the areas surrounding our main office and our branch offices. We offer our customers a variety of deposit products with interest rates that are competitive with those of similar products offered by other financial institutions in our market area. We also utilize borrowings as a source of funds. Our revenues are derived primarily from interest on loans and, to a lesser extent, interest on investment securities and mortgage-backed securities. We also generate revenues from other income including realized gains on sales of loans associated with loan production, deposit fees and service charges, realized gains on sales of other real estate owned, realized gains on sales of securities and loan fees.

Market Area and Competition 
 
          The Company is headquartered in Ottawa, Illinois, which is located in north-central Illinois approximately 80 miles southwest of Chicago. Its market area, which benefits from its proximity to Chicago, includes LaSalle County, Grundy County and parts of contiguous counties.
 
The Bank faces significant competition for the attraction of deposits and origination of loans. Our most direct competition for deposits and loans has historically come from the several financial institutions operating in our market area, including a number of independent banks, and, to a lesser extent, from other financial service companies, such as brokerage firms, credit unions, mortgage companies and mortgage brokers. In addition, the Bank faces competition for investors’ funds from money market funds and other corporate and government securities. Competition for loans also comes from the increasing number of non-depository financial service companies entering the mortgage and consumer credit market, such as securities companies and specialty finance companies. The Bank believes that its long-standing presence in Ottawa, Illinois, its recent expansion into Grundy County as a result of the Twin Oaks acquisition, and its personal service philosophy enhance its ability to compete favorably in attracting and retaining individual and business customers. The Company actively solicits deposit-related customers and competes for deposits by offering customers personal attention, professional service and competitive interest rates.
 
Lending Activities 
 
          General. Our loan portfolio consists primarily of one-to-four family residential mortgage loans. To a lesser extent, our loan portfolio includes multi-family and non-residential real estate, commercial, construction and consumer loans. Excluding our purchased loan portfolio and except as noted below, the majority of our loans are made within our local market. However, on occasion we originate loans to borrowers outside our market area. At December 31, 2018, loans made to borrowers outside our market area totaled $63.5 million, or 26.9% of our total loan portfolio.

          Asset Quality. Within our investment portfolio we have no subprime or Alt-A backed instruments among our securities. Historically, our lending activity has promoted home ownership in the communities we serve. Our consumer and residential mortgage loans are originated consistent with the underwriting approach described herein. This includes an assessment of each borrower’s personal financial condition, including a review of credit reports and related FICO scores as well as verification of income and assets. The Company does not conduct lending programs that target the subprime market. During the ordinary course of business to achieve our goal of being a community bank, we originate and manage loans in our portfolio to some borrowers with a risk of default higher than customers considered prime. Thus, an extended economic downturn may affect us indirectly, albeit to a lesser extent than it would likely impact those banks and thrifts that produce and retain significant portfolios that target such loans and securities. While we believe that the nature of our one-to-four family lending niche and our underwriting standards would limit the impact of the downward turn in the credit cycle on the quality of our assets—particularly in comparison with those institutions that directly target subprime and Alt-A lending—another downturn in the credit cycle could result in our experiencing higher levels of charge-offs and/or provisions for loan losses, which might impact our results of operations.
          One- to-Four Family Residential Loans. Our primary lending activity is the origination of mortgage loans to enable borrowers to purchase or refinance existing homes or to construct new residential dwellings in our market area. We offer fixed-rate and adjustable-rate mortgage loans with terms up to 30 years. Borrower demand for adjustable-rate loans versus fixed-rate loans is a function of the level of interest rates, the expectations of changes in the level of interest rates, the difference between the interest rates and loan fees offered for fixed-rate mortgage loans and the initial period interest rates and loan fees for adjustable-rate loans. The relative amount of fixed-rate mortgage loans and adjustable-rate mortgage loans that can be originated or purchased at any time is largely determined by the demand for each in a competitive environment and the effect each has on our interest rate risk. The loan fees charged, interest rates, and other provisions of mortgage loans are determined by us on the basis of our own pricing criteria and competitive market conditions.
 
We offer fixed rate loans with terms of either 15, 20 or up to 30 years. We traditionally sell 30-year fixed rate loans into the secondary market, resulting in a fixed rate loan portfolio primarily composed of loans with less than 15 to 20 year terms, however, 30 year loans may be retained. Our adjustable-rate mortgage loans are based on either a 15, 20 or up to 30-year amortization schedule and interest rates and payments on our adjustable-rate mortgage loans adjust every one, three, five or seven years. Interest rates and payments on our adjustable-rate loans generally are adjusted to a rate that is based on the respective one, three, and five year monthly Constant Maturity Treasury indices. The maximum amount by which the interest rate may be increased or decreased is generally 1% to 2% per adjustment period, depending on the type of loan, and the lifetime interest rate ceiling is generally 5% over the initial interest rate of the loan. The initial and floor rates for owner occupied properties range from are 4.125% to 4.625% for the one, three, five and seven-year adjustable rate loans for non-owner occupied one-to-four family properties, respectively, at this time.
 
Due to historically low interest rate levels, borrowers generally have preferred fixed-rate loans in recent years. While we anticipate that our adjustable-rate loans will better offset the adverse effects on our net interest income of an increase in interest rates as compared to fixed-rate mortgages, the increased mortgage payments required of adjustable-rate loans in a rising interest rate environment could cause an increase in delinquencies and defaults. The marketability of the underlying property also may be adversely affected in a high interest rate environment. In addition, although adjustable-rate mortgage loans help make our asset base more responsive to changes in interest rates, the extent of this interest rate sensitivity is limited by the annual and lifetime interest rate adjustment limits.
 
While one-to-four family residential real estate loans are normally originated with up to 30-year terms, such loans typically remain outstanding for substantially shorter periods because borrowers often prepay their loans in full upon sale of the property pledged as security or upon refinancing the original loan. Therefore, average loan maturity is a function of, among other factors, the level of purchase and sale activity in the real estate market, prevailing interest rates and the interest rates payable on outstanding loans.
 
We also regularly make loans secured by non-owner occupied one-to-four family residential properties. Loans secured by non-owner occupied properties generally expose a lender to greater risk of non-payment and loss than loans secured by owner occupied properties because repayment of such loans depend primarily on the tenant’s continuing ability to pay rent to the property owner, who is our borrower, or, if the property owner is unable to find a tenant, the property owner’s ability to repay the loan without the benefit of a rental income stream. In addition, the physical condition of non-owner occupied properties is often below that of owner occupied properties due to lax property maintenance standards, which has a negative impact on the value of the collateral properties. In reaching a decision on whether to originate a non-owner occupied one-to-four family residential real estate loan, we consider the net operating income of the property, the borrower’s credit history and profitability, and the value of the underlying property. At December 31, 2018, loans secured by non-owner occupied one-to-four family properties totaled $29.7 million, or 20.9% of our total one-to-four family residential loan portfolio.
 
          We generally do not make conventional loans with loan-to-value ratios exceeding 80%. Loans with loan-to-value ratios in excess of 80% generally require private mortgage insurance, government guarantee or additional collateral. We require all properties securing mortgage loans to be appraised by an independent appraiser approved by our Board of Directors and licensed by the State of Illinois. We require title insurance on all first mortgage loans. Borrowers must obtain hazard insurance, or flood insurance for loans on property located in a flood zone, before closing the loan.

Our largest one-to-four family residential loan at December 31, 2018 was a loan for $3.5 million that is secured by multiple one-to-four family and condominium units, of which $3.4 million is outstanding. This loan is performing in accordance with its terms.
 
We participate with the USDA Rural Development Company to offer loans to qualifying customers. Loans are granted up to 100% of appraised value and the USDA guarantees up to 90% of the loan. These loans require no down payment but are subject to maximum income limitations.
 
Residential and Commercial Construction Loans.  On occasion we originate (i) residential construction loans to individuals and purchase loans that finance the construction of residential dwellings for personal use, which we classify within our one-to-four family loan portfolio, and (ii) commercial construction loans for the development of projects including condominiums, apartment buildings, single-family subdivisions, single-family investor loans, as well as owner-occupied properties used for business, which we classify within our loan portfolio based on the type of property under construction.
 
Our residential construction loans generally provide for the payment of interest only during the construction phase, which is usually twelve months. At the end of the construction phase, substantially all of our loans automatically convert to permanent mortgage loans. Construction loans generally can be made with a maximum loan to value ratio of 80% or up to 95% with private mortgage insurance of the appraised value with maximum terms of 30 years. We also require periodic inspections of the property during the term of the construction. At December 31, 2018, our largest outstanding residential construction loan was for $1.5 million, of which $1.0 million was disbursed.
 
Our commercial construction loans provide for payment of interest only during the construction phase and may, in the case of an apartment or commercial building, convert to a permanent mortgage loan upon the completion of construction. In the case of a single-family subdivision or construction or builder loan, as individual lots are sold, the principal balance is reduced by a minimum of 80% of the net lot sales price. In the case of a commercial construction loan, the construction period may be from nine months to two years. Loans are generally made to a maximum of 70% of the appraised value as determined by an appraisal of the property made by an independent licensed appraiser. We also require periodic inspections of the property during the term of the construction loan. At December 31, 2018, our largest outstanding commercial construction loan was for $1.1 million, of which $0.6 million was disbursed.
 
Lines of Credit. We offer lines of credit, principally home equity lines of credit, which have adjustable rates of interest that are indexed to the prime rate as published in The Wall Street Journal for terms of up to 20 years. These loans are originated with maximum loan-to-value ratios of 80% of the appraised value of the property, and we require that we have a second lien position on the property. We also offer secured and unsecured lines of credit for well-qualified individuals and small businesses. Management includes these loans based on the collateral supporting the line of credit in either the non-residential, multi-family, commercial or one-to-four family categories for the purposes of monitoring and evaluating the portfolio.
 
Multi-Family and Non-Residential Real Estate Loans. We offer fixed rate and adjustable-rate mortgage loans secured by multi-family, non-residential real estate and agricultural real estate loans. Our loans in the category are generally secured by condominiums, apartment buildings, single-family subdivisions, owner-occupied properties used for businesses and agricultural land used for production.
 
We originate and purchase multi-family, non-residential real estate and agricultural loans with terms generally up to 30 years. Interest rates and payments on adjustable-rate loans adjust every one, three and five years. Interest rates and payments on our adjustable rate loans generally are adjusted to a rate typically equal to the interest rate used for one- to- four family loan products, plus 50 basis points to 100 basis points based on credit-worthiness and risk. Loan amounts generally do not exceed 80% of the appraised value for well-qualified borrowers.
 
We originate and purchase land loans to individuals on approved residential building lots for personal use for terms of up to 15 years and to a maximum loan to value ratio of 80% of the appraised value. Our land loans are adjustable loans with adjustments occurring every one, three and five years, based on the original contract. Interest rate adjustments are based on the CMT plus a spread. For adjustable loans in this class, the loans generally have an interest rate floor.
 
Our largest non-residential real estate loan at December 31, 2018 was for $2.2 million, all of which is outstanding. This loan is performing in accordance with its terms. For adjustable loans in this category, there generally is an interest rate floor ranging from 3.75% to 6.00%.

Loans secured by multi-family and non-residential real estate generally have larger balances and involve a greater degree of risk than one-to-four family residential mortgage loans. Of primary concern in multi-family and non-residential real estate lending is the borrower’s credit-worthiness and the feasibility and cash flow potential of the project. Payments on loans secured by income producing properties often depend on successful operation and management of the properties. As a result, repayment of such loans may be subject, to a greater extent than residential real estate loans, to adverse conditions in the real estate market or the economy. In reaching a decision on whether to make a multi-family or non-residential real estate loan, we consider the net operating income of the property, the borrower’s expertise, credit history and profitability, and the value of the underlying property.
 
Commercial Business Loans. These loans consist of operating lines of credit secured by general business assets, equipment, inventory and crops.  We loan primarily to businesses with less than $5,000,000 in annual revenues.  The operating lines of credit are generally short term in nature with interest rates tied to short term rates and adjustments occurring daily, monthly, or quarterly based on the original contract.  For adjustable loans, there is also an interest rate floor.  The equipment loans are typically made with maturities of less than five years and are priced with a fixed interest rate. The Bank has originated commercial loans from Bankers Healthcare Group in prior years. Bankers Healthcare Group specializes in loans to healthcare professionals of all specialties throughout the United States. These loans are primarily comprised of working capital and equipment loans. We underwrite these loans based on our criteria and service the loans in-house.  
Consumer Loans. We offer a variety of consumer loans, which include auto, share loans and personal unsecured loans to our customer base. Unsecured loans generally have a maximum borrowing limit of $25,000 and a maximum term of four years.
 
The procedures for underwriting consumer loans include an assessment of the applicant’s payment history on other debts and ability to meet existing obligations and payments on the proposed loans. Although the applicant’s credit-worthiness is a primary consideration, the underwriting process also includes a comparison of the value of the collateral, if any, to the proposed loan amount.
 
Consumer loans may entail greater risk than do residential mortgage loans, particularly in the case of consumer loans that are unsecured or secured by assets that depreciate rapidly. In such cases, repossessed collateral for a defaulted consumer loan may not provide an adequate source of repayment for the outstanding loan and the remaining deficiency often does not warrant further substantial collection efforts against the borrower. In addition, consumer loan collections depend on the borrower’s continuing financial stability, and therefore are more likely to be adversely affected by job loss, divorce, illness, or personal bankruptcy. Furthermore, the application of various federal and state laws, including federal and state bankruptcy and insolvency laws may limit the amount which can be recovered on such loans.
 
Purchased Auto Loans. We purchase auto loans from regulated financial institutions. At December 31, 2018 and 2017, we had $22.1 million and $20.6 million of purchased auto loans outstanding, respectively. These types of loans are primarily low balance individual auto loans. We have the opportunity to review the loans at least three days prior to our purchase and we have a right to refuse any specific loan within thirty days of the purchase of any given loan pool. For the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, we purchased $10.0 and $14.1 million of auto loans, respectively.
Loan Origination, Purchases and Sales. Loan originations come from a number of sources. The primary source of loan originations are our in-house loan originators, and to a lesser extent, advertising and referrals from customers. We occasionally purchase loans or participation interests in loans. As of December 31, 2018, we had an aggregate of $30.2 million in purchased loan participations outstanding, including the auto loan purchases discussed in the previous paragraph. The largest outstanding loan participation as of December 31, 2018 was a commercial loan for $3.3 million. This loan is performing in accordance with its terms.
 
We sell some of the longer-term fixed-rate one-to-four family mortgage loans that we originate in the secondary market based on prevailing market interest rate conditions, an analysis of the composition and risk of the loan portfolio, liquidity needs and interest rate risk management goals. Generally, loans are sold without recourse and with servicing retained. We sold $19.8 million and $21.8 million of loans in the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. We occasionally sell participation interests in loans and may sell loan participations in the future.

Loan Approval Procedures and Authority. Our lending activities follow written, non-discriminatory underwriting standards and loan origination procedures established by our Board of Directors and management.
 
           For one-to-four family loans and owner occupied residential loans, our President may approve loans up to $500,000. Residential loans and all commercial loans above $500,000 up to $2 million in the aggregate to any borrower(s) must be approved by a majority of our level one loan committee. This committee consists of our President, Executive Vice-President and our Chief Lending Officer and Commercial Loan Officers. For loans to any borrower(s) in the aggregate of more than $2 million up to $4 million, approval is required by a majority of our level two loan committee, which consists of specific members of the level one committee, one designated outside director and our Chairman of the Board. For loan requests above $4 million in the aggregate to any borrower(s), approval is required by a majority of the Board of Directors, as a whole.
 
          Loans to One Borrower. The maximum amount that we may lend to one borrower and the borrower’s related entities is limited by regulation to generally 15% of our stated capital and reserves. At December 31, 2018, our regulatory maximum was $6.9 million. 

          Loan Commitments. We issue commitments for fixed-rate and adjustable-rate mortgage loans conditioned upon the occurrence of certain events. Commitments to originate mortgage loans are legally binding agreements to lend to our customers and generally expire in 45 days.
 
          Delinquencies. When a borrower fails to make a required loan payment, we take a number of steps to have the borrower cure the delinquency and restore the loan to current status. We make initial contact with the borrower when the loan becomes 10 days past due. If payment is not then received by the 30th day of delinquency, additional letters are sent and phone calls are made to the customer. When the loan becomes 120 days past due, we generally commence foreclosure proceedings against any real property that secures the loan or attempt to repossess any personal property that secures a consumer loan. If a foreclosure action is instituted and the loan is not brought current, paid in full, or refinanced before the foreclosure sale, the real property securing the loan generally is sold at foreclosure. We may consider loan workout arrangements with certain borrowers under certain circumstances.
 
Management informs the Board of Directors on a monthly basis of the amount of loans delinquent more than 60 days, all loans in foreclosure and all foreclosed and repossessed property that we own.

Classified Assets. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation regulations and our Asset Classification Policy provide that loans and other assets considered to be of lesser quality be classified as “substandard,” “doubtful” or “loss” assets. An asset is considered “substandard” if it is inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged, if any. “Substandard” assets include those characterized by the “distinct possibility” that the institution will sustain “some loss” if the deficiencies are not corrected. Assets classified as “doubtful” have all of the weaknesses inherent in those classified as “substandard,” with the added characteristic that the weaknesses present make “collection or liquidation in full,” on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions and values, “highly questionable and improbable.” Assets classified as “loss” are those considered “uncollectible” and of such little value that their continuance as assets without the establishment of a specific loss reserve is not warranted. We classify an asset as “special mention” if the asset has a potential weakness that warrants management’s escalated level of attention. While such assets are not impaired, management has concluded that if the potential weakness in the asset is not addressed, the value of the asset may deteriorate, adversely affecting the repayment of the asset. Loans classified as impaired for financial reporting purposes are generally those loans classified as substandard or doubtful for regulatory reporting purposes.
 
          An insured institution is required to establish allowances for loan losses in an amount deemed prudent by management for loans classified as substandard or doubtful, as well as for other problem loans. General allowances represent loss allowances which have been established to recognize the inherent losses associated with lending activities, but which, unlike specific allowances, have not been allocated to particular problem assets. When an insured institution classifies problem assets as “loss,” it is required to charge off such amounts. An institution’s determination as to the classification of its assets and the amount of its valuation allowances is subject to review by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (“OCC”). 
 
On the basis of management’s review of our assets, at December 31, 2018 and 2017, we classified $0.3 million and $0.8 million, respectively, of our assets as special mention and $1.5 million and $1.5 million, respectively, of our assets as substandard. We classified none of our assets as doubtful and there were no assets classified as loss for the years ended December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017. The loan portfolio is reviewed on a regular basis to determine whether any loans require classification in accordance with applicable regulations. Not all classified assets constitute non-performing assets.
 
The economy continued to stabilize in our market during 2018 which meant foreclosures and liquidations as a manner of reducing non-performing assets continued but at a much slower pace. This is not our primary means to resolve credit issues, however, there are certain circumstances when foreclosure and liquidations are the remedy pursued. From time to time, the Company as part of our loss mitigation strategy may renegotiate the loan terms (i.e. interest rate, structure, repayment term, A/B note format, etc.) based on the economic or legal reasons related to the borrower’s financial difficulties. There were no new troubled debt restructurings (“TDRs”) during 2018 and 2017. TDRs are considered to be non-performing, except for those that have established a sufficient performance history (generally a minimum of six consecutive months of performance) under the terms of the restructured loan.
 
At December 31, 2018, one loan (with aggregate balances of $0.1 million) of our 22 substandard loans (with aggregate balances of $1.5 million) was considered a TDR and was included in non-performing assets. At December 31, 2017, four loans (with aggregate balances of $0.5 million) of our 19 substandard loans (with aggregate balances of $1.5 million) were considered TDRs and were included in non-performing assets. The decrease in TDR balances included in impaired loans was primarily a result of upgrading three TDRs totaling $0.4 million due to improved performance.

The total amount of non-accrual loans decreased to $1.5 million as of December 31, 2018, from $1.6 million at December 31, 2017. Total non-performing loans consist of 22 loans to 15 borrowers for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to 19 loans to 21 borrowers for the year ended December 31, 2017. For the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, gross interest income of $108,000 and $123,000, respectively, would have been recorded had the non-accrual loans at the end of the period been on accrual status throughout the period. We recognized $0 and $10,000 in cash basis interest income on impaired loans for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
 
Allowance for Loan Losses
 
Our allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level necessary to absorb loan losses which are both probable and reasonably estimable. Management, in determining the allowance for loan losses, considers the losses inherent in its loan portfolio and changes in the nature and volume of loan activities, along with the general economic and real estate market conditions. We utilize a two-tier approach: (1) identification of impaired loans and establishment of specific loss allowances on such loans; and (2) establishment of general valuation allowances on the remainder of our loan portfolio. We maintain a loan review system, which allows for a periodic review of our loan portfolio and the early identification of potential impaired loans. Such system takes into consideration, among other things, delinquency status, size of loans, type and market value of collateral and financial condition of the borrowers. Specific loan loss allowances are established for identified losses based on a review of such information. A loan evaluated for impairment is considered to be impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. All loans identified as impaired are evaluated independently. We do not aggregate such loans for evaluation purposes. Loan impairment is measured based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan’s effective interest rate or, as a practical expedient, at the loan’s observable market price or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent. The interest on these loans is accounted for on the cash-basis or cost-recovery method, until qualifying for return to accrual status. Should full collection of principal be expected, cash collected on nonaccrual loans can be recognized as interest income.

          The general component consists of quantitative and qualitative factors and covers non-impaired loans. The quantitative factors are based on historical loss experience adjusted for qualitative factors. The historical loss experience is determined by portfolio segment and is based on the actual loss history experienced by the Company using the most recent twelve quarters with heavier weighting given to the most recent quarters.
 
          Actual loss experience is supplemented with other qualitative factors based on the risks present for each portfolio segment. These qualitative factors include consideration of the following:
 

● | Levels of and trends in delinquencies and impaired loans
--+---------------------------------------------------------


● | Levels of and trends in charge-offs and recoveries
--+---------------------------------------------------


● | Trends in volume and terms of loans
--+------------------------------------


● | Effects of any changes in risk selection and underwriting standards
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Other changes in lending policies, procedures and practices
--+------------------------------------------------------------


● | Experience, ability and depth of lending management and other relevant staff
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | National and local economic trends and conditions
--+--------------------------------------------------


● | Industry conditions
--+--------------------


● | Effects of changes in credit concentrations
--+--------------------------------------------

 
The allowance is increased through provisions charged against current earnings and offset by recoveries of previously charged-off loans. Loans which are determined to be uncollectible are charged against the allowance. Management uses available information to recognize probable and reasonably estimable loan losses, but future loss provisions may be necessary based on changing economic conditions. The allowance for loan losses as of December 31, 2018 is maintained at a level that represents management’s best estimate of losses inherent in the loan portfolio, and such losses were both probable and reasonably estimable. In addition, the OCC, as an integral part of its examination process, periodically reviews our allowance for loan losses.

Each quarter, management evaluates the total balance of the allowance for loan losses based on several factors that are not loan specific, but are reflective of the inherent losses in the loan portfolio. This process includes, but is not limited to, a periodic review of loan collectability in light of historical experience, the nature and volume of loan activity, conditions that may affect the ability of the borrower to repay, underlying value of collateral, if applicable, and economic conditions in our market areas. First, we group loans by delinquency status. All loans 90 days or more delinquent and all loans classified as substandard or doubtful are evaluated individually, based primarily on the value of the collateral securing the loan. Specific loss allowances are established as required by this analysis. All loans for which a specific loss allowance has not been assigned are segregated by type and delinquency status and a loss allowance is established by using loss experience data and management’s judgment concerning other matters it considers significant. The allowance is allocated to each category of loan based on the results of the above analysis.
 
Total allowance for loan losses increased to $2.6 million at December 31, 2018 as compared to $2.5 million at December 31, 2017. The increase reflected an increase of $0.3 million in the general portion of the reserve while specific reserves on impaired loans were consistent between the years.  Impaired loans were $1.5 million with a valuation allowance of $217,000 at December 31, 2018, as compared to $1.5 million with a valuation allowance of $230,000 at December 31, 2017. Of the $1.5 million of impaired loans at December 31, 2018, $0.1 million were acquired in the merger with Twin Oaks and valued per FASB ASC 310-30 (see Note 4 to the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements). The increase in the general portion of the reserve was due primarily to balance increases in all categories of the loan portfolio.  These increases to the allowance were partially off-set by improvements in historical loss levels resulting from stabilization in nonperforming asset levels and charge-off levels, off-set slightly by changes in the qualitative factors applied to reflect changes in risk.
 
This analysis process is inherently subjective, as it requires us to make estimates that are susceptible to revisions as more information becomes available. Although we believe that we have established the allowance at a level to absorb probable and estimable losses, additions may be necessary if economic or other conditions in the future differ from the current environment.

Investment Activities
 
          We have legal authority to invest in various types of liquid assets, including U.S. Treasury obligations, securities of various federal agencies and of state and municipal governments, mortgage-backed securities and certificates of deposit of federally insured institutions.
 
At December 31, 2018, our investment portfolio consisted primarily of municipal securities with maturities of five to more than ten years and residential mortgage-backed securities issued by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and Ginnie Mae with stated final maturities of 30 years or less.
 
Our investment objectives are to provide and maintain liquidity, to maintain a balance of high quality, diversified investments to minimize risk, to provide collateral for pledging requirements, to establish an acceptable level of interest rate risk, to provide an alternate source of low-risk investments when demand for loans is weak and to generate a favorable return. Our Board of Directors has the overall responsibility for our investment portfolio, including approval of our investment policy and appointment of our Investment Committee. The Investment Committee is responsible for approval of investment strategies and monitoring of investment performance. Our Executive Vice-President and CFO are the designated investment officers and they are responsible for the daily investment activities and are authorized to make investment decisions consistent with our investment policy. The Investment Committee, consisting of seven external Board of Director members, meets regularly with the Executive Vice-President and CFO to review and determine investment strategies and transactions.
 
 The following table sets forth the carrying value of our investment portfolio at the dates indicated.

Deposit Activities and Other Sources of Funds 
 
General. Deposits and loan repayments are the major sources of our funds for lending and other investment purposes. Loan repayments are a relatively stable source of funds, while deposit inflows and outflows and loan prepayments are significantly influenced by general interest rates and market conditions.
Deposit Accounts. The vast majority of our depositors are residents of LaSalle County, with some deposit relationships in Grundy County. Deposits are raised primarily from within our primary market area through the offering of a broad selection of deposit instruments, including checking accounts, money market accounts, regular savings accounts, club savings accounts, certificate accounts and various retirement accounts. The Bank also is a member of the Certificate of Deposit Registry Service (CDARS), which allows the Bank to retain high deposit relationships with its depository customer base, while still allowing the customer to enjoy FDIC deposit insurance on amounts in excess of the current limit of $250,000. During 2017, the Bank became a member of the QuickRate CD listing service, which allows the Bank to obtain institutional deposits when needed to help meet loan funding needs.  During 2018, the Bank also began a relationship with Financial Northeastern Companies, a CD broker, to obtain institutional deposits when needed to help meet loan funding needs.  Deposit account terms vary according to the minimum balance required, the time periods the funds must remain on deposit, and the interest rate among other factors. In determining the terms of our deposit accounts, we consider the rates offered by our competition, profitability to us, matching deposit and loan products and customer preferences and concerns. We generally review our deposit mix and pricing weekly. Our current strategy is to offer competitive rates, but not be the market leader in every type and maturity.
 
The following table sets forth the dollar amount of deposits by type as of the dates indicated.

Borrowings. If necessary, we borrow from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Chicago to supplement our supply of lendable funds and to meet deposit withdrawal requirements. The Federal Home Loan Bank functions as a central reserve bank providing credit for member financial institutions. As a member, we are required to own capital stock in the Federal Home Loan Bank of Chicago and are authorized to apply for advances on the security of such stock and certain of our mortgage loans and other assets (principally securities that are obligations of, or guaranteed by, the United States), provided certain standards related to credit-worthiness have been met. Advances are made under several different programs, each having its own interest rate and range of maturities. Depending on the program, limitations on the amount of advances are based either on a fixed percentage of an institution’s net worth or on the Federal Home Loan Bank’s assessment of the institution’s credit-worthiness. Under its current credit policies, the Federal Home Loan Bank generally limits advances to 35% of a member’s assets, and short-term borrowings of less than one year may not exceed 10% of the institution’s assets. The Federal Home Loan Bank determines specific lines of credit for each member institution. There were $12.1 million of Federal Home Loan Bank advances outstanding at December 31, 2018. At December 31, 2018, we had the ability to borrow an additional $74.6 million from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Chicago. In addition, as of December 31, 2018, the Bank had $7.9 million of available credit from Bankers Bank of Wisconsin to purchase federal funds and $5.0 million of available credit from Midwest Independent Bank to purchase federal funds.
Personnel

At December 31, 2018, we had 50 full-time employees and 8 part-time employees, none of whom is represented by a collective bargaining unit. We believe our relationship with our employees is good.

REGULATION AND SUPERVISION
 
General 
 
Ottawa Savings Bank as a federal savings bank is currently subject to extensive regulation, examination and supervision by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), as its primary federal regulator, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, as the insurer of its deposits. Ottawa Savings Bank is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank System and its deposit accounts are insured up to applicable limits by the Deposit Insurance Fund (“DIF”) managed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”). Ottawa Savings Bank must file reports with the OCC and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation concerning its activities and financial condition in addition to obtaining regulatory approvals prior to entering into certain transactions such as mergers with, or acquisitions of, other financial institutions. There are periodic examinations by the OCC and, under certain circumstances, the FDIC to evaluate Ottawa Savings Bank’s safety and soundness and compliance with various regulatory requirements. This regulatory structure is intended primarily for the protection of the insurance fund and depositors. The regulatory structure also gives the regulatory authorities extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities and examination policies, including policies with respect to the classification of assets and the establishment of adequate allowance for loan losses for regulatory purposes. Any change in such policies, whether by the OCC, the FDIC or Congress, could have a material adverse impact on Ottawa Bancorp, Inc., and Ottawa Savings Bank and their operations.
 
The Dodd-Frank Act made extensive changes to the regulation of Ottawa Savings Bank. Under the Dodd-Frank Act, the Office of Thrift Supervision was eliminated and responsibility for the supervision and regulation of federal savings associations such as Ottawa Savings Bank was transferred to the OCC on July 21, 2011. The OCC is the agency that is primarily responsible for the regulation and supervision of national banks. Additionally, the Dodd-Frank Act created a new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau as an independent bureau of the Federal Reserve Board. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau assumed responsibility for the implementation of the federal financial consumer protection and fair lending laws and regulations and has authority to impose new requirements. However, institutions of less than $10 billion in assets, such as Ottawa Savings Bank, will continue to be examined for compliance with consumer protection and fair lending laws and regulations by, and be subject to the enforcement authority of, their prudential regulators.
 
Certain of the regulatory requirements that are applicable to Ottawa Savings Bank and Ottawa Bancorp, Inc. are described below. This description of statutes and regulations is not intended to be a complete explanation of such statutes and regulations and their effects on Ottawa Savings Bank and Ottawa Bancorp, Inc.
 
Federal Banking Regulation 
 
Business Activities. The activities of federal savings banks, such as Ottawa Savings Bank, are governed by federal laws and regulations. Those laws and regulations delineate the nature and extent of the business activities in which federal savings banks may engage. In particular, certain lending authority for federal savings banks, e.g., commercial, non-residential real property loans and consumer loans, is limited to a specified percentage of the institution’s capital or assets.
Capital Requirements. In July 2013, the OCC and the Federal Reserve Board approved a new rule that will substantially amend the regulatory risk-based capital rules applicable to Ottawa Savings Bank. The final rule implements the “Basel III” regulatory capital reforms and changes required by the Dodd-Frank Act. The final rule includes new minimum risk-based capital and leverage ratios, which became effective for Ottawa Savings Bank on January 1, 2015, and refines the definition of what constitutes “capital” for purposes of calculating these ratios. The new minimum capital requirements are: (i) a new common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 4.5%; (ii) a Tier 1 to risk-based assets capital ratio of 6% (increased from 4%); (iii) a total capital ratio of 8% (unchanged); and (iv) a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 4%. The final rule also establishes a “capital conservation” buffer of 2.5%, and will result in the following minimum ratios: (i) a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 7%; (ii) a Tier 1 to risk-based assets capital ratio of 8.5%; and (iii) a total capital ratio of 10.5%. The new capital conservation buffer requirement was phased in beginning in January 2016 at 0.625% of risk-weighted assets and increased each year until fully implemented in January 2019. An institution will be subject to limitations on paying dividends, engaging in share repurchases, and paying discretionary bonuses if its capital level falls below the buffer amount. These limitations will establish a maximum percentage of eligible retained income that can be utilized for such actions.

Prompt Corrective Regulatory Action. Prompt corrective action regulations provide five classifications: well capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized, although these terms are not used to represent overall financial condition. If adequately capitalized, regulatory approval is required to accept broker deposits. The OCC is required to take certain supervisory actions against undercapitalized institutions, the severity of which depends upon the institution’s degree of undercapitalization. In addition, numerous mandatory supervisory actions become immediately applicable to an undercapitalized institution, including, but not limited to, increased monitoring by regulators and restrictions on growth, capital distributions and expansion. The OCC could also take any one of a number of discretionary supervisory actions, including the issuance of a capital directive and the replacement of senior executive officers and directors. Significantly and critically undercapitalized institutions are subject to additional mandatory and discretionary measures.
Insurance of Deposit Accounts. The Bank’s deposits are insured up to applicable limits, which are $250,000 per depositor by the Deposit Insurance Fund (“DIF”) of the FDIC. Under the FDIC’s risk-based assessment system, insured institutions are assigned a risk category based on supervisory evaluations, regulatory capital levels and certain other factors. An institution’s assessment rate depends upon the category to which it is assigned, and certain adjustments specified by Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation regulations. Institutions deemed less risky pay lower assessments. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation may adjust the scale uniformly, except that no adjustment can deviate more than two basis points from the base scale without notice and comment. No institution may pay a dividend if in default of the federal deposit insurance assessment.
 
The Dodd-Frank Act required the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation to revise its procedures to base its assessments upon each insured institution’s total assets less tangible equity instead of deposits. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation finalized a rule, effective April 1, 2011, that set the assessment range at 2.5 to 45 basis points of total assets less tangible equity.
 
The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation has authority to increase insurance assessments. A significant increase in insurance premiums would likely have an adverse effect on the operating expenses and results of operations of Ottawa Savings Bank. Management cannot predict what insurance assessment rates will be in the future.
 
Loans to One Borrower. Federal law provides that savings banks are generally subject to the limits on loans to one borrower applicable to national banks. Generally, subject to certain exceptions, savings banks may not make a loan or extend credit to a single or related group of borrowers in excess of 15% of its unimpaired capital and surplus. An additional amount may be lent, equal to 10% of unimpaired capital and surplus, if secured by specified readily-marketable collateral.
Qualified Thrift Lender Test. Federal law requires savings associations to meet a qualified thrift lender test. Under the test, a savings bank is required to either qualify as a “domestic building and loan association” under the Internal Revenue Code or maintain at least 65% of its “portfolio assets” (total assets less: (i) specified liquid assets up to 20% of total assets; (ii) intangibles, including goodwill; and (iii) the value of property used to conduct business) in certain “qualified thrift investments” (primarily multi-family residential mortgages and related investments, including certain mortgage-backed securities but also including education, credit card and small business loans) in at least 9 months out of each 12-month period.
 
A savings association that fails the qualified thrift lender test is subject to certain operating restrictions and the Dodd-Frank Act also specifies that failing the qualified thrift lender test is a violation of law that could result in an enforcement action and dividend limitations. As of December 31, 2018, Ottawa Savings Bank maintained 86.5% of its portfolio assets in qualified thrift investments and, therefore, met the qualified thrift lender test.
 
Limitation on Capital Distributions. Federal regulations impose limitations upon all capital distributions by a savings association, including cash dividends, payments to repurchase its shares and payments to stockholders of another institution in a cash-out merger. Under the regulations, an application to and the prior approval of the OCC is required before any capital distribution if the institution does not meet the criteria for “expedited treatment” of applications under OCC regulations (i.e., generally, examination and Community Reinvestment Act ratings in the two top categories), the total capital distributions for the calendar year exceed net income for that year plus the amount of retained net income for the preceding two years, the institution would be undercapitalized following the distribution or the distribution would otherwise be contrary to a statute, regulation or agreement with the OCC. If an application is not required, the institution must still provide 30-days prior written notice to and receive the non-objection of, the Federal Reserve Board of the capital distribution if, like Ottawa Savings Bank, it is a subsidiary of a holding company, as well as an informational notice filing to the OCC. If Ottawa Savings Bank’s capital were ever to fall below its regulatory requirements or the OCC notified it that it was in need of increased supervision, its ability to make capital distributions could be restricted. In addition, the OCC could prohibit a proposed capital distribution by any institution which would otherwise be permitted by the regulation, if the OCC determines that such distribution would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice.
Community Reinvestment Act. All federal savings associations have a responsibility under the Community Reinvestment Act and related regulations to help meet the credit needs of their communities, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods. An institution’s failure to satisfactorily comply with the provisions of the Community Reinvestment Act could result in denials of regulatory applications. Responsibility for administering the Community Reinvestment Act, unlike other fair lending laws, is not being transferred to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Ottawa Savings Bank received a “satisfactory” Community Reinvestment Act rating in its most recently completed examination.

Federal law limits Ottawa Savings Bank’s authority to engage in transactions with “affiliates” (e.g., any entity that controls or is under common control with Ottawa Savings Bank, including Ottawa Bancorp and their other subsidiaries). The aggregate amount of covered transactions with any individual affiliate is limited to 10% of the capital and surplus of the savings association. The aggregate amount of covered transactions with all affiliates is limited to 20% of the savings association’s capital and surplus. Certain transactions with affiliates are required to be secured by collateral in an amount and of a type specified by federal law. The purchase of low quality assets from affiliates is generally prohibited. Transactions with affiliates must generally be on terms and under circumstances that are at least as favorable to the institution as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with non-affiliated companies. In addition, savings associations are prohibited from lending to any affiliate that is engaged in activities that are not permissible for bank holding companies and no savings association may purchase the securities of any affiliate other than a subsidiary.
 
The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 generally prohibits loans by Ottawa Bancorp to its executive officers and directors. However, the law contains a specific exception for loans by a depository institution to its executive officers and directors in compliance with federal banking laws. Under such laws, Ottawa Savings Bank’s authority to extend credit to executive officers, directors and 10% stockholders (“insiders”), as well as entities such persons’ control, is limited. The laws limit both the individual and aggregate amount of loans that Ottawa Savings Bank may make to insiders based, in part, on Ottawa Savings Bank’s capital level and requires that certain board approval procedures be followed. Such loans are required to be made on terms substantially the same as those offered to unaffiliated individuals and not involve more than the normal risk of repayment. There is an exception for loans made pursuant to a benefit or compensation program that is widely available to all employees of the institution and does not give preference to insiders over other employees. Loans to executive officers are subject to additional limitations based on the type of loan involved.
 
In accordance with banking regulations, the Board of Directors reviews all loans made to a director or executive officer in an amount that, when aggregated with the amount of all other loans to such person and his or her related interests, exceed the greater of $25,000 or 5% of Ottawa Bancorp’s capital and surplus (up to a maximum of $500,000) and such loans must be approved in advance by a majority of the disinterested members of the Board of Directors. Additionally, pursuant to the Company’s Code of Ethics and Business Conduct, all executive officers and directors of the Company must disclose any existing or emerging conflicts of interest to the President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company. Such potential conflicts of interest include, but are not limited to, the following: (i) the Company conducting business with or competing against an organization in which a family member of an executive officer or director has an ownership or employment interest; and (ii) the ownership of more than 1% of the outstanding securities (or that represents more than 5% of the total assets of the employee and/or family member) of any business entity that does business with or is in competition with the Company.
 
Enforcement. The OCC currently has primary enforcement responsibility over savings associations and has authority to bring actions against the institution and all institution-affiliated parties, including stockholders, and any attorneys, appraisers and accountants who knowingly or recklessly participate in wrongful actions likely to have an adverse effect on an insured institution. Formal enforcement action may range from the issuance of a capital directive or cease and desist order to removal of officers and/or directors to institution of receivership, conservatorship or termination of deposit insurance. Civil penalties cover a wide range of violations and can amount to $25,000 per day, or even $1.0 million per day in especially egregious cases. The FDIC has the authority to recommend to the OCC that enforcement action be taken with respect to a particular savings association. If action is not taken by the OCC, the FDIC has authority to take such action under certain circumstances. Federal law also establishes criminal penalties for certain violations.
Federal Home Loan Bank System. Ottawa Savings Bank is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank System, which consists of 11 regional Federal Home Loan Banks. The Federal Home Loan Bank provides a central credit facility primarily for member institutions. Ottawa Savings Bank, as a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Chicago is required to acquire and hold shares of capital stock in that Federal Home Loan Bank. Ottawa Savings Bank was in compliance with this requirement with an investment in Federal Home Loan Bank stock at December 31, 2018 of $0.5 million.
Federal Reserve System. The Federal Reserve Board regulations require savings associations to maintain noninterest-earning reserves against their transaction accounts (primarily Negotiable Order of Withdrawal “NOW” and regular checking accounts).  The amounts are adjusted annually and, for 2018, the regulations provided that reserves be maintained against aggregate transaction accounts as follows: a 3% reserve ratio is assessed on net transaction accounts up to and including $124.2 million; and a 10% reserve ratio is applied above $124.2 million. The first $16.3 million of otherwise reservable balances (subject to adjustments by the Federal Reserve Board) are exempted from the reserve requirements. Ottawa Savings Bank complies with the foregoing requirements. In October 2008, the Federal Reserve Board began paying interest on certain reserve balances.

Holding Company Regulation

General. As a savings and loan holding company, Ottawa Bancorp, Inc. is subject to Federal Reserve Board regulations, examinations, supervision, reporting requirements and regulations regarding its activities. Among other things, this authority permits the Federal Reserve Board to restrict or prohibit activities that are determined to be a serious risk to Ottawa Savings Bank.
 
Pursuant to federal law and regulations and policy, a savings and loan holding company such as Ottawa Bancorp may generally engage in the activities permitted for financial holding companies under Section 4(k) of the Bank Holding Company Act and certain other activities that have been authorized for savings and loan holding companies by regulation. 
 
Federal law prohibits a savings and loan holding company from, directly or indirectly or through one or more subsidiaries, acquiring more than 5% of the voting stock of another savings association, or savings and loan holding company thereof, without prior written approval of the Federal Reserve Board or from acquiring or retaining, with certain exceptions, more than 5% of a non-subsidiary holding company or savings association. A savings and loan holding company is also prohibited from acquiring more than 5% of a company engaged in activities other than those authorized by federal law or acquiring or retaining control of a depository institution that is not insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. In evaluating applications by holding companies to acquire savings associations, the Federal Reserve Board must consider the financial and managerial resources and future prospects of the company and institution involved, the effect of the acquisition on the risk to the insurance funds, the convenience and needs of the community and competitive factors.
 
The Federal Reserve Board is prohibited from approving any acquisition that would result in a multiple savings and loan holding company controlling savings associations in more than one state, except: (i) the approval of interstate supervisory acquisitions by savings and loan holding companies; and (ii) the acquisition of a savings association in another state if the laws of the state of the target savings association specifically permit such acquisitions. The states vary in the extent to which they permit interstate savings and loan holding company acquisitions.
 
Capital Requirements.  Savings and loan holding companies with less than $3 billion in assets are not subject to specific regulatory capital requirements. The Dodd-Frank Act, however, requires the Federal Reserve Board to promulgate consolidated capital requirements for depository institution holding companies that are no less stringent, both quantitatively and in terms of components of capital, than those applicable to institutions themselves. 
 
 21



Source of Strength. The Dodd-Frank Act also extends the “source of strength” doctrine to savings and loan holding companies. The regulatory agencies must issue regulations requiring that all banks and savings and loan holding companies serve as a source of strength to their subsidiary depository institutions by providing capital, liquidity and other support in times of financial stress.
Dividends and Stock Repurchases. The Federal Reserve Board has the power to prohibit dividends by savings and loan holding companies if their actions constitute unsafe or unsound practices. The Federal Reserve Board has issued a policy statement on the payment of cash dividends by bank holding companies, which also applies to savings and loan holding companies and which expresses the Federal Reserve Board’s view that a holding company should pay cash dividends only to the extent that the company’s net income for the past year is sufficient to cover both the cash dividends and a rate of earnings retention that is consistent with the company’s capital needs, asset quality and overall financial condition. The Federal Reserve Board also indicated that it would be inappropriate for a holding company experiencing serious financial problems to borrow funds to pay dividends. Under the prompt corrective action regulations, the Federal Reserve Board may prohibit a bank holding company from paying any dividends if the holding company’s bank subsidiary is classified as “undercapitalized.”
 
Federal Reserve Board policy also provides that a holding company should inform the Federal Reserve Board supervisory staff prior to redeeming or repurchasing common stock or perpetual preferred stock if the holding company is experiencing financial weaknesses or if the repurchase or redemption would result in a net reduction, as of the end of a quarter, in the amount of such equity instruments outstanding compared with the beginning of the quarter in which the redemption or repurchase occurred.
 
Acquisition of Control. Under the federal Change in Bank Control Act, a notice must be submitted to the Federal Reserve Board if any person (including a company), or group acting in concert, seeks to acquire direct or indirect “control” of a savings and loan holding company or savings association. Under certain circumstances, a change of “control” may occur, and prior notice is required, upon the acquisition of 10% or more of the voting stock of a savings and loan holding company or savings institution, unless the Federal Reserve Board has found that the acquisition will not result in a change of control. Under the Change in Bank Control Act, the Federal Reserve Board has 60 days from the filing of a complete notice to act, taking into consideration certain factors, including the financial and managerial resources of the acquirer and the anti-trust effects of the acquisition. Any company that so acquires control would then be subject to regulation as a savings and loan holding company.
Federal Securities Laws 
 
Ottawa Bancorp, Inc. common stock is registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Ottawa Bancorp, Inc. is subject to the information, proxy solicitation, insider trading restrictions and other requirements under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
FEDERAL AND STATE TAXATION
 
Federal Income Taxation 
 
General. The following discussion of tax matters is intended only as a summary and does not purport to be a comprehensive description of the tax rules applicable to us. We report our income on a calendar year basis using the accrual method of accounting. The federal income tax laws apply to us in the same manner as to other corporations with some exceptions, including particularly our reserve for bad debts discussed below. Our federal income tax returns have been either audited or closed under the statute of limitations through tax year 2013. For its 2018 fiscal year, Ottawa Savings Bank’s maximum federal income tax rate was 21%.
 
On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was enacted, which amended the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, reducing tax rates and modifying certain policies, credits, and deductions for individuals and businesses. Included in this legislation was a reduction of the federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%. As a result of this reduction, we were required to revalue our existing net deferred tax assets, which resulted in a charge to income tax expense during the fourth quarter of 2017. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act also added limitations on the deductibility of business interest expense. While this limitation should not impact the deductibility of the Company’s interest expense, the limitation could impact our commercial borrowers. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act also includes changes to personal income taxes that may impact the Bank’s borrowers, including: (i) a lower limit on the deductibility of mortgage interest on single-family residential mortgages; (ii) the elimination of interest deductions for home equity loans; and (iii) a limitation on the deductibility of property taxes and state and local income taxes.
 
Bad Debt Reserves. For fiscal years beginning before June 30, 1996, thrift institutions that qualified under certain definitional tests and other conditions of the Internal Revenue Code were permitted to use certain favorable provisions to calculate their deductions from taxable income for annual additions to their bad debt reserve. A reserve could be established for bad debts on qualifying real property loans, generally secured by interests in real property improved or to be improved, under the percentage of taxable income method or the experience method. The reserve for non-qualifying loans was computed using the experience method. Federal legislation enacted in 1996 repealed the reserve method of accounting for bad debts for institutions with assets in excess of $500 million and the percentage of taxable income method for all institutions for tax years beginning after 1995 and requires savings institutions to recapture or take into income certain portions of their accumulated bad debt reserves. Approximately $2.3 million of our accumulated bad debt reserves would not be recaptured into taxable income unless Ottawa Savings Bank makes a “non-dividend distribution” to Ottawa Bancorp, Inc. as described below.
 
 22



Distributions. If Ottawa Savings Bank makes “non-dividend distributions” to Ottawa Bancorp, Inc., the distributions will be considered to have been made from Ottawa Savings Bank’s un-recaptured tax bad debt reserves, to the extent of the “non-dividend distributions,” and then from Ottawa Savings Bank’s supplemental reserve for losses on loans, to the extent of those reserves, and an amount based on the amount distributed, but not more than the amount of those reserves, will be included in Ottawa Savings Bank’s taxable income. Non-dividend distributions include distributions in excess of Ottawa Savings Bank’s current and accumulated earnings and profits, as calculated for federal income tax purposes, distributions in redemption of stock, and distributions in partial or complete liquidation. Dividends paid out of Ottawa Savings Bank’s current or accumulated earnings and profits will not be so included in Ottawa Savings Bank’s taxable income.
 
The amount of additional taxable income triggered by a non-dividend is an amount that, when reduced by the tax attributable to the income, is equal to the amount of the distribution. Therefore, if Ottawa Savings Bank makes a non-dividend distribution to Ottawa Bancorp, Inc., approximately one and one-half times the amount of the distribution not in excess of the amount of the reserves would be includable in income for federal income tax purposes, assuming a 21% federal corporate income tax rate. Ottawa Savings Bank does not intend to pay dividends that would result in a recapture of any portion of its bad debt reserves.
 
Tax Allocation Agreement. Ottawa Bancorp, Inc. and Ottawa Savings Bank have executed a Tax Allocation Agreement. The purpose of this agreement is to set forth the rights and obligations of Ottawa Bancorp and Ottawa Savings Bank for purposes of filing consolidated federal and state combined income tax returns.
 
 Under the Tax Allocation Agreement, Ottawa Bancorp and Ottawa Savings Bank calculate their federal and state income tax liabilities as if they were filing a separate tax return. If there is tax liability calculated on this separate entity basis, Ottawa Savings Bank pays that tax liability to Ottawa Bancorp. Payments are made no earlier than five days prior to the time that Ottawa Bancorp is required to make either estimated or final tax payments for the consolidated or combined return. If Ottawa Savings Bank has a taxable loss for a year on a separate entity basis, and if that loss could have been carried back to obtain a refund, Ottawa Bancorp pays an amount equal to such refund to Ottawa Savings Bank, whether or not any such refund is actually received on a consolidated or combined basis. If that taxable loss would not have resulted in a refund on a separate entity basis because there was no carry-back available, but that loss is used on the consolidated or combined return to reduce tax liability on a consolidated or combined basis, Ottawa Bancorp pays Ottawa Savings Bank an amount equal to the tax savings from using that loss.
 
Ottawa Savings Bank is required to contribute to Ottawa Bancorp, Inc. its share of any required estimated tax payments. When the consolidated or combined return is actually filed, if the estimated payments by Ottawa Savings Bank to Ottawa Bancorp exceed the amount of Ottawa Savings Bank’s tax liability on a separate entity basis, Ottawa Bancorp will refund the excess to Ottawa Savings Bank. If Ottawa Savings Bank’s tax liability on a separate entity basis exceeds the estimated payments it has paid to Ottawa Bancorp, Ottawa Savings Bank will pay the deficiency to Ottawa Bancorp.
 
State Taxation 
 
Ottawa Savings Bank is required to file Illinois income tax returns and pay tax at an effective tax rate of approximately 9.46% of Illinois taxable income. For these purposes, Illinois taxable income generally means federal taxable income subject to certain modifications, primarily the exclusion of interest income on United States obligations.
