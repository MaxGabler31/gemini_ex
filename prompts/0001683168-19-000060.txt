ITEM 1. BUSINESS
History
 
We were incorporated under the name “Hazlo! Technologies, Inc.” on August 19, 2010 in the State of Nevada. Our initial business plan was to modify and translate software and web applications originally written in English into Spanish and to focus on the needs of the Arizona business community to better serve the Spanish-speaking population. We did not generate any revenue from said IT services and data translation services.
 
On December 12, 2011, we entered a Share Exchange Agreement with DingXu BVI’s sole shareholder (Chin Yung Kong) under which we issue 3,000,000 shares of common stock to Chin Yung Kong to acquire 100% of the issued and outstanding shares of DingXu BVI (the “Share Exchange”). Upon closing of the Share Exchange, DingXu BVI became the wholly owned subsidiary of CLAD.
 
China Liaoning DingXu Ecological Agriculture Development Co, Ltd., a BVI company (the “DingXu BVI”) was incorporated under the laws of British Virgin Islands on April 15, 2011. Chin Yung Kong was the sole shareholder and director of DingXu BVI.
On July 5, 2011, DingXu BVI formed Panjin Hengrun Biological Technology Development Co., Ltd. 盘锦恒润生物技术开发有限公司, a limited liability company organized under the laws of the PRC (“Panjin Hengrun”). DingXu BVI owns 99% of the total ownership of Panjing Hengrun.
 
On November 28, 2011, Panjin Hengrun entered into a set of contractual arrangements with Liaoning Dingxu Ecological Agriculture Development Co., Ltd.辽宁鼎旭生态农业发展有限公司, a limited liability company organized under the laws of the PRC and an affiliated entity of Panjin Hengrun through contractual arrangements (“Liaoning Dingxu”). The contractual arrangements are comprised of a series of agreements, including a Consulting Service Agreement and an Operating Agreement, through which Panjin Hengrun has the right to advise, consult, manage and operate Liaoning Dingxu to collect and own all of Liaoning Dingxu’s net profits and net losses. Additionally, under a Proxy Agreement, the shareholders of Liaoning Dingxu have vested their voting control over Liaoning Dingxu to Panjin Hengrun. In order to further reinforce Panjin Hengrun’s rights to control and operate Liaoning Dingxu, Liaoning Dingxu and its shareholders have granted Panjin Hengrun, under an Option Agreement, the exclusive right and option to acquire all of their equity interests in Liaoning Dingxu, or, alternatively, all of the assets of Liaoning Dingxu. Further, the shareholders of Liaoning Dingxu agreed to pledge all of their rights, titles and interests in Liaoning Dingxu under an Equity Pledge Agreement.
 
Upon entry of these contractual arrangements, Liaoning Dingxu became the Variable Interest Entity (“VIE”) of Panjin Hengrun pursuant to ASC-810-10-05 and Panjin Hengrun was able to carry out business operations through Liaoning Dingxu.
 
Liaoning Dingxu was formed as a limited liability company organized under the laws of the PRC on August 6, 2009. It mainly engages in the business of growing mushrooms and marketing, producing and selling mushrooms and related agricultural products.
 
Since the completion of the Share Exchange, our business operations have been carried out through Panjin Hengrun and its affiliated operating entity Liaoning Dingxu. On December 12, 2011, we ceased the business of development stage IT services and data translation services and started to engage in the business of growing mushrooms and marketing, producing and selling mushrooms and related agricultural products through Liaoning Dingxu.

Business Overview
 
We mainly engage in the business of growing mushrooms and marketing, producing and selling mushrooms and related agricultural products through our affiliated VIE Liaoning Dingxu.
 
Main Products
 
We mainly produced and sold three types of products:
 
(1) Fresh mushrooms. We grow fresh mushrooms in our greenhouses and sell them to stores that sell products directly to individual customers. Our fresh mushrooms include oyster mushrooms, king oyster mushrooms, shiitake mushrooms, king trumpet mushrooms and button mushrooms.
 (2) Mushroom seeds. We sell mushroom seeds to farmers in the form of stick shaped containers filled with fertilizers on which the mushrooms grow and bottles of mushroom seeds which are also used to grow mushrooms.
 (3) Dried Mushrooms. We dry and package fresh mushrooms and sell them to stores that sell products directly to individual customers. Our dried mushrooms include eryngii mushrooms, white mushrooms, jade mushrooms, white king oyster mushrooms and ganoderma.
Seasonality
 Our market is not seasonal due to the fact that our mushrooms are grown in the green house and therefore are not affected by season changes. We do, however, need to store our fresh mushrooms, mushroom sticks and spawns in a low temperature environment, which creates extra costs in the spring and summer months.
Market Overview
 
We sell all of our products in Liaoning Province China.
 Sales and Marketing
 
We conduct direct sales and marketing through our own sales team to stores that sell products directly to individual customers. We have not used agencies and brokers to sell our products.
Raw Materials and Source of Raw Materials
 
The raw materials we use for growing our products include sawdust, straw, bran and chicken manure. We collect materials from local farmers and do not have any supply contracts with any farmers.

Our Competitors
 There are many mushroom producers and sellers in China and we only have a very small percentage of the total market in China. On a daily basis, we produce approximately 25,000 kg of fresh mushrooms, 10,000 mushroom sticks and 10,000 bottles of mushroom seed. Our daily production is approximately 33% of our daily production capacity. We believe that Xinghe Biological Inc. located at Dongguan, Guangdong, has approximately 60 tons daily production capability and has approximately 8% of the market share in South China markets and Gaorong Company, located in Shanghai, China, has approximately 100 tons daily production capability and has approximately 10% of the market share in South China markets.
Our Plan of Growth
 

(1) | Expand our farms. We plan to obtain land use rights to more farmland to expand our mushroom farms and increase the production of our fresh mushrooms. 
----+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(2) | Start the production of processed mushroom products. We have purchased, installed and tested equipment to be used in the production of mushroom products, such as canned mushrooms and mushroom drinks. Our production of mushrooms is not sufficient to begin production of such products. We intend to begin production as soon as we can purchase additional mushrooms and hire additional employees.
