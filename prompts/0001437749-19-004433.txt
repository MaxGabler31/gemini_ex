Item 1.  Business
Guaranty Federal Bancshares, Inc.
 
Guaranty Federal Bancshares, Inc. (hereinafter referred to as “we,” “us,” “our,” or the “Company”) is a Delaware-chartered corporation that was formed in September 1997. The Company became a unitary savings and loan holding company for Guaranty Federal Savings Bank, a federal savings bank (the "Bank") on December 30, 1997, in connection with a plan of conversion and reorganization involving the Bank and its then existing mutual holding company. The mutual holding company structure had been created in April 1995 at which time more than a majority of the shares of the Bank were issued to the mutual holding company and the remaining shares were sold in a public offering. In connection with the conversion and reorganization on December 30, 1997, the shares of the Bank held by the mutual holding company were extinguished along with the mutual holding company, and the shares of the Bank held by the public were exchanged for shares of the Company. All of the shares of the Bank which remained outstanding after the conversion are owned by the Company.
 
On June 27, 2003, the Bank converted from a federal savings bank to a state-chartered trust company with banking powers in Missouri, and the Company became a bank holding company. On this date, the name of the Bank was changed from Guaranty Federal Savings Bank to Guaranty Bank. The primary activity of the Company is to oversee its investment in the Bank. The Company engages in few other activities. For this reason, unless otherwise specified, references to the Company include operations of the Bank. Further, information in a chart or table based on Bank only data is identical to or immaterially different from information that would be provided on a consolidated basis. In addition to the Bank, the Company owns Guaranty Statutory Trust I and Guaranty Statutory Trust II, both Delaware statutory trusts.
 
On April 2, 2018, the company completed the acquisition of Carthage, Missouri-based Hometown Bancshares, Inc. (“Hometown”) including its wholly owned bank subsidiary, Hometown Bank, National Association and Hometown Bancshares Statutory Trust I, a Delaware statutory trust. Under the terms of the Agreement and Plan of Merger, each share of Hometown common stock was exchanged for $20.00 in cash and the transaction was valued at approximately $4.6 million. Hometown’s subsidiary bank, Hometown Bank, National Association, was merged into Guaranty Bank on June 8, 2018. Including the effects of acquisition method accounting adjustments, the Company acquired approximately $178.8 million in assets, including approximately $143.9 million in loans (inclusive of loan discounts) and approximately $161.2 million in deposits. Goodwill of $1.4 million was also recorded as a result of this transaction. The acquisition strengthened the Company’s position in Southwest Missouri and the Company believes it will be able to achieve cost savings by integrating the two companies and combining accounting, data processing and other administrative functions all of which gave rise to the goodwill recorded.
 
At December 31, 2018, the Company’s consolidated assets were $965.1 million, net loans were $779.8 million, deposits were $749.6 million and total stockholders’ equity was $80.5 million. See Item 6 “Selected Financial Data” for further details regarding the Company’s financial position and results of operations for the previous five fiscal years.
 
Guaranty Bank
 
The Bank's principal business has been, and continues to be, attracting retail deposits from the general public and investing those deposits, together with funds generated from operations, in commercial real estate loans, multi-family residential mortgage loans, construction loans, permanent one- to four-family residential mortgage loans, business, consumer and other loans. The Bank also invests in mortgage-backed securities, U.S. Government and federal agency securities and other marketable securities. The Bank's revenues are derived principally from interest on its loans and other investments and fees charged for services provided, and gains generated from sales of loans and investment securities, and the Bank’s results of operations are primarily dependent on net interest margin, which is the difference between interest income on interest-earning assets and interest expense on interest-bearing liabilities. The Bank's primary sources of funds are: deposits; borrowings; amortization and prepayments of loan principal; and amortizations, prepayments and maturities of investment securities.
 
The Bank is regulated by the Missouri Division of Finance (“MDF”) and its deposits are insured by the Deposit Insurance Fund of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the "FDIC"). See discussion under section captioned “Supervision and Regulation” in this Item 1. The Bank is a member of the FHLB of Des Moines, which is one of 11 regional Federal Home Loan Banks (“FHLB”).

Market Area

The Bank's primary market areas are Greene, Christian, Jasper, and Newton Counties, which are in the southwestern corner of Missouri and includes the cities of Springfield, Nixa, Ozark, Joplin, Carthage and Neosho, Missouri (our “Market Area”).  The major components of the Market Area’s economy are service industries, education, retail, light manufacturing and health care. There is a significant regional health care presence with three large regional hospitals.  There also are four accredited colleges and two major universities.  Part of the area’s growth can be attributed to its proximity to Branson, Missouri, which has developed a strong tourism industry related to country music and entertainment.  Branson is located 30 miles south of Springfield, and attracts between five and six million tourists each year, many of whom pass through Springfield. The Bank also has one Loan Production Office in Webster County, Missouri. 
Lending Activities
 
Like many commercial banks in our market, our loan portfolio is comprised of different types of industries. However, real estate lending is a significant portion of our business and accounted for more than 81% of our loan portfolio by value as of December 31, 2018. Set forth below is selected data relating to the composition of the Bank’s loan portfolio at the dates indicated:

Commercial Real Estate Loans. As of December 31, 2018, the Bank had commercial real estate loans totaling $322.9 million or 41% of the Bank's total loan portfolio. Commercial real estate loans are generally originated in amounts up to 80% of the appraised value of the mortgaged property. The majority of the Bank’s commercial real estate loans have been originated with adjustable rates of interest, the majority of which are quoted at a spread to the Wall Street Prime rate for the initial fixed rate period with subsequent adjustments at a spread to the Wall Street Prime rate. The Bank's commercial real estate loans are generally permanent loans secured by improved property such as office buildings, retail stores, small shopping centers, medical offices, motels, churches and other non-residential buildings.
 
To originate commercial real estate loans, the Bank generally requires a mortgage and security interest in the subject real estate, personal guarantees of the principals, a security interest in the related personal property, and a standby assignment of rents and leases. The Bank has established its loan-to-one borrower limitation, which was $28.3 million as of December 31, 2018, as its maximum commercial real estate loan amount.

Loans secured by commercial real estate are generally larger and involve a greater degree of risk than residential mortgage loans. Because payments on loans secured by commercial real estate are often dependent on successful operation or management of the properties, repayment of such loans may be subject, to a greater extent, to adverse conditions in the real estate market or the economy. The Bank seeks to minimize these risks by careful underwriting, requiring personal guarantees, lending only to established customers and borrowers otherwise known by the Bank, and generally restricting such loans to its primary Market Area.
 
As of December 31, 2018, the Bank’s commercial real estate loan portfolio included approximately $13.6 million, or 1.7% in loans to develop land into residential lots. The Bank utilizes its knowledge of the local market conditions and appraisals to evaluate the development cost and estimate projected lot prices and absorption rates to assess loans on residential subdivisions. The Bank typically loans up to 75% of the appraised value over terms up to two years. Development loans generally involve a greater degree of risk than residential mortgage loans because (1) the funds are advanced upon the security of the land which has a materially lower value prior to completion of the infrastructure required of a subdivision, (2) the cash flow available for debt repayment is a function of the sale of the individual lots, and (3) the amount of interest required to service the debt is a function of the time required to complete the development and sell the lots.
 
Commercial Business Loans. As of December 31, 2018, the Bank had commercial business loans totaling $119.4 million or 15% of the Bank's total loan portfolio. Commercial business loans are generally secured by business assets, such as accounts receivable, equipment and inventory. Unlike residential mortgage loans, which generally are made on the basis of the borrower's ability to make repayment from his or her employment and other income and which are secured by real property whose value tends to be more easily ascertainable, commercial business loans are of higher risk and typically are made on the basis of the borrower's ability to make repayment from the cash flow of the borrower's business. As a result, the availability of funds for the repayment of commercial business loans may be substantially dependent on the success of the business itself. Further, the collateral securing the loans may depreciate over time, may be difficult to appraise and may fluctuate in value based on the success of the business. The Bank expects to continue to expand its commercial business lending as opportunities present themselves.
 
One- to Four-Family Mortgage Loans. The Bank offers fixed- and adjustable-rate (“ARM”) first mortgage loans secured by one- to four-family residences in the Bank's primary lending area. Typically, such residences are single family homes that serve as the primary residence of the owner. However, there are a number of loans originated by the Bank which are secured by non-owner occupied properties. Loan originations are generally obtained from existing or past customers, members of the local community, attorney referrals, established builders and realtors within our Market Area. Originated mortgage loans in the Bank's portfolio include due-on-sale clauses which provide the Bank with the contractual right to deem the loan immediately due and payable in the event that the borrower transfers ownership of the property without the Bank's consent.
 
As of December 31, 2018, $133.9 million or 17% of the Bank’s total loan portfolio consisted of one- to four-family residential loans. The Bank currently offers ARM and balloon loans that have fixed interest rate periods of one to seven years. Generally, ARM loans provide for limits on the maximum interest rate adjustment ("caps") that can be made at the end of each applicable period and throughout the duration of the loan. ARM loans are originated for a term of up to 30 years on owner-occupied properties and generally up to 25 years on non-owner occupied properties. Typically, interest rate adjustments are calculated based on U.S. treasury securities adjusted to a constant maturity of one year (CMT), plus a 2.50% to 2.75% margin. Interest rates charged on fixed-rate loans are competitively priced based on market conditions and the cost of funds existing at the time the loan is committed. The Bank's fixed-rate mortgage loans are made for terms of 15 to 30 years which are currently being sold on the secondary market.
 
Generally, ARM loans pose credit risks different from the risks inherent in fixed-rate loans, primarily because as interest rates rise, the underlying payments of the borrower rise, thereby increasing the potential for default. At the same time, the marketability of the underlying property may be adversely affected by higher interest rates. The Bank does not originate ARM loans that provide for negative amortization.
 
The Bank generally originates both owner occupied and non-owner occupied one- to four-family residential mortgage loans in amounts up to 80% of the appraised value or the selling price of the mortgaged property, whichever is lower. The Bank on occasion may make loans up to 95% of appraised value or the selling price of the mortgage property, whichever is lower. However, the Bank typically requires private mortgage insurance for the excess amount over 80% for mortgage loans with loan to value percentages greater than 80%.
 
 7



Multi-Family Mortgage Loans. The Bank originates multi-family mortgage loans in its primary lending area. As of December 31, 2018, $90.5 million or 12% of the Bank's total loan portfolio consisted of multi-family residential real estate loans. With regard to multi-family mortgage loans, the Bank generally requires personal guarantees of the principals as well as a security interest in the real estate. Multi-family mortgage loans are generally originated in amounts of up to 80% of the appraised value of the property. A portion of the Bank’s multi-family mortgage loans have been originated with adjustable rates of interest which are quoted at a spread to the FHLB advance rate for the initial fixed rate period with subsequent adjustments based on the Wall Street prime rate. The loan-to-one-borrower limitation, $28.3 million as of December 31, 2018, is the maximum the Bank will lend on a multi-family residential real estate loan.
 
Loans secured by multi-family residential real estate generally involve a greater degree of credit risk than one- to four-family residential mortgage loans and carry larger loan balances. This increased credit risk is a result of several factors, including the concentration of principal in a limited number of loans and borrowers, the effects of general economic conditions on income producing properties, and the increased difficulty of evaluating and monitoring these types of loans. Furthermore, the repayment of loans secured by multi-family residential real estate is typically dependent upon the successful operation of the related real estate property. If the cash flow from the project is reduced, the borrower's ability to repay the loan may be impaired.
 
Construction Loans. As of December 31, 2018, construction loans totaled $88.6 million or 11% of the Bank's total loan portfolio. Construction loans originated by the Bank are generally secured by permanent mortgage loans for the construction of owner-occupied residential real estate or to finance speculative construction secured by residential real estate or owner-operated commercial real estate. This portion of the Bank’s loan portfolio consists of speculative loans, i.e., loans to builders who are speculating that they will be able to locate a purchaser for the underlying property prior to or shortly after the time construction has been completed.
 
Construction loans are made to contractors who have sufficient financial strength and a proven track record, for the purpose of resale, as well as on a "pre-sold" basis. Construction loans made for the purpose of resale generally provide for interest only payments at floating rates and have terms of six months to fifteen months. Construction loans for speculative purposes, models, and commercial properties typically have loan to value ratios of up to 80%. Loan proceeds are disbursed in increments as construction progresses and as inspections warrant.
 
Construction lending by its nature entails significant additional risks as compared with one-to four-family mortgage lending, attributable primarily to the fact that funds are advanced upon the security of the project under construction prior to its completion. As a result, construction lending often involves the disbursement of substantial funds with repayment dependent on the success of the ultimate project and the ability of the borrower or guarantor to repay the loan. Because of these factors, the analysis of the prospective construction loan projects requires an expertise that is different in significant respects from that which is required for residential mortgage lending. The Bank attempts to address these risks through its underwriting and construction monitoring procedures.
 
Consumer and Other Loans. The Bank also offers consumer loans, primarily consisting of loans secured by certificates of deposit, automobiles, boats and home equity loans. As of December 31, 2018, the Bank has such loans totaling $33.1 million or 4% of the Bank’s total loan portfolio. The Bank expects to continue to expand its consumer lending as opportunities present themselves.
Director and Insider Loans. Management believes that loans to Directors and Officers are prudent and within the normal course of business. These loans reflect normal credit terms and represent no more collection risk than any other loan in the portfolio.
 
Delinquencies, Non-Performing and Problem Assets.
 
Delinquent Loans. As of December 31, 2018, the Bank has ten loans 90 days or more past due with a principal balance of $2,234,471 and 34 loans between 30 and 89 days past due with an aggregate principal balance of $8,318,686. The Bank generally does not accrue interest on loans past due more than 90 days.

Non-Performing Assets. Loans are reviewed on a regular basis and are placed on non-accrual status when, in the opinion of management, the collection of all interest at contractual rates becomes doubtful. As part of such review, mortgage loans are placed on non-accrual status generally when either principal or interest is more than 90 days past due, or when other circumstances indicate the collection of principal or interest is in doubt. Interest accrued and unpaid at the time a loan is placed on non-accrual status is charged against interest income.
 
Real estate acquired by the Bank as a result of foreclosure or by deed in lieu of foreclosure is deemed a foreclosed asset held for sale until such time as it is sold. When a foreclosed asset held for sale is acquired it is recorded at its estimated fair value, less estimated selling expenses. Valuations of such foreclosed assets are periodically performed by management, and any subsequent decline in estimated fair value is charged to operations.

Problem Assets. Federal regulations require that the Bank review and classify its assets on a regular basis to determine those assets considered to be of lesser quality. In addition, in connection with examinations of insured institutions, bank examiners have authority to identify problem assets and, if appropriate, require them to be classified. There are three classifications for problem assets: substandard, doubtful, and loss. "Substandard assets" must have one or more defined weaknesses and are characterized by the distinct possibility that the insured institution will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. "Doubtful assets" have the weaknesses of substandard assets with the additional characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values highly questionable, and improbable. An asset classified "loss" is considered uncollectible and of such little value that continuance as an asset of the institution is not warranted. The regulations have also created a “special mention” category, described as assets which do not currently expose an insured institution to a sufficient degree of risk to warrant classification but do possess credit deficiencies or potential weaknesses deserving management's close attention. Federal regulations require the Bank to establish general allowances for loan losses from assets classified as substandard or doubtful. If an asset or portion thereof is classified as loss, the insured institution must either establish specific allowances for loan losses in the amount of 100% of the portion of the asset classified loss or charge off such amount. A portion of general loss allowances established to cover possible losses related to assets classified substandard or doubtful may be included in determining an institution's regulatory capital.
 
For management purposes, the Bank also designates certain loans for additional attention. Such loans are called “Special Mention” and have identified weaknesses, that if the situation deteriorates, the loans would merit a substandard classification.

Allowance for Loan Losses and Provision for Loan Losses
 
The allowance for loan losses is established through a provision for loan losses based on management's evaluation of the risk inherent in its loan portfolio and the general economy. Such evaluation, which includes a review of all loans on which full collectability may not be reasonably assured, considers among other matters, the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral, economic conditions, historical loan loss experience, and other factors that warrant recognition in providing for an adequate loan loss allowance. In addition, various regulatory agencies, as an integral part of their examination process, periodically review the Bank's allowance for loan losses and valuation of foreclosed assets held for sale. Such agencies may require the Bank to recognize additions to the allowance based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examination.
 
As of December 31, 2018, the Bank's total allowance for loan losses was $8.0 million or 1.02% of gross loans outstanding (excluding mortgage loans held for sale), an increase of $888,151 from December 31, 2017. The Bank experienced loan charge offs in excess of recoveries as management charged off specific loans that had been previously identified and classified as impaired. This allowance reflects not only management's determination to maintain an allowance for loan losses consistent with regulatory expectations for non-performing or problem assets, but also reflects the regional economy and the Bank's policy of evaluating the risks inherent in its loan portfolio.
 
Management records a provision for loan losses to bring the total allowance for loan losses to a level considered adequate based on the Bank’s internal analysis and methodology. During 2018, the Bank recorded a provision for loan loss expense, as shown in the table below. Management anticipates the need to continue adding to the allowance through charges to provision for loan losses as growth in the loan portfolio or other circumstances warrant.
 
In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles for acquisition accounting, the loans acquired through the acquisition of Hometown were recorded at fair value; therefore, there was no allowance associated with Hometown’s loans at acquisition. Management continues to evaluate the allowance needed on the acquired Hometown loans factoring in the net remaining discount of $2.45 million at December 31, 2018.

Borrowings
 
The Company’s borrowings at December 31, 2018 consist of FHLB advances, a note payable at another financial institution and issuances of junior subordinated debentures. Other borrowings available to the Company include borrowings from the Federal Reserve Bank and Securities Sold Under Agreements to Repurchase.
 
 16



Deposits are the primary source of funds for the Bank's lending activities and other general business purposes. However, during periods when the supply of lendable funds cannot meet the demand for such loans, the FHLB System, of which the Bank is a member, makes available, subject to compliance with eligibility standards, a portion of the funds necessary through loans (advances) to its members. Use of FHLB advances is a common practice, allowing the Bank to provide funding to its customers at a time when significant liquidity is not present, or at a rate advantageous relative to current market deposit rates. FHLB advances, due to their structure, allow the Bank to better manage its interest rate and liquidity risk. The following table presents certain data for FHLB advances as of the dates indicated.

Junior Subordinated Debentures:
On December 15, 2005, the Company completed an offering of $15 million of “Trust Preferred Securities” (defined hereinafter). The Company formed two wholly-owned subsidiaries, Guaranty Statutory Trust I (“Trust I”) and Guaranty Statutory Trust II (“Trust II”) each a Delaware statutory trust (each a “Trust”, and collectively, the “Trusts”), for the purpose of issuing the $15 million of Trust Preferred Securities. The proceeds of the sale of Trust Preferred Securities, together with the proceeds of the Trusts’ sale of their common securities to the Company, were used by each Trust to purchase certain debentures from the Company. The Company issued 30-year junior subordinated deferrable interest debentures to the Trusts in the principal amount of $5,155,000 (“Trust I Debentures”) and $10,310,000 (“Trust II Debentures”, and together with the Trust I Debentures, the “Debentures”) pursuant to the terms of Indentures dated December 15, 2005 by and between the Company and Wilmington Trust Company, as trustee. The Trust I Debentures bear interest at a fixed rate of 6.92%, payable quarterly. The Trust II Debentures bear interest at a fixed rate of 6.47% for 5 years, payable quarterly, after issuance and thereafter at a floating rate equal to the three month LIBOR plus 1.45%. The interest payments by the Company to the Trusts will be used to pay the dividends payable by the Trusts to the holders of the Trust Preferred Securities.
 
The Debentures mature on February 23, 2036. Subject to prior approval by the Federal Reserve Board, the Debentures and the Trust Preferred Securities are each callable by the Company or the Trusts, respectively and as applicable, at its option after five years from issuance, and sooner in the case of a special redemption at a special redemption price ranging up to 103.2% of the principal amount thereof, and upon the occurrence of certain events, such as a change in the regulatory capital treatment of the Trust Preferred Securities, either Trust being deemed an investment company or the occurrence of certain adverse tax events. In addition, the Company and the Trusts may defer interest and dividend payments, respectively, for up to five consecutive years without resulting in a default. An event of default may occur if the Company declares bankruptcy, fails to make the required payments within 30 days or breaches certain covenants within the Debentures. The Debentures are subordinated to the prior payment of any other indebtedness of the Company.
 
Pursuant to two guarantee agreements by and between the Company and Wilmington Trust Company, the Company issued a limited, irrevocable guarantee of the obligations of each Trust under the Trust Preferred Securities whereby the Company has guaranteed any and all payment obligations of the Trusts related to the Trust Preferred Securities including distributions on, and the liquidation or redemption price of, the Trust Preferred Securities to the extent each Trust does not have funds available.

On April 2, 2018 the Company acquired Carthage, Missouri-based Hometown Bancshares. Pursuant to a Second Supplemental Indenture dated April 2, 2018 by and among the Company, Hometown and Wilmington Trust Company, as Trustee, the Company assumed Hometown’s rights, duties and obligations under the original Indenture of a wholly owned subsidiary, Hometown Bancshares Capital Trust I, a Delaware statutory trust formed on October 29, 2002. This Trust was formed for the purposes of issuing $6.0 million of Trust Preferred Securities. Hometown issued 30-year junior subordinated deferrable interest debentures to the Trust in the principal amount of $6,186,000 (“Hometown Trust I Debentures”) pursuant to the terms of Indentures dated October 29, 2002 by and between the Company and Wilmington Trust Company, as trustee. These debentures bear interest at a floating rate equal to the three-month LIBOR plus 5.00%, payable quarterly, until May 2019. The rate from May 2019 until maturity in 2032 is a floating rate equal to the three-month LIBOR plus 6.00%, payable quarterly, with a maximum interest rate of 12.5%. The interest payments by the Company to the Trust will be used to pay the dividends payable by the Trust to the holders of the Trust Preferred Securities.
 
The Hometown Debentures mature on November 7, 2032. Subject to prior approval by the Federal Reserve Board, the Debentures and the Trust Preferred Securities are each callable by the Company or the Trust, respectively and as applicable, at its option after five years from issuance at 100% of principal amount plus any accrued interest. Also, upon the occurrence of certain events, such as a change in the regulatory capital treatment of the Trust Preferred Securities, the Trust being deemed an investment company or the occurrence of certain adverse tax events the Debentures and Securities are callable. In addition, the Company and the Trust may defer interest and dividend payments, respectively, for up to five consecutive years without resulting in a default. An event of default may occur if the Company declares bankruptcy, fails to make the required payments within 30 days or breaches certain covenants within the Debentures. The Debentures are subordinated to the prior payment of any other indebtedness of the Company.
 
Pursuant to a guarantee agreement by and between the Company and Wilmington Trust Company, the Company issued a limited, irrevocable guarantee of the obligations of each Trust under the Trust Preferred Securities whereby the Company has guaranteed any and all payment obligations of the Trusts related to the Trust Preferred Securities including distributions on, and the liquidation or redemption price of, the Trust Preferred Securities to the extent each Trust does not have funds available.
 
The following table sets forth certain information as to the Company's subordinated debentures issued to the Trusts at the dates indicated.

Subsidiary Activity and Segment Information
 
The Company has four wholly-owned subsidiaries: (i) the Bank, the Company’s principal subsidiary and a state-chartered bank with trust powers in Missouri; (ii) Trust I; (iii) Trust II; and (iv) Hometown Trust I. As discussed in more detail above, Trust I and Trust II were formed in December 2005 for the exclusive purpose of issuing trust preferred securities to acquire junior subordinated debentures issued by the Company. Hometown Trust I was acquired in 2018 with its purpose to issue trust preferred securities to acquire junior subordinated debentures issued by Hometown Bancshares in October 2002. Those debentures are the sole assets of the Trusts. The interest payments by the Company on the debentures are the sole revenues of the Trusts and are used by the Trusts to pay the dividends to the holders of the trust preferred securities. The Company has guaranteed any and all payment obligations of the Trusts related to the trust preferred securities. Under generally accepted accounting principles, the Trusts are not consolidated with the Company.
 
The Bank has one service corporation subsidiary, Guaranty Financial Services of Springfield, Inc., a Missouri corporation. This service corporation, which has been inactive since February 1, 2003, had agreements with third party providers for the sale of securities and casualty insurance products.
 
The Company’s banking operation conducted through its principal subsidiary, the Bank, is the Company’s only reportable segment. Other information about the Company’s business segment is contained in the section captioned “Segment Information” in Note 1 to the Notes of the Consolidated Financial Statements in this report.

Employees
 
As of December 31, 2018, the Bank had 202 full-time employees and 24 part-time employees. As of December 31, 2018, the Company had no employees. None of the Bank's employees are represented by a collective bargaining group.
Competition
 
The Bank experiences substantial competition both in attracting and retaining deposit accounts and in the origination of loans. The Bank's primary competition consists of commercial banks, credit unions, and savings institutions.
 
Direct competition for deposit accounts comes from other commercial banks, credit unions, regional bank and thrift holding companies, and savings institutions located in the remainder of our Market Area. Significant competition for the Bank's other deposit products and services come from money market mutual funds, brokerage firms, insurance companies, and retail stores. Recently, online firms have offered attractive financial service products to consumers, irrespective of location. The primary factors in competing for loans are interest rates and loan origination fees and the range of services offered by various financial institutions. Our larger competitors have a greater ability to finance wide-ranging advertising campaigns through their greater capital resources. Our marketing efforts depend heavily upon referrals from officers, directors and shareholders, selective advertising in local media and direct mail solicitations. The Bank believes it is able to compete effectively in its primary Market Area by offering competitive interest rates and loan fees, and a variety of deposit products, and by emphasizing personal customer service.
 
Supervision and Regulation
 
General 
 
The Company and the Bank are subject to an extensive regulatory framework under federal and state law. Consequently, the Company’s growth and earnings performance may be affected by the requirements of federal and state statutes and by regulations and policies of various bank regulatory authorities, including the:

● | Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (“FRB”);
--+----------------------------------------------------------


● | Missouri Division of Finance; (“MDF”);
--+---------------------------------------


● | Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation; and
--+-------------------------------------------


● | Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”).
--+-----------------------------------------------

 
Additionally, the Company’s business may be impacted by assorted laws and rules, including:
 

● | anti-money laundering laws enforced by the U.S. Department of Treasury (Treasury);
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | taxation laws administered by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and state taxing authorities;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | accounting rules developed by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB); and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | securities laws administered by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and state securities authorities.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
 20



Regulatory agencies often have significant discretion regarding their supervisory and enforcement activities. This comprehensive supervisory and regulatory framework significantly impacts the Company’s operations and results. Additionally, new legislation is introduced from time to time that could impact the Company and the Bank in substantial ways and the nature, extent, or impact of new statutes or regulations on the Company’s or the Bank’s operations or financial conditions cannot be predicted with any certainty.
 
Set forth below is a brief summary of certain material laws and regulations applicable to the Company and the Bank. These laws and regulations are primarily intended for the protection of the Bank’s customers and depositors and not for the benefit of the stockholders or creditors of the Company. The following description does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the statutes and regulations described below.
 
Dodd-Frank Act
 
The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (“Dodd-Frank Act” or “Dodd-Frank”) significantly changed the regulatory framework for financial institutions and their holding companies. Among other provisions, the Dodd-Frank Act:
 

● | created the CFPB, which is responsible for implementing, supervising, and enforcing compliance with consumer financial protection laws;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | increased the deposit insurance coverage limit and changed the assessment base for calculating a bank’s deposit insurance assessments;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | repealed the prohibition on payment of interest on demand deposits;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------


● | provided for new disclosures related to executive compensation and corporate governance and prohibited compensation arrangements that encourage inappropriate risks or that could provide excessive compensation;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | imposed new capital requirements on banking institutions (see “New Capital Rules” below);
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | enhanced the authority of the Federal Reserve Board to examine the Company and its non-bank subsidiaries; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | imposed new requirements and restrictions on consumer mortgage banking.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
The Dodd-Frank Act contains numerous provisions scheduled to be implemented through rulemakings by various federal regulatory agencies over a period of several years. Many, but not all, of the regulations have been issued and full implementation of the Dodd-Frank Act is still not complete. This law will continue to significantly influence the regulatory environment in which the Bank and the Company operate. As a result, the Company cannot predict the Dodd-Frank Act’s ultimate impact on the Company or the Bank at this time. Certain rules proposed or adopted under the Dodd-Frank Act are discussed throughout this section.
 
Minimum Capital Requirements
 
In July 2013, the U.S. federal banking agencies approved a final rule to comprehensively revise the regulatory capital framework for the U.S. banking sector, implementing many aspects of the framework agreed to by the International Basel Committee on Bank Supervision and incorporating changes required by the Dodd-Frank Act (the “Basel III Rule”). The capital requirements apply to all banks and savings associations, bank holding companies with more than $3 billion in assets and savings and loan holding companies (other than certain savings and loan holding companies engaged in insurance underwriting and grandfathered diversified holding companies). The Basel III Rule establishes new higher capital ratio requirements, tightens the definition of “capital,” imposes new operating restrictions on banking organizations with insufficient capital buffers, and increases the risk-weighting of certain assets. Cumulatively, these changes result in substantially more demanding capital standards for U.S. banking organizations.
 
 21



The Basel III Rule distinguishes between banking organizations subject to the “advanced approaches” method of computing risk-based regulatory capital, which are those with $250 billion or more in total consolidated assets or $10 billion or more in foreign exposures, and other banking organizations that successfully opt-in (“Advanced Banks”) and other banking organizations, such as the Company and the Bank, which operate under the “standardized approach” (“Standardized Banks”). The new rules became effective for the Company and the Bank on January 1, 2015, with certain requirements to be phased-in between January 2016 and January 2019.
 
The Basel III Rule, among other features:
 

● | Introduces a new capital measure, Common Equity Tier 1 (“CET1” or “Tier 1 Common”), which is defined as common stock instruments, related surplus (net of Treasury stock), and retained earnings, subject to certain regulatory adjustments; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Requires banking institutions to maintain:
--+-------------------------------------------


o | a new minimum ratio of CET1 to risk-weighted assets of at least 4.5% (plus a capital conservation buffer);
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | a minimum amount of Tier 1 capital (the sum of CET1 and Additional Tier 1 capital) to risk-weighted assets of at least 6%, which is an increase from 4% (plus a capital conservation buffer);
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | a total capital (the sum of Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital) ratio of at least 8% of risk-weighted assets (plus a capital conservation buffer); and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | a minimum leverage ratio of Tier 1 capital of 4%. Proposed CBLR to likely add new ratios/will discuss with HUSCH regarding proposal if necessary to discuss here
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
In addition, the Basel III Rule requires that banking organizations maintain a “capital conservation buffer” comprised of CET1 in order to avoid restrictions on the ability to make capital distributions (including dividends and stock purchases) and pay discretionary bonuses to executive officers. The capital conservation buffer is equal to 2.5% of risk-weighted assets, in addition to the minimum CET1, Tier 1, and total capital ratios. The capital conservation buffer will be phased-in beginning at 0.625% of risk-weighted assets on January 1, 2016, and increasing each subsequent year by an additional 0.625%, to reach the final level of 2.5% of risk-weighted assets on January 1, 2019. Accordingly, factoring in the capital conservation buffer, the minimum ratios noted above increase to 7% for CET1, 8.5% for Tier 1 capital, and 10.5% for total capital.
 
Furthermore, the Basel III Rule includes more restrictive definitions for the components of capital. For example, cumulative perpetual preferred stock and trust preferred securities have been phased-out of Tier 1 capital. However, for smaller entities with less than $15 billion in assets as of December 31, 2009, such as the Bank, the final rule permanently grandfathers as Tier 1 capital trust preferred securities and similar instruments issued by such entities prior to May 19, 2010, until such entity exceeds $15 billion in assets. The final Basel III Rule provides entities such as the Company and the Bank with a one time “opt-out” right to continue excluding accumulated other comprehensive income (“AOCI”) from CET1 capital. This opt-out was required to be made in the first quarter of 2015 and the Company and Bank made this election. Accordingly, the Bank and the Company need not include AOCI in CET1 capital going forward. The rule also requires that goodwill and certain other intangible assets, other than mortgage servicing assets, net of associated deferred tax liabilities, be deducted from CET1 capital. Additionally, certain deferred tax assets and mortgage servicing assets must be deducted from CET1 capital if such assets exceed a certain percentage of an institution’s CET1 capital. Generally, greater deductions from CET1 reduce an institution’s capital base.
 
Moreover, the Basel III Rule changes the risk-weightings for certain assets that are used to calculate capital ratios. All else being equal, a higher risk weight results in a higher risk-weighted asset amount which, in turn, gives rise to a lower risk-based capital ratio. The final rule assigns a higher risk-weighting of 150% (up from 100%) for exposures that are more than 90 days past due and assigns a higher risk-weighting of 150% (up from 100%) for high-volatility commercial real estate loans, which are credit facilities that, prior to conversion to permanent financing, finance or have financed the acquisition, development, or construction of real property, subject to certain exclusions. Although initially contemplated, there was no change to the risk-weighting treatment of residential mortgage loans in the final Basel III Rule.
 
 22



Although the Basel III Rule is more stringent than previous capital rules, the Basel III Rule has had minimal impact on the Company and the Bank, to date. The Company and the Bank have a strong capital base and currently maintain adequate capital to meet the new standards.
 
A proposed rule issued on February 8, 2019 by federal banking regulators may provide a simpler method of measuring adequate capital ratios for community banking organizations. The proposal applies to depository institutions and companies holding less than $10 billion in combined assets: (i) meeting risk-based qualifying criteria; and (ii) maintaining a community banking leverage ratio (“CBLR”) of greater than 9 percent.  Under the proposed CBLR rule, qualifying institutions would be eligible to opt into the CBLR framework.  Opting in would mean the institution would need to maintain a ratio of greater than 9 percent and regulators would deem the institution well capitalized under the agencies’ capital rule.  It is unclear if the federal banking regulators will issue a final rule and, even if they do, the final rule may not apply to us and provide relief from federal banking capital requirements.
 
Nonetheless, federal banking guidelines provide that financial institutions experiencing significant growth could be expected to maintain capital levels above the minimum requirements without significant reliance on intangible assets. Additionally, higher capital levels could be required under certain circumstances, such as situations involving interest rate risk, risk from concentrations of credit, or nontraditional activities. Accordingly, the Company and the Bank could be required to maintain higher capital levels in the future even if the federal banking regulators issue a final CBLR rule.
 
Regulation of the Bank
 
General. The Bank, as a Missouri-chartered non-member depository trust company, is primarily regulated by the MDF and FDIC. The Bank is subject to extensive federal and state regulatory oversight in all areas of banking operations, including, but not limited to, lending activities, investments, loans, deposits, interest rates payable on deposits, establishment of branches, corporate restructuring, and capital adequacy. The Bank is also subject to certain reserve requirements promulgated by the FRB.
 
The MDF, in conjunction with the FDIC, regularly examines the Bank and reports to the Bank's Board of Directors on any deficiencies that are found in the Bank's operations. The Bank must also file reports with the MDF and the FDIC concerning its activities and financial condition, in addition to obtaining regulatory approvals prior to entering into certain transactions such as mergers with or acquisitions of other banks or savings institutions. These regulatory authorities have extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities and examination policies. Regulation by these agencies is designed to protect the Bank’s depositors and not the Company’s shareholders.
 
Insurance of Deposit Accounts and Assessments.  The deposit accounts held by the Bank are insured by the DIF, as part of the FDIC. The Dodd-Frank Act permanently increased the maximum amount of deposit insurance for banks, savings institutions, and credit unions to $250,000 per insured depositor, retroactive to January 1, 2009. The Dodd-Frank Act also increased the minimum ratio of net worth to insured deposits of the DIF from 1.15% to 1.35%.
 
A bank's insurance assessment is determined quarterly by multiplying its assessment rate by its assessment base. Per FDIC rules, a bank’s assessment base is the institution’s average consolidated total assets minus its average tangible equity. The FDIC has adopted a risk-based system for assessment rates. For banks with less than $10 billion in assets, such as the Bank, the risk classification is based on the Bank’s capital levels and level of supervisory risk. Assessment rates are subject to adjustment and (1) decrease for issuance of long-term unsecured debt (including senior unsecured debt and subordinated debt); (2) increase for holdings of long-term unsecured or subordinated debt issued by other insured banks; and (3) for banks that are not well-rated or not well-capitalized, increase for significant holdings of brokered deposits.
 
The FDIC may terminate a bank’s deposit insurance if it finds that the institution has engaged in unsafe and unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations, or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, order or condition imposed by the FDIC.
 
Regulatory Capital Requirements and Prompt Corrective Action. The FDIC is required to take prompt corrective action if an insured depository institution, such as the Bank, does not meet its minimum capital requirements. The FDIC has established five capital tiers: “well-capitalized”, “adequately capitalized”, “undercapitalized”, “significantly undercapitalized” and “critically undercapitalized”. A depository institution’s capital tier depends upon its capital levels in relation to various relevant capital measures, which, among others, include a Tier 1 and total risk-based capital measure and a leverage ratio capital measure. The Prompt Corrective Action rules were amended effective January 1, 2015 to incorporate changes under the Basel III Rule, including the CET1 requirements, and to raise capital requirements for certain categories. An insured financial institution is considered:

● | “Well-capitalized” if it has a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 5% or greater, a CET1 to risk-based capital ratio of 6.5% or greater, a Tier 1 to risk-based capital ratio of 8% or greater, a total risk-based capital ratio of 10% or greater and is not subject to any written agreement, order, capital directive, or prompt corrective action directive;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
 23




● | “Adequately capitalized” if it has it has a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 4% or greater, a CET1 to risk-based capital ratio of 4.5% or greater, a Tier 1 to risk-based capital ratio of 6% or greater, and a total risk-based capital ratio of 8% or greater;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | “Undercapitalized” if it has a Tier 1 leverage ratio of less than 4%, a CET1 to risk-based capital ratio of less than 4.5%, a Tier 1 to risk-based capital ratio of less than 6% and a total risk-based capital ratio of less than 8%;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | “Significantly undercapitalized” if it has a Tier 1 leverage ratio of less than 3%, a CET1 to risk-based capital ratio of less than 3%, a Tier 1 to risk-based capital ratio of less than 4%, and a total risk-based capital ratio of less than 6%; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | “Critically undercapitalized” if it has a tangible equity capital to total assets ratio equal to or less than 2%.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
The FDIC may, under certain circumstances, reclassify a well-capitalized insured depository institution as adequately capitalized. It is also permitted to require an adequately capitalized or undercapitalized institution to comply with supervisory provisions as if the institution were in the next lower category (but not treat a significantly undercapitalized institution as critically undercapitalized) based on supervisory information other than the capital levels of the institution. An institution may be reclassified if the FDIC determines (after notice and opportunity for hearing) that the institution is in an unsafe or unsound condition or deems the institution to be engaging in an unsafe or unsound practice.
 
Federal banking agencies are required to take prompt corrective action to resolve capital deficiencies at insured depository institutions. Failure to meet the capital guidelines could subject a bank to a variety of enforcement actions, including the issuance of a capital directive, prohibition on paying dividends or management fees, prohibition on accepting brokered deposits, and restrictions on paying bonuses or increasing compensation for executive officers. For critically undercapitalized institutions, a receiver may be appointed.
 
The Bank met its minimum capital adequacy guidelines, and the Bank was categorized as “well-capitalized”, as of December 31, 2018. Applicable capital and ratio information is contained under the section titled “Regulatory Matters” in Note 1 to the “Notes of the Consolidated Financial Statements” in this report.
 
Safety and Soundness Standards. The federal bank regulators have adopted guidelines to promote the safety and soundness of federally insured depository institutions. The guidelines set forth standards for internal controls, information systems and internal audit systems, loan documentation, credit underwriting, interest-rate-risk exposure, asset growth, asset quality, earnings, stock valuation and compensation, fees and benefits and other operational and managerial standards. The guidelines provide standards in each area and an institution must establish its own procedures to achieve such goals.
 
If an institution fails to meet a standard, a regulator may require the institution to submit an acceptable plan to achieve compliance with the standard. If an institution fails to submit an acceptable plan or fails to implement an accepted plan, an agency must, by order, require the institution to correct the deficiency. The agency may, and in some cases must, take other supervisory actions until the deficiency has been corrected.
 
Federal Home Loan Bank System. The Bank is a member of the FHLB of Des Moines, which is one of 11 regional FHLBs. The FHLB system’s primary purpose is to provide stable funding to member institutions that such institutions in turn use to make loans to families, farms and businesses. The FHLBs are overseen by the Federal Housing Finance Agency (“FHFA”). As a member, the Bank is required to purchase and maintain a minimum investment in the stock of the FHLB. As of December 31, 2018, the Bank was in compliance with this requirement.
Dividend Limitations. The amount of dividends that the Bank may pay is subject to various regulatory limitations. Under federal law, an FDIC-insured institution may not pay dividends if it is undercapitalized or if payment would cause it to be undercapitalized. If the FDIC believes that a bank is engaged in, or about to engage in, an unsafe or unsound practice, the FDIC may require, after notice and hearing, that the bank cease and desist from that practice. In addition, under Missouri law, the Bank may pay dividends to the Company only from a portion of its undivided profits and may not pay dividends if its capital is impaired. Additionally, under Missouri statute, dividends paid by the Bank are restricted by a statutory formula, which provides for the maintenance of a surplus fund and prohibits the payment of dividends which would impair the surplus fund.
 
 24



Anti-Money Laundering and Anti-Terrorism Regulation. The Bank Secrecy Act (“BSA”) establishes the framework for anti-money laundering (“AML”) obligations imposed on U.S. financial institutions. The purpose of the BSA is to prevent banks and other financial services providers from being used as intermediaries for, or to hide the transfer or deposit of money derived from, drug trafficking, money laundering, and other crimes. The Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001 (“USA Patriot Act”) amended the BSA and imposes a number of obligations on banks, including the requirement to implement policies, procedures and controls reasonably designed to detect and report instances of money laundering and terrorism financing. The USA Patriot Act also requires financial institutions to develop written customer identification programs. In addition, the U.S. Department of Treasury’s Office of Foreign Asset Controls (“OFAC”) administers and enforces economic and trade sanctions based on U.S. foreign policy and national security against entities such as targeted foreign countries and terrorists.
 
Consumer Protection Laws.  In connection with its banking activities, the Bank is subject to a number of federal and state laws designed to protect consumers in their transactions with banks. These laws include, but are not limited to, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act (“ECOA”), Fair Credit Reporting Act (“FCRA”), Fair and Accurate Credit Transaction Act of 2003 (“FACTA”), Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (“GLBA”), Electronic Funds Transfer Act (“EFTA”), Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (“HMDA”), Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (“RESPA”), and Truth in Lending Act (“TILA”), and their various state counterparts. In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act prohibits unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts or practices (“UDAAP”). Moreover, several federal laws, including GLBA, FCRA, and FACTA, regulate consumer financial privacy and restrict the sharing of consumer financial information.  The Bank also must comply with various state statutes related to maintaining the security of consumer financial information and take steps to prevent and report data breaches if they arise.
 
Transactions with Affiliates and Insiders. Federal law imposes certain limitations on the ability of a bank to engage in “covered transactions” with affiliates. The Company is an affiliate of the Bank for purposes of these restrictions. The definition of “covered transactions,” which was expanded under the Dodd-Frank Act, includes extensions of credit to affiliates, investments in stock or other securities of affiliates, and acceptance of the stock or other securities of an affiliate as collateral for loans. Additionally, federal law prohibits institutions from engaging in certain transactions with affiliates unless the transactions are on terms substantially the same as, or at least as favorable to the Bank as, those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with non-affiliated companies. Federal law also restricts the Bank’s ability to extend credit to its executive officers, directors, principal shareholders, and their related interests, including that such credit extensions must be made on substantially the same terms, including interest rate and collateral, as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with unrelated third parties, and not involve more than the normal risk of repayment or present other unfavorable features.
 
Transaction Account Reserve Requirements. The FRB requires insured depository institutions to maintain reserves against specified deposit liabilities. Reservable liabilities consist of net transaction accounts, non-personal time deposits, and Eurocurrency liabilities. For 2018, the first $16.0 million of otherwise reservable balances are exempt from the reserve requirements; the reserve requirement is 3% for net transaction accounts between $16.0 million and $122.3 million; and the reserve requirement is 10% for net transaction accounts in excess of $122.3 million. These reserve requirements are subject to annual adjustment.
Commercial Real Estate Lending. The Bank may be subject to greater scrutiny from federal banking regulators based on its concentration of commercial real estate (“CRE”) loans. Federal regulators have issued guidance to address concerns about CRE concentrations and to provide expectations for managing a concentrated portfolio. The guidance includes development and construction loans for which repayment is dependent upon the sale of the property, as well as properties for which repayment is dependent upon rental income.
 
Per the guidance, institutions that may have significant CRE concentration risk are those that have experienced rapid growth in CRE lending, have notable exposures to a specific type of CRE, or are approaching or exceed the following supervisory criteria: (i) total loans for construction, land development, and other land represent 100% or more of the institution’s total capital; or (ii) total CRE loans represent 300% or more of the institution’s total capital, and the outstanding balance of the institution’s CRE loan portfolio has increased by 50% or more during the prior 36 months. If a bank’s portfolio goes outside of these general guidelines, the bank must engage in heightened risk management practices. 
 
Residential Real Estate Lending. The CFPB has issued rules implementing several Dodd-Frank requirements regarding residential mortgage lending. Lenders must assess a borrower’s ability to repay the mortgage-related obligation and must consider certain underwriting factors. Lenders also receive certain protections from liability if they make “qualified mortgages.” Additionally, new rules prohibit certain loan features, such as negative amortization, interest-only payment, balloon payments, and restrict points and fees paid by a borrower and prepayment penalties.”  CFPB also issued servicing standards applying to mortgage servicers generally but in particular with defaulted loans.

Volcker Rule. The Volcker Rule, issued by the federal banking and securities regulators pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, generally prohibits insured depository institutions and their affiliated companies from: (i) short-term proprietary trading in securities and other financial instruments; and (ii) sponsoring or acquiring or retaining an ownership interest in private equity and hedge funds, subject to certain exceptions.
Community Reinvestment Act. Under the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 (“CRA”), the Bank has a continuing and affirmative obligation, consistent with safe and sound operation, to help meet the credit needs of its communities, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods. As part of its examinations, the FDIC evaluates the Bank’s record in meeting these obligations. CRA ratings are also taken into account by regulators in evaluating applications for mergers, acquisitions, or to open a new branch or facility. Based on its most recent CRA compliance examinations, the Bank has received a “Satisfactory” CRA rating.
 
Regulation of the Company
 
General. The Company is a registered bank holding company subject to regulation and supervision by the FRB under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 (“BHCA”). The Company is required to file periodic reports of its operations with the FRB. Additionally, the Company is legally obligated to act as a source of strength to the Bank and to commit resources to support the Bank.
Restrictions on Dividends and Stock Repurchases. The Company’s source of funds (including cash flow to pay dividends to stockholders) is dividends paid to it by the Bank. The right of the Company to receive dividends or other distributions from the Bank is subject to the prior claims of creditors of the Bank, including depositors, and applicable regulatory restrictions, including prior approval in certain situations.
 
The amount of dividends that the Company may pay is subject to various regulatory limitations, including the requirement to maintain adequate capital. Financial institutions are generally prohibited from paying dividends if, following payment of dividends, the institution would be considered undercapitalized. Additionally, under the Basel III Rule, institutions seeking to pay dividends must maintain the required capital conservation buffer. Also, the FRB strongly encourages financial institutions to consult with the agency prior to paying dividends. The FRB has indicated that a board of directors should “eliminate, defer, or severely limit” dividends if:
 

● | the bank holding company’s net income available to shareholders for the past four quarters, net of dividends paid during that period, is not sufficient to fully fund the dividends;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the bank holding company’s rate of earnings retention is inconsistent with capital needs and overall macroeconomic outlook; or
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the bank holding company will not meet, or is in danger of not meeting, its minimum regulatory capital adequacy ratios.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Banking regulators also have the authority to prohibit banks and bank holding companies from paying a dividend if such payment would be an unsafe or unsound practice.
 
Generally, a bank holding company must notify the FRB prior to the purchase or redemption of its outstanding equity securities if the gross consideration for the purchase or redemption, when aggregated with the net consideration paid for all such purchases during the preceding twelve months is equal to 10% or more of the bank holding company’s consolidated net worth. Prior approval may not be required if the bank holding company, among other things, will meet or exceed “well capitalized” thresholds both before and after the repurchase, is considered “well managed,” and is not subject to any unresolved supervisory issues. Additionally, bank holding companies are expected to consult with the FRB before redeeming or repurchasing stock if:
 

● | the bank holding company is at “significant risk” of developing a financial weakness;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the bank holding company is considering expansion (either acquisition or new activities); and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
 26




● | if such redemption or repurchase will cause a net reduction in capital from the beginning of the quarter in which the redemption or repurchase occurs.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
The FRB may disapprove of the purchase or redemption if it determines, among other things, that the proposal would constitute an unsafe or unsound business practice.
 
Support of Banking Subsidiaries. Under FRB policy, the Company is expected to act as a source of financial strength to the Bank and, where required, to commit resources to support the Bank. Financial support from the Company may be required even when the Company might not otherwise be inclined to provide it. Moreover, if the Bank should become undercapitalized, the Company would be required to guarantee the Bank's compliance with its capital restoration plan in order for such plan to be accepted by the FDIC.
Acquisitions, Activities, and Changes in Control. Under the BHCA, the Company must obtain the prior approval of the FRB before the Company may: (i) acquire substantially all the assets of a bank; (ii) acquire direct or indirect ownership or control of more than 5% of the voting shares of any bank; or (iii) or merge or consolidate with any other bank holding company. The BHCA also restricts the Company’s ability to acquire direct or indirect ownership or control of 5% or more of any class of voting shares of any nonbanking corporation. The FRB is required to consider the financial and managerial resources and future prospects of the bank holding companies and banks concerned and the convenience and needs of the community to be served. Consideration of financial resources generally focuses on capital adequacy. Consideration of convenience and needs includes the involved institutions’ performance under the CRA. The FRB may not approve a transaction if it would result in or tend to create a monopoly, substantially lessen competition, or otherwise function as a restraint of trade, unless the anti-competitive effects are clearly outweighed by the public interest in meeting the needs and convenience of the community to be served.
 
Additionally, FRB approval is required prior to any person or company acquiring “control” of a bank holding company. “Control” is conclusively presumed to exist if a person or company acquires 25% or more of the outstanding voting shares of a bank holding company. There is a rebuttable presumption of control if a person or company acquires more than 10% but less than 25% of any class of voting securities.
 
Moreover, bank holding companies are generally prohibited from engaging in any business other than that of banking, managing, and controlling banks or furnishing services to banks and their subsidiaries, although bank holding companies are permitted to engage in activities that are determined to be “closely related to banking” and “a proper incident thereto.”
 
Transactions with Affiliates. As discussed above, federal regulations restrict the extent to which the Company and its officers and directors may engage in certain “covered transactions” with the Bank, including borrowing or otherwise obtaining credit from or selling assets or securities to the Bank. Additionally, any transactions that are “covered transactions” with the Bank must be on nonpreferential terms.
Federal Securities Regulation and Corporate Governance. The Company’s stock is registered with the SEC and, therefore, the Company is subject to SEC restrictions and requirements, including rules regarding information sharing, proxy solicitation, and insider trading.
 
The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (“SOX”) addresses, among other issues, corporate governance, auditing and accounting, executive compensation, and enhanced and timely disclosure of corporate information. Per SOX, the Company’s Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and Chief Financial Officer (CFO) are required to certify that the quarterly and annual reports do not contain any untrue statement of a material fact. The SEC’s rules regarding CEO and CFO certifications require these officers to certify, among others, that: (i) they are responsible for establishing, maintaining and regularly evaluating the effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting; (ii) they have made certain disclosures to auditors and the audit committee of the board of directors; and (iii) they have included information in quarterly and annual reports about their evaluation and whether there have been changes in internal controls over financial reporting or in other factors that could materially affect internal control over financial reporting.
 
The Dodd-Frank Act provides other investor protections, corporate governance, and executive compensation requirements that affect U.S. publicly traded companies. For example, the Dodd-Frank Act requires companies to give shareholders a non-binding vote approving executive compensation and “golden parachute” payments. Pursuant to the Dodd Frank Act, in July 2015, the SEC proposed a rule that companies whose securities are listed on national securities exchanges and associations (including the Company whose securities are listed on the NASDAQ Global Market) would be required to develop and enforce recovery policies that, in the event of an accounting restatement, would “claw back” from current and former executive officers incentive-based compensation they should not have received based on the restatement.  Recovery would be required without regard to fault and without regard to whether any misconduct occurred in connection with or an executive officer’s responsibility for the erroneous misstatement.  The proposed rules would also require disclosure of listed companies’ recovery policies, and their actions under those policies.  The proposed rules are not yet final.
 
Tax Reform. In the fourth quarter of 2017 the Company re-measured its deferred tax assets and liabilities as a result of the enactment of the new tax law "H.R.1," originally known as the "Tax Cuts and Jobs Act" (the "Tax Reform Legislation").  The enactment occurred on December 22, 2017.  The Tax Reform Legislation became effective January 1, 2018 and modifies the tax law in many ways.  The centerpiece of the Tax Reform Legislation is the reduction of the federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%.  All deferred tax items as of December 22, 2017 needed to be re-valued using the new federal corporate income tax rate of 21%.  As a result, income tax expense recorded in 2017 included a $1.0 million reduction to deferred tax assets. The impact of the Tax Reform Legislation on the Company’s 2017 financial results are not necessarily indicative of the results to be achieved in any future periods.
