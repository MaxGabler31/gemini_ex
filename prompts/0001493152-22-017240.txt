ITEM 1. BUSINESS.
 
Sharing Services Global Corporation (“Sharing Services”) and its subsidiaries (collectively, the “Company”) aim to build shareholder value by developing or investing in innovative emerging businesses and technologies that augment the Company’s products and services portfolio, business competencies, and geographic reach.
 
In March 2021, Sharing Services changed its fiscal year-end from a fiscal year ending on April 30th to a fiscal year ending on March 31st. In connection with this change, the Company decided not to restate the information reported for prior accounting periods, because: (a) the Company’s businesses are not inherently seasonal, (b) the change in fiscal years did not otherwise materially distort comparability of the Company’s results of operations and cash flows, and (c) the cost to restate the data reported for prior periods outweighs the usefulness of such restated data. Accordingly, the consolidated financial statements included herein reflect the results of operations and cash flows for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2022 (365 days) compared to the eleven months ended March 31, 2021 (335 days). The Company’s Common Stock is traded, under the symbol “SHRG,” in the OTCQB Market, an over-the-counter trading platforms market operated by OTC Markets Group Inc.
 
Our History
 
Sharing Services was originally incorporated under the name Sharing Services, Inc. on April 24, 2015. In December 2017, the Company, through its U.S.-based subsidiaries, launched its Elevate brand of health and wellness products.
 
In January 2019, Sharing Services, Inc. changed its corporate name to Sharing Services Global Corporation to better reflect the Company’s strategic intent to grow its business globally. In connection with the name change, the Company adopted the trading symbol SHRG effective April 4, 2019. Prior to this, the Company’s Common Stock traded under the trading symbol SHRV.
 
In February 2021, the Company rebranded its product offerings under the new marketing banner, “The Happy Co TM,” to capitalize on its vision that Everyone Deserves to be Happy. As part of this business initiative, the Company updated its customer messaging to re-emphasize the Company’s core values, including, among others: “harnessing the power of happiness;” “offering products you love;” “achieving more together;” and “offering products by people, for people.”
 
In June 2021, the Company expanded its geographical footprint, and through its wholly owned subsidiary, commenced operations in the Republic of Korea (South Korea).
 
Strategic Growth Initiatives
 
The Company intends to grow its business by pursuing a multipronged growth strategy, that includes: (a) expanding its product offerings, both within the health and wellness category and in new product categories, (b) expanding its direct-to consumer geographic footprint (primarily in Asia), and (c) launching its membership-based consumer travel products line worldwide. This growth strategy may also include the use of strategic acquisitions of businesses that augment the Company’s product and services portfolio, business competencies and geographic reach.
Key Global Industry and Business Trends
 
We believe the following industry and business trends will provide opportunities for the Company to grow its business in a sustained manner in the future:
 

● | The Global direct selling industry is strong. According to the World Federation of Direct Selling Associations (“WFDSA”), worldwide industry sales exceeded $179 billion in 2020, with the Americas and Asia accounting for more than $141 billion in sales.

--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The level of interest in the direct selling industry is high among younger sectors of the population. Over 70% of the people involved in direct selling, in the U.S. and worldwide, were between the ages of 20 and 54, according to the WFDSA and the DSA. By comparison, the U.S. Census Bureau estimates that persons in this age group make up about 46% of the overall 2020 U.S. population.

● | Participation in the industry by women is high. For example, women made up approximately 74% of the people involved in direct selling in 2020, in the U.S. and worldwide, according to the WFDSA and the DSA. By comparison, the U.S. Census Bureau estimates that women make up about 51% of the overall 2020 U.S. population.

● | The initial costs and business risks in direct selling are relatively lower. According to “2020 Consumer Attitudes & Entrepreneurship Study,” published by the DSA, the required start-up costs and business risks associated with direct selling in the U.S. are lower than those for most competing entrepreneurial business opportunities. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Business Segments, Geographic Area Information and Seasonality
 
The Company currently operates in two business segments: (a) the sale of health and wellness products through an independent sales force and (b) the sale of other products and services, including third-party skincare products, and services sold on a subscription basis. During the fiscal years ended March 31, 2022, and 2021, substantially all and approximately 97%, respectively, of the Company’s consolidated sales were from its health and wellness products. 
 
During the fiscal years ended March 31, 2022, and 2021, 87% and 94%, respectively, of the Company’s consolidated sales were made to customers and independent contractor distributors located in the United States (the “U.S.”). See Note 19 - “BUSINESS SEGMENT AND GEOGRAPHIC AREA INFORMATION” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 — “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this Annual Report for more details.
 
While the Company’s business generally is not highly seasonal, sales activity is normally slower during November and December, when many customers and independent contractor distributors in the U.S. traditionally take a holiday break.
 
Competition 
 
The health and wellness products industry is highly competitive and growing, and there are few barriers to entering the industry. Our competitors include a wide range of retailers, including traditional retail stores that offer their products in “brick and mortar” outlets and/or online, and e-commerce-based retailers. These retailers include, among other, CVS Health Corporation (Pharmacies), GNC Holdings (a specialty retailer), Target Corporation, The Vitamin Shoppe, Walgreens Boots Alliance (Pharmacies) and Walmart.
 
The direct selling industry is highly fragmented and competitive, and there are few barriers to entering the industry. We compete with other direct selling businesses, including many that have a longer operating history, higher visibility and name recognition, and more financial resources than we do. Among others, these network marketing companies include Amway Corporation, Avon Products, Herbalife Nutrition, Mary Kay, Nature’s Sunshine Products, The Body Shop, Nu Skin Enterprises and Youngevity International.
 
We compete in these marketplaces by emphasizing differentiators such as our access to exclusive products and ingredients, the quality and efficacy of our product offerings, the reliability and convenience of our distribution system, and a personalized customer service experience. We offer products and services that aim to improve the health and happiness of our customers and distributors. In addition, our direct selling business model, provides our independent contractor distributors the opportunity to build wealth by growing and operating of their own distribution business.
 
We also compete with other direct selling organizations in our efforts to attract and retain our independent contractor distributors by emphasizing the strengths of our product line, entrepreneurship and leadership training, a comprehensive sales compensation plan, a strong marketing focus, positive corporate values, and strong management leadership.
 
Competitive Strengths
 
We believe the following competitive strengths differentiate us from our competitors and will help drive our future growth:
 

● | A strong management team consisting of senior and middle management professionals with significant direct selling industry and global business experience. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | A strong financial foundation, including cash and cash equivalents of $17.0 million and $12.1 million as of March 31, 2022, and 2021, respectively. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | An exclusive line of Nootropic products sourced through one or more exclusive strategic partnerships and not available through traditional sales channels. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Best in class marketing process that focuses on the nutritional value and/or other health benefits of our health and wellness products. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Our ability to offer our industry-exclusive brands directly to consumers using a friendly, highly trained entrepreneurial sales force. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Our 30-day, “full customer satisfaction or your money back” product return policy.

The Company’s health and wellness product line consists of Nootropics, natural products aimed at improving the health and happiness of its customers and distributors. We aim to grow health and wellness product offerings by developing, acquiring, and introducing new products and services. In each of the fiscal years ended March 31, 2022, and 2021, substantially all and approximately 97%, respectively, of the Company’s consolidated sales were from its health and wellness products.

Sales and Marketing
 
We rely on a direct selling model consisting of independent contractor distributors and on customer referrals to promote and sell a majority of our products. We believe this is an effective selling model since our independent contractor distributors can educate consumers about our products in person, provide testimonials, and provide higher levels of customer support, compared to more traditional selling models. The Company also markets and sells its products and services using its proprietary websites, including: www.elevacity.com and www.thehappyco.com.
 
We provide support to our independent contractor distributors with marketing content, websites, events, and technology. We offer our products online and provide our independent distributors with a virtual online Back Office website. This website is where independent distributors can manage, monitor, and operate their businesses 24 hours a day from any location. In addition, we actively communicate with our independent distributors about new products, price changes, policy changes, recruiting opportunities, sales promotions, and other important matters via electronic mail, by phone and during our sales conventions. Sales conventions are currently held once or twice a year and are attended or viewed digitally by a significant number of our current independent distributors and prospective independent distributors. Each sales convention includes the participation of one or more key personalities, including social media influencers, engaged in promoting our products and services. In addition, each sales convention is attended by members of our executive team, providing an opportunity for our sales force to learn about new business initiatives, new products, and other matters relevant to their businesses.
 
As part of our efforts to protect our customers, distributors, employees, and other business partners during the recent COVID pandemic, in 2020, the Company transitioned its sales conventions to a digital format only. In 2022, the Company resumed holding in-person sales events and conventions when it is safe to do so. The Company anticipates resuming the use of all sales conventions in person in the foreseeable future, as the threat of the health emergency fully subsides.
 
Product Distribution
 
Currently, distribution and delivery of our products in the U.S., Canada, and the southern Pacific region is handled primarily by our distribution center in Addison, Texas. On the other hand, sales, distribution, and delivery of our products in Asia is handled by our South Korean subsidiary.
 
We intend to grow, in part, by also offering and distributing our products to customers in additional geographic areas outside the U.S. As product sales reach critical mass levels, we anticipate expanding distribution of our products by facilities, including facilities operated by independent logistics partners, located outside the U..S.
 
Retail Customers and Independent Contractor Distributors 
 
The Company distributes its products through two distribution channels: (1) sales to our retail customers – consumers that buy our products from a distributor or through one of our websites, for personal use and (2) sales to our independent contractor distributors that buy product for resale or for personal use. The Company’s goal is to monitor and grow both sales channels using different strategies. To grow our retail customer base, we offer high-quality, unique products. Our strategy for growing our sales force of independent distributors includes providing a meaningful business opportunity to them, a competitive sales compensation plan, sales incentives, and volume-based bonuses, as further discussed below.
 
Any person may join the Company as a distributor, or Brand Partner, by purchasing a Virtual Business System (“VBS”) for $49.00. This kit includes the training and basic marketing materials which better enables our sales force to sell our products and build their organization. Independent distributors may then purchase products for personal use or to build their sales organization. No product purchases are required upon enrollment.

Distributor Agreement and Compensation
 
Our distributors are independent contractors, and the Company does not direct or control their efforts. However, the Company requires its distributors to abide by its policies and procedures, and to comply with all applicable laws and regulations. To become a distributor an individual must affirmatively accept our standard Distributor Agreement as well as our Distributor Policies and Procedures. These documents govern the relationship between the Company and each independent distributor. The Distributor Policies and Procedures outline the scope of permissible marketing activities, and the Distributor Agreement defines the relationship between the distributor and the Company. Our policies and procedures require that our distributors present our products, as well as the business opportunity, both ethically and professionally.
 
We believe that our compensation plan offers our independent distributors an exciting and effective way to earn commissions. All our distributors can earn commissions when they sell our products to their retail customers or their downline independent distributors. Additionally, they can earn commissions when their own personally sponsored distributors (or downline) sell products to end users. There is no limit as to the number of personally enrolled distributors or retail customers that an independent distributor may have.
 
Each distributor begins by purchasing a VBS. The VBS includes the training and basic marketing materials which better enables our sales force to sell our products and build their organization. No commissions or bonuses are paid for enrolling other distributors.
 
Additionally, each month, our top producing distributors may also earn commission based on the sales levels achieved by such distributor and his/her downline. This bonus commission is designed to compensate them for mentoring, training, and developing the distributors in their downline.
 
The Company’s compensation plan is designed to promote customer acquisition and retention. The Company provides a back-office website for our independent distributors to use in their ecommerce sales, but an affiliate may also sell directly to their customers.
 
We rely upon our independent distributors to create customer demand and sales. We believe our plan is successful in helping to attract and motivate our sales force and key industry leaders. Please see ITEM 1A. – “RISK FACTORS” – “The dependence of some of our subsidiaries upon a direct selling business model to sell our products, and the highly competitive and dynamic nature of the direct selling industry” and “Our subsidiaries’ ability to attract and retain independent distributors; the ability of a distributor to successfully perform his or her role; and the potential adverse impact of the loss of a high-level distributor or a significant number of distributors for causes out of our subsidiaries’ control” below for more information.
 
Full Customer Satisfaction Product Return Policy
 
If a consumer is not completely satisfied with the products they purchased, we offer a full refund, or exchange of the product, for items returned within 30 days from the date of purchase. For products purchased by our independent distributors, we also offer a generous product return policy that allows our distributors to get full credit for unopened and resalable items returned for up to 30 days from the date of purchase, generally subject to a customary restocking fee.
Trademarks and Other Intellectual Property 
 
We have obtained 22 trademark registrations issued by the United States Patent and Trademark Office. We anticipate obtaining additional U.S. trademark registrations in the future, in connection with the 34 applications presently pending.
 
In addition, we intend to file for trademark protection in jurisdictions outside the U.S. where we market and distribute or intend to market and distribute our products, including, among others, in Canada, Australia, New Zealand, South Korea, Singapore, Malaysia, Japan, Thailand, and the Philippines. Trademark protection is increasingly important to our growing business.
 
Several of our products are manufactured under formulations and processes owned by some of our key vendors. Some of our key vendors have registered or applied for patent registrations to maintain exclusivity over the ingredients, formulation and processes, and the integrated products they supply to us. Such potential patents, the underlying ingredients, formulation and processes, and integrated products are material to the Company’s business. The Company reserves the right to join in any future actions to defend against any infringement on such patents that could adversely affect the products the Company sells. If our vendors and us were unsuccessful in protecting such intellectual property rights, this could have a material adverse effect on our business. Please see ITEM 1A. – “RISK FACTORS” – “Our dependence on one supplier for a substantial portion of the products we sell and the potential for material disruptions in our supply chain or potential increases in the prices of the products we purchase beyond what we can pass along to our customers” below for more information.
 
To protect our own intellectual property and proprietary processes that are material to the long-term health and profitability of the Company, we maintain disciplined business practices to manage trade secrets and use various forms of confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements. We consider trademark protection to be very important to our business and utilize an internal compliance team to closely monitor the usage of our intellectual property. Please see ITEM 1A. – “RISK FACTORS” – “The success of our efforts to register our trademarks and to protect certain intellectual property rights” below for more information.

Strategic Supply Chain Partnerships
 
We strive to maintain positive relationships with key business partners to ensure the continuous manufacturing, supply, and quality of our products. In the fiscal year ended March 31, 2022, and 2021, product purchases from one supplier accounted for 64% and 99%, respectively, of our product purchases. Please see ITEM 1A. – “RISK FACTORS” – “Our dependence on one supplier for a substantial portion of the products we sell and the potential for material disruptions in our supply chain or potential increases in the prices of the products we purchase beyond what we can pass along to our customers.”
 
We intend to grow, in part, by also offering and distributing our products to customers in geographic areas outside the U.S. As product sales reach critical mass levels, we anticipate expanding manufacturing and distribution of our products by facilities, including facilities operated by independent logistics partners, located outside the U.S.
 
Regulatory Environment
 
Our business is regulated by various federal, state, and local governmental agencies in the U.S. and by similar agencies in Canada and other jurisdictions in which we market and sell our products. These laws and regulations are related to: (a) the manufacturing, labeling, distribution, and sale of our products; (b) product claims and advertising; and (c) our network marketing program.
Regulation of Direct Selling Activities
 
In the United States, direct selling programs are subject to a variety of federal and state regulations governed by the United States Federal Trade Commission (the “FTC”) or a similar state agency. These regulations are generally intended to protect consumers from fraudulent or deceptive sales practices. They also ensure that product sales are made to the ultimate consumers and that compensation within the organization is made based upon actual sales transactions, rather than upon recruitment into the organization.
 
The Company monitors and, if necessary, responds to regulatory developments that may adversely affect its network marketing program. We believe the Company is in material compliance with all applicable laws and regulations relating to direct selling activities in the United States and other countries where we operate.
 
Regulation of Personal Care and Nutritional Food Products
 
Personal care and nutritional food products (including the products we sell) and certain related marketing and advertising practices are subject to governmental regulation by various federal, state, and local government agencies and other authorities in the U.S., Canada, and other jurisdictions where we market and distribute or intend to market and distribute our products in the future. These agencies and authorities include the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”), the FTC, the Consumer Product Safety Commission, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, and various similar state and Canadian regulatory agencies. To date, we have not experienced any governmental actions related to health or safety, or food and drug regulations regarding our products.
 
The FDA regulates both finished dietary supplement products (including health and wellness products such as ours) and dietary ingredients. Dietary supplements are specifically regulated under the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994 (the DSHEA). Under the DSHEA, manufacturers and distributors of dietary supplements are prohibited from marketing products that are adulterated or misbranded. Generally, such regulations apply prior to a product reaching the market. Once a product reaches the market, the FDA is responsible for taking enforcement action against any product found to be an adulterated or misbranded dietary supplement. Unlike medications, dietary supplements and dietary ingredients, such as those sold by the Company, do not require FDA approval before such products can be marketed and sold.
 
The FTC, which enforces consumer protection laws regarding truth in advertising, and similar state and foreign agencies regulate how we advertise and market our products. The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission, and similar state and foreign agencies, seek to protect the public from unreasonable risks of injuries or death associated with consumer products. In the U.S., Canada and other jurisdictions where we operate, our products are also subject to laws and regulations concerning product formulation, labeling and packaging. These laws and regulations often require us to, among other things, conform product labeling to local language and content description requirements, register or qualify the products with the applicable government authorities, or obtain approvals or file required notifications prior to marketing such products within certain jurisdictions. Many of the jurisdictions where we operate also regulate product capability claims and advertising content. These regulations control the type of claims and representations that can be made regarding the capabilities of products. For example, in the United States, it is unlawful to make claims that nutritional supplements will help diagnose, cure, mitigate, treat, or prevent disease. Please see ITEM 1A. – “RISK FACTORS” – “Our ability to comply with current consumer product laws and regulations or our becoming subject to new or more stringent consumer product laws and regulations in the future” below for more information.
