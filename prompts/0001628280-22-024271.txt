ITEM 1.    BUSINESS
Overview
Ideanomics is an operating company incorporated in 2004 under the laws of the State of Nevada. Our evolution has been driven by technological innovation and numerous strategic acquisitions of businesses to act as our operating subsidiaries that expanded our product offerings and complemented our existing solutions. Currently, Ideanomics conducts its operations globally in one segment with two business units – Ideanomics Mobility and Ideanomics Capital. Ideanomics Mobility has as its mission the acceleration of commercial adoption of electric vehicles. Ideanomics Capital is the Company’s fintech business unit, which focuses on leveraging technology and innovation to improve efficiency, transparency, and profitability for the financial services industry.
Principal Products or Services and Their Markets
Ideanomics Mobility
Description
The Ideanomics Mobility business unit is seeking to accelerate the commercial adoption of electric vehicles. The Company’s EV and technology acquisitions during 2021 completed the foundation for the development of four product-focused verticals comprised of off-highway, two-wheeler, on-highway, and associated energy and charging services. This integrated offering helps support business progress toward its mission of offering fleet operators the convenience of a range of vehicles and associated charging systems through a single procurement partner. 
By combining leading EV technologies, products, knowledge, and capabilities across the Company’s four product verticals, Ideanomics anticipates that it will be able to rapidly develop unique zero emission mobility solutions in both the off-highway and on-highway commercial vehicle markets. These include the provision of commercial electric vans, trucks, and buses, electric tractors, and two-wheeled transportation, supported by the provision of energy services and infrastructure for the EV market consisting of charging systems, energy storage, energy generation, including hydrogen and solar, and associated data and management applications. These will be supported by financing programs that have been developed to enable commercial fleet operators to migrate away from gasoline and diesel-powered vehicles with minimal disruption to their business models and balance sheet. Together, these products and services will provide the Company with the capability to assist commercial fleet operators to transition with confidence to BEV and FCEV and meet their zero-emission objectives.
By choosing the integrated platform approach from Ideanomics Mobility, the commercial fleet operator will benefit from a single source solution that supports all aspects of the transition to EV, from early-stage requirements analysis, charging infrastructure specification and installation, vehicle procurement and deployment, training, vehicle- and charging-derived data management, operationalization management services, and financing.
To support the cost of transition from fossil fuels to BEV and FCEV, Ideanomics will offer fleet operators the complete financial and management support to confidently migrate from traditional CapEx models to an OpEx model, releasing capital to support traditional business growth and have the simplicity, predictability, and certainty of a monthly subscription which covers all aspects of EV fleet operations. These programs will also have the added advantage of providing Ideanomics with predictable recurring revenues. These MaaS solutions are comprised of financing programs we refer to as VaaS and CaaS.
To support the Company’s operations, in late 2021 Ideanomics entered a lease agreement for a 48,500 square foot facility in New Jersey, which will serve as a center of excellence for Ideanomics Mobility and for promoting education and advocacy of electric and hydrogen powered vehicles to commercial fleet operators. Anticipated to come online in late 2022, the facility will showcase the Ideanomics Mobility products and services and serve as a regional support center on the East Coast of the United States for Ideanomics Mobility’s operating businesses’ activities in North America.
Operating Companies
There are six operating companies within the Ideanomics Mobility business unit” (i) WAVE, (ii) Solectrac, (iii) US Hybrid, (iv) Tree Technologies, (v) Ideanomics China (formerly known as Mobile Energy Global and (vi) Energica.
1.WAVE
In 2021, the Company acquired 100% of privately held WAVE.
Founded in 2011, and headquartered in Salt Lake City, Utah, WAVE is a leading provider of high-power inductive (wireless) charging solutions for medium and heavy-duty EVs. Embedded in roadways and depot facilities, the WAVE system automatically charges vehicles during scheduled stops. The hands-free WAVE system mitigates battery range limitations and enables fleets to achieve duty cycles which are comparable to that of ICEs.
Deployed since 2012, WAVE has demonstrated the capability to develop and integrate high-power charging systems into heavy-duty EVs from leading commercial EV manufacturers. WAVE provides custom fleet solutions for mass transit, logistics, airport and campus shuttles, drayage fleets, and off-road vehicles at ports and industrial sites.
Since the acquisition of WAVE in January 2021, the Company has continued investment in engineering, facilities and production resources, including continuous development programs improving technology, reducing cost and scaling manufacturing. These investments and programs are necessary to meet current and anticipated demand for WAVE’s high power inductive wireless charging products. WAVE has continued to develop its high-powered induction capabilities beyond 250kW, successfully delivering systems at 125kW and 500kW, and is working on a 1-Megawatt system for heavy trucking applications. To support widespread adoption, WAVE is developing relationships with additional OEM partners to facilitate the integration of its vehicle-side hardware.
To support its expansion plans, WAVE is adapting its products to meet the varying power requirements and standards for Europe and Asia.
2.Solectrac
In 2021, the Company completed the acquisition of Solectrac, a California-based manufacturer and distributor of electric powered tractors. Since the acquisition the Company has invested in developing the business and has made investments in engineering, supply chain management, and operational leadership to scale the business.
The next stage of product development has been initiated, focused on ergonomic and application improvements, system upgrades, the introduction of a range of Solectrac-compatible farming implements, and a re-styling exercise to strengthen Solectrac’s physical branding. To that end, Solectrac recently launched its E70N tractor, which is focused on vineyards and hobby farms.
A lease on a new facility, in proximity to the current facility, has been recently executed to facilitate expanding its manufacturing and assembly capacity to meet anticipated market demand. While currently being utilized for assembly and testing, Solectrac has engaged the services of a leading, global, automotive consultancy to design and implement a scalable and compliant manufacturing operation at this new facility which is expected to come online during the second half of 2022.
To support its growth objectives, Solectrac has commenced the development of a North American dealer and distribution network, which will help it in the marketing, distribution, sales, and servicing of its products and services.
3.US Hybrid
In 2021, the Company completed the acquisition of US Hybrid, a California-based low- and zero-emission engineering and vehicle integration business which also manufactures hydrogen fuel cells and power electronics for electric, hydrogen, and hybrid powered vehicles. Since the acquisition, the Company has invested in developing the business and has made investments in people and operations to help scale the business, which includes a lease on a new facility in Torrance, California to expand its engineering and assembly capacity to meet the anticipated market demand for specialist vehicle applications. 
Additionally, the Company is working with US Hybrid to further develop the resources required to expand its hydrogen fuel cell manufacturing operations to meet the anticipated demand for hydrogen powered vehicles.
US Hybrid will continue to provide engineering services, fuel cells, power electronics, systems, and components, and associated vehicle integration services to both external customers and to internal companies within Ideanomics Mobility. US Hybrid will serve as a research and development resource across Ideanomics Mobility for BEV and FCEV.
4.Tree Technologies
Tree Technologies is headquartered in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia and through its Treeletrik brand sells EV bikes, scooters, and batteries throughout the ASEAN region. Tree Technologies is collaborating with Energica on the potential development of a new range of low power commercially focused electric motorcycles which are anticipated for introduction to market in 2022 and 2023. The development of the next generation of Treeletrik-branded motorbikes will enable Tree Technologies to remain competitive and leverages Energica’s technology and know-how; translated to the lower power commuter and delivery bike market segment to which Tree Technologies markets its products. This technical collaboration demonstrates the synergistic nature of the companies within Ideanomics Mobility, and the ability to leverage and apply IP, technology, and expertise to improve the Company’s products.
The contract with PSE for the purchase of 200,000 motorcycles is not progressing on the originally anticipated time scale because of the pandemic restrictions and the progress and performance of PSE in areas including local homologation. The Company is evaluating alternatives to fulfilling the order, including but not limited to establishing dealerships in Indonesia, Philippines, and Thailand starting in 2022 to directly enter these markets and take advantage of the opportunity surrounding the dependence on two and three-wheeled low-cost transportation in the region.
Tree Technologies was subjected to continuous rolling lockdowns in 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This has restricted the supply chain and ability to export products within the ASEAN region. The Company anticipates this situation to continue until such time as vaccination rates increase in Malaysia and surrounding countries.
5.Ideanomics China (formerly known as Mobile Energy Global)
The Company's operations in China continue to develop the business, selling ride hailing vehicles, electric vans, trucks, and buses, and EV batteries. A market has developed for used commercial EVs in China, and the Company has established operations to take advantage of this market. Additionally, Ideanomics China supports supply chain operations for the rest of the companies within Ideanomics Mobility.
6.Energica
Energica is the world’s leading manufacturer of high performance electric motorcycles and the sole manufacturer of the FIM Enel MotoE™ World Cup. Energica motorcycles are currently on sale through the official network of dealers and importers.
Status of Previously Announced Acquisitions
VIA
VIA Motors is a leading electric commercial vehicle company with proven advanced electric drive technology, delivering sustainable mobility solutions for a more livable world. VIA designs, manufactures, and markets electric commercial vehicles, with superior life-cycle economics, for use across a broad cross-section of the global fleet customer base. 
We executed a definitive agreement to acquire VIA on August 30, 2021. We are currently in the process of obtaining the required stockholder approval to acquire 100% of VIA and registering the issuance of our common stock as consideration for the transaction. The total aggregate consideration payable in connection with this transaction is up to $630.0 million, consisting of an upfront payment comprised of both stock and cash consideration at the closing of the transaction of $450.0 million and an earnout payment of up to $180.0 million in our common stock. The majority of the $450.0 million is payable in Ideanomics common stock and the $450.0 million value is based on a calculation for a fixed number of shares priced at $2.3668. The cash component of the $450.0 million is documented in two forms, both of which shall be credited to closing consideration: (1) a SAFE issued to VIA on June 7, 2021, for $7.5 million and (2) secured convertible promissory notes issued to VIA periodically in advance of the closing of the transaction, the current outstanding aggregate principal balance of which is $55.4 million. Further details can be found in the Form S-4/A filed with the SEC on February 1, 2022 as well as the Form 8Ks likewise filed by the Company on May 23, 2022, June 16, 2022, July 18, 2022, and August 19, 2022. The Company currently anticipates that its agreement to purchase VIA will close in the fourth quarter of 2022.
With the acquisition of VIA Motors, Ideanomics will acquire a business which has developed a unique commercial battery electric skateboard architecture in the high-growth Class 2 to 5 local and last mile delivery market segment. The skateboard architecture provides an opportunity to customize the vehicle configuration in a van or cab/chassis to meet specific customer needs. VIA is well advanced in the development and validation of the product and with the support of Ideanomics will transition to volume manufacturing by 2023. The details of the transaction with VIA Motors are delineated in a Registration 
Statement on Form S-4 filed by Ideanomics, Inc. with the Securities and Exchange Commission on November 5, 2021, as amended (File No. 333-260843).
Energica
On January 7, 2022, the Company entered into a loan agreement with Energica. Pursuant to this loan agreement, the Company may advance up to Euro 5.0 million, in installments of Euro 250,000, at an annual interest rate of Eurobar plus 2.0%. The purpose of the loan is to provide working capital during the motorcycle manufacturing and purchasing season. The loan is unsecured, with interest payable semi-annually, on June 30 and December 31 of each year. The outstanding principal is due and payable in two installments, on June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2024. On February 9, 2022, the Company wired €52.5 million ($60.3 million) to an escrow account in order to facilitate and fund the conditional tender offer. On March 7, 2022 the Company announced that it had achieved the 90% threshold for the conditional tender offer and the transaction closed on March 14, 2022.
Ideanomics Capital
Ideanomics Capital is the Company's fintech business unit, which focuses on leveraging technology and innovation to improve efficiency, transparency, and profitability for the financial services industry which could generate high rates of return through the deployment of technology and solutions to disrupt existing business models.
The Company’s Ideanomics Capital business unit provides capital market expertise to enable the sale of its subsidiaries’ products and services. It aligns financing resources and develops funding structures that enable growth and revenue generation for the Ideanomics Mobility business unit. Financing structures would include service and products for payment such as CaaS and VaaS. These options are part of the Ideanomics Mobility offering to commercial fleet operators. Additionally, in 2021 Ideanomics Capital began supporting Energica in the creation of a financing program to increase dealership and expand the eBike business. Over time, it is Ideanomics intention to focus Ideanomics Capital as the financial services arm of Ideanomics Mobility and to divest its other fintech assets accordingly.
Operating Companies
There are two operating companies within the Ideanomics Capital business unit: (i) Timios and (ii) Justly.
1.Timios
Founded in 2008 by real estate industry veteran Trevor Stoffer, Timios' vision is to bring transparency to real estate transactions. The company offers title and settlement, and REO title and closing services in 45 states and currently serves 285 national and regional clients.
In 2021, the Company acquired 100% of privately-held Timios. Timios, a nationwide title and escrow services provider, which has been expanding in recent years through offering innovative and freedom-of-choice-friendly solutions for real estate transactions. The products include residential and commercial title insurance, closing and settlement services, as well as specialized offerings for the mortgage process industry. Timios combines difficult to obtain local and state licenses, a knowledgeable and experienced team, and a scalable platform to deliver best-in-class services through both centralized processing and localized branch networks. Ideanomics will assist Timios in scaling its business in various ways, including referring client acquisitions and product innovation.
Timios experienced a cybersecurity incident on July 27, 2021, and, as a consequence of the incident, there was a material reduction in the number of daily orders and revenue. The number of daily orders was recovering, however the impact of rising interest rates during first half of 2022 has made the near-term market conditions more challenging as the mortgage origination and refinance markets are sensitive to rising interest rates. The company has seen an increase in the default sector, which utilizes title and closing services, and this is anticipated to provide some offset to the drop in mortgage origination and refinance revenues. In addition, Timios has entered into a strategic partnership with OrangeGrid making Timios the preferred provider of title, escrow, valuation and asset management services within OrangeGrid's GridReady default management ecosystem. Additionally, Timios and Orangegrid will collaborate on a number of co-marketing initiatives to accelerate market adoption of the solution. Mortgage servicers who are GridReady customers will be able to seamlessly order title, escrow and valuation products and track fulfillment by Timios through the GridSource vendor management component of the ecosystem.
2.JUSTLY (formerly known as Delaware Board of Trade (DBOT))
In the latter half of 2021, the Company restructured and relaunched its DBOT business as JUSTLY, a FINRA-registered broker dealer destination for ESG and thematic investments. The Company has hired an entirely new management team of experienced capital markets and regulatory professionals, implementing new systems for JUSTLY to leverage its new business model as a destination for crowdfunding as well as other associated offerings.
JUSTLY, in its new form, is a broker dealer that operates a funding platform focused on Reg. CF, A+ and D private equity and debt. Recent regulatory easing and the increase in the maximum size of Reg. CF (now $5.0 million) and Reg. A+ (now $75.0 million) have increased investor interest and access to the private equity market. JUSTLY is also registered with FINRA to manage an ATS, which is currently not active, but is expected to be relaunched when market conditions are more favorable, offering a secondary market in private equities. The Company believes that growing demand for private placements and the need for a secondary market provide a favorable environment for JUSTLY's future growth.
Portfolio Optimization
The Company had previously identified two business units that it considered non-core. The non-core assets are Grapevine, a marketing and ecommerce platform focused on influencer marketing, and Fintech Village a 58-acre development site in West Hartford, Connecticut.
The Company completed the divestitures of Grapevine in April, 2021 and of Fintech Village in December, 2021.
In addition, we may also reorganize our business structure in 2022 to align our portfolio of products and solutions more closely with the markets we serve and bring better performance clarity with our competitive peer set. We are continuing to review our portfolio and will look for other ways to better manage and optimize our product offerings. 
Competitive Business Conditions, Competitive Position in the Industry and Methods of Competition
The markets in which we participate are dynamic and highly competitive, requiring companies to react quickly to capitalize on opportunity. We retain skilled and experienced personnel and deploy substantial resources to meet the changing demands of the industry and to capitalize on change. The market for our products is highly competitive and subject to rapid technological change. We encounter significant domestic and international competition across all units of our business. 
Ideanomics Mobility
The company’s EV business operates in the market for fleet commercial vehicles, which is still in the development stage. The company could face competition from other companies that develop and operate a similar integrated platform for the procurement, purchase, financing, charging, and energy management needs of fleet EV operators. The company could also face competition from companies that only operate in one part of the vehicle purchase and operation cycle, for example, an EV vehicle or battery manufacturer may sell directly to EV fleet operators while also participating in the platform operated by the Company’s Ideanomics China business. 
Purchasers of commercial vehicles have the choice between traditional ICE vehicles and EVs and this is likely to continue for at least the next five years, and possibly longer. The most important drivers for the development of the commercial fleet EV market are federal and provincial regulations relating to clean air and electric vehicles including subsidies and incentives to help owners of fleets of commercial vehicles convert from combustion engines to EV. The speed at which fleet operators convert to EV is highly correlated with government regulations, targets and related subsidies and incentives. If the governments, or municipalities, change the regulations, targets, incentives or subsidies then the rate at which fleet operators convert their vehicles to EV could slow down which in turn may lead to lower revenues for the Company. Additionally, the rate and form in which the commercial fleet EV market develops is dependent upon technological developments in battery and charging systems; deployment of the charging infrastructure to support widespread commercial EV use and the development of new financing and lending structures that address the different collateral and resale values of the battery and vehicle versus ICE vehicles.
In addition to its directly owned operations, the Company operates through a network of investment arrangements, partnerships and formal and informal alliances; consequently, its competitive position could be adversely impacted if one of the members of the alliance was not able to meet the demand for its products, decides not to continue to cooperate with the Company, or goes out of business.
Ideanomics Capital
The Company’s Ideanomics Capital business unit operates in sectors that are undergoing rapid change. The Company’s fintech business operates in several markets, with Timios providing title and escrow services throughout the U.S, and JUSTLY is a FINRA registered broker-dealer, which intends to operate a financing funding platform focused on private equity and debt. Timios has many competitors, some of whom may have a broader geographic reach within this market, and may be more well-capitalized and therefore more able to weather a downturn in business volume resulting from an increase in interest rates.
JUSTLY, among other business endeavors, operates a curated crowdfunding equity platform of private impact investments to advisors, registered investment advisors, family offices, angels, and accredited and non-accredited investors from all income levels. JUSTLY is engaged in business in a highly competitive, constantly evolving marketplace, requiring continual advancing pricing sophistication and technological capabilities of the competitors and necessitating to differentiate their product offerings. 
Sources and Availability of Raw Materials
The Company’s businesses depend on a ready supply of components and parts that are sourced domestically and internationally and any interruption to the supply of these could have an adverse impact on the Company’s results. The Company’s suppliers that manufacture components and parts, which includes EV motors and batteries, depend on a ready supply of raw materials and components, consequently a shortage of raw materials or components could adversely impact their manufacturing process and, potentially, impact the Company’s revenues as it may not be able to complete orders that it has received. The Company may also be adversely impacted if global logistics and supply chains are interrupted.
Our products are manufactured or assembled from both standard components and parts that are unique to our specifications. Our internal manufacturing operations are largely process oriented and we use significant quantities of various raw materials, including aluminum, copper, steel, bimetals, optical fiber and plastics and other polymers, among others. We use significant volumes of aluminum, copper, steel and polymers in manufacturing coaxial and twisted pair cables and antennas. Other parts are produced using processes such as stamping, machining, molding and pressing from metals or plastics. Portions of the requirements for these materials are purchased under supply arrangements where some portion of the unit pricing may be indexed to commodity market prices for these metals. We may occasionally enter forward purchase commitments or otherwise secure availability for specific commodities to mitigate our exposure to price changes for a portion of our anticipated purchases. Certain of the raw materials utilized in our products may only be available from a few suppliers, and we may enter into longer term agreements to secure access to certain key inputs. We may, therefore, encounter significant price increases and/or availability issues for the materials we obtain from these suppliers, such as those that we have seen in 2021. These supply chain constraints have limited our ability to manufacture and deliver products to our customers in 2021 and we expect this to continue into 2022.
Our profitability has been and may continue to be materially affected by changes in the market price of our raw materials and components, most of which are linked to the commodity markets. Prices for aluminum, copper, plastics, silicon and certain other polymers derived from oil and natural gas have fluctuated substantially during the past several years. We have adjusted our prices for certain products and may have to adjust prices again. Delays in implementing price increases, failure to achieve market acceptance of price increases, or price reductions in response to a rapid decline in raw material costs, could have a material adverse impact on the results of our operations.
In addition, some of our products are assembled from specialized components and subassemblies manufactured by third-party suppliers. We depend upon sole suppliers for certain of these components, including capacitors, memory devices and silicon chips. Our results of operations have been and may continue to be materially affected if these suppliers cannot provide these components in sufficient quantity and quality on a timely and cost-efficient basis. We believe that our supply contracts and our supplier contingency plans mitigate some of this risk. Our supply agreements include technology licensing and component purchase contracts, and several of our competitors have similar supply agreements for these components. There can be no guarantee that the Company will be able to extend or renew these supply agreements on similar terms, or at all. In addition, we license software for operating network and security systems or sub-systems and a variety of routing protocols from different suppliers.
Seasonality
The Company expects that orders and sales will be influenced by the amount and timing of budgeted expenditure by its customers. Typically, the Company would expect to see higher sales at the start of the year when companies start executing on their capital programs and at the end of the year when companies are spending any surplus or uncommitted budget before the new budget cycle commences. The Company’s EV operating businesses are in the early stage of their development and consequently do not have sufficient trading histories to project seasonal buying patterns with any degree of confidence. 
Revenues generated by the Company’s Timios Title Agency business are impacted by the volume and timing of orders, typically the first quarter of the year shows a decline in revenues reflecting the lower orders in fourth quarter of the year due to the impact of holidays.
Working Capital Requirements
As the Company expands its business the need for working capital will continue to grow. The Company acquired several companies in 2021 and, along with its existing operations, are all considered growth companies at various stages of maturity. For these reasons, and the tight supply chain within automotive in general, will require working capital for both organic growth of those business plus for the purchase of components for the manufacture and assembly of the Company’s respective EV and wired and wireless charging systems. The Company will continue to raise both debt and equity capital to support the working capital needs of these businesses and its U.S. headquarters functions.
Trademarks, Patents and Licenses
We hold various patents and trade names and rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark, service mark and trade secret laws to establish and protect our intellectual property rights. We have a number of pending patent applications relating to new products and technology. We will continue to file additional patent applications on new inventions, as appropriate, demonstrating our commitment to technology and innovation. For technology that is not owned by us, we have a program for obtaining appropriate licenses to help ensure that we have the necessary license coverage for our products. In addition, we have formed strategic relationships with leading technology companies to provide us with early access to technology that we believe will help keep us at the forefront of our industry. Although we believe our intellectual property rights play a role in maintaining our competitive position in a number of the markets that we serve, we do not believe we would be materially adversely affected by the expiration or termination of our trademarks or trade names or the loss of any of our other intellectual property rights. 
Business and Customer Concentration
The Company is in the process of building out its Ideanomics Mobility unit and has not yet reached a stage of development where the loss of any single customer would have a material adverse effect on the Company.
Timios’ title and escrow service depends upon a network of referring financial institutions. The loss of referrals from the larger referring financial institutions would have a material adverse effect on the Company.
Reliance on Government Contracts
In its international operations the Company does not typically contract directly with national governments, however it may contract with provincial, state and local municipalities.
The Company does not contract directly with the government of the PRC. Additionally, the rate at which commercial fleets convert to EV is heavily influenced by federal and provincial policies in the PRC as they relate to clean air and adoption of EV technology. Consequently, the Company’s results may be adversely impacted by changes in regulations in the PRC.
Corporate Structure
Ideanomics is a Nevada corporation existing as an operating company that conducts a substantial majority of its operations through twenty-five (25) of its operating subsidiaries established in various jurisdictions including the United States, People’s Republic of China, Hong Kong, Malaysia, and England and Wales, and nine (9) subsidiaries with no operations acting solely as holding companies. Currently, there are fifteen (15) operating subsidiaries of Ideanomics in the United States and five (5) PRC subsidiaries. In addition, twenty (20) of the subsidiaries of the Company are referred to as dormant subsidiaries that ceased their operations, remain not liquidated solely for the purpose of compliance with administrative formalities, and are expected to be liquidated within 6 months of the consummation of the merger.
The organizational structure of the Company is comprised of a total of fifty-four (62) subsidiaries. The following chart depicts our corporate structure as of June 1, 2022.
Our Unconsolidated Equity Investments
Our investments in Energica, PEA, the MDI Fund, TM2, and FNL, where we may exercise significant influence, but not control, are classified as a long-term equity investments and accounted for using the equity method. Under the equity method, 
the investment is initially recorded at cost and adjusted for our share of undistributed earnings or losses of the investee. Investment losses are recognized until the investment is written down to nil, provided that we do not guarantee the investee’s obligations or we are committed to provide additional funding.
Refer to Note 12 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part IV, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information.
Energica
On March 3, 2021, the Company entered into an investment agreement with Energica. The Company invested €10.1 million ($13.6 million) for 6.1 million ordinary shares of Energica at a subscription price of €1.78 ($2.21) for each ordinary share. Pursuant to the purchase of the shares the Company will hold 20.0% of Energica’s share capital. 
Energica is the world’s leading manufacturer of high performance electric motorcycles and was the sole manufacturer of the FIM Enel MotoE™ World Cup.
Certain shareholders of Energica have rights such that they may convert their ordinary shares into ordinary shares with supervoting rights under certain conditions. If some or all of these ordinary shares were converted into ordinary shares with supervoting rights, the Company’s ownership in Energica would be diluted, perhaps significantly.
PEA
On August 2, 2021, the Company announced a strategic investment in PEA, a business unit within the Prettl Group, a large German industrial company that manufactures and distributes components and systems for the automotive, energy, and electronics industries. The terms include a strategic investment of €7.5 million ($9.1 million) for 11,175 preferred shares. Ideanomics received exclusive sales and distribution rights for PEA charging infrastructure products and solutions in North America and CEO Alf Poor will join PEA's Board of Directors. The Company received legal ownership as of October 19, 2021, after payment of €7.5 million ($9.1 million).
MDI Fund
On July 26, 2021, the Company entered into a subscription agreement to invest $25.0 million in the MDI Fund. The MDI Fund sponsored by the National Bankers’ Association, is an organization of minority-owned banks that aims to increase inclusivity in the financial services industry. The MDI Fund will provide capital resources primarily in low and moderate income areas to grow a more skilled workforce, increase employment opportunities, and support businesses’ growth among minority and underserved communities. 
The initial investment of $0.6 million was made on July 26, 2021.
TM2
On January 28, 2021, the Company entered into a SAFE with TM2. As of August 13, 2021, the SAFE was amended to which Ideanomics invested €5.0 million ($5.9 million), an increase in the investment of €3.5 million ($4.1 million), from the original contracted investment of €1.5 million ($1.8 million.) 
TM2 is a London based digital commodities issuance and trading platform for technology metals. It connects institutional investors, proprietary traders and retail investors with metals suppliers – miners, refiners, recyclers and mints. The platform focuses specifically on new metals that currently don’t have an active trading marketplace, such as rhodium, lithium, cobalt, rhenium, etc. The Company’s ownership interest in TM2 provides valuable data and insight into the global technology metals market, which is critical to the future of the cleantech and EV industries. TM2 connects both pillars of cleantech and fintech. The types of metals and materials traded on the TM2 platform are critical to cleantech (for EV battery production, energy storage systems, solar cells, etc.,) while the fintech platform is innovative in representing these commodities which do not exist on traditional exchanges.
In the fourth quarter ending December 31, 2021, as the management and controlling shareholders of TM2 updated business plans and related capital requirements for the emerging trading platform in 2023, it was determined that incremental funding would be required to achieve critical objectives. TM2 has been unsuccessful to date in obtaining incremental funding and 
consequently has reduced headcount and curtailed other critical spending. The current outlook and management approach without any indication of likely incremental capital funding indicates a probable impairment. The Company recorded an impairment charge for the full value of the investment in the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2021.
FNL
On April 20, 2021, Ideanomics entered into a stock purchase agreement with FNL (developer of Hoo.be), pursuant to which Ideanomics made an investment into FNL, which included the investment of $2.9 million cash into FNL, the issuance of 0.1 million shares of Ideanomics common stock, and 100.0% of the common stock outstanding of Grapevine. Ideanomics received 0.6 million shares of common stock of FNL at a subscription price of $8.09 per share of common stock, and Ideanomics also converted a $250,000 SAFE into 30,902 shares of common stock. The Company determined that the basis in the FNL investment is the aggregate of the cash invested, including the SAFE, the fair value of the Ideanomics common stock issued, and the fair value of Grapevine. As a result of this transaction, Ideanomics owns 29.0% of the common stock outstanding of FNL, and FNL appointed Alfred Poor, Ideanomics’ Chief Executive Officer, to be a member of its board of directors.
Government Regulations
Rules and Regulations Material to our Business
Vehicle Safety and Testing
In the U.S., some of our vehicles are subject to regulation by the NHTSA, including all applicable FMVSS and the NHTSA bumper standard. While our current vehicles fully comply with applicable regulations and we expect that our vehicles in the future will fully comply with all applicable FMVSS with limited or no exemptions, FMVSS are subject to change from time to time and while we anticipate being in compliance with the proposed changes, there is no assurance until final regulation changes are enacted. As a manufacturer, we must self-certify that our vehicles meet all applicable FMVSS and the NHTSA bumper standard, or otherwise are exempt, before the vehicles may be imported or sold in the U.S. 
We are also required to comply with other federal laws administered by NHTSA including labeling requirements and other information provided to customers in writing, Early Warning Reporting requirements regarding warranty claims, field reports, death and injury reports and foreign recalls and additional requirements for cooperating with compliance and safety investigations and recall reporting. In addition, federal law requires inclusion of fuel economy ratings, as determined by the U.S. Department of Transportation and the EPA, and New Car Assessment Program ratings as determined by NHTSA, if available. 
Our vehicles sold outside of the U.S. are subject to similar foreign compliance, safety, environmental and other regulations. Many of those regulations are different from those applicable in the U.S. and may require redesign and/or retesting. Some of those regulations impact or prevent the rollout of new vehicle features. Additionally, the European Union established new rules regarding additional compliance oversight that commenced in 2020. There is also regulatory uncertainty regarding how these rules will impact sales in the United Kingdom given its withdrawal from the E.U. 
Automobile Manufacturer and Dealer Regulation
In the U.S., state laws regulate the manufacture, distribution, sale and service of motor vehicles, and generally require motor vehicle manufacturers and dealers to be licensed in order to sell vehicles directly to residents. Certain states have asserted that the laws in such states do not permit manufacturers to be licensed as dealers or to act in the capacity of a dealer, or that they otherwise restrict a manufacturer’s ability to deliver or service vehicles. 
Battery Safety and Testing
Our battery packs are subject to various U.S. and international regulations that govern transport of “dangerous goods,” defined to include lithium-ion batteries, which may present a risk in transportation. The governing regulations, which are issued by the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration, are based on the UN Recommendations on the Safe Transport of Dangerous Goods Model Regulations and related UN Manual Tests and Criteria. The regulations vary by mode of shipping transportation, such as by ocean vessel, rail, truck or air. We conduct testing to demonstrate our compliance with such regulations.
As indicated above, we use lithium-ion cells in the high voltage battery packs in some of our vehicles and energy storage products. The use, storage and disposal of our battery packs are regulated under existing laws and are the subject of ongoing regulatory changes that may add additional requirements in the future. 
Solar Energy—General
We are subject to certain state and federal regulations applicable to solar and battery storage providers and sellers of electricity. To operate our systems, we enter into standard interconnection agreements with applicable utilities. Sales of electricity and non-sale equipment leases by third parties, such as our leases and PPAs, are likely to face regulatory challenges in some states and jurisdictions.
Environmental Regulations
We operate in an industry that is subject to extensive environmental regulation, which has become more stringent over time. The laws and regulations to which we are subject govern, among others, vehicle emissions and the storage, handling, treatment, transportation and disposal of hazardous materials and the remediation of environmental contamination. Compliance with such laws and regulations at an international, regional, national, and local level is an important aspect of our ability to continue our operations.
Environmental standards applicable to us are established by the laws and regulations of the countries in which we operate, standards adopted by regulatory agencies and the permits and licenses issued to us. Each of these sources is subject to periodic modifications and what we anticipate will be increasingly stringent requirements. Violations of these laws, regulations or permits and licenses may result in substantial administrative, civil or even criminal fines, penalties and possibly orders to cease any violating operations or to conduct or pay for corrective works. In some instances, violations may also result in the suspension or revocation of permits or licenses.
EPA Emissions and Certificate of Conformity
The U.S. Clean Air Act requires that we obtain a Certificate of Conformity issued by the EPA and a California Executive Order issued by CARB certifying that certain of our vehicles comply with all applicable emissions and related certification requirements. A Certificate of Conformity is required for vehicles sold in states covered by the Clean Air Act’s standards and a CARB Executive Order is required for vehicles sold in California and states that have adopted California’s stricter standards for emissions controls related to new vehicles and engines sold in such states. States that have adopted the California standards as approved by EPA also recognize the CARB Executive Order for sales of vehicles.
In addition to California, there are 13 other states that have either adopted or are in the process of adopting the stricter California standards, including New York, Massachusetts, Vermont, Maine, Pennsylvania, Connecticut, Rhode Island, Washington, Oregon, New Jersey, Maryland, Delaware and Colorado.
We are required to seek an EPA Certificate of Conformity for certain of our vehicles sold in states covered by the Clean Air Act’s standards and a CARB Executive Order for vehicles sold in California or any of the other 13 states identified above that have adopted the stricter California standards.
Regulations Pertaining to Our Title Business
Our title companies and related subsidiaries are subject to extensive regulation under applicable state laws. The laws of most states in which we transact business establish supervisory agencies with broad administrative powers relating to issuing and revoking licenses to transact business, regulating trade practices, licensing agents, accounting practices, and financial practices. 
In addition to state-level regulation, our title business is subject to regulation by federal agencies, including the CFPB. The CFPB was established under the Dodd-Frank which also included regulation over financial services and other lending related businesses. The CFPB has broad authority to regulate, among other areas, the mortgage and real estate markets in matters pertaining to consumers. This authority includes the enforcement of the TILA, the RESPA and the rules related to the TRID formerly placed with the Department of Housing and Urban Development. Our underwritten title companies, primarily those domiciled in California, are also subject to certain regulation by insurance regulatory or other governing authorities relating to their net worth and working capital.
From time to time, we receive inquiries and requests for information from attorneys general, insurance commissioners and other regulatory agencies about various matters relating to our business. Sometimes these take the form of civil investigative demands or subpoenas. We cooperate with all such inquiries. From time to time, we are assessed fines for violations of regulations or other matters or enter into settlements with such authorities which may require us to pay fines or claims or take other actions.
Regulations Regarding our Fintech Businesses
Securities and Commodities Laws
In order for a securities exchange to operate, it must register as a broker-dealer with the SEC and become a member of FINRA. Depending on a securities exchange’s activities, it may be required to also register as a broker dealer on the state level. JUSTLY is a registered broker dealer with an ATS. Depending upon the jurisdiction, we may also be required to comply with laws applicable to securities exchanges.
Financial Crimes and Sanctions Compliance
The jurisdictions in which we operate and intend to operate generally have adopted laws to prevent money laundering, terrorist financing, fraud and other financial crime, as well as to ensure compliance with applicable sanctions regimes. Various aspects of our business require us to develop and implement policies and procedures that confirm the identity of customers, detect suspicious activities and ensure we do not do business with blocked persons.
Rules and Regulations of PRC Material to our Business 
General Regulation of Businesses in the PRC
We are required to obtain government approval from or filing with the MOFCOM and/or other government agencies in the PRC for transactions, such as our acquisition or disposition of business entities in the PRC. Additionally, foreign ownership of certain business and assets in the PRC is not permitted without specific government approval.
Regulations Relating to Foreign Investment
Investment activities in the PRC by foreign investors are principally governed by the Negative List and the Encouraged Foreign Investment Catalogue, which was promulgated and is amended from time to time by the MOFCOM and the National Development and Reform Commission. The Catalogue sets forth the industries in which foreign investments are encouraged, restricted, or prohibited. Industries that are not listed in the restricted or prohibited categories are permitted areas for foreign investments and are generally open to foreign investment unless specifically restricted by other PRC regulations. Establishment of wholly foreign owned enterprises is generally allowed in encouraged and permitted industries. Foreign investors are not allowed to invest in industries in the prohibited category.
Under PRC law, the establishment of a wholly foreign owned enterprise is subject to the approval of or filing with the MOFCOM or its local counterparts and the wholly foreign owned enterprise must register with the competent administration for market regulation. Our significant PRC subsidiaries have duly obtained all material approvals required for their business operations.
In addition, the transportation sector is subject to regulation at the central and provincial level. The PRC government may issue from time to time new laws or new interpretations on existing laws, some of which are not published on a timely basis or may have retroactive effect. Administrative and court proceedings in the PRC may also be protracted, resulting in substantial costs and diversion of resources and management attention. Regulatory risk also encompasses the interpretation by the tax authorities of current tax laws, and our legal structure and scope of operations in the PRC, which could be subject to further restrictions resulting in limitations on our ability to conduct business in the PRC.
PRC Regulations on Automobile Sales
On April 5, 2017, the MOFCOM promulgated the Administrative Measures on Automobile Sales, which became effective on July 1, 2017, pursuant to which automobile suppliers and dealers are required to file with relevant authorities (via an information system for national automobile circulation operated by competent commerce departments) within 90 days after receiving a business license. Where there is any change to a party’s underlying information, automobile suppliers and dealers must update such information within 30 days after such change. Failure to satisfy such filing requirement will be subject to a warning or a fine up to RMB 30,000. 
PRC Regulations on the Recall of Defective Automobiles
On October 22, 2012, the State Council promulgated the Administrative Provisions on Defective Automotive Product Recalls, which became effective on January 1, 2013, and which were amended on March 3, 2019. According to this legislation, the product quality supervision department of the State Council is responsible for the supervision and administration of recalls of defective automotive products in China. Manufacturers of automobile products are required to take measures to eliminate defects in products they sell. A manufacturer must recall all defective automobile products. If any operator conducting sales, leasing, or repair of vehicles discovers any defect in automobile products, it must cease to sell, lease or use the defective products and must assist manufacturers in the recall of those products. 

PRC Regulation Relating to Compulsory Product Certification
According to the Administrative Regulations on Compulsory Product Certification promulgated by the QSIQ (which was subsequently merged into the SAMR) on July 3, 2009 and which became effective on September 1, 2009, and the List of the First Batch of Products Subject to Compulsory Product Certification promulgated by the QSIQ in association with the CAA on December 3, 2001, which became effective on the same day, the QSIQ is responsible for the quality certification of automobiles. Automobiles and relevant accessories must not be sold, exported or used in operating activities until they are certified by relevant certification authorities designated by the CAA as qualified products and granted certification marks. 
PRC Regulations on Consumer Rights Protection
The Consumer Rights and Interests Protection Law, as promulgated on October 31, 1993 and most recently amended in 2013 by the SCNPC, imposes stringent requirements and obligations on business operators in China. Failure to comply with consumer protection requirements under this legislation could subject business operators to administrative penalties including warnings, confiscation of unlawful income, imposition of fines, an order to cease business operations, revocation of business licenses, as well as potential civil or criminal liabilities. 
PRC Regulation on Employment 
The Labor Contract Law of the PRC, which was promulgated by the SCNPC on June 29, 2007 and most recently amended as of July 1, 2013, is primarily aimed at regulating rights and obligations of employer and employee relationships, including the establishment, performance and termination of labor contracts. Pursuant to the Labor Contract Law, labor contracts must be concluded in writing if labor relationships are to be or have been established between employers and their employees. Employee wages shall be no lower than local standards on minimum wages and must be paid to employees in a timely manner. Employers are prohibited from forcing employees to work above certain time limits and employers shall pay employees for overtime work in accordance with national regulations. The Labor Contract Law in effect prohibits employers from terminating employees without severance except in a few enumerated circumstances (e.g., serious violation of company rules and regulations). In some permitted circumstances of termination (such as where an employee is incompetent and remains incompetent after training or assignment to another post), a 30 days’ prior notice (or pay in lieu) and severance payments are required. 
The Social Insurance Law of the PRC, promulgated by the SCNPC on October 28, 2010 and most recently amended on December 29, 2018, provides that each employer within the PRC must register with the State’s social insurance system upon its establishment and make contributions to the social insurance system for the benefit of each of its employees, including foreign nationals who are employed in the PRC. Specifically, an employer must make monthly deposits to a designated fund for its contribution to each of its employees’ pension insurance, medical insurance, work injury insurance, unemployment insurance, and maternity insurance. Failure to make such deposits according to the amounts and times provided by law can lead to a court order for seizure, freezing, or an auction of the employer’s property equivalent to the value of any unpaid social insurance payables. 
In accordance with the Regulations on the Management of Housing Fund which was promulgated by the State Council on April 3, 1999 and revised on March 24, 2019, employers must register at designated administrative centers and open bank accounts in order to deposit mandatory employee housing fund contributions. Employers are required to pay and deposit housing fund contributions (in an amount no less than 5% of the monthly average salary of the employee in the preceding year) in full and on time. 
PRC Regulation on Government Subsidies
On April 22, 2015, the MOF, the MOST, the MIIT and the NDRC jointly promulgated the Financial Support Circular, which took effect on the same day. The Financial Support Circular provides that those who purchase new energy vehicles specified in the Catalogue of Recommended New Energy Vehicle Models for Promotion and Application issued by the MIIT may enjoy government subsidies. A purchaser may purchase a new energy vehicle from a manufacturer by paying the price deducted by the subsidy amount, and the manufacturer may obtain the subsidy amount from the PRC central government after such new energy vehicle is sold to the purchaser. 
On April 23, 2020, the MOF, the MOST, the MIIT and the NDRC jointly issued the 2020 Financial Subsidies Circular, which took effect on the same day, and which extended the implementation period of financial subsidies for new energy vehicles to the end of 2022. The 2020 Financial Subsidies Circular further specifies that the subsidy criteria for new energy vehicles during the period from year 2020 to 2022 will generally be reduced by 10%, 20% and 30% compared to the subsidy standard of the previous year respectively, and the number of vehicles eligible for the subsidies will not exceed approximately two million each year. 
On December 31, 2020, the above mentioned authorities further promulgated the 2021 Financial Subsidies Circular, a Circular on Further Improving the Financial Subsidy Policy for the Wider Application of New-energy Vehicles, which became effective on January 1, 2021, and was another similar circular to reiterate the principles including among others, the subsidy criteria reduction rate as stipulated in the 2020 Financial Subsidies Circular. This 2021 Financial Subsidies Circular emphasizes that the effective period for financial subsidy policies applicable to new energy vehicles will be extended to the end of 2022, given levels of technical progress, scale effect and other factors. The reduction of these subsidy standards will be gradual. The 2021 subsidy standard reduces the base subsidy amount by 20% for each new energy vehicle on the basis of that for the previous year.
On December 31, 2021, the above mentioned authorities promulgated the 2022 Financial Subsidies Circular, a Circular on Financial Subsidy Policy for Application and Promotion of New-energy Vehicles in the year of 2022, which became effective on January 1, 2022. The 2022 Financial Subsidies Circular specifies that the subsidy standard of 2022 will be reduced by 30% compared to the subsidy standard of the previous year, and the financial subsidy policies applicable to new energy vehicles will expire on December 31, 2022. 
Taxation
On March 16, 2007, the National People’s Congress of the PRC originally passed the EIT Law, which was most recently amended on December 29, 2018, and on November 28, 2007, the State Council of China originally passed implementing rules to the EIT Law, which were most recently amended on April 23, 2019. The EIT Law and its implementing rules impose a unified EIT rate of 25.0% on all domestic-invested enterprises and FIE unless they qualify under certain limited exceptions. In addition, under the EIT Law, an enterprise established outside of the PRC with “de facto management bodies” within the PRC is considered a resident enterprise and will be subject to an EIT of 25% on its global income. The implementing rules define the term “de facto management bodies” as “an establishment that exercises, in substance, overall management and control over the production, business, personnel, accounting, etc., of a Chinese enterprise.” If the PRC tax authorities subsequently determine that we should be classified as a resident enterprise, then our organization’s global income will be subject to PRC income tax of 25%. 
In April 2009, the State Administration of Taxation originally issued a circular, commonly known as “Circular 82,” which was most recently amended on December 29, 2017. Circular 82 provides specific criteria for determining whether the “de facto management body” of a PRC-controlled enterprise that is incorporated offshore is actually located in China. Although this circular only applies to offshore enterprises controlled by PRC enterprises or PRC enterprise groups (not those controlled by PRC individuals or foreigners,) the criteria set forth in the circular may reflect the State Administration of Taxation’s general position on how the “de facto management body” test should be applied in determining the tax resident status of all offshore enterprises. According to Circular 82, an enterprise incorporated offshore but controlled by a PRC enterprise or a PRC enterprise group will be regarded as a PRC tax resident by virtue of having its “de facto management body” in China if all of the following conditions are met: (i) the primary location of the day-to-day operational management is in the PRC; (ii) decisions relating to the enterprise’s financial and human resource matters are made or are subject to approval by organizations or personnel in the PRC; (iii) the enterprise’s primary assets, accounting books and records, company seals, and board and shareholder resolutions, are located or maintained in the PRC; and (iv) at least 50% of voting board members or senior executives habitually reside in the PRC. 
For detailed discussion of PRC tax issues related to resident enterprise status, see Part I—Item 1A—“Risk Factors—Risks Related to Doing Business in the PRC- Under the EIT Law, we may be classified as a “resident enterprise” of China. Such 
classification will likely result in dividends payable to our foreign investor and gains on sale of our common stock by our foreign investors may become subject to PRC taxation.”
Foreign Currency Exchange
Under the PRC foreign currency exchange regulations applicable to us, RMB is convertible for current account items, including the distribution of dividends, interest payments, trade and service-related foreign exchange transactions. Currently, our PRC operating entities may purchase foreign currencies for settlement of current account transactions, including payments of dividends to us, without the approval of the PRC State Administration of Foreign Exchange, by complying with certain procedural requirements. Conversion of RMB for capital account items, such as direct investment, loan, security investment and repatriation of investment, however, is still subject to the approval of the State Administration of Foreign Exchange. In particular, if our PRC operating entities borrow foreign currency through loans from us or other foreign lenders, these loans must be registered with the State Administration of Foreign Exchange, and if we finance the subsidiaries by means of additional capital contributions, these capital contributions must be registered or filed with by certain government authorities. These limitations could affect our PRC operating entities’ ability to obtain foreign exchange through debt or equity financing.
Dividend Distributions
PRC regulations restrict the ability of our PRC entities to make dividends and other payments to their offshore parent company. PRC legal restrictions permit payments of dividends by our PRC entities only out of their accumulated after-tax profits, if any, determined in accordance with PRC accounting standards and regulations. Each of our PRC subsidiaries is also required under PRC laws and regulations to allocate at least 10% of our annual after-tax profits determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the PRC to a statutory general reserve fund until the amounts in such fund reaches 50% of its registered capital. These reserves are not distributable as cash dividends. Our PRC subsidiaries have the discretion to allocate a portion of their after-tax profits to staff welfare and bonus funds, which may not be distributed to equity owners except in the event of liquidation.
In addition, under the EIT Law, the Notice 112 which was originally issued on January 29, 2008 and most recently amended on February 29, 2008, any dividends from our PRC operating subsidiaries paid to us through our entities are (since January 1, 2008) subject to a withholding tax at a rate of 10%. Furthermore, the ultimate tax rate will be determined by treaty between the PRC and the tax residence nation of the holder of the PRC subsidiary. Dividends historically declared and paid before January 1, 2008 on distributable profits were grandfathered in under the EIT Law and were not subject to withholding tax.
We intend to reinvest profits, if any, and do not intend on making cash distributions of dividends in the near future.
The Company is subject to a variety of U.S. and international laws, rules, policies and other obligations regarding data protection.
We are subject to federal, state and international laws relating to the collection, use, retention, security and transfer of various types of personal information. In many cases, these laws apply not only to third-party transactions, but also restrict transfers of personal information among the Company and its international subsidiaries and vice versa. Many jurisdictions have passed laws regarding data privacy and personal data, and additional jurisdictions are considering imposing additional restrictions or have laws that are pending. These laws continue to develop and may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Complying with emerging and changing requirements causes the Company to incur substantial costs and has required and may in the future require the Company to change its business practices. Noncompliance could result in significant penalties or legal liability.
The Company makes statements about its use and disclosure of personal and business information through its privacy policy, information provided on its website, press statements and other privacy notices. Any failure by the Company to comply with these public statements or with other federal, state or international privacy or data protection laws and regulations could result in inquiries or proceedings against the Company by governmental entities or others. In addition to reputational impacts, penalties could include ongoing audit requirements and significant legal liability. In addition to the risks generally relating to the collection, use, retention, security and transfer of personal information, the Company is also subject to specific obligations relating to information considered sensitive under applicable laws, such as vehicle telematics data and financial data. Vehicle telematics are subject to specific regulation by the PRC, and if the Company fails to adequately comply with these rules and requirements, the Company can be subject to litigation or government investigations in the PRC or elsewhere, and can be liable for associated investigatory expenses, and can also incur significant fees or fines.
Human Capital Management
Human Capital Resources
Our experienced employees and management team are our most valuable resources. Attracting, training, and retaining key personnel has been and will remain critical to our success. We are committed to attracting, motivating, and retaining top professionals. To achieve our human capital goals, we intend to stay focused on providing our personnel with entrepreneurial opportunities to expand our business within their areas of expertise. We will also continue to provide our personnel with personal and professional growth opportunities, including additional training, performance-based incentives such as opportunities for stock ownership, and other competitive benefits.
We work to ensure that the Company provides a safe, inclusive, and positive employee environment for all its employees. As of December 31, 2021, we had a total of 559 employees, of which 476 were located in the United States, 40 located in Malaysia, 37 located in China and 6 located in the United Kingdom. None of our employees are represented by a union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We have not experienced any work stoppages, and we consider our relationship with our employees to be good.
Our success is directly related to the satisfaction, growth, and development of our employees. We strive to offer a work environment where employee opinions are valued and allow our employees to use and augment their professional skills. To achieve our human capital goals, we intend to remain focused on providing our personnel with entrepreneurial opportunities to expand our business within their areas of expertise and continue to provide our personnel with personal and professional growth. Ideanomics emphasizes several measures and objectives in managing our human capital assets, including, among others, employee safety and wellness, talent acquisition and retention, employee engagement, development and training, diversity and inclusion, and compensation and pay equity. 
COVID-19 and Employee Safety and Wellness
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented significant changes that we determined were in the best interest of our employees as well as the communities in which we operate. These measures include allowing most employees to work from home. We believe in supporting our employees’ health and well-being. Our goal is to help employees make informed decisions about their health by providing the tools and resources necessary to achieve a healthier lifestyle. We offer our employees a wide array of benefits such as life and health (medical, dental, and vision) insurance, paid time off and retirement benefits, as well as emotional well-being services through our health insurance program. 
Diversity and Inclusion and Ethical Business Practices
We believe that a company culture focused on diversity and inclusion is a crucial driver of creativity and innovation. We also believe that diverse and inclusive teams make better business decisions, ultimately driving better business outcomes. We are committed to recruiting, retaining, and developing high-performing, innovative and engaged employees with diverse backgrounds and experiences. This commitment includes providing equal access to, and participation in, equal employment opportunities, programs, and services without regard to race, religion, color, national origin, disability, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, stereotypes, or assumptions based thereon. We welcome and celebrate our teams’ differences, experiences, and beliefs, and we are investing in a more engaged, diverse, and inclusive workforce. 
Ideanomics also fosters a strong corporate culture that promotes high standards of ethics and compliance for our business, including policies that set forth principles to guide employee, officer, director, and vendor conduct, such as our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics. We also maintain a whistleblower policy and anonymous hotline for the confidential reporting of any suspected policy violations or unethical business conduct on the part of our businesses, employees, officers, directors, or vendors.

Environmental, Social and Corporate Governance
Ideanomics published its first ESG Report in January 2021. The report serves as a step in fulfilling our commitment to our employees, our shareholders, our subsidiaries, and our partners. Our dynamic process of incorporating social and environmental 
challenges into our operations as well as creating actionable plans to improve areas of weakness will enable us to grow a stronger, cleaner, and more resilient business. Some ESG highlights this year include:
•Added ESG oversight at the Board level by expanding the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee’s responsibilities and created an ESG Task Force to oversee ESG programs and initiatives. 
•Fortified our Code of Conduct by stating our position against discrimination and corruption, commitment to safe work ecosystems, and fair labor standards. 
•Downsized our corporate offices, significantly reducing our carbon footprint and to making appropriate adjustments for our flexible remote workforce. 
•The 3 “R’s” have never been more important, and we strive to implement Reduce, Reuse, and Recycle wherever possible, including water filters and reusable cups and company supplied water bottles to all employees to encourage minimizing of our footprint. 
•We maintained our optional remote work policy initiated in March 2020. We’ve also expanded our human resource function to expand programs and benefits to ensure our team’s continued well-being, diversity, and professional growth.
•Began partnership with One Tree Planted, a non-profit organization that works with reforestation partners across 43 countries to get trees in the ground. These projects restore forests after fires and floods, create jobs, build communities, and protect habitat for wildlife. As part of our commitment to One Tree Planted, Ideanomics donated more than 2,000 trees in 2021. 
As Ideanomics grows and we implement our ESG platform across our subsidiaries, we will apply best practices to ensure that our partners and suppliers meet both environmental and human rights standards.
