ITEM 1.  BUSINESS 
BAB, Inc. (“the Company”) has three wholly owned subsidiaries: BAB Systems, Inc. (“Systems”), BAB Operations, Inc. (“Operations”) and BAB Investments, Inc. (“Investments”). Systems was incorporated on December 2, 1992, and was primarily established to franchise Big Apple Bagels® (“BAB”) specialty bagel retail stores. My Favorite Muffin (“MFM”) was acquired in 1997 and is included as a part of Systems. Brewster’s (“Brewster’s”) was established in 1996 and the coffee is sold in BAB and MFM locations. SweetDuet® (“SD”) frozen yogurt can be added as an additional brand in a BAB or MFM location. Operations was formed in 1995, primarily to operate Company-owned stores of which there are currently none. The assets of Jacobs Bros. Bagels (“Jacobs Bros.”) were acquired in 1999, and any branded wholesale business uses this trademark. Investments was incorporated in 2009 to be used for the purpose of acquisitions. To date there have been no acquisitions.
The Company was incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware on July 12, 2000.  The Company currently franchises and licenses bagel and muffin retail units under the BAB and MFM trade names. At November 30, 2017, the Company had 82 franchise units and 3 licensed units in operation in 23 states and the United Arab Emirates. There are 2 units under development. The Company additionally derives income from the sale of its trademark bagels, muffins and coffee through nontraditional channels of distribution including under a licensing agreement with Green Beans Coffee. Also, included in licensing fees and other income is Operations Sign Shop results. For franchise consistency and convenience, the Sign Shop provided the majority of signage to franchisees, including but not limited to, menu panels, build charts, interior and exterior signage and point of purchase materials. Beginning in December 2017, a majority of franchise signage and point of sale materials will be outsourced to a printer that will be able to provide consistency and convenience to the franchisees. Outsourcing signage will not have a material effect on revenues or net income. 
The BAB franchised brand consists of units operating as “Big Apple Bagels®,” featuring daily baked bagels, flavored cream cheeses, premium coffees, gourmet bagel sandwiches and other related products. BAB units are primarily concentrated in the Midwest and Western United States. The MFM brand consists of units operating as "My Favorite Muffin®," featuring a large variety of freshly baked muffins, coffees and related products, and units operating as "My Favorite Muffin and Bagel Cafe," featuring these products as well as a variety of specialty bagel sandwiches and related products.  The SweetDuet® brand is a fusion concept, pairing self-serve frozen yogurt with MFM’s exclusive line of My Favorite Muffin gourmet muffins. SD frozen yogurt can be added as an additional brand in a BAB or MFM location. Although the Company doesn't actively market Brewster's stand-alone franchises, Brewster's coffee products are sold in most franchised units. 
 
The Company is leveraging on the natural synergy of distributing muffin products in existing BAB units and, alternatively, bagel products and Brewster's Coffee in existing MFM units. The Company expects to continue to realize efficiencies in servicing the combined base of BAB and MFM franchisees.
 
Net Income
 The Company reported net income of $454,000 and $449,000 for the years ended November 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively. 
 
Food Service Industry 
 Food service businesses are often affected by changes in consumer tastes; national, regional, and local economic conditions; demographic trends; traffic patterns; and the type, number and location of competing restaurants. Multi-unit food service chains, such as the Company's, can also be substantially adversely affected by publicity resulting from problems with food quality, illness, injury or other health concerns or operating issues stemming from one store or a limited number of stores. The food service business is also subject to the risk that shortages or interruptions in supply caused by adverse weather or other conditions could negatively affect the availability, quality and cost of ingredients and other food products. In addition, factors such as inflation, increased food and labor costs, regional weather conditions, availability and cost of suitable sites and the availability of experienced management and hourly employees may also adversely affect the food service industry in general and the Company's results of operations and financial condition in particular.

The Company's current Franchise Disclosure Documents (“FDD”) provides for, among other things, the opportunity for prospective franchisees to enter into a Preliminary Agreement for their first production store. This agreement enables a prospective franchisee a period of 60 days in which to locate a site. The fee for this Preliminary Agreement is $10,000. If a site is not located and approved by the Company within the 60 days, the prospective franchisee will receive a refund of $7,000. If a site is approved, the entire $10,000 will be applied toward the initial franchise fee.  See also last paragraph under "Government Regulation" section in this 10-K. The Company's Franchise Agreement provides a franchisee with the right to develop one store at a specific location. Each Franchise Agreement is for a term of 10 years with the right to renew. Franchisees are expected to be in operation no later than 10 months following the signing of the Franchise Agreement.
 
The Company will recognize revenue upon a signed and completed franchise agreement for a Master Franchise Agreement (“MFA”). The revenue for a MFA is a nonrefundable fee and the amount of the fee is dependent on the area covered by the MFA. In addition there will be ongoing royalty fees as determined by the contract.
 
The Company currently advertises its franchising opportunities in directories, newspapers and the internet. In addition, prospective franchisees contact the Company as a result of patronizing an existing store.
 
COMPETITION
 
The quick service restaurant industry is intensely competitive with respect to product quality, concept, location, service and price. There are a number of national, regional and local chains operating both owned and franchised stores which compete with the Company on a national level or solely in a specific market or region. The Company believes that because the industry is extremely fragmented, there is a significant opportunity for expansion in the bagel, muffin, frozen yogurt and coffee concept chains.
 
The Company believes the primary direct competitors of its bagel units are Panera Bread Company, Bruegger's Bagel Bakery and Einstein Noah Restaurant Group, which operates Einstein Bros. Bagels. There are several other regional bagel chains with fewer than 50 stores, as well as numerous small, independently owned bagel bakeries and national fast food restaurants such as Dunkin’ Donuts and McDonald’s, all of which may compete with the Company. There is no major national competitor in the muffin business, but there are a number of regional and local operators. The Company believes the primary direct competitors for its yogurt concept are Red Mango, Yogurtland and TCBY. There are several regional and a number of local individual operators. Additionally, the Company competes directly with a number of national, regional and local coffee competitors.
 
Other competition includes supermarket bakery sections and prepackaged, fresh and frozen bagels, muffins and yogurt. Certain of these competitors may have greater product and name recognition and larger financial, marketing and distribution capabilities than the Company.  The Company believes the startup costs associated with opening a retail food establishment offering similar products on a stand-alone basis are competitive with the startup costs associated with opening its stores and, accordingly, such startup costs are not an impediment to entry into the retail bagel, muffin, frozen yogurt or coffee businesses.
 
The Company believes that its stores compete favorably in terms of food quality, and taste, convenience and customer service and value, which the Company believes are important factors to its targeted customers.  Competition in the food service industry is often affected by changes in consumer tastes, national, regional and local economic and real estate conditions, demographic trends, traffic patterns, the cost and availability of labor, consumer purchasing power, availability of product and local competitive factors.  The Company attempts to manage or adapt to these factors, but not all such factors are within the Company's control. Such factors could cause the Company and some or all of its franchisees to be adversely affected.
 
The Company competes for qualified franchisees with a wide variety of investment opportunities in the restaurant business, as well as other industries. Investment opportunities in the bagel bakery cafe business include franchises offered by Einstein Noah Restaurant Group, Panera Bread Company and opportunities in the frozen yogurt business, including Red Mango, Yogurtland and TCBY.  The Company's continued success is dependent on its reputation for providing high quality and value with respect to its service, products and franchises. This reputation is affected by the performance of its franchise stores and licensed units that sell branded products over which the Company has limited control.

Any challenge, if successful, in whole or in part, could restrict the Company's use of the names and marks in areas in which the challenger is found to have used the name or mark prior to the Company's use. Any such restriction could limit the expansion of the Company's use of the names or marks into that region, and the Company and its franchisees may be materially and adversely affected.

GOVERNMENT REGULATION
 
The Company is subject to the Trade Regulation Rule of the Federal Trade Commission (the "FTC") entitled “Disclosure Requirements and Prohibitions Concerning Franchising and Business Opportunity Ventures'' (the "FTC Franchise Rule") and state and local laws and regulations that govern the offer, sale and termination of franchises and the refusal to renew franchises. Continued compliance with these broad federal, state and local regulatory networks is essential and costly. The failure to comply with such regulations may have a material adverse effect on the Company and its franchisees. Violations of franchising laws and/or state laws and regulations regulating substantive aspects of doing business in a particular state could limit the Company's ability to sell franchises or subject the Company and its affiliates to rescission offers, monetary damages, penalties, imprisonment and/or injunctive proceedings. In addition, under court decisions in certain states, absolute vicarious liability may be imposed upon franchisors based upon claims made against franchisees.

The Company and its franchisees are required to comply with federal, state and local government regulations applicable to consumer food service businesses, including those relating to the preparation and sale of food, minimum wage requirements, overtime, working and safety conditions, citizenship requirements, as well as regulations relating to zoning, construction, health and business licensing. Each store is subject to regulation by federal agencies and to licensing and regulation by state and local health, sanitation, safety, fire and other departments. Difficulties or failures in obtaining the required licenses or approvals could delay or prevent the opening of a new Company-owned or franchise store, and failure to remain in compliance with applicable regulations could cause the temporary or permanent closing of an existing store. The Company believes that it is in material compliance with these provisions. Continued compliance with these federal, state and local laws and regulations is costly but essential, and failure to comply may have an adverse effect on the Company and its franchisees.

The Company believes its FDD, together with any applicable state versions or supplements, comply with both the FTC guidelines and all applicable state laws regulating franchising in those states in which it has offered franchises.
 
The Company is also subject to a number of state laws, as well as foreign laws (to the extent it offers franchises outside of the United States), that regulate substantive aspects of the franchisor-franchisee relationship, including, but not limited to, those concerning termination and non-renewal of a franchise.
