PART I
 

ITEM 1. | BUSINESS.
--------+----------

Overview
 
Seven Stars Cloud Group, Inc. (NASDAQ: SSC) was incorporated in the State of Nevada on October 19, 2004. Since 2010, it has been a premium content Video On Demand (“VOD”) services provider with primary operations in the People’s Republic of China through its subsidiaries and variable interest entities. It provided premium content and integrated value-added service solutions for the delivery of VOD and paid video programming to digital cable providers, Internet Protocol Television (“IPTV”) providers, Over-the-Top (“OTT”) streaming providers, mobile manufacturers and operators, as well as direct customers.
Starting from 2017, it is aiming to become a next generation Artificial-Intelligent (AI) & Blockchain-Powered, Fintech company. By providing and managing an infrastructure and environment that facilitates the transformation of traditional financial markets such as commodities, currency and credit into the asset digitalization era, SSC hopes to provide asset owners and holders a seamless method and platform for digital asset securitization, tokenization and trading. Separately, SSC is aiming to offer a closed supply chain trading ecosystem for corporate buyers and sellers designed to eliminate standard transactional intermediaries and create a more direct and margin-expanding path for principals.


2017 has been a year of transition from the Company’s legacy business to the Company’s new business.
 
Pertaining to the Company’s efforts to become a next generation Artificial-Intelligent (AI) & Blockchain-Powered, Fintech company, in early Q1 2017, the Company completed the acquisition  of Sun Video Group HK Limited ("SVG"), which had a 51% ownership stake in M.Y. Products, LLC ("MYP"), a global, smart supply chain management operator. Functioning as a global smart supply chain management company, the acquisition was consummated in an effort to support the Company's brand licensing and video commerce business with B2B services. With the aforementioned service offerings under one roof, the Company could now provide Chinese manufacturers the opportunity to improve profitability within the distribution chain and allowing manufacturers to capture more robust margins as well as reapportioning cost savings to marketing and branding, thereby improving revenue volume.
 
Also in early February 2017, the Company announced it had acquired 55% of Wide Angle Group Limited ("WAG"). Coupling WAG's capabilities and offerings with those already existing under the SVG/MYP deal, including Supply Chain Management, Manufacturer Sourcing, Supply Chain Financing, VR (virtual reality)-Enabled Commerce Technology and AI-driven Big Data Technology Management, the Company was seeking to creating a diversified and robust business division, separate from the VOD business.
 
For 2017, through the acquisition and operation of the SVG and WAG the two current revenue sources were initiated. They are supply chain management & structured finance and alternative finance & carry trade businesses. The Company is currently primarily engaged with consumer electronics and smart supply chain management operations. Our end customers include about 15 to 20 corporations across the world. Starting from October 2017, through partnership with another business partner, our newly controlled Singapore joint venture has been conducting oil trading business in Singapore. Other than the trading business that Company already operated in 2017, the Company also intends to run the engine upon its Venus blockchain based platform, which includes TPaaS & VPaaS system. As of fourth quarter of 2017, TPaaS system went into trial operation. A significant portion of our operations will consist of these new lines of business, however since these are new business lines, customer demand is in the process of being validated, and the global regulatory environment is constantly adapting to these new fintech products and technologies. As a result, it is not possible to make a definitive prediction on the rate of growth and profitability of these operations at this time. These services will be offered globally from our New York and China offices.
 
As part of our overall strategy, the Company is focused on trying to establish 4 digital asset product categories which are expected to trade on 4 digital asset global trading platforms and exchanges and are expected to be distributed and monetized through 4 digital asset global partner sales and monetization networks.
 
The 4 digital asset product categories are expected to be (i) financial, (ii) vertical industry, (iii) consumer and (iv) media. The products within these groups are in development and are expected to represent new digital financial assets that can be used for store of value, application platform-based transactions, supply chain transactions, transaction incentivization, and general payments. By nature, their storage and transactability in the various use cases that they are created and are expected to produce new value and fungibility with other digital assets and in some cases, fiat currency.
 
The 4 digital asset global trading platforms and exchanges are expected to be:
 

i. | Global Financial Digital Asset Exchange Groups
---+-----------------------------------------------


ii. | Global Vertical Industry Digital Asset Exchange Groups
----+-------------------------------------------------------


iii. | Global Consumer Digital Asset Exchange Groups
-----+----------------------------------------------


iv. | Global Media Digital Asset Exchange Groups
----+-------------------------------------------

 
Our digital asset trading platforms are expected to represent owned and partner exchanges that will support our digital asset products.
 
The 4 digital asset global partner sales and monetization networks are expected to be:
 

i. | GenXPlus (rebranded from NextGen X)
---+------------------------------------


ii. | Redrock Global Capital
----+-----------------------


iii. | Partnerships with highly scalable, transparent and decentralized digital asset exchange platforms
-----+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


iv. | Launch of highly scalable, transparent and decentralized financial exchange partner platforms
----+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Company’s global partner sales and monetization networks are expected to enable the unlocking of value through fractionalization, tokenization and securitization of assets in digital form.
 
Our digital asset trading platforms are expected to represent owned and partner exchanges that will support our digital asset products.
 
In support of the Company’s overall strategy, in August 2017, the Company subscribed to a strategic investment of US$250,000 in the Delaware Board of Trade Holdings, Inc. (“DBOT”) to acquire 187,970 common shares. DBOT is an SEC recognized Alternative Trading System, which SSC believes can be developed into a distributed network. On December 18, 2017, the Company subscribed for another 27% purchase of DBOT, which would make the Company the largest shareholder of DBOT, and as part of this purchase, the Company’s President, Robert G. Benya, is expected to become a DBOT Board Director. DBOT (http://dbottrading.com/) operates three business lines: (i) DBOT ATS LLC, a FINRA Member Firm, a member of the Securities Investor Protection Corporation ("SIPC") and an SEC recognized fully automated, auto-execution Alternative Trading System ("ATS"); (ii) DBOT Issuer Services LLC, focused on setting and maintaining issuer standards, as well as the provision of issuer services to DBOT designated issuers; and (iii) DBOT Technology Services LLC, focused on the provision of market data and marketplace connectivity. These transactions are still pending and have not yet closed. These transactions will not close until DBOT gets FINRA’s approval. We will not be able to consolidate the results of DBOT.
 
Also, in support of the Company’s overall strategy, on October 19, 2017 the Company announced an agreement to establish a Joint Venture, BBD Digital Capital Group Ltd ("BDCG"), with management partners Tiger Sports Media Limited and Seasail Ventures Limited, ("Seasail") an affiliate of parent company BBD (https://en.bbdservice.com/introduction). The BDCG will focus on artificial intelligence-driven financial data services as well as transactional platforms for index, futures and derivative trading, for both global commodity and energy clients. By leveraging Seasail's technology, BDCG will look to capitalize on commodity and energy provider's needs for more precise risk management services, more informed operational planning and more strategic decision-making, specifically as they all relate to the trading of index, futures and commodities. In December 2017, the Company acquired 20% equity interest of BDCG from Tiger Sports Media Limited, which gave the Company 60% total equity interest, and BDCG would become one subsidiary of the Company. The valuation report of BDCG was received post-signing of the BDCG Purchase Agreement with both parties agreeing that there is no obligation to close the Transaction until a satisfactory valuation report has been received, evaluated and approved by the Company’s Audit Committee. On April 24, 2018, the Audit Committee approved the satisfactory valuation report provided by an independent third party and closed this transaction.

VIE Structure and Arrangements

To comply with PRC laws and regulations that prohibit or restrict foreign ownership of companies that provide value-added telecommunication services, we provide services through Sinotop Beijing and SSF, which hold the licenses and approvals to provide digital distribution and Internet content services in the PRC. We have the ability to control Sinotop Beijing and SSF through a series of contractual agreements, as described below, entered into among YOD WFOE, YOD Hong Kong, Sinotop Beijing, SSF and the respective legal shareholders of Sinotop Beijing and SSF.
 
Through these contractual arrangements, we have acquired both control over and rights to, 100% of the economic benefit of Sinotop Beijing and SSF. Accordingly, Sinotop Beijing and SSF are each considered a variable interest entity, or VIE, and are therefore consolidated in our financial statements. Pursuant to the below contractual agreements, YOD WFOE can have the assets transferred freely out of each VIE without any restrictions. Therefore, YOD WFOE considers that there is no asset of the respective VIE that can be used only to settle obligation of such VIE, except for the registered capital of each respective VIE, amounting to RMB10.6 million (or approximately $1.6 million) for Sinotop Beijing as of December 31, 2017, and RMB 27.6 million (or approximately $4.2 million) has been injected as of December 31, 2017. As Sinotop Beijing and SSF are incorporated as limited liability companies under PRC Company Law, creditors of these two entities do not have recourse to the general credit of other entities of the Company.

In addition to VIE agreements described above, the Company’s subsidiary and the parent company of YOD WFOE, YOU On Demand (Asia) Limited, a company incorporated under the laws of Hong Kong (“YOD Hong Kong”) has entered into a Management Services Agreement with each VIE.
 
Pursuant to such Management Services Agreement, YOD Hong Kong has the exclusive right to provide to the VIE management, financial and other services related to the operation of the VIE’s business, and the VIE is required to take all commercially reasonable efforts to permit and facilitate the provision of the services by YOD Hong Kong.

YOD Hong Kong may also request ad hoc quarterly payments of the aggregate fee, which payments will be credited against the VIE’s future payment obligations.
 
In addition, at the sole discretion of YOD Hong Kong, the VIE is obligated to transfer to YOD Hong Kong, or its designee, any part or all of the business, personnel, assets and operations of the VIE which may be lawfully conducted, employed, owned or operated by YOD Hong Kong, including:

The term of each Management Services Agreement is 20 years, and may not be terminated by the VIE, except with the consent of, or a material breach by, YOD Hong Kong.
 
Loan Agreement
 
Pursuant to the Loan Agreement among YOD WFOE and the nominee shareholders, YOD WFOE agrees to lend RMB 19.8 million and RMB 0.2 million, respectively, to the nominee shareholders of SSF for the purpose of establishing SSF and for development of its business. As of December 31, 2017, RMB 27.6 million ($4.2 million) and RMB nil have been lent to Lan Yang and Yun Zhu, respectively. Lan Yang has contributed all of the RMB 27.6 million ($4.2 million) in the form of capital contribution and accordingly the loan is eliminated with the capital of SSF upon consolidation. The loan can only be repaid by a transfer by the nominee shareholders of their equity interests in SSF to YOD WFOE or YOD WFOE’s designated persons, through (i) YOD WFOE having the right, but not the obligation to at any time purchase, or authorize a designated person to purchase, all or part of the Nominee Shareholders’ equity interests in SSF at such price as YOD WFOE shall determine (the “Transfer Price”), (ii) all monies received by the nominee shareholders through the payment of the Transfer Price being used solely to repay YOD WFOE for the loans, and (iii) if the Transfer Price exceeds the principal amount of the loans, the amount in excess of the principal amount of the loans being deemed as interest payable on the loans, and to be payable to YOD WFOE in cash.

Our Industry (For the Supply Chain Finance & Management Businesses)

As discussed in the Overview above, our business ecosystem is based on seven product engines, and plan to launch respective product engines in full as high priorities by the management. For 2017, only engine seven was operational. There are two revenue sources for engine seven “Supply Chain Finance and Management for Vertical Products”. They are supply chain management & structured finance and alternative finance & carry trade businesses. We intend to run the engine upon its Venus blockchain based platform, which includes TPaaS & VPaaS system. As of fourth quarter of 2017, TPaaS system went into trial operation. In 2018, we intend to strengthen our engine seven operation by including among other things i) Venus platform fully operational, and ii) establishing blockchain based supply chain finance model.
Supply Chain Management & Structured Finance
 
The growth rate of supply chain finance volume in developed countries is 10%-30% in 2011, while the growth rate of that in emerging economies in China and India is 20%-25%. Financing for small and medium-sized enterprises has always been difficult around the globe, especially during expanded reproduction period. As most small and medium-sized corporate issuers are not qualified to issue under regular asset backed securities and asset backed notes products on national credit market, innovative structured financing tools such as asset-backed specific plan scheme plays a key role as complementary financing tools in helping those firms to meet their potential financing needs. Also according to “2015-2020 China’s supply chain finance market forward-looking research report published by “Zhiyan Consulting”, it forecasts that China's supply chain finance market size will reach 15 trillion by 2020.
Alternative Finance & Carry Trade
 
Growth in global alternative finance market is accelerating and China is still dominating. By 2015, global market reached 918 billion RMB while China market reached 673.5 billion RMB. By the end of 2016, China market increased from about 673.5 billion RMB in 2015 to 1,603 billion RMB in 2016, accounting for 99.2% of the total Asian financial market, and an estimated 85% of the total global market in 2016.1
 
China is currently dominated by non-business alternative finance, which totaled 928 billion RMB in 2016 led by peer-to-peer consumer lending. However, it is likely that a sizable proportion of consumers in China are using personal loans for business purposes. Of which, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are increasingly turning to alternative sources of financing. In China, micro, small and medium-sized enterprises, which make up 99% of registered companies, are the most active forces in China and they are playing an important role in promoting economy, increasing taxation revenue and stabilizing employment rate. However, only 10% of SMEs are able to get financing from banks, and over 80% are relying on alternative financing sources, especially in the commodities trade market. 2
 
From Carry Trade’s perspective, the RMB exchange rate is close to the highest level since October 2017, the expected volatility is near the lowest level in two consecutive years, and the interest rate is relatively high because of government’s deleveraging measures. Chinese currency has become Asia’s the most attractive carry trade over the same period of time.3

Our Competition (For the Supply Chain Finance & Management Businesses)
 
In recent years, the market for supply chain finance business is faced with increasingly aggressive competitions. Our primary competitors are mainly from supply chain finance solutions providers in the B2B Supply Chain marketplace. Specifically, in terms of the commodities global trade market, our major competitors are primarily engaged in import/export finance through buying/selling commodity flows from global companies, financing for lower credit rated SME and asset liability management funding for bank treasuries using commodity trade flows SSC is aiming to strengthen competitiveness in utilizing dynamic ontology based methodology and Fintech powered risk management tools to rate and evaluate risks inherent in those borrowers distinguishes us from those competitors.

Our Employees
 
As of December 31, 2017, we had a total of 70 full-time employees including three located in the United States. The following table sets forth the number of our employees by function on December 31, 2017.

Function | Number of Employees
---------------------------------+--------------------
Business Development | 15 
Project Management and Operation | 11 
Technology | 23 
Finance and Legal | 12 
Human Resource | 3 
Administrative | 6 
TOTAL | 70 

 
Our employees are not represented by a labor organization or covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We have not experienced any work stoppages.
 
We are required under PRC law to make contributions to employee benefit plans at specified percentages of employee salary. In addition, we are required by the PRC law to cover employees in China with various types of social insurance. We believe that we are in compliance with the relevant PRC laws.
 
Seasonality
 
Our operating results and operating cash flows historically for our legacy YOD business have not been subject to seasonal variations. However, we expect a disproportionate amount of our revenues generated from Wecast Services quarter over quarter to be subject to seasoned fluctuations at holiday periods and due to introduction of new products. This pattern may change, however, as a result of new market opportunities or new product introductions.
Regulation
 
General Regulation of Businesses
 
We are required to obtain government approval from the Ministry of Commerce of the People’s Republic of China (“MOFCOM”), and other government agencies in China for transactions such as our acquisition or disposition of business entities in China. Additionally, foreign ownership of business and assets in China is not permitted without specific government approval. For this reason, Sinotop Beijing was acquired through our acquisition of YOD Hong Kong, which controls Sinotop Beijing through a series of contractual agreements with YOD Hong Kong and YOD WFOE. We use voting control agreements among the parties so as to obtain equitable and legal ownership or control of our subsidiaries and VIEs to conduct our legacy YOD business.

Investment activities in China by foreign investors are principally governed by the Guidance Catalogue of Industries for Foreign Investment, or the Catalogue, which was promulgated and is amended from time to time by the MOFCOM and the National Development and Reform Commission. The Catalogue sets forth the industries in which foreign investments are "encouraged", "restricted", or "prohibited". Industries that are not listed in any of the above three categories are permitted areas for foreign investments and are generally open to foreign investment unless specifically restricted by other PRC regulations. Establishment of wholly foreign-owned enterprises is generally allowed in encouraged and permitted industries. Foreign investors are not allowed to invest in industries in the prohibited category.
 
According to the latest version of the Catalogue, which came into effect on July 28, 2017, foreign investments in value-added telecommunications services (except for e-commerce) are "restricted". Therefore, we provide value-added telecommunications services through our VIE in China.
 
Other than value-added telecommunications, most of our PRC subsidiaries mainly engage in technical services, consultations and trading activities, which are "encouraged" under the latest version of the Catalogue.
 
Under PRC law, the establishment of a wholly foreign-owned enterprise is subject to the approval of or filing with the MOFCOM or its local counterparts and the wholly foreign-owned enterprise must register with the competent industry and commerce bureau. Our significant PRC subsidiaries have duly obtained all material approvals required for their business operations.
 
Foreign direct investment in telecommunications companies in China is governed by the Regulations for the Administration of Foreign-Invested Telecommunications Enterprises, which was promulgated by the State Council on December 11, 2001 and recently amended on February 6, 2016. The regulations provide that a foreign investor's beneficial equity ownership in an entity providing value-added telecommunications services in China is not permitted to exceed 50%. In addition, the main foreign investor who invests in a foreign-invested value-added telecommunications enterprise operating the value-added telecommunications business in China must demonstrate a good track record and experience in operating a value-added telecommunications business, provided such investor is a major one among the foreign investors investing in a value-added telecommunications enterprise in China. Moreover, foreign investors that meet these requirements must obtain approvals from the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, or the MIIT, and the MOFCOM, or their authorized local counterparts, which retain considerable discretion in granting approvals, for its commencement of value-added telecommunications business in China.
 
The MIIT's Notice Regarding Strengthening Administration of Foreign Investment in Operating Value-Added Telecommunication Businesses, or the MIIT Notice, issued on July 13, 2006 prohibits holders of these services licenses from leasing, transferring or selling their licenses in any form, or providing any resources, sites or facilities, to any foreign investors intending to conduct such businesses in China.
 
The PRC market in which the we operate our legacy YOD business poses certain macro-economic and regulatory risks and uncertainties. These uncertainties extend to the ability of us to conduct wireless telecommunication services through contractual arrangements in the PRC since the industry remains highly regulated. We conduct those operations in China through a series of contractual arrangements entered among YOD WFOE, Sinotop Beijing as the parent company of Zhong Hai Media, SSF and the respective legal shareholders of Sinotop Beijing and SSF. We believe that these contractual arrangements are in compliance with PRC law and are legally enforceable. If Sinotop Beijing, SSF or their respective legal shareholders fail to perform the obligations under the contractual arrangements or any dispute relating to these contracts remains unresolved, YOD WFOE or YOD HK can enforce its rights under the VIE contracts through PRC law and courts. However, uncertainties in the PRC legal system could limit the Company’s ability to enforce these contractual arrangements. In particular, the interpretation and enforcement of these laws, rules and regulations involve uncertainties. If YOD WFOE had direct ownership of Sinotop Beijing and SSF, it would be able to exercise its rights as a shareholder to effect changes in the board of directors of Sinotop Beijing or SSF, which in turn could effect changes at the management level, subject to any applicable fiduciary obligations. However, under the current contractual arrangements, the Company relies on Sinotop Beijing, SSF and their respective legal shareholders to perform their contractual obligations to exercise effective control. The Company also gives no assurance that PRC government authorities will not take a view in the future that is contrary to the opinion of the Company. If the current ownership structure of the Company and its contractual arrangements with the VIEs and their equity holders were found to be in violation of any existing or future PRC laws or regulations, the Company’s ability to conduct its business could be impacted and the Company may be required to restructure its ownership structure and operations in the PRC to comply with the changes in the PRC laws which may result in deconsolidation of the VIEs.

In addition, the telecommunications, information and media industries remain highly regulated. Restrictions are currently in place and are unclear with respect to which segments of these industries foreign owned entities, like YOD WFOE, may operate. The PRC government may issue from time to time new laws or new interpretations on existing laws to regulate areas such as telecommunications, information and media, some of which are not published on a timely basis or may have retroactive effect. For example, there is substantial uncertainty regarding the Draft Foreign Investment Law, including, among others, what the actual content of the law will be as well as the adoption and effective date of the final form of the law. Administrative and court proceedings in China may also be protracted, resulting in substantial costs and diversion of resources and management attention. While such uncertainty exists, we cannot assure that the new laws, when it is adopted and becomes effective, and potential related administrative proceedings will not have a material and adverse effect on our ability to control the affiliated entities through the contractual arrangements. Regulatory risk also encompasses the interpretation by the tax authorities of current tax laws, and our legal structure and scope of operations in the PRC, which could be subject to further restrictions resulting in limitations on our ability to conduct business in the PRC.
 
Our Digital Asset Trading Platforms represent owned and partner exchanges that will support our Digital Asset Products. These exchanges will in the future exist in various sovereign jurisdictions. Once operational, the Company and the DBOT ATS shall comply with the requirements for alternative trading systems, unless an exemption is available. These requirements include registering the alternative trading system as a broker-dealer.

Taxation
 
On March 16, 2007, the National People’s Congress of China passed the EIT Law, and on November 28, 2007, the State Council of China passed its implementing rules which took effect on January 1, 2008. The EIT Law and its implementing rules impose a unified earned income tax (“EIT”) rate of 25.0% on all domestic-invested enterprises and foreign invested enterprises (“FIEs”) unless they qualify under certain limited exceptions. In addition, under the EIT Law, an enterprise established outside of China with “de facto management bodies” within China is considered a resident enterprise and will normally be subject to an EIT of 25% on its global income. The implementing rules define the term “de facto management bodies” as “an establishment that exercises, in substance, overall management and control over the production, business, personnel, accounting, etc., of a Chinese enterprise.” If the PRC tax authorities subsequently determine that we should be classified as a resident enterprise, then our organization’s global income will be subject to PRC income tax of 25%. For detailed discussion of PRC tax issues related to resident enterprise status, see “Risk Factors - Risks Related to Doing Business in China - Under the New Enterprise Income Tax Law, we may be classified as a “resident enterprise” of China.” Such classification will likely result in unfavorable tax consequences to us and our non-PRC shareholders.”
 
On December 22, 2017 the U.S. Tax Reform, which among other effects, reduces the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate to 21% from 34% (or 35% in certain cases) beginning in 2018, requires companies to pay a one-time transition tax on certain unrepatriated earnings from non-U.S. subsidiaries that is payable over eight years, makes the receipt of future non-U.S. sourced income of non-U.S. subsidiaries tax-free to U.S. companies and creates a new minimum tax on the earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries relating to the parent’s deductions for payments to the subsidiaries. U.S. Tax Reform, also eliminates the expiration date for U.S. net operating loss carryovers (NOLs”). Such carryovers may now be carried forward indefinitely rather than for 20 years. In addition, NOLs can only be used to offset 80% of taxable income in any single year.
 
Foreign Currency Exchange
 
Approximately 50% of our gross profit and most expenses are denominated in RMB. Under the PRC foreign currency exchange regulations applicable to us, RMB is convertible for current account items, including the distribution of dividends, interest payments, trade and service-related foreign exchange transactions. Currently, our PRC operating entities may purchase foreign currencies for settlement of current account transactions, including payments of dividends to us, without the approval of the PRC State Administration of Foreign Exchange (“SAFE”), by complying with certain procedural requirements. Conversion of RMB for capital account items, such as direct investment, loan, security investment and repatriation of investment, however, is still subject to the approval of SAFE. In particular, if our PRC operating entities borrow foreign currency through loans from us or other foreign lenders, these loans must be registered with SAFE, and if we finance the subsidiaries by means of additional capital contributions, these capital contributions must be approved by certain government authorities, including the MOFCOM, or their respective local branches. These limitations could affect our PRC operating entities’ ability to obtain foreign exchange through debt or equity financing.
Dividend Distributions
 
Approximately 50% of our gross profit are earned by our PRC entities. However, PRC regulations restrict the ability of our PRC entities to make dividends and other payments to their offshore parent company. PRC legal restrictions permit payments of dividends by our PRC entities only out of their accumulated after-tax profits, if any, determined in accordance with PRC accounting standards and regulations. Each of our PRC subsidiaries is also required under PRC laws and regulations to allocate at least 10% of our annual after-tax profits determined in accordance with PRC GAAP to a statutory general reserve fund until the amounts in such fund reaches 50% of its registered capital. These reserves are not distributable as cash dividends. Our PRC subsidiaries have the discretion to allocate a portion of their after-tax profits to staff welfare and bonus funds, which may not be distributed to equity owners except in the event of liquidation.
 
In addition, under the new EIT law, the Notice of the State Administration of Taxation on Negotiated Reduction of Dividends and Interest Rates (“Notice 112”), which was issued on January 29, 2008, and the Notice of the State Administration of Taxation Regarding Interpretation and Recognition of Beneficial Owners under Tax Treaties (“Notice 601”), which became effective on October 27, 2009, dividends from our PRC operating subsidiaries paid to us through our entities will be subject to a withholding tax at a rate of 10%. Furthermore, the ultimate tax rate will be determined by treaty between the PRC and the tax residence of the holder of the PRC subsidiary. Dividends declared and paid from before January 1, 2008 on distributable profits are grandfathered under the EIT Law and are not subject to withholding tax.
 
The Company intends on reinvesting profits, if any, and does not intend on making cash distributions of dividends in the near future.
