Item 1. Business.
Overview
We are a biopharmaceutical company creating next generation immunotherapies for cancer, inflammation, and autoimmunity using de novo protein design technology. We use sophisticated computational methods to design proteins that demonstrate specific pharmaceutical properties that provide potentially superior therapeutic benefit over native proteins. Existing protein engineering treatments generally involve the modification of native proteins. With our proprietary platform, which we refer to as our Neoleukin platform, we design new protein scaffolds from the ground up, capable of demonstrating specific biological properties. Through this method we are able to produce proteins that, while resembling native proteins, may have novel molecular interfaces, differential activation of specific cell types, increased stability, or improved biodistribution compared to native proteins in order to deliver greater therapeutic benefit. De novo proteins have the capacity to be cytokine receptor agonists, antagonists, or result in conditional activation of specific cytokine receptors such that they may regulate inflammation or the immune response to cancer and inflammatory conditions. We are initially focused on key cytokine mimetics, which we refer to as Neoleukin de novo cytokine mimetics. Neoleukin de novo cytokine mimetics can be modified to adjust affinity, thermodynamic stability, resistance to biochemical modification, pharmacokinetic characteristics, and targeting to tumor or inflamed tissues.
Our lead product candidate, NL-201, is a de novo protein designed to mimic the therapeutic activity of the cytokines interleukin-2, or IL-2, and interleukin-15, or IL-15, for the potential treatment of various types of cancer, including renal cell carcinoma, or RCC, melanoma, and hematological malignancies, while limiting the toxicity caused by the preferential binding of native IL-2 and IL-15 to non-target cells. In preclinical studies, a closely-related precursor to NL-201 demonstrated higher levels of activity and lower toxicity in multiple murine solid tumor syngeneic models as compared to recombinant, native IL-2. 
De Novo Protein Design Technology
Our Neoleukin platform uses a set of advanced computational algorithms and methods to design functional de novo proteins. A protein is generally defined as one or more chains of covalently-linked amino acids – totaling at least 50 amino acids – that assemble into a 3-dimensional structure. Human cells contain tens of thousands of different proteins; however this is still only a small subset of all possible amino acid sequences that can be assembled to form a protein. While protein engineering to date has largely been conducted through the modification of native proteins, with our Neoleukin platform we are able to explore the full sequence space, guided by the physical principles that underlie protein folding, and design functional proteins from the ground up. Our de novo proteins fit the above definition of a protein, but, unlike native proteins, are designed using our proprietary computational algorithms and methods. Successful de novo protein design is a cutting-edge process that requires both the advanced computational tools and deep insight into how a sequence of amino acids will fold into a stable 3-dimensional protein.
To design a Neoleukin de novo cytokine mimetic using our Neoleukin platform, we begin with an accurate model of the biological target. This is typically a high-resolution crystal structure but may instead be a computationally-modeled structure. Then, critical points of contact between molecular interfaces are identified so that essential interactions can be maintained or strengthened, and undesirable interactions can be avoided. Next, we use a computational algorithm to build idealized 3-dimensional topologies of the biological target and the Neoleukin de novo cytokine mimetic. Finally, we use a separate computational algorithm to select amino acids for each position within the idealized 3-dimensional topologies that maximizes interactions at the desired interface and the thermodynamic stability of the resulting protein. These amino acid sequences are then expressed in bacteria, tested in our laboratory, and further modified to optimize the final sequence. The resulting protein is unlike anything that exists in nature and can be fine-tuned to improve on the desired biological activity.
While we are currently focused on the design of Neoleukin de novo cytokine mimetics, we believe this approach could be used broadly to widen the therapeutic window and improve drug-like characteristics of therapeutic proteins, including chemical stability, pharmacokinetic properties, or novel routes of administration. Furthermore, we believe that the Neoleukin platform can also be used to generate de novo proteins that inhibit activation of specific receptors, a property that could be valuable for treatment of inflammatory or autoimmune conditions. Computational design of therapeutic proteins is in a very early stage of development. The potential is vast, and we are focused on continuing to improve the technology and realizing the tremendous potential of de novo protein design to improve human health.
Our Strategy
Our business model is focused on three primary goals:
•Develop proprietary de novo protein immunotherapies for the treatment of cancer and inflammatory conditions;
•Become the leader in de novo protein design for therapeutic applications by strengthening our intellectual property, including know-how; and
•Collaborate with leading biotechnology, pharmaceutical, and academic partners to expand the scope and application of our platform.
The key elements of our strategy are:
•Rapidly advance NL-201 to clinical proof-of-concept. NL-201 is our lead product candidate and we believe it is the first entirely de novo therapeutic protein to be evaluated in a clinical setting. In 2021, we initiated a Phase 1 clinical trial in patients with advanced, relapsed, or refractory solid tumors. The Phase 1 trial is currently ongoing with interim data expected in the second half of 2022. We also plan to expand our ongoing trial of NL-201 by adding a combination arm with Merck's KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab) in mid-2022. In addition, we plan to initiate a Phase 1 clinical trial in hematological malignancies with NL-201 in 2022. 
•Generate preclinical data for additional product candidates. Our research activities are currently focused on the development of novel de novo cytokine receptor agonists and antagonists to expand our pipeline. We are currently optimizing and evaluating several early research projects as potential clinical candidates. We initially intend to develop de novo protein therapeutics to address significant unmet medical needs in oncology, inflammation, and autoimmune indications.
•Expand the capabilities of the Neoleukin platform. De novo protein design is in the early stages of development and has the potential to generate therapeutics to treat a wide range of human diseases. We believe that there will be a rapid evolution in the enabling technology, such that it will be feasible to design more complex and dynamic proteins in the future. We intend to devote a significant amount of resources to building our talent, methods, and infrastructure in order to position Neoleukin as a leader in the design and development of de novo protein therapeutics.
•Build partnerships to leverage the Neoleukin platform. There is substantial interest in the field of de novo protein design for therapeutic applications. We intend to seek partners that can provide additional resources and expertise to further advance our pipeline and broaden our potential targets. We may also strategically pursue one or more collaborations to design, out-license, or co-develop de novo proteins.
NL-201
Our lead product candidate, NL-201, is an IL-2/IL-15 immunotherapy designed to eliminate binding to the alpha subunit of the IL-2 receptor (also known as CD25) while enhancing binding to the beta and gamma subunits. In multiple preclinical animal models, a precursor to NL-201, demonstrated substantial antitumor activity without detectable binding to CD25, as compared to native IL-2. Following these preclinical studies, we further refined our precursor to extend its half-life, resulting in the NL-201 product candidate. We have since completed multi-dose, non-GLP and GLP toxicology studies of NL-201 in rats and non-human primates, as well as initiated a first in-human clinical trial. This included completion of GLP in-life dosing with no unexpected toxicities observed. NL-201 is intended to be used as either a single-agent or in combination with complementary therapeutic modalities, including checkpoint inhibitors. In addition, we believe NL-201 holds promise in combination with cell therapy to expand and maintain populations of transplanted CAR-T and natural killer, or NK, cells.
IL-2 is one of the few immuno-oncology drugs with demonstrated activity as a single agent. IL-2 has a confirmed mechanism of action for treating tumors; however, it has encountered issues as a therapeutic due to the biased activation of cells that contain CD25. CD25 induces conformational changes in IL-2 that enable high-affinity binding to the beta and gamma subunits of the IL-2 receptor. Preferential binding to endothelial cells expressing CD25 is believed to exacerbate vascular leak syndrome, while preferential activation of CD25-expressing regulatory T cells can inhibit anti-cancer immune responses. Due to IL-2’s potential for high toxicity, with vascular leak syndrome and cytokine storm being frequent side effects, and reduced efficacy over time, its use as a therapeutic has been limited. Further, low-dose treatments have generally been insufficient to demonstrate therapeutic activity.
While the problem posed by IL-2 is well understood, it has been difficult to modify native IL-2 to retain potent activation of IL-2 receptor signaling while eliminating binding to CD25. Instead of modifying native IL-2, computational methods were used to design a new sequence with the proper intermolecular interactions to efficiently bind the beta and gamma subunits while eliminating CD25 binding. As opposed to traditional recombinant protein therapeutics, de novo proteins are entirely novel sequences with limited homology to native proteins. While there is a potential that patients may mount an anti-drug immune response against NL-201, we believe that this risk may be mitigated by several factors, including the stability of the protein and its resistance to proteolytic degradation.
Immunotherapy Market Overview
Over the past several decades, the potential of the immune system to control and/or eliminate cancer has been better understood and appreciated. Immunotherapies, including allogeneic stem cell transplantation, checkpoint inhibitors, and cellular therapies have led to impressive improvements in patient outcomes. Immunotherapy is one of the fastest growing segments of the oncology market and immune checkpoint inhibitors are one of the most widely used classes of cancer immunotherapy. Checkpoint inhibitors promote an anti-cancer immune response by blocking inhibitory signals between cancer cells and the immune microenvironment. Patients with metastatic cancers, who previously had generally poor prognoses, now have the opportunity to achieve durable responses with checkpoint inhibitors. The initial drug in this class, ipilimumab, was approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, in 2011. Since that time, many additional checkpoint inhibitors have been approved by the FDA. In addition to checkpoint inhibitors, other notable cancer immunotherapies expected to improve cancer outcomes over the next decade include bi-specific T-cell engagers, immune agonists, and cellular therapies.
Limitations of Current Treatments
Despite achieving success in a subset of patients, checkpoint inhibitors often fail to control tumor growth. In addition, some patients do not tolerate checkpoint inhibitor therapy regimens. While checkpoint inhibitors work to block the mechanisms by which malignant cells evade immunological surveillance by anti-cancer T cells, they are less effective in patients who lack a favorable tumor microenvironment, expression of the inhibitory ligand, or sufficient tumor-specific antigens. For these patients, novel approaches to immunotherapy are needed that complement and/or enhance checkpoint inhibition. What is needed is a new class of agents that activate immune cells in the tumor microenvironment.
We believe that stimulation of the IL-2 and IL-15 pathways is an attractive approach to generate an anti-cancer immune response because it promotes the proliferation and activation of both CD8+ effector T cells and NK cells. Recombinant human IL-2, or aldesleukin, is a proven therapy and is approved for the treatment of adults with metastatic RCC or metastatic melanoma. However, significant toxicity has resulted in multiple boxed warnings in the labeling, including a requirement that administration occur in the hospital under supervision of an experienced physician. As a result of these toxicities, aldesleukin is not frequently used clinically. In addition, aldesleukin has a relatively modest rate of durable remissions, potentially because it preferentially stimulates the proliferation of regulatory T cells, which can inhibit the antitumor response. We believe there is a clear clinical need for an agent that stimulates an immunological response to cancer with greater selectivity and less toxicity than aldesleukin.
Ongoing Clinical Development
NL-201 is currently being evaluated in a Phase 1 clinical trial in advanced solid tumors. The Phase 1 clinical trial is planned to enroll up to 120 patients with advanced, relapsed, or refractory solid tumors. Patients will receive monotherapy, intravenous NL-201 and may continue treatment until disease progression. The trial is assessing safety, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, immunogenicity, and antitumor activity. When the recommended dose and schedule are determined, we expect to enroll indication-specific expansion cohorts of patients with renal cell carcinoma and melanoma. The trial is being conducted at multiple sites in North America and Australia.
In addition to our ongoing Phase 1 clinical trial of NL-201 for advanced solid tumors, we plan to initiate a Phase 1 clinical trial of NL-201 in hematological malignancies in 2022. NL-201 has also shown potential for enhanced antitumor activity in preclinical studies when combined with other therapies such as checkpoint inhibitors, CAR-T cell therapy, and tumor-targeting antibodies. On January 10, 2022, we announced a clinical collaboration with Merck to evaluate NL-201 in combination with KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab). We plan to amend the ongoing solid tumor trial in order to add a pembrolizumab combination arm with up to an additional 132 patients.
UW License Agreement
On July 8, 2019, Neoleukin Therapeutics, Inc., or Former Neoleukin, entered into an Exclusive License Agreement with the University of Washington, or UW, under which UW (on behalf of itself and Stanford University) granted us an exclusive worldwide license under certain patent rights, to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, offer to lease or lease, import, export or otherwise offer to dispose of licensed products in all fields of use, and a nonexclusive worldwide license to use certain know-how. The foregoing licenses may be sublicensed by us without UW’s consent, subject to certain limited conditions. We assumed the benefits and obligations of the Exclusive License Agreement in connection with the completion of the merger of Former Neoleukin into the Company. The Exclusive License Agreement was amended effective as of July 24, 2020 to, among other things, (i) add a jointly owned patent application family directed to de novo cytokine antagonists to the agreement, (ii) specify royalties, milestone payments and sublicense consideration payments payable by Neoleukin for licensed products under certain patent rights related to the jointly owned patent application, (iii) specify the term for achievement of performance milestones for licensed products under certain patents rights related to the jointly owned patent application, and (iv) terminate UW’s right to participate in equity financings. The Exclusive License Agreement was amended a second time, effective as of December 15, 2021 to, among other things, add a second jointly owned patent application family directed to de novo cytokine antagonists to the agreement subject to the same terms of the first jointly owned patent application family. 
As consideration for the licensed rights, Former Neoleukin issued shares of common stock to UW, representing five percent of its fully-diluted capitalization on the date on which the Exclusive License Agreement was executed. Additionally, we are required to pay UW: (i) an annual maintenance fee starting in January 2022 (but excluding any year in which minimum annual royalties are paid); (ii) up to $875,000 in combined development and regulatory milestone payments with respect to each distinct class of licensed product; (iii) up to $10.0 million in combined commercial milestone payments based on cumulative net sales of licensed products within each distinct class of licensed product; (iv) a low single digit royalty on net sales of licensed products sold by us and our sublicensees, which may be subject to reductions, and subject to minimum annual royalty payments following the first commercial sale of a licensed product; (v) a certain percentage of any sublicense consideration (other than royalties) we receive from sublicensees, ranging from 50% to low single digit percentages based on the stage of development at the time the sublicense is executed; and (vi) a certain percentage of consideration we receive from an acquisition of us or our assets, ranging from 50% to zero based on the stage of development at the relevant time. We are obligated to pay royalties on a country-by-country basis until the expiration of the last valid claim within the licensed patent rights in such country.
The Exclusive License Agreement will expire upon the expiration of the last valid claim within the licensed patent rights. We may terminate the Exclusive License Agreement upon prior written notice to UW. UW may terminate the Exclusive License Agreement by giving a specified number of days’ notice if we permanently cease operations, become insolvent or similar, or if we challenge the validity of the licensed patent rights. In addition, UW may terminate the Exclusive License Agreement for material breach that is not cured within a specified number of days, which cure period is to be at least doubled if we are proceeding diligently to cure the default.
Other Research Programs
Beyond our initial focus on NL-201, our research team is working on further applying de novo protein design principles to develop therapeutics to address significant unmet medical needs in immuno-oncology, inflammation, and autoimmunity. Our research is powered by our Neoleukin platform, which is our computational framework for developing highly selective, hyper-stable de novo immunomodulatory proteins. Beyond NL-201, we are developing targeted and conditionally active IL-2/IL-15 mimetics, as well as cytokine mimetic programs for other oncology targets. Our research team is also actively applying our Neoleukin platform to generate de novo receptor agonist and antagonist candidates against multiple targets of interest for inflammatory and autoimmune indications. As we validate additional candidates, they will enter our preclinical pipeline.
Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we investigated the application of our de novo protein technology to prevent or treat SARS-CoV-2 virus infection, and, in November 2020, we announced the publication of our scientific work in the journal Science detailing the creation of NL-CVX1, a de novo protein decoy that is specifically designed to block infection of SARS-CoV-2, the virus which causes the COVID-19 disease. Our findings demonstrated that NL-CVX1 blocks infection of human cells in vitro, even when a high viral burden is used. Furthermore, intranasal administration of NL-CVX1 protected Syrian hamsters from a lethal dose of SARS-CoV-2. In June 2021, in response to the evolving COVID-19 therapeutic landscape, including the widespread availability of effective vaccines, we suspended plans to advance this research program into clinical trials.
Intellectual Property
Our intellectual property strategy is centered around robust protection of our pipeline molecules and enabling technologies. We have licensed rights to patents and patent applications stemming from provisional patent applications that our scientific co-founders authored while they were employees at UW. We have also licensed rights to two provisional patent applications that we jointly own with UW. These patents and patent applications, as applicable, include disclosure and claims encompassing our NL-201 product candidate, the composition of matter of key molecule families, as well as methods of using the computational algorithms that form the basis of our Neoleukin platform. We have secured an exclusive license from UW to develop and commercialize products covered by these patents and patent applications. For NL-201 and related technology, two U.S. patents have issued and will expire in 2039, absent any patent term adjustments or extensions. A third U.S. patent has issued directed to certain targeted Il-2/IL-15 mimetics which will expire in 2039, absent any patent term adjustments or extensions. Additional patent applications are pending in the United States and world-wide. Any patents that may issue from these patent applications in-licensed from UW are expected to expire in 2039, absent any patent term adjustments or extensions. As our product candidate and other programs advance through research and development, we expect to seek to identify and protect new inventions, and we have filed applications on new inventions such as methods of administration and combination therapies.
Also, through our research efforts, we anticipate generating intellectual property covering novel compounds and improvements on existing molecules. We expect that patents that result from this new research will remain Neoleukin’s exclusive property, except to the extent jointly developed with third parties. In addition, our research team is extending and enhancing our computational technology and capabilities. We intend to protect improvements to the Neoleukin platform through a combination of new patent filings and/or the maintenance of trade secrets, as appropriate. We file U.S. non-provisional applications and PCT applications that claim the benefit of the priority date of earlier filed provisional applications, when appropriate. The PCT system allows a single application to be filed within 12 months of the original priority date of the patent application, and to designate all of the 153 PCT member states in which national patent applications can later be pursued based on the international patent application filed under the PCT. The PCT searching authority performs a patentability search and issues a non-binding patentability opinion which can be used to evaluate the chances of success for the national applications in foreign countries prior to having to incur the filing fees. Although a PCT application does not issue as a patent, it allows the applicant to seek protection in any of the member states through national-phase applications. At the end of the period of 2 1/2 years from the first priority date of the patent application, separate patent applications can be pursued in any of the PCT member states either by direct national filing or, in some cases by filing through a regional patent organization, such as the European Patent Organization. The PCT system delays expenses, allows a limited evaluation of the chances of success for national/regional patent applications and enables substantial savings where applications are abandoned within the first 2 1/2 years of filing.
We intend to pursue patent issuance and protection in key commercial markets where we expect significant product sales may occur.
Competition
The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by rapid evolution of technologies, fierce competition, and strong defense of intellectual property. While we believe that our Neoleukin platform and our knowledge, experience, and scientific resources provide us with competitive advantages going forward, we face competition from major pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions, governmental agencies, and public and private research institutions, among others.
The development of next-generation IL-2 or IL-15 agonists for cancer immunotherapy is an area of intense interest within the biotechnology industry. We are aware of several IL-2 or IL-15 agonists in various stages of clinical development, including engineered variants of IL-2 that attempt to improve on aldesleukin’s narrow therapeutic window by inhibiting IL-2’s natural high-affinity interaction with CD25 using traditional protein engineering approaches including steric inhibition and mutagenesis.
Many of our competitors, either alone or with strategic partners, have substantially greater financial, technical, and human resources than we do. Accordingly, our competitors may be more successful than us in obtaining approval for treatments and achieving widespread market acceptance, rendering our treatments obsolete or non-competitive. Accelerated merger and acquisition activity in the biotechnology and biopharmaceutical industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. These companies also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel, establishing clinical trial sites, and patient registration for clinical trials and acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. Our commercial opportunity could be substantially limited in the event that our competitors develop and commercialize products that are more effective, safer, less toxic, more convenient, or less expensive than our comparable products. In geographies that are critical to our commercial success, competitors may also obtain regulatory approvals before us, resulting in our competitors building a strong market position in advance of the entry of our products. We believe the primary factors determining the success of our programs will be the efficacy, safety, and convenience of our product candidates.
Manufacturing
We conduct manufacturing activities for the clinical development of our product candidates under individual purchase orders with third-party contract manufacturing organizations as we do not have a manufacturing facility and currently do not intend to develop one.
The FDA and other health authorities worldwide regulate and inspect equipment, facilities and processes used in manufacturing pharmaceutical products prior to approval. If we or our partners fail to comply with applicable requirements and conditions of product approval, the FDA and/or other global health authorities may seek sanctions, including fines, civil penalties, injunctions, suspension of manufacturing operations, operating restrictions, withdrawal of FDA and/or other global health authorities’ approval, seizure or recall of products and criminal prosecution.
Commercial Operations
We do not currently have an organization for the sales, marketing and distribution of pharmaceutical products. We may rely on licensing and co-promotion agreements with strategic partners for the commercialization of our products in the United States and other territories. If we choose to build a commercial infrastructure to support marketing in the United States, such commercial infrastructure could be expected to include a targeted sales force supported by sales management, internal sales support, an internal marketing group and distribution support. To develop the appropriate commercial infrastructure internally, we would have to invest financial and management resources, some of which would have to be deployed prior to any confirmation that NL-201, or any of our other product candidates, will be approved.
Government Regulation
As a biopharmaceutical company that operates and anticipates seeking approval for pharmaceutical product candidates in the United States, we are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA and other federal, state, and local regulatory agencies. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or the FDC Act, and its implementing regulations set forth, among other things, requirements for the research, testing, development, manufacture, quality control, safety, effectiveness, approval, labeling, storage, record keeping, reporting, distribution, import, export, advertising and promotion of our products. Our pharmaceutical product candidates must be approved by the FDA before we can commence clinical trials or market those products in the United States.
Although the discussion below focuses on regulation in the United States, we conduct research activities and anticipate seeking approval for, and marketing of, our products in other countries and regions, such as Canada and Australia. Generally, our activities in other countries will be subject to regulation that is similar in nature and scope as that imposed in the United States, although there can be important differences. Additionally, some significant aspects of regulation in Europe are addressed in a centralized way through the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, but country-specific regulation remains essential in many respects. The process of obtaining regulatory marketing approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources.
FDA Approval Process
The FDA is the main regulatory body that controls pharmaceuticals in the United States, and its regulatory authority is based in the FDC Act. Pharmaceutical products are also subject to other federal and state statutes and regulations. Biological products used for the prevention, treatment, or cure of a disease or condition of a human being are subject to regulation under the FDC Act, except the section of the FDC Act which governs the approval of New Drug Applications, or NDAs. Biological products are approved for marketing under provisions of the Public Health Service Act, or PHSA, via a Biologics License Application, or BLA. However, the application process and requirements for approval of BLAs are very similar to those for NDAs. A failure to comply with any requirements during the product development, approval, or post-approval periods, may lead to administrative or judicial sanctions. These sanctions could include the imposition by the FDA or an institutional review board, or IRB, of a hold on clinical trials, refusal to approve pending marketing applications or supplements, withdrawal of approval, warning or untitled letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, civil penalties or criminal prosecution.
The steps required before a new biological product may be marketed in the United States generally include:
•completion of preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies in compliance with the FDA’s Good Laboratory Practices regulations;
•submission to the FDA of an Investigational New Drug Application, or IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;
•approval by an IRB at each clinical site before each trial may be initiated;
•performance of adequate and well-controlled clinical trials in accordance with federal regulations and with current good clinical practices, or GCPs, to establish the safety and efficacy of the investigational drug product for each targeted indication;
•development of manufacturing processes to ensure the product candidate’s identity, strength, quality, purity, and potency;
•submission of BLA to the FDA;
•satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facilities at which the investigational product is produced to assess compliance with the FDA's Current Good Manufacturing Practice Regulations, or cGMP, and to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate;
•satisfactory completion of FDA inspection of investigator sites; and
•FDA review and approval of the BLA.
With the enactment of the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009, or BPCIA, an abbreviated pathway for the approval of biosimilar and interchangeable biological products was created. The abbreviated regulatory pathway establishes legal authority for the FDA to review and approve biosimilar biologics, including the possible designation of a biosimilar as interchangeable based on its similarity to an existing reference product. Notwithstanding minor differences in clinically inactive components, biosimilarity sufficient to reference a prior FDA-approved product requires a high similarity to the reference product and no clinically meaningful differences between the biological product and the reference product in terms of safety, purity, potency, mechanism of action, conditions of use, route of administration, and dosage formulation. Biosimilarity must be shown through analytical studies, animal studies, and at least one clinical trial, absent a waiver by the FDA. 
Under the BPCIA, an application for a biosimilar product cannot be approved by the FDA until 12 years after licensure date of the reference product licensed under a BLA. No application for a biosimilar can be submitted for four years from the licensure date of the reference product. However, certain changes and supplements to an approved BLA, and subsequent applications filed by the same sponsor, manufacturer, licensor, predecessor in interest, or other related entity do not qualify for the 12-year exclusivity period.
Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, formulation, and toxicity, as well as animal trials to access the characteristics and potential safety and efficacy of the product. The conduct of the preclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements, including Good Laboratory Practices. The results of preclinical testing are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND along with other information, including information about product chemistry, manufacturing and controls, and a proposed clinical trial protocol. Long-term preclinical tests, such as tests of reproductive toxicity and carcinogenicity in animals, may continue after the IND is submitted. A 30-day waiting period after the submission of each IND is required prior to the commencement of clinical testing in humans. If the FDA has neither commented on nor questioned the IND within this 30-day period, the clinical trial proposed in the IND may begin. Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational drug to patients under the supervision of qualified investigators following GCPs, an international standard meant to protect the rights and health of patients and to define the roles of clinical trial sponsors, administrators and monitors. Clinical trials must be conducted: (i) in compliance with federal regulations; (ii) in compliance with GCPs, an international standard meant to protect the rights and health of patients and to define the roles of clinical trial sponsors, administrators, and monitors; as well as (iii) under protocols that detail the parameters to be used in monitoring safety, and the efficacy criteria to be evaluated. Each protocol involving testing on U.S. patients and subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND.
The FDA may order the temporary or permanent discontinuation of a clinical trial at any time, or impose other sanctions, if it believes that the clinical trial either is not being conducted in accordance with FDA regulations or presents an unacceptable risk to the clinical trial patients. The trial protocol and informed consent information for patients in clinical trials must also be submitted to an IRB for approval. An IRB may also require the clinical trial at the site to be halted, either temporarily or permanently, for failure to comply with the IRB’s requirements, or may impose other conditions if it believes that the patients are subject to unacceptable risk. In some cases, clinical trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the trial sponsor, for example, the data safety monitoring board, or DSMB. The suspension or termination of development can occur during any phase of clinical trials if it is determined that the participants or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk.
The clinical investigation of an investigational drug is generally divided into three phases. Although the phases are usually conducted sequentially, they may overlap or be combined. The three phases of an investigation are generally described as follows:
•Phase 1 — Phase 1 includes the initial introduction of an investigational drug into humans. Phase 1 clinical trials may be conducted in patients with the target disease or condition or healthy volunteers. These trials are designed to evaluate the safety, metabolism, pharmacokinetics and pharmacologic actions of the investigational drug in humans, the side effects associated with increasing doses, and if possible, to gain early evidence on effectiveness. During Phase 1 clinical trials, sufficient information about the investigational product’s pharmacokinetics and pharmacological effects may be obtained to permit the design of Phase 2 clinical trials.
•Phase 2 — Phase 2 includes controlled clinical trials conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the investigational product for a particular indication(s) in patients with the disease or condition under study, to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage, and to identify possible adverse side effects and safety risks associated with the drug. Phase 2 clinical trials are typically well-controlled, closely monitored, and conducted in a limited patient population.
•Phase 3 — Phase 3 clinical trials are controlled clinical trials conducted in an expanded patient population at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. They are performed after preliminary evidence suggesting effectiveness of the investigational product has been obtained and are intended to further evaluate dosage, clinical effectiveness and safety, to establish the overall benefit-risk relationship of the product, and to provide an adequate basis for product approval. In most cases, the FDA requires two adequate and well-controlled Phase 3 clinical trials to demonstrate the efficacy of the drug. A single Phase 3 trial may be sufficient in rare instances including (1) where the study is a large multicenter trial demonstrating internal consistency and a statistically very persuasive finding of a clinically meaningful effect on mortality, irreversible morbidity or prevention of a disease with a potentially serious outcome and confirmation of the result in a second trial would be practically or ethically impossible or (2) when in conjunction with other confirmatory evidence.
Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the product and finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, the manufacturer must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality, purity and potency of the final product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested, and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
Assuming successful completion of all required testing in accordance with all applicable regulatory requirements, a BLA is submitted to the FDA to request market approval for the product in specified indications. The BLA must include the results of all preclinical, clinical, and other testing and a compilation of data relating to the product’s pharmacology, chemistry, manufacturing, and controls. To support marketing approval, the data submitted must be sufficient in quality and quantity to establish the safety and effectiveness of the investigational drug product to the satisfaction of the FDA. The cost of preparing and submitting a BLA is substantial. The submission of most BLAs is additionally subject to a substantial user fee; there may be some instances in which the user fee is waived.
The FDA will initially review the BLA for completeness before it accepts the BLA for filing. The FDA has 60 days from its receipt of a BLA to determine whether the application will be accepted for filing based on the Agency’s threshold determination that it is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. After the BLA submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review. The FDA has agreed to certain performance goals in the review of BLAs. For a new molecular entity, or NME, that is classified as a standard review product, FDA’s goal is to review the BLA within ten months of the date the FDA files the BLA; an application for an NME that is classified as a priority review product has a goal for review of six months from the date the FDA files the BLA. A BLA can be classified for priority review when the FDA determines the biologic product has the potential to treat a serious or life-threatening condition and, if approved, would be a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness compared to available therapies. The FDA can extend the review process by three or more additional months to consider certain late-submitted information or information intended to clarify information already provided in the submission.
The FDA does not always achieve its performance goal and its review of BLAs can take significantly longer. The FDA reviews the BLA to determine, among other things, whether the proposed product is safe and effective for its intended use, and whether the product is being manufactured in accordance with cGMP. The FDA may refer applications for novel biological products which present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions.
Before approving a BLA, the FDA will inspect the facilities at which the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the product unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and are adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving a BLA, the FDA will typically inspect the sponsor and one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCPs. After the FDA evaluates the BLA and the manufacturing facilities, it issues either an approval letter or a complete response letter. A complete response letter generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing, time or information in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. If, or when, those deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA’s satisfaction in a resubmission of the BLA, the FDA will issue an approval letter. The FDA has committed to reviewing such resubmissions in two or six months depending on the type of information included. The approval process is lengthy and difficult and notwithstanding the submission of any requested additional information, the FDA ultimately may refuse to approve an BLA if applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied or if the FDA believes additional clinical data or other data and information are required. Data obtained from clinical trials are not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret data differently than a company interprets the same data.
An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications. FDA’s approval of a product may be significantly limited to specific disease and dosages or the indications for use may otherwise be limited, which could restrict the commercial value of the product. Further, the FDA may require that certain contraindications, warnings, or precautions be included in the product labeling. In addition, as a condition of BLA approval, the FDA may require a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or REMS, to help ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh the potential risks. REMS can include medication guides, communication plans for healthcare professionals, special training or certification for prescribing or dispensing, dispensing only under certain circumstances, restricted distribution, special monitoring, and the use of patient registries. The requirement for REMS can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the drug. Moreover, product approval may require substantial post-approval testing and surveillance to monitor the drug’s safety or efficacy. Once granted, product approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or problems are identified following initial marketing.
Changes to some of the conditions established in an approved application, including changes in indications, labeling, manufacturing processes or facilities, or modification to a REMS, require submission and FDA approval of a new BLA or BLA supplement before the change can be implemented. A BLA supplement for a new indication typically requires clinical data similar to that in the original application, and the FDA uses the same procedures and actions in reviewing BLA supplements as it does in reviewing BLAs. Furthermore, should new safety information arise, additional testing, product labeling, or FDA notification may be required.
Sponsors of clinical trials of FDA-regulated products, including biological products, are required to register and disclose certain clinical trial information on the website www.clinicaltrials.gov. Information related to the product, patient population, phase of investigation, trial sites and investigators, and other aspects of a clinical trial are then made public as part of the registration. Sponsors are also obligated to disclose the results of their clinical trials after completion. Disclosure of the results of clinical trials can be delayed in certain circumstances for up to two years after the date of completion of the trial. Competitors may use this publicly available information to gain knowledge regarding the progress of clinical development programs as well as clinical trial design.
Pediatric Information
Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, or PREA, BLAs or supplements to BLAs must contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of the product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDA may, on its own initiative or at the request of the applicant, grant full or partial waivers, or deferrals, for submission of data. Unless otherwise required by regulation, PREA does not apply to any product with orphan product designation except a product with a new active ingredient that is a molecularly targeted cancer product intended for the treatment of an adult cancer and directed at a molecular target determined by FDA to be substantially relevant to the growth or progression of a pediatric cancer.
Fast Track Designation, Accelerated Approval, and Priority Review 
A sponsor may seek approval of its product candidate under programs designed to accelerate the FDA’s review and approval of BLAs. For example, Fast Track Designation may be granted to a drug intended for treatment of a serious or life-threatening disease or condition that has potential to address unmet medical needs for the disease or condition. The key benefits of fast track designation are more frequent interactions with the FDA and rolling review (submission of portions of an application before the complete marketing application is submitted).
Under Fast Track and the accelerated approval program, the FDA may approve a BLA on the basis of either a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. Post-marketing studies or completion of ongoing studies after marketing approval are required to verify the drug’s clinical benefit in relationship to the surrogate endpoint or ultimate outcome in relationship to the clinical benefit.
Based on results of the Phase 3 clinical trial(s) submitted in a BLA, upon the request of an applicant, the FDA may grant the BLA a priority review designation, which sets the target date for FDA action on the application at eight months after the BLA submission. Priority review is granted where there is evidence that the proposed product would be a significant improvement in the safety or effectiveness of the treatment, diagnosis, or prevention of a serious condition. If criteria are not met for priority review, the application is subject to the standard FDA review period of twelve months after NDA submission. Priority review designation does not change the scientific/medical standard for approval or the quality of evidence necessary to support approval.
Additional Controls for Biologics
To help reduce the increased risk of the introduction of adventitious agents, the PHSA emphasizes the importance of manufacturing controls for products whose attributes cannot be precisely defined. The PHSA also provides authority to the FDA to immediately suspend biologics licenses in situations where there exists a danger to public health, to prepare or procure products in the event of shortages and critical public health needs, and to authorize the creation and enforcement of regulations to prevent the introduction or spread of communicable diseases within the United States.
After a BLA is approved, the product may also be subject to official lot release as a condition of approval. As part of the manufacturing process, the manufacturer is required to perform certain tests on each lot of the product before it is released for distribution. If the product is subject to official release by the FDA, the manufacturer submits samples of each lot of product to the FDA together with a release protocol showing a summary of the lot manufacturing history and the results of all of the manufacturer’s tests performed on the lot. The FDA may also perform certain confirmatory tests on lots of some products, such as viral vaccines, before allowing the manufacturer to release the lots for distribution. In addition, the FDA conducts laboratory research related to the regulatory standards on the safety, purity, potency, and effectiveness of biological products. As with drugs, after approval of a BLA, biologics manufacturers must address any safety issues that arise, are subject to recalls or a halt in manufacturing, and are subject to periodic inspection after approval.
Post-Approval Regulations
After regulatory approval of a biologic is obtained, a company is required to comply with a number of post-approval requirements. For example, as a condition of approval of a BLA, the FDA may require post-marketing testing, including Phase 4 clinical trials, and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product’s safety and effectiveness after commercialization. In addition, as a holder of an approved BLA, a company is required to report adverse reactions and production problems to the FDA, to provide updated safety and efficacy information, and to comply with requirements concerning advertising and promotional labeling for any of its products. Also, quality control and manufacturing procedures must continue to conform to cGMP after approval to assure and preserve the long-term stability of the drug or biological product. The cGMP requirements apply to all stages of the manufacturing process, including the production, processing, sterilization, packaging, labeling, storage and shipment of the drug product. The FDA periodically inspects manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with cGMP, which imposes extensive procedural and substantive record keeping requirements. In addition, changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated, and, depending on the significance of the change, may require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon a company and any third-party manufacturers that a company may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMP and other aspects of regulatory compliance.
We rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the production of clinical and commercial quantities of our product candidates. Future FDA and state inspections may identify compliance issues at our facilities or at the facilities of our contract manufacturers that may disrupt production or distribution, or require substantial resources to correct.
The FDA may withdraw a product approval if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product or the failure to comply with applicable requirements may result in restrictions on a product, manufacturer or holder of an approved BLA, including withdrawal or recall of the product from the market or other voluntary, FDA-initiated or judicial action that could delay or prohibit further marketing. Further, the failure to maintain compliance with regulatory requirements may result in administrative or judicial actions, such as fines, warning or untitled letters, holds on clinical trials, product recalls or seizures, product detention or refusal to permit the import or export of products, refusal to approve pending applications or supplements, restrictions on marketing or manufacturing, injunctions or civil or criminal penalties.
After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims, are subject to prior FDA approval. Newly discovered or developed safety or effectiveness data may require changes to a product’s approved labeling, including the addition of new warnings and contraindications, and may require the implementation of other risk management measures. Also, new government requirements, including those resulting from new legislation, may be established, or the FDA’s policies may change, which could delay or prevent regulatory approval of our products under development.
Advertising and Promotion
The FDA and other federal regulatory agencies closely regulate the marketing and promotion of drugs through, among other things, standards and regulations for direct-to-consumer advertising, communications regarding unapproved uses, industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities, and promotional activities involving the Internet. A product cannot be commercially promoted before it is approved. After approval, product promotion cannot be false or misleading, and product claims must be adequately substantiated. Healthcare providers are permitted to prescribe drugs for “off-label” uses—that is, uses not approved by the FDA and therefore not described in the drug’s labeling—because the FDA does not regulate the practice of medicine. However, FDA regulations impose stringent restrictions on manufacturers’ communications regarding off-label uses. Broadly speaking, a manufacturer may not promote a drug for off-label use, but may engage in non-promotional, balanced communication regarding off-label use under specified conditions. Failure to comply with applicable FDA requirements and restrictions in this area may subject a company to adverse publicity and enforcement action by the FDA, the U.S. Department of Justice, or DOJ, or the Office of the Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, as well as state authorities. This could subject a company to a range of penalties that could have a significant commercial impact, including civil and criminal fines and agreements that materially restrict the manner in which a company promotes or distributes drug products.
Enforcement
During all phases of development (pre- and post-marketing), failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements may result in administrative or judicial sanctions. These sanctions could include the FDA’s imposition of a clinical hold on trials, refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, warning or untitled letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, product detention or refusal to permit the import or export of products, injunctions, fines, civil penalties or criminal prosecution. Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us.
Comparable European and Other International Government Regulation
In addition to FDA regulations in the United States, we will be subject to a variety of comparable regulations in other jurisdictions governing, among other things, clinical trials and any commercial sales and distribution of our products. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain the requisite approvals from regulatory authorities in foreign countries prior to the commencement of clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries.
Some countries outside of the United States have a similar process that requires the submission of a clinical trial application, or CTA, much like the IND prior to the commencement of human clinical trials. In Europe, for example, a CTA must be submitted to each country’s national health authority and an independent ethics committee, much like the FDA and IRB, respectively. Once the CTA is approved in accordance with a country’s requirements, clinical trial development may proceed. To obtain regulatory approval to commercialize a new drug under European Union regulatory systems, we must submit a marketing authorization application, or MAA. The MAA is similar to the NDA, with the exception of, among other things, country-specific document requirements and environmental impact assessments.
For other countries outside of the European Union, such as countries in Eastern Europe, Latin America or Asia, the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. In all cases, again, the clinical trials are conducted in accordance with GCPs and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.
Australia
Conducting clinical trials for therapeutic drug candidates in Australia is subject to regulation by Australian governmental entities. Approval for inclusion in the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods, or the ARTG, is required before a pharmaceutical drug product may be marketed in Australia.
Typically, the process of obtaining approval of a new therapeutic drug product for inclusion in the ARTG requires compilation of clinical trial data. Clinical trials conducted using “unapproved therapeutic goods” in Australia, being those which have not yet been evaluated by the Therapeutic Goods Administration, or TGA, for quality, safety and efficacy must occur pursuant to either the Clinical Trial Notification, or CTN, or Clinical Trial Exemption, or CTX, process.
The CTN process broadly involves:
•completion of pre-clinical laboratory and animal testing;
•submission to a Human Research Ethics Committee, or the HREC, of all material relating to the proposed clinical trial, including the trial protocol. The TGA does not review any data relating to the clinical trial;
•the institution or organization at which the trial will be conducted, referred to as the “Approving Authority” gives the final approval for the conduct of the trial at the site, having due regard to the advice from the HREC; and
•CTN trials cannot commence until the trial has been notified to the TGA.
Under the CTX process:
•a sponsor submits an application to conduct a clinical trial to the TGA for evaluation and comment; and
•a sponsor cannot commence a CTX trial until written advice has been received from the TGA regarding the application and approval for the conduct of the trial has been obtained from an ethics committee and the institution at which the trial will be conducted.
In each case, it is required that:
•adequate and well-controlled clinical trials demonstrate the quality, safety and efficacy of the therapeutic product;
•evidence is compiled which demonstrates that the manufacture of the therapeutic drug product complies with the principles of cGMP;
•manufacturing and clinical data is derived to submit to the Australian Committee on Prescription Medicines, which makes recommendations to the TGA as to whether or not to grant approval to include the therapeutic drug product in the ARTG; and
•an ultimate decision is made by the TGA whether to include the therapeutic drug product in the ARTG.
Pre-clinical studies include laboratory evaluation of the therapeutic drug product as well as animal studies to assess the potential safety and efficacy of the drug. The results of the pre-clinical studies form part of the materials submitted to the investigators HREC in the case of a CTN trial and part of the application to the TGA in the case of a CTX trial.
Clinical trials involve administering the investigational product to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of a qualified principal investigator. The TGA has developed guidelines for a CTN. Under the CTN process, all material relating to the proposed trial is submitted directly to the HREC of each institution at which the trial is to be conducted. An HREC is an independent review committee set up under guidelines of the Australian National Health and Medical Research Council. The role of an HREC is to ensure the protection of rights, safety and well-being of human subjects involved in a clinical trial by, among other things, reviewing, approving and providing continuing review of trial protocols and amendments, and of the methods and material to be used in obtaining and documenting informed consent of the trial subjects. The TGA is formally notified by submission of a CTN application but does not review the safety of the drug or any aspect of the proposed trial. The approving authority of each institution gives the final approval for the conduct of the clinical trial, having due regard to advice from the HREC. Following approval, responsibility for all aspects of the trial conducted under a CTN application remains with the HREC of each investigator’s institution.
The standards for clinical research in Australia are set by the TGA and the National Health and Medical Research Council, and compliance with GCPs is mandatory. Guidelines, such as those promulgated by the International Conference on Harmonization of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use, or ICH, are required across all fields, including those related to pharmaceutical quality, nonclinical and clinical data requirements and study designs. The basic requirements for preclinical data to support a first-in- human study under ICH guidelines are applicable in Australia. Requirements related to adverse event reporting in Australia are similar to those required in other major jurisdictions.
Other Healthcare, Data Protection, and Privacy Laws and Compliance Requirements
In the United States, our activities are potentially subject to additional regulation and oversight under other healthcare laws by various federal, state and local authorities in addition to the FDA, including the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, other divisions of the HHS (e.g., the Office of Inspector General), the DOJ, and individual U.S. Attorney offices within the DOJ, and state and local governments. These laws include the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, any person or entity, from knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving any remuneration, directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, to induce or in return for either the referral of an individual, or purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for the purchase, lease or order of any good, facility, item or service reimbursable, in whole or part, under Medicare, Medicaid or another federal healthcare program. The term remuneration has been interpreted broadly to include anything of value. The federal Anti-Kickback Statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on one hand and prescribers, purchasers, and formulary managers on the other. There are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting some common activities from prosecution. The exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly and practices that involve remuneration that may be alleged to be intended to induce prescribing, purchasing or recommending may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exception or safe harbor. Our practices may not in all cases meet all of the criteria for protection under a statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor from federal Anti-Kickback Statute liability. Failure to meet all of the requirements of a particular applicable statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor, however, does not make the conduct per se illegal under the Anti-Kickback Statute. Instead, the legality of the arrangement will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis based on a cumulative review of all of its facts and circumstances. In addition, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, or collectively, the Affordable Care Act, further strengthened these laws by amending the intent standard under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and the criminal health care fraud statutes (discussed below), such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. In addition, the Affordable Care Act codified case law that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the civil False Claims Act (discussed below).
Federal civil and criminal false claims laws, including the False Claims Act, and civil monetary penalties laws prohibit, among other things, any person or entity from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to, or approval by, the federal government, including the Medicare and Medicaid programs, or knowingly making, using, or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to the federal government, including the Medicare and Medicaid programs. As a result of a modification made by the Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act of 2009, a claim includes “any request or demand” for money or property presented to the U.S. government. Recently, several pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have been prosecuted under these laws for allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product. Other companies have been prosecuted for causing false claims to be submitted because of the companies’ marketing of the product for off-label, and thus, non-covered, uses.In the United States, there are numerous federal and state laws and regulations governing data privacy of personal data and the collection, use, disclosure, and protection of health data, genetic data, consumer data, and children's data. 
The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, created additional federal criminal statutes that prohibit knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud or to obtain, by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations or promises, any money or property owned by, or under the control or custody of, any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up by trick, scheme or device, a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Also, many states have similar fraud and abuse statutes or regulations that apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payor.
HIPAA was amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, implementing additional regulations and imposing requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. Among other things, HITECH makes certain HIPAA standards directly applicable to business associates—independent contractors or agents of covered entities that receive or obtain protected health information in connection with providing a service on behalf of a covered entity. HITECH also created four new tiers of civil monetary penalties, amended HIPAA to make civil and criminal penalties directly applicable to business associates, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorney’s fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. In addition, some state laws may more broadly govern the privacy and security of health information in specified circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways from HIPPA/HITECH and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts.
We may be subject to privacy and data security regulations and legal requirements in the United States, Europe, and throughout the world as it relates to collection, use, disclosure, and protection of personal information that may be broader than as is required under HIPAA or comparable state laws to HIPAA. Many of the state laws enable a state attorney general to bring actions and provide private rights of action to consumers as enforcement mechanisms. There is also heightened sensitivity around certain types of health data, which may be subject to additional protections. Compliance with these laws requires a flexible privacy framework as they are constantly evolving. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in government enforcement actions and create liability for us (which could include civil and/or criminal penalties), private litigation, and/or adverse publicity. Federal regulators, state attorneys general, and plaintiffs' attorneys have been active in this space.
Also, as we become more dependent on information technologies to conduct our operations, cyber incidents, including deliberate attacks and attempts to gain unauthorized access to computer systems and networks, may increase in frequency and sophistication, and we may have legal duties to protect that information and, in the event of a security incident, report to affected individuals and government authority.
Other applicable federal, state, and foreign laws related to privacy and data protection, include, without limitation, the following:
•The Federal Trade Commission, or FTC, and state attorneys general enforce consumer protection laws that prohibit unfair and deceptive acts and practices, including Section 5 of the FTC Act, which creates standards for the collection, use, dissemination, and security of health-related and other non-health-related personal information. Individual states have comparable unfair and deceptive acts and practices statutes. 
•The California Consumer Privacy Act, or CCPA, came into effect in January 2020 and places increased obligations on businesses, including by requiring covered companies to provide new disclosures to California consumers and provide such consumers certain data protection and privacy rights, including the ability to opt-out of certain sales of personal data. A ballot initiative from privacy rights advocates intended to augment and expand the CCPA called the California Privacy Rights Act, or CPRA, was passed in November 2020 and will take effect in January 2023 (with a look back to January 2022), and modifies the CCPA while also creating a new state agency that will be vested with authority to implement and enforce the CCPA and the CPRA.
•Several states have enacted consumer privacy laws that will take effect in 2023, including: (1) the Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act that gives new data protection rights to Virginia residents and imposes additional obligations on controllers and processors of personal data similar in scope to the CCPA; (2) the Colorado Privacy Act, which is set to take effect on July 1, 2023. As of January 2022, fourteen states have pending legislation under review relating to consumer privacy. 
•Domestic laws in all 50 states require businesses to provide notice to customers whose personally identifiable information has been disclosed as a result of a data breach. 
•European data protection laws will apply to any clinical trial programs we conduct or research collaborations we enter into in the European Economic Area, or the EEA, the United Kingdom, or the UK, or Switzerland. These include European Union, or EU, General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679, or GDPR, which applies extra-territorially and imposes onerous requirements on controllers (e.g., sponsors) and processors (e.g., contract research organizations, laboratories) of personal data, including, for example: (i) accountability and transparency requirements, and enhanced requirements for obtaining valid consent; (ii) obligations to consider data protection as any new products or services are developed and to limit the amount of personal data processed; (iii) obligations to comply with data protection rights of data subjects; and (iv) reporting of personal data breaches to the supervisory authority without undue delay (and no later than 72 hours). The GDPR and comparable UK and Swiss law also prohibits the international transfer of personal data from the EEA/UK/Switzerland to countries outside of those jurisdictions unless made to a country deemed to have adequate data privacy laws by the European Commission (or as applicable under UK/Swiss authority) or where a data transfer mechanism has been put in place. Further, the GDPR provides that countries in the EEA may establish their own laws and regulations further restricting the processing of certain personal data, including genetic data, biometric data, and health data.
•In Canada, the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act, or PIPEDA, and similar provincial laws may impose obligations with respect to processing personal information, including health-related information. PIPEDA requires companies to obtain an individual’s consent when collecting, using or disclosing that individual’s personal information. 
•In Australia, the Privacy Act of 1988 is the primary federal legislation applying to protection of privacy in Australia, applicable to both private and public sectors at the Commonwealth level and outlines Data Subject’s rights, and is supplemented by TGA (Therapeutic Goods Administration).
Additionally, the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act within the Affordable Care Act, and its implementing regulations, require that certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biological and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program (with certain exceptions) report annually to CMS information related to certain payments or other transfers of value made or distributed to physicians, physician assistants, certain types of advance practice nurses and teaching hospitals, or to entities or individuals at the request of, or designated on behalf of, the physicians, physician assistants, certain types of advance practice nurses and teaching hospitals, and applicable manufacturers and group purchasing organizations to report annually certain ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members and payments or other “transfers of value” to such physician owners and their immediate family members.
In order to distribute products commercially, we must comply with state laws that require the registration of manufacturers and wholesale distributors of pharmaceutical products in a state, including, in some states, manufacturers and distributors who ship products into the state even if such manufacturers or distributors have no place of business within the state. Some states also impose requirements on manufacturers and distributors to establish the pedigree of product in the chain of distribution, including some states that require manufacturers and others to adopt new technology capable of tracking and tracing product as it moves through the distribution chain. Several local, state and foreign governments have enacted legislation requiring pharmaceutical companies to, among other things, establish compliance programs, file periodic reports with the state or foreign government, make periodic public disclosures on sales, marketing, pricing, clinical trials and other activities, and/ or register their sales representatives, as well as to prohibit pharmacies and other healthcare entities from providing specified physician prescribing data to pharmaceutical companies for use in sales and marketing, and to prohibit other specified sales and marketing practices. In addition, our future commercial activities may also be subject to federal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws.
If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the federal and state healthcare laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including without limitation, civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, individual imprisonment, exclusion from participation in government programs, such as Medicaid and Medicare, integrity obligations, injunctions, as well as reputational harm, administrative burdens, diminished profits and future earnings and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations. To the extent that any of our products are sold in a foreign country, we may be subject to similar foreign laws and regulations, which may include, for instance, anti-fraud and abuse laws, and implementation of corporate compliance programs and reporting of payments or transfers of value to healthcare professionals.
Coverage, Reimbursement, and Pricing
Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any drug products for which we obtain regulatory approval. In the United States and markets in other countries, sales of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale will depend, in part, on the extent that third-party payors provide coverage, and establish adequate reimbursement levels for such drug products. In the United States, third-party payors include federal healthcare programs, state healthcare programs, managed care providers, private health insurers, and other organizations. The process for determining whether a third-party payor will provide coverage for a drug product may be separate from the process for setting the price of a drug product or for establishing the reimbursement rate that such a payor will pay for the drug product. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific drug products on an approved list, also known as a formulary, which might not include all of the FDA-approved drugs for a particular indication. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the price, examining the medical necessity and reviewing the cost-effectiveness of drug products and medical services, in addition to questioning their safety and efficacy. We may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of our products, in addition to the costs required to obtain FDA approvals. NL-201 or our future product candidates may not be considered medically necessary or cost-effective. A payor’s decision to provide coverage for a drug product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Further, one payor’s determination to provide coverage for a drug product does not assure that other payors will also provide coverage for the drug product. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development. If a drug product is reimbursed under a governmental healthcare program, such as Medicare, Medicaid or TRICARE, additional laws and program requirements will apply.
Different pricing and reimbursement schemes exist in other countries. In the European Union, governments influence the price of pharmaceutical products through their pricing and reimbursement rules and control of national healthcare systems that fund a large part of the cost of those products to consumers. Some jurisdictions operate positive and negative list systems under which products may only be marketed once a reimbursement price has been agreed upon. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval, some of these countries may require the completion of clinical trials that compare the cost-effectiveness of a particular product candidate to currently available therapies. Other member states allow companies to fix their own prices for drugs, but monitor and control company profits. The downward pressure on healthcare costs in general, particularly prescription drugs, has become more intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. The European Union provides options for its member states to restrict the range of medicinal products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. A member state may approve a specific price for the medicinal product, or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the medicinal product on the market. We may face competition for our product candidates from lower-priced products in foreign countries that have placed price controls on pharmaceutical products. In addition, in some countries, cross-border imports from low-priced markets exert a commercial pressure on pricing within a country.
The marketability of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale may suffer if the government and third-party payors fail to provide adequate coverage and reimbursement. In addition, an increasing emphasis on managed care in the United States has increased and will continue to increase the pressure on pharmaceutical pricing. Coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which we receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.
Healthcare Reform
In March 2010, President Obama signed the Affordable Care Act, which substantially changed healthcare financing and the delivery by both governmental and private insurers, and significantly impacted the pharmaceutical industry. The Affordable Care Act impacts existing government healthcare programs and requires the development of new programs. For example, the Affordable Care Act provides for Medicare payment for performance initiatives and improvements to the physician quality reporting system and feedback program.
Among the Affordable Care Act’s provisions of importance to the pharmaceutical industry are the following:
•an annual, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports certain specified branded prescription drugs and biological products apportioned among these entities according to their market share in some government healthcare programs, that began in 2011;
•an increase in the statutory minimum rebates a manufacturer must pay under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, retroactive to January 1, 2010, to 23.1% and 13% of the average manufacturer price for most branded and generic drugs, respectively and capped the total rebate amount for innovator drugs at 100% of AMP;
•expansion of healthcare fraud and abuse laws, including the False Claims Act and the Anti-Kickback Statute, new government investigative powers, and enhanced penalties for noncompliance;
•a new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program, in which manufacturers must agree to offer point-of-sale discounts, now 7% off negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition for the manufacturers’ outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D;
•extension of manufacturers’ Medicaid rebate liability to covered drugs dispensed to individuals who are enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations;
•expansion of eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs by, among other things, allowing states to offer Medicaid coverage to additional individuals and by adding new mandatory eligibility categories for individuals with income at or below 133% of the Federal Poverty Level, thereby potentially increasing manufacturers’ Medicaid rebate liability;
•expansion of the entities eligible for discounts under the Public Health Service pharmaceutical pricing program;
•a requirement to report annually specified financial arrangements with physicians and teaching hospitals, as defined in the Affordable Care Act and its implementing regulations, including reporting information related to “payments or other transfers of value” made to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors) and teaching hospitals, and applicable manufacturers and applicable group purchasing organizations to report annually to CMS ownership and investment interests held by physicians (as defined above) and their immediate family members and payments or other “transfers of value” to such physician owners and their immediate family members;
•a requirement to annually report drug samples that manufacturers and distributors provide to licensed practitioners, pharmacies of hospitals and other healthcare entities; and
•a Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research.
In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the Affordable Care Act was enacted. On August 2, 2011, the President signed into law the Budget Control Act of 2011, which, among other things, created the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction to recommend proposals in spending reductions to Congress. The Joint Select Committee did not achieve its targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2013 through 2021, triggering the legislation’s automatic reductions to several government programs. These reductions include aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect on April 1, 2013 and, due to subsequent legislative amendments, will stay in effect through 2029 unless additional Congressional action is taken. On January 2, 2013, President Obama signed into law the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several providers and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. Furthermore, there has been heightened governmental scrutiny recently over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products. For example, there have been several recent Congressional inquiries and proposed bills designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drug products. These new laws and initiatives may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding, which could have a material adverse effect on our future customers and accordingly, our financial operations.
Since its enactment, there have been judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of Affordable Care Act, as well as efforts by the Trump administration to repeal or replace certain aspects of the Affordable Care Act, or ACA. Since January 2017, President Trump signed two executive orders and other directives designed to delay, circumvent, or loosen certain requirements mandated by the Affordable Care Act. Concurrently, Congress has considered legislation that would repeal or repeal and replace all or part of the ACA. While Congress has not passed repeal legislation, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 includes a provision repealing, effective January 1, 2019, the tax-based shared responsibility payment imposed by the ACA on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year that is commonly referred to as the “individual mandate”. In November 2020, the United States Supreme Court held oral arguments on the Fifth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals decision that held that the individual mandate is unconstitutional. It is uncertain how the United States Supreme Court will rule on this case or how healthcare measures of the Biden administration will impact the ACA and our business. Congress may consider other legislation to repeal or replace elements of the ACA.
We cannot predict what healthcare reform initiatives may be adopted in the future. However, we anticipate that Congress, state legislatures, and third-party payors may continue to review and assess alternative healthcare delivery and payment systems and may in the future propose and adopt legislation or policy changes or implementations effecting additional fundamental changes in the healthcare delivery system. We also expect ongoing initiatives to increase pressure on drug pricing. Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare and other government programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors.
Anti-Corruption Legislation
The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, prohibits any U.S. individual or business from paying, offering, or authorizing payment or offering of anything of value, directly or indirectly, to any foreign official, political party or candidate for the purpose of influencing any act or decision of the foreign entity in order to assist the individual or business in obtaining or retaining business. The FCPA also obligates companies whose securities are listed in the United States to comply with accounting provisions requiring us to maintain books and records that accurately and fairly reflect all transactions of the corporation, including international subsidiaries, and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls for international operations.
