 Company Overview        Adamis Pharmaceuticals Corporation (“we,” “us,” “our,” “Adamis” or the “company”) is a specialty biopharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing products in various therapeutic areas, including allergy, opioid overdose, respiratory and inflammatory disease. Our products and product candidates in the allergy, respiratory, and opioid overdose markets include: SYMJEPI™ (epinephrine) Injection 0.3mg, which was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, in 2017 for use in the emergency treatment of acute allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis, for patients weighing 66 pounds or more; SYMJEPI (epinephrine) Injection 0.15mg, which was approved by the FDA in September 2018, for use in the treatment of anaphylaxis for patients weighing 33-65 pounds; ZIMHI™ (naloxone HCL Injection, USP) 5 mg/0.5 mL, which was approved by the FDA in October 2021 for the treatment of opioid overdose; and Tempol, an investigational drug. In June 2020, we entered into a license agreement with a third party to license rights under certain patents, patent applications and related know-how of the licensor relating to Tempol. The exclusive license includes the worldwide use under the licensed patent rights and related rights for the fields of COVID-19 infection, asthma, respiratory syncytial virus infection, and influenza infection, as well as the field of use of Tempol as a therapeutic for reducing radiation-induced dermatitis in patients undergoing treatment for cancer. We commenced Phase 2/3 clinical trial start-up activities to examine the safety and efficacy of Tempol in COVID-19 patients early in the infection,and on September 2, 2021, we announced the initiation of patient dosing in the trial.  In February 2022 we announced the enrollment and dosing of more than 100 subjects in the Phase 2/3 trial, and on March 14, 2022, we announced that the Data Safety Monitoring Board, or DSMB, overseeing the Phase 2/3 clinical trial met to evaluate the clinical and safety data from the first planned interim analysis and, following its evaluation, recommended that the study continue without modification. Assuming continuation of the trial and continued enrollment of patients, following submission of additional data and information to the DSMB, the DSMB will conduct a second planned review, currently anticipated to be in May 2022, which may provide additional insight into the safety and clinical results at that time.  Our goal is to create low cost therapeutic alternatives to existing treatments.  Consistent across all specialty pharmaceuticals product lines, we intend to submit New Drug Applications, or NDAs under Section 505(b)(2), of the U.S. Food, Drug & Cosmetic Act, as amended, or FDCA, or Section 505(j) Abbreviated New Drug Applications, or ANDAs, to the FDA, whenever possible, in order to potentially reduce the time to market and to save on costs, compared to those associated with Section 505(b)(1) NDAs for new drug products.
  Our US Compounding Inc. subsidiary, or USC, which we acquired in April 2016 and which is registered as a human drug compounding outsourcing facility under Section 503B of the FDCA and the U.S. Drug Quality and Security Act, or DQSA, provided prescription compounded medications, including compounded sterile preparations and nonsterile compounds, to patients, physician clinics, hospitals, surgery centers and other clients throughout most of the United States. In July 2021, we sold certain assets relating to USC’s human compounding pharmaceutical business and approved a restructuring process to wind down the remaining USC business and sell, liquidate or otherwise dispose of the remaining USC assets. Effective October 31, 2021, USC surrendered its Arkansas retail pharmacy permit and wholesaler/outsourcer permit and is no longer selling compounded pharmaceutical or veterinary products. 
 To achieve our goals and support our overall strategy, we will need to raise additional funding in the future and make significant investments in, among other things, product development and working capital.
     The current status of our development programs is as follows:

 Anaphylaxis; SYMJEPI; Epinephrine Injection Pre-Filled Single Dose Syringe        The American Academy of Allergy Asthma and Immunology, or AAAAI, defines anaphylaxis as a serious life-threatening allergic reaction. The most common anaphylactic reactions are to foods, insect stings, medications and latex. According to information published by AAAAI reporting on findings from a 2009-2010 study, up to 8% of U.S. children under the age of 18 had a food allergy, and approximately 38% of those with a food allergy had a history of severe reactions. Anaphylaxis requires immediate medical treatment, including an injection of epinephrine.
     We estimate that sales of prescription epinephrine products in 2021 were more than $1.8 billion, based on assumptions and estimates utilizing industry data. We cannot provide any assurances concerning any possible future rates of annual growth or whether annual prescription sales will decline or grow. The market for prescription epinephrine products is competitive, and a number of factors have resulted in, and could continue to result in, downward pressure on the pricing of, and revenues from sales of, our SYMJEPI (epinephrine) Injection 0.3mg and 0.15mg prescription epinephrine products. Our SYMJEPI (epinephrine) Injection 0.15mg and 0.3mg products allow users to administer a pre-measured epinephrine dose quickly with a device that we believe, based on human factors studies, to be intuitive to use. 
     On June 15, 2017, the FDA approved our SYMJEPI (epinephrine) Injection 0.3mg product for the emergency treatment of allergic reactions (Type I) including anaphylaxis. SYMJEPI (epinephrine) Injection 0.3mg is intended to deliver a dose of epinephrine, which is used for emergency, immediate administration in acute anaphylactic reactions to insect stings or bites, allergic reaction to certain foods, drugs and other allergens, as well as idiopathic or exercise-induced anaphylaxis for patients weighing 66 pounds or more. On September 27, 2018, the FDA approved our lower dose SYMJEPI (epinephrine) Injection 0.15mg product, for the emergency treatment of allergic reactions (Type I) including anaphylaxis in patients weighing 33 to 66 pounds.
    In July 2018, we entered into a Distribution and Commercialization Agreement, or the Sandoz Agreement, with Sandoz Inc., or Sandoz, to commercialize both of our SYMJEPI products. In January 2019, we announced that Sandoz had launched SYMJEPI (epinephrine) 0.3 mg Injection in the U.S. market, initially available in the institutional setting. On July 9, 2019, we announced the full launch (institutional and retail) by Sandoz of both dose forms of the SYMJEPI injection products.
 On May 11, 2020, we announced that we entered into an agreement, or the Termination Agreement, with Sandoz to terminate the Sandoz Agreement and simultaneously announced that we entered into an exclusive distribution and commercialization agreement, or the USWM Agreement, with USWM, LLC, or USWM or US WorldMeds, for the United States commercial rights for the SYMJEPI products, as well as for our ZIMHI product. Under the terms of the USWM Agreement, we appointed USWM as the exclusive distributor of SYMJEPI in the United States and related territories, or the Territory, effective upon the termination of the Sandoz Agreement, and of the ZIMHI product if approved by the FDA for marketing, and granted USWM an exclusive license under our patent and other intellectual property rights and know-how to market, sell, and otherwise commercialize and distribute the products in the Territory, in partial consideration of an initial payment of $1,000,000 by USWM and potential additional regulatory and commercial based milestone payments. There can be no assurances that any of these milestones will be met or that any milestone payments will be paid to us. We retain rights to the intellectual property subject to the USWM Agreement and to commercialize both products outside of the Territory. In addition, we may continue to use the licensed intellectual property (excluding certain of the licensed trademarks) to develop and commercialize other products (with certain exceptions), including products that utilize our Symject™ syringe product platform.
 The USWM Agreement provides that, after deducting the supply price and subject to certain other deductions and adjustments, including an allocation for USWM sales and distribution expenses from net sales of the products, USWM will pay to us 50% of the net profit from net sales, as each such term is defined in the USWM Agreement, of the product in the Territory to third parties, determined on a quarterly basis. We will be the supplier of the products to USWM, and USWM will order and pay us a supply price for quantities of products ordered. The agreement does not include minimum payments to us by USWM, minimum requirements for sales of product by USWM or, with certain exceptions, minimum purchase commitments by USWM.
 On January 22, 2021, we announced that the SYMJEPI products added to the Walgreens Prescription Savings Club program and were available to members of the program.  The Walgreens Prescription Savings Club offers customers, who pay an annual membership fee, savings off retail prices on a large variety of medications.  
On October 1, 2019, we entered into an exclusive distribution and commercialization agreement with a company in Australia to register and commercialize the SYMJEPI products in the Australia and New Zealand markets, after all required regulatory registration and approvals have been obtained. Following several communications with the applicable Australian regulatory authority and requests by the authority for additional data and modifications to current specifications that were beyond the scope of our FDA-approved dossier, we and our commercial partner in Australia voluntarily withdrew our regulatory application until we determine if the commercial case for SYMJEPI in Australia justifies the additional development efforts and expense. There can be no assurances that we will decide to resubmit the application, nor regarding the outcome of the regulatory review should we decide to resubmit the application.
 On March 21, 2022, we announced a voluntary recall of four lots of SYMJEPI (epinephrine) Injection 0.15 mg (0.15 mg/0.3 mL) and 0.3 mg (0.3 mg/0.3 mL) Pre-Filled Single-Dose Syringes to the consumer level. The four lots are being recalled due to the potential clogging of the needle preventing the dispensing of epinephrine. USWM will handle the entire recall process for the company, with company oversight. SYMJEPI is manufactured and tested for us by Catalent Belgium S.A. As of the date of this Report, neither USWM nor we have received, or are aware of, any adverse events related to this recall. The recall is being conducted with the knowledge of the FDA. As of the date of this Report, manufacturing of SYMJEPI is currently on hold pending the results of investigation that is underway to determine the root cause.We currently anticipate a resolution and resumption of manufacturing after the investigation is completed and any issues are satisfactorily addressed, although there can be no assurance concerning the outcome of the investigation. Our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2021, included elsewhere in this Report, include and reflect a reserve of approximately $2.0 million associated with the recall. The company may be able to be reimbursed by certain third parties for some of the costs of the recall under the terms of its manufacturing agreements, but there are no assurances regarding the amount or the timing of any such recovery,

Opioid Overdose        ZIMHI (naloxone) Injection
     Naloxone is an opioid antagonist used to treat narcotic overdoses. Naloxone, which is generally considered the drug of choice for immediate administration for opioid overdose, blocks or reverses the effects of the opioid, including extreme drowsiness, slowed breathing, or loss of consciousness. Common opioids include morphine, heroin, tramadol, oxycodone, hydrocodone and fentanyl. 
    The number of deaths due to opioids has increased over five-fold compared to 1999. According to statistics published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), drug overdoses resulted in approximately 96,779 deaths in the United States during the 12-month period ending March 2021, which was a 29% increase over the prior 12-month period. Drug overdoses are now the leading cause of death for Americans under age 50, with more powerful synthetic opioids, like fentanyl and its analogues, responsible for the largest number of those deaths. Studies from 2013 to 2016 have revealed an approximately 87% increase in deaths associated with synthetic opioids, whereas, death rates due to natural and semisynthetic opioids remained relatively stable.  With this significant increase in synthetic opioid abuse are published studies that have suggested that the current recommended doses of naloxone may be inadequate in that frequent redosing is required. Repeat dosing of the commonly utilized dose of naloxone suggests the need for a higher dosage product.
 On December 31, 2018, we filed an NDA with the FDA relating to our higher dose naloxone injection product, ZIMHI, for the treatment of opioid overdose.  On November 22, 2019, we received a Complete Response Letter, or CRL, from the FDA regarding our NDA for ZIMHI. A CRL is issued by the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research when it has completed its review of a file and questions remain that preclude the approval of the NDA in its current form. The CRL stated that the FDA determined that it could not approve the NDA in its present form and provided recommendations needed for resubmission.  In May 2020 we resubmitted the NDA for ZIMHI to the FDA. On November 13, 2020, we received a second CRL from the FDA regarding the resubmitted NDA. In May 2021 we resubmitted the NDA for ZIMHI to the FDA. On October 18, 2021, we announced that the FDA had approved ZIMHI for the treatment of opioid overdose. On March 31, 2022, our commercial partner USWM and we issued a press release announcing the commercial launch of ZIMHI.
  Tempol (APC400) 
    On June 12, 2020, we entered into a license agreement with Matrix Biomed, Inc., or the Licensor, to license rights under certain patents, patent applications and related know-how of Licensor relating to Tempol, an investigational drug. The exclusive license includes the worldwide use under the licensed patent rights and related rights for the fields of COVID-19 infection, asthma, respiratory syncytial virus infection, and influenza infection. In addition, the exclusive license includes the field of use of Tempol as a therapeutic for reducing radiation-induced dermatitis in patients undergoing treatment for cancer. In consideration for the Licensor providing the rights under the licensed patent rights and related know-how relating to Tempol within the licensed fields, we paid Licensor $250,000 and also issued to the Licensor 1,000,000 shares of our Series B Convertible Preferred Stock, which has previously converted into an equal number of shares of our common stock.

Tempol is a redox cycling nitroxide that promotes the metabolism of many reactive oxygen species and improves nitric oxide bioavailability. It has been studied extensively in animal models of oxidative stress and inflammation. Overall, Tempol acts as both a super-oxide dismutase mimetic and also has demonstrated anti-inflammatory, anticoagulant activity and antiviral activity. Inflammation and oxidative stress occur in various disease states including COVID-19.  COVID-19 is a complex disease that manifests in multiple phases including, among others, viral replication and hyperinflammation. Both inflammatory cytokines and reactive oxygen species (ROS) from cells of the immune system called macrophages and neutrophils damage the lung in Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). Many published articles describing animal models of ARDS show Tempol caused a decrease in lung inflammation and preserved lung pathology associated with acute and chronic lung injury.  In animal models, Tempol has been shown to decrease proinflammatory cytokines (cytokine storm), and through its antioxidant activity has been shown to decrease the harmful effects of ROS.  In addition, Tempol has been shown to decrease platelet aggregation, a problem observed in many COVID-19 patients.  More recently, Tempol has been shown to have antiviral activity against the virus that causes COVID-19 in-vitro and may have synergy with the antiviral Remdesivir.
 Preclinical studies of Tempol have shown it to have antiviral, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant activity. The company believes this unique mechanism of action could provide physicians with a tool to intervene to slow or stop progression of COVID-19 or inflammation at multiple phases of the disease. If proven, this could provide Tempol with an advantage over the two oral antiviral drugs for which the FDA has recently granted Emergency Use Authorization for the treatment of COVID-19, although there can be no assurance that this would be the case.

On January 28, 2021, we announced that in collaboration with the Human Immune Monitoring Center at Stanford University we conducted a study to investigate the effects of Tempol on immune cells from COVID-19 patients, and that preliminary data from that study showed that Tempol decreases cytokines from stimulated cells from COVID-19 patients, Subsequent analysis of the data confirmed that preincubation of immune cells with Tempol resulted in a significant decrease in multiple T cell and APC-derived cytokines from both cells of COVID-19 and uninfected donors.  In March 2021, we announced that in studies conducted at Galveston National Laboratory, or GNL, University of Texas Medical Branch, hamsters challenged with the virus that causes COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) showed decreased inflammation in the lungs when treated with Tempol compared to controls, and on March 22, 2022, we announced that in studies conducted at the GNL, hamsters challenged with high levels of the Omicron variant of the SAR-CoV-2 virus, resulted in significant decrease of inflammation in the lungs of animals treated with Tempol compared to controls.
 In July 2020, we submitted to the FDA a pre-IND package which provided a protocol for a Phase 2/3 study examining Tempol in COVID-19 patients, and the FDA provided comments regarding the prospective use of Tempol in a randomized placebo controlled trial. In January 2021, we submitted an IND to the FDA for the investigational use of Tempol for the treatment of COVID-19. On February 22, 2021, we announced that the FDA notified the company that the agency had completed the safety review of the IND and concluded that the company may proceed with the proposed clinical investigation and trial described in the IND. The goal of the study titled, “A Phase 2/3, Adaptive, Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Study to Examine the Effects of Tempol (MBM-02) on Preventing COVID-19 Related Hospitalization in Subjects with COVID-19 Infection,” is to examine the safety and activity of Tempol in COVID-19 patients early in the infection. In addition to safety, the study will examine markers of inflammation, clinical resolution of symptoms, and the rate of hospitalization for patients taking Tempol versus placebo early in COVID-19 infection. The trial is designed to enroll a total of approximately 248 patients.  On June 11, 2021, we announced that clinical trial start-up activities were underway, that the company was carrying out those activities with a large clinical research organization, that commenced activities included site identification and initiation, data base production, vendor management, and the establishment of an independent data safety monitoring board, or DSMB, of infectious disease experts, which will review the safety and efficacy of the trial, and that clinical trial drug product and placebo have also been obtained. On September 2, 2021, we announced the initiation of patient dosing in the trial. Our trial requires individuals with moderate COVID-19 symptoms to be unvaccinated and have co-morbidities such as heart disease, as those patients typically have worse outcomes, requiring hospitalization. We initially experienced enrollment challenges primarily as a result of the decrease in COVID-19 infections and increased immunizations in the United States. We took certain responsive steps including opening new sites across the U.S. and modifying the protocol to include vaccinated subjects.
 In February 2022 we announced the enrollment and dosing of more than 100 subjects in the Phase 2/3 trial.  On March 14, 2022, we announced that the Data Safety Monitoring Board, or DSMB, overseeing the Phase 2/3 clinical trial met to evaluate the clinical and safety data from the first planned interim analysis and, following its evaluation, recommended that the study continue without modification. The trial is continuing, and following submission of additional data and information to the DSMB, the DSMB will conduct a second planned review, currently anticipated to be in May 2022, which may provide additional insight into the safety and clinical results at that time.  In January 2022, we submitted a Fast Track Application to the FDA for Tempol for the treatment and prevention of COVID-19.  Fast Track is a process designed to facilitate the development, and expedite the review, of drugs to treat serious conditions and fulfills an unmet medical need. The purpose is to get important new drugs to the patient earlier. Fast Track addresses a broad range of serious conditions, and the request can be initiated by the drug company at any time during the development process. The FDA will review the request and decide based on whether the drug fulfills an unmet medical need in a serious condition. Once a drug receives Fast Track designation, early and frequent communication between the FDA and the drug company is encouraged throughout the entire drug development and review process.  In March 2022, we received a communication from the FDA denying our request for Fast Track designation for our Tempol product at this time, indicating that the program did not satisfy the requirements for Fast Track designation.  
  We intend to continue to explore the availability of government and/or non-government funding to help support study the efficacy of Tempol as a therapeutic treatment for COVID-19.  We also continue to explore options regarding the funding and design of a clinical study to examine the effects of Tempol for other clinical indications including, but not limited to, the treatment of methamphetamine and cocaine use disorder, and are engaged in additional activities intended to support such development, should we determine to pursue and proceed with such activities.

Under our agreement with the Licensor, we will be responsible for funding preclinical and clinical development relating to products developed for the licensed fields of use, and for matters relating to compliance of any licensed products or development and testing of licensed products with laws and regulations. Licensor will provide, and we will purchase from Licensor, Tempol material for preclinical or clinical work or use in licensed products, and Licensor agreed to provide us with other information and materials relating to testing and development of products within the licensed fields of use. The agreement provides for representatives of the company and Licensor to meet periodically and discuss issues relating to the development, testing and approval of products within the licensed fields of use.  Under the license agreement, if any products are commercialized, profits (as defined in the agreement) from sales of licensed products will be shared equally between the parties.  Profits are generally determined as net sales of licensed products less costs incurred by us for manufacturing, marketing and distribution of licensed products.  The license agreement contains other covenants of the company and Licensor relating to, among other matters, funding of testing and development of licensed products, confidentiality, compliance with laws, and other matters. The agreement also includes provisions regarding prosecution, maintenance, infringement and enforcement of the licensed patents, books and records, indemnification and other matters. The company may not sublicense its rights under the agreement without the consent of Licensor, and neither party may assign its rights under the agreement without the consent of the other party. The term of the agreement continues until the expiration of the last to expire of the patents licensed under the agreement and will terminate or may be terminated earlier upon the occurrence of certain other events including an uncured breach of the agreement or failure to satisfy certain covenants. The company may also terminate the agreement with advance written notice to Licensor.    US Compounding, Inc.
 On July 30, 2021, the company and its wholly-owned USC subsidiary entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement, or the USC Agreement, effective as of July 30, 2021, or the Effective Date, with Fagron Compounding Services, LLC d/b/a Fagron Sterile Services, or the Purchaser, providing for the sale and transfer by USC and the purchase by the Purchaser, effective as of the Effective Date, of certain assets of USC related to its human compounding pharmaceutical business, or the Business, including certain customer information and information on products sold to such customers by USC, together, the “Book of Business,” including related formulations, know-how, and expertise regarding the compounding of pharmaceutical preparations, clinical support knowledge and other data and certain other information relating to the customers and products, collectively referred to as the “Assets.” After the Effective Date, Purchaser may use the Book of Business to secure customers for its products and services and may otherwise use the Book of Business. Pursuant to the USC Agreement, the Purchaser will not assume any liabilities of USC, and the transaction did not include the sale or transfer of any USC equipment, buildings or real property, or any products, information, agreements, relationships or other assets relating to the veterinary business of USC.    The USC Agreement provides that the consideration payable by the Purchaser to the company for the Assets sold and transferred will consist of the following amounts: (i) a payment of $107,500 on the Effective Date; and (ii) monthly payments in an amount equal to (a) two (2.0) times the amount actually collected by Purchaser or its affiliates for sales of products or services made to certain identified customers included in the Book of Business during the 12-month period following the Effective Date, or the “Payment Term.” and (b) a lower multiple of the amount actually collected by Purchaser or its affiliates for sales of products or services made to certain other customers included in the Book of Business. In addition, to the extent that such product or service is supplied by USC pursuant to the supply arrangement provided for by the USC Agreement, or the “Supply Agreement,” the Purchaser agreed to reimburse USC for the cost of such product or service, as set forth in the Supply Agreement. The USC Agreement provides that during the Payment Term, the Purchaser will maintain the Book of Business and use commercially reasonable efforts to maximize the consideration payable to the company and collect amounts outstanding related to sales of products or services made to customers included in the Book of Business. However, the USC Agreement does not provide for any minimum purchase price consideration to the company or USC. Accordingly, there is no assurance as to the amount of purchase price consideration that the company or USC may ultimately receive as a result of the transactions contemplated by the USC Agreement. Certain of the customers included in the Book of Business may decide to not purchase products or to reduce their purchases of products from Purchaser after the Effective Date, and Purchaser may, in good faith, decide not to change its product mix from those products offered by Purchaser as of the Effective Date and may decide not to carry all of the products offered and sold by USC as part of the Business prior to the Effective Date.
 The USC Agreement includes certain restrictive covenants of the company and USC, including noncompetition provisions, pursuant to which, for a period of five years from the Effective Date, or the “Restricted Period,” and subject to certain exceptions, the company and USC have agreed, among other matters, not to solicit any Business from any customers included in the Book of Business or engage in certain other activities. Each of the USC Agreement and the Supply Agreement includes standard indemnification provisions, and a number of other covenants and agreements of the parties concerning the transactions contemplated by the USC Agreement and the Supply Agreement, including concerning cooperation and assistance, confidentiality, non-disparagement and the transfer of information and documents, compliance with laws, and personnel matters. The USC Agreement includes indemnification provisions pursuant to which the company and USC agreed to indemnify the Purchaser and certain related parties against losses incurred by such indemnified parties arising or resulting from certain matters including breach of the USC Agreement by USC and third party claims relating to product sales to customers by USC before the Effective Date.  In connection with the transaction, the company accrued a $700,000 liability for a transaction fee payable to a financial advisor.

    Plan for the Remaining Operations, Business and Assets of USC
 In light of a number of factors including the sale of assets to the Purchaser pursuant to the USC Agreement, in August 2021 the Board approved a restructuring process of winding down the remaining operations and business of USC and selling, transferring or disposing of the remaining assets of USC.  Effective October 31, 2021, USC surrendered its Arkansas retail pharmacy permit and wholesaler/outsourcer permit and is no longer selling compounded pharmaceutical or veterinary products.  The restructuring and winding down includes, without limitation, the termination of USC’s veterinary business and USC sales to veterinary customers; the termination of employment of all or substantially all employees engaged in the USC business (except as determined to be necessary or appropriate in connection with the company’s and USC’s performance of their obligations under the USC Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, or in connection with resolving matters relating to the winding down of USC’s business), and providing such notices and making such payments to such employees as the officers of the company determine are necessary or appropriate, including as maybe required by law or as maybe provided for pursuant to any retention agreement, severance agreement, incentive agreement, or other written agreement with such employees; the sale or other disposition from time to time of the remaining equipment, real property, buildings and tangible and intangible assets relating to USC’s business that are unrelated to the USC Agreement; the termination, assignment or other resolution of agreements with third parties relating to the USC business; making regulatory filings and taking appropriate actions with federal and state regulatory authorities in connection with the winding down and winding up of USC’s business; and taking such other actions as the officers of the company or USC (as appropriate) determine are necessary or appropriate in connection with the winding down and winding up of the remaining business, operations and assets of USC. The company has sold and disposed of certain customer information and other assets related to USC’s veterinary compounded pharmaceuticals business and will continue the process of selling or otherwise disposing of the remaining assets relating to USC’s business. 
  Other Product Candidates or Technologies             C31G. We also have a microbicide product candidate, named C31G. In December 2010, we announced the successful completion of a Phase 3 contraceptive trial of C31G. The study met its primary endpoint and was conducted by the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD), NIH, in the Contraceptive Clinical Trials Network at 14 sites in the United States. The clinical investigators found that C31G was not inferior in contraceptive efficacy to the comparator drug Conceptrol. Moreover, the gel was well-tolerated and had a high degree of acceptability in women who completed the study. C31G does not contain nonoxynol-9 and, if commercialized, could offer an alternative for women who seek a non-hormonal method of contraception. In addition, in September 2013 we announced that a published study conducted by university researchers at Louisiana State University Health Science Center found that C31G was effective in treating Herpes Simplex Virus, or HSV, in an eye infection (ocular keratitis) animal model using live rabbits. In the same study the researchers also reported that ocular administration of C31G was safe and well tolerated, confirming earlier clinical studies that established C31G safety and tolerability in other applications. HSV-1 is the same virus that causes cold sores and is common in humans. In previous animal studies, C31G was also active against HSV-2, the cause of genital herpes. Before considering any actions to further develop or consider commercialization alternatives for a C31G product candidate, further meetings with the FDA would be required to discuss the regulatory pathways for submitting an NDA for marketing approval, including the additional trials that would be required before an NDA is submitted, and in addition, we would seek to enter into an out-licensing or similar transaction with third party entities or organizations. The C31G product candidate is held by our Biosyn, Inc. subsidiary, which we acquired in 2004. Provisions in the agreement pursuant to which we acquired Biosyn, and/or in certain of the funding or other agreements relating to the C31G product, provide for payments to the former Biosyn shareholders upon marketing approval by the FDA (or, in certain circumstances, certain foreign regulatory authorities) of C31G for one or more indications, and for payments to certain other third parties in the event of sales or other revenues relating to C31G or certain other events. In addition, sale or out-licensing of the C31G product candidate may require the consent of one or more such third parties. Accordingly, there can be no assurances that we will pursue commercialization of or enter into any agreement or transaction involving C31G or that any C31G product will be developed, submitted for regulatory approval, approved or marketed.            Our development plans and decisions regarding our products and product candidates, including whether to continue, resume or terminate product development efforts, are affected by a number of factors, including without limitation the availability of adequate funding, the development, clinical trial and regulatory pathway for the product candidate, the costs and results of preparing for and conducting any additional studies, trials or development efforts that we may determine to undertake, the pace of conduct, progress, and completion of, studies relating to our product candidates, the absence of unexpected regulatory issues or delays, the time period required to enroll a sufficient number of patients in the study, our success in negotiating and entering into development or commercialization agreements relating to our products should we choose to seek commercialization partners for one or more of our products or product candidates, and the commercial and competitive landscape for the product including the introduction of potentially competing new products by our competitors. As a result, our product development plans, as well as the anticipated dates for development and introduction of products in our product pipeline, could be affected by such considerations. In considering development and commercialization alternatives for our products and product candidates and technologies, we may seek to enter into development or commercialization agreements, license agreements, or other strategic agreements with third parties relating to development, commercialization and marketing of one or more of our products or product candidates. We currently have no in-house manufacturing capabilities, and as a result we intend to rely on third-party contract manufacturers to manufacture the materials needed for our clinical trials, products and product candidates.

 Additional factors that could affect the development and launch dates for our products and product candidates include general market conditions, the outcome of discussions with the FDA concerning the regulatory approval pathway of the applicable product candidate including the number and kind of clinical trials that the FDA will require before the FDA will consider regulatory approval of the applicable product, any unexpected difficulties in licensing or sublicensing intellectual property rights that may be required for other components of the product, patent infringement lawsuits relating to Paragraph IV certifications as part of any Section 505(b)(2) or ANDA filings, any unexpected difficulties in the ability of our suppliers to timely supply quantities for commercial launch of the product, any unexpected delays or difficulties in assembling and deploying an adequate sales force to market the product, and receipt of adequate funding to support product development and sales and marketing efforts.   

 Clinical Supplies and Manufacturing 
    We have no in-house manufacturing or distribution capabilities and have no current plans to establish manufacturing facilities for significant clinical or commercial production.  We rely on third-party contract manufacturers to manufacture our products and make the material used to support the development of our product candidates.  Our third-party manufacturers are subject to extensive governmental regulation. The FDA mandates that drugs be manufactured, packaged and labeled in conformity with current good manufacturing practices, or cGMP, regulations. In complying with cGMP regulations, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in production, record keeping and quality control to ensure that their services and products meet applicable specifications and other requirements.  We intend to continue to outsource the manufacture and distribution of our products for the foreseeable future, and we believe this manufacturing strategy will enable us to direct our financial resources to development of products without devoting the resources and capital required to build cGMP compliant manufacturing facilities.  Our SYMJEPI (epinephrine) Injection 0.3mg and 0.15mg products are manufactured by a third-party manufacturer, Catalent Belgium SA/NV, utilizing materials to complete the manufacturing process obtained from various companies and suppliers.  Our ZIMHI (naloxone) Injection 5 mg product is also  manufactured by a third-party manufacturer, Siegfried, Irvine, USA, utilizing materials to complete the manufacturing process obtained from various companies and suppliers. The assembly and final packaging of all our products are implemented by a third-party entity, Phillips-Medisize, LLC. There are potential sources of supply other than our existing suppliers, although new suppliers would be required to qualify under applicable regulatory requirements.  Sales and Marketing        Our SYMJEPI (epinephrine) products were initially marketed and sold in the U.S. markets by Sandoz pursuant to our commercialization agreement with Sandoz.  Following termination of the Sandoz Agreement in 2020, our SYMJEPI products and our ZIMHI product are marketed and sold in the U.S. markets by USWM pursuant to our USWM Agreement.  
  Customers and Distribution         Our SYMJEPI (epinephrine) 0.15 mg and 0.3 mg Injection products and our ZIMHI product are distributed in the U.S. markets by our commercialization partner USWM pursuant to the USWM Agreement.  The FDA approved ZIMHI for marketing in October 2021, and on March 31, 2022, our commercialization partner USWM and we issued a press release announcing the commercial launch of ZIMHI. Pursuant to our agreement with USWM, we are responsible for supplying the SYMJEPI and ZIMHI products to USWM at a supply price for quantities of products ordered.  On January 22, 2021, we announced that the SYMJEPI products added to the Walgreens Prescription Savings Club program and were available to members of the program.  The Walgreens Prescription Savings Club offers customers, who pay an annual membership fee, savings off retail prices on a large variety of medications.    Competition         The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are extremely competitive. Our potential competitors in the field are many in number and include major pharmaceutical and specialized biotechnology companies. Many of our potential competitors have significantly more financial, technical and other resources than we do, which may give them a competitive advantage. In addition, they may have substantially more experience in effecting strategic combinations, in-licensing technology, developing drugs, obtaining regulatory approvals and manufacturing and marketing products. We cannot give any assurances that we can compete effectively with these other biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies. Our potential competitors in these markets may succeed in developing products that could render our products and those of our collaborators obsolete or non-competitive. In addition, many of our competitors have significantly greater experience than we do in the fields in which we compete.  
     Our products and product candidates, if developed, approved and launched, will compete with numerous prescription and non-prescription over-the-counter products targeting similar conditions, as well as prescription generic products. In addition, a number of large pharmaceuticals companies produce similar pharmaceutical products for similar indications. Moreover, certain products that previously have been available by prescription only have been or could in the future be approved by the FDA for sale over-the-counter without a prescription at a lower price than competing prescription products, which could adversely affect our ability to successfully develop and market a competing prescription product.

   The SYMJEPI (epinephrine) Injection 0.3mg and 0.15mg products compete against other self-administered epinephrine products, including EpiPen, EpiPen Jr., Auvi-Q and Adrenaclick. There has been market and regulatory focus in recent years on the prices to consumers of self-administered epinephrine products, which have exerted downward pressure on the pricing of such products. The company that markets EpiPen, introduced an authorized generic version of the auto-injector product at a lower price than the EpiPen.  Additionally, in late 2018 a generic, or A/B rated, competitor to EpiPen was approved and launched. Other competing products have been introduced or prices on existing competing products have been reduced, and if additional competing products are introduced in the future, including additional generic versions of one or more existing spring-loaded auto-injector devices, at lower prices than the current market leading products, the competitive success of our SYMJEPI products could be adversely affected. The competitive success of our products could also be adversely affected by changes in the willingness of insurance companies and other third-party payors to cover or reimburse some or all of the costs to consumers of our products.  Our ZIMHI high dose naloxone injection product, for opioid overdose, is expected to compete with other products in the markets for opioid overdose.  If we successfully develop and obtain regulatory approval of our Tempol product candidate for the treatment of COVID-19, such product would compete with a variety of COVID-related therapeutic products in the marketplace that are intended to address the approved indications. 
 Intellectual Property 
     Our success will depend in part on our ability to:  
    
● | obtain and maintain international and domestic patents and other legal protections for the proprietary technology, inventions and improvements we consider important to our business;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | prosecute and defend our patents; 
● | preserve our trade secrets; and 
● | operate without infringing on the patents and proprietary rights of other parties. 

 
We intend to continue to seek appropriate patent protection for product candidates in our research and development programs where applicable and their uses by filing patent applications in the United States and other selected countries.  We intend for these patent applications to cover, where possible, claims for composition of matter, medical uses, processes for preparation and formulations. As of December 31, 2021, the company had: (i) 27 issued patents in the United States and 10 pending United States patent applications, one of which has been allowed; (ii) 91 issued and 42 pending foreign patent applications, two of which have been allowed, relating to our Symject™ injection device, DPI and C31G products and product candidates, among other things. The issued patents and allowed patents applications are expected to expire between 2022  and 2041, not taking into account any potential patent-term extensions that may be available in the future.
 
In addition, we have licensed certain rights under certain patents, patent applications and related know-how of the Licensor relating to Tempol pursuant to our license agreement with the Licensor.  The exclusive license includes the worldwide use under the licensed patent rights and related rights of Licensor for Tempol for the fields of COVID-19 infection, asthma, respiratory syncytial virus infection, and influenza infection, as well as the exclusive license includes the use of Tempol as a therapeutic for reducing radiation-induced dermatitis in patients undergoing treatment for cancer.     Although we believe that our rights under patents and patent applications provide a competitive advantage, the patent positions of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies are highly uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions. We may not be able to develop patentable products or processes, and may not be able to obtain patents from pending applications. Even if patent claims are allowed, the claims may not issue, or in the event of issuance, may not be sufficient to protect the technology owned by or licensed to us. It is possible that any patents or patent rights that we obtain or license may be circumvented, challenged or invalidated by our competitors. 
     We also rely on trade secrets, proprietary know-how and continuing innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position, especially when we do not believe that patent protection is appropriate or can be obtained. We seek protection of these trade secrets, proprietary know-how and any continuing innovation, in part, through confidentiality and proprietary information agreements. However, these agreements may not provide meaningful protection for, or adequate remedies to protect, our technology in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of information. Furthermore, our trade secrets may otherwise become known to, or be independently developed by, our competitors.  
     Government Regulation         The marketing of pharmaceutical products in the United States is subject to extensive government regulation. Likewise, if we seek to market and distribute any such products abroad, they would also be subject to extensive foreign government regulation. 
     In the United States, the FDA regulates pharmaceutical products. FDA regulations govern the testing, manufacturing, marketing, advertising, promotion, labeling, sale and distribution of pharmaceutical products, and generally require a rigorous process for the approval of new drugs. We also may be subject to foreign regulatory requirements governing clinical trials and drug product sales if products are tested or marketed abroad. The approval process outside the United States varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and the time required may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval.

 Regulation in the United States          Seeking and obtaining FDA approval to market a drug requires substantial time, effort and money. Our product candidates that require marketing approval by the FDA will be regulated as drugs. In the United States, drugs are subject to regulation under the FDCA. The statute and related regulations govern, among other things, testing, manufacturing, safety, efficacy, labeling, storage, record keeping, advertising, and other promotional practices. The FDA approval process for new drugs generally includes, without limitation:  
    
● | preclinical studies; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | submission of an Investigational New Drug application, or IND, for clinical trials; 
● | adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish safety and efficacy of the product; 
● | review of a New Drug Application, or NDA; and 
● | inspection of the facilities used in the manufacturing of the drug to assess compliance with the FDA’s current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMP, regulations.

 
Failure to comply with FDA and other governmental regulations at any time during the product development process, approval process, or after approval can result in fines, unanticipated compliance expenditures, recall or seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production and/or distribution, suspension of the FDA’s review of NDAs injunctions and criminal prosecution. Any of these actions could have a material adverse effect on us.
 
Preclinical Trials    
Preclinical studies include laboratory evaluation of the product, as well as animal studies to assess the potential safety and effectiveness of the product. Most of these studies must be performed according to FDA’s Good Laboratory Practice, or GLP, requirements, a system of management controls for laboratories and research organizations to ensure the consistency and reliability of results. The results of the preclinical studies and existing clinical and/or human use data (if applicable), together with manufacturing information and analytical data, are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND, which we are required to file before we can commence any clinical trials for our product candidates in the United States. Clinical trials may begin 30 days after an IND is received, unless the FDA raises concerns or questions about the conduct of the clinical trials. If concerns or questions are raised, an IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before clinical trials can proceed. We cannot assure you that submission of any additional IND for any of our preclinical product candidates will result in authorization to commence clinical trials.
 
Human Clinical Trials under an IND

Clinical trials involve the administration of the product candidate that is the subject of the trial to volunteers or patients under the supervision of a qualified principal investigator. Each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, at each institution at which the study will be conducted. The IRB will consider, among other things, ethical factors, safety of human subjects and the possible liability of the institution arising from the conduct of the proposed clinical trial. Also, clinical trials must be performed according to standards, commonly referred to as Good Clinical Practice, or GCP, requirements, which are enumerated in FDA regulations and guidance documents. 
 
Clinical trials typically are conducted in sequential phases: Phases 1, 2 and 3. The phases may overlap. The FDA may require that we suspend clinical trials at any time on various grounds, including if the FDA makes a finding that the subjects participating in the trial are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. In Phase 1 clinical trials, a drug is usually tested on a limited number of healthy subjects to determine safety, existence of adverse effects, proper dosage, absorption, metabolism, distribution, excretion and other drug effects. In Phase 2 clinical trials, a drug is usually tested on a limited patient population to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the drug for specific, targeted indications, determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage, and identify possible adverse effects and safety risks. In Phase 3 clinical trials, a drug is usually tested on a larger patient population to determine efficacy and to further determine safety, usually at multiple clinical sites. We cannot assure you that any of our current or future clinical trials will result in approval to market additional products.      
U.S. Review and Approval Processes

An NDA must include comprehensive and complete descriptions of the preclinical testing, clinical trials and the chemical, manufacturing and control requirements of a drug that enable the FDA to determine the drug’s or biologic’s safety and efficacy. An NDA must be accompanied by payment of a user fee unless a waiver or exemption applies, and must be submitted, filed and approved by the FDA before any drug product that we may successfully develop and that requires marketing approval by the FDA can be marketed commercially in the United States.  
      Once the FDA receives an NDA, it has 60 days to review the application to determine if it is substantially complete and the data is readable, before it accepts the NDA for filing. The FDA can refuse to file any NDA that it deems incomplete or not properly reviewable.  Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review of the submission to determine, among other things, whether the proposed product is safe and effective for its intended use, and whether the product is being manufactured in accordance with cGMP to assure and preserve the product’s identity, strength, quality and purity.

 Under the goals and policies agreed to by the FDA under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, the FDA agrees to specific goals for NDA review time through a two-tiered classification system, Priority Review and Standard Review. A Priority Review designation is given to drugs that are intended to treat serious conditions, and would provide a significant improvement in safety and effectiveness if approved.  For a Priority Review application, the FDA aims to complete the initial review cycle for New Molecular Entities, or NMEs, within six months of the 60 day filing date, and for non-NMEs within six months of the date of receipt. Standard Review applies to all applications that are not eligible for Priority Review. The FDA aims to complete Standard Review NDAs for NMEs within ten months of the 60 day filing date, and for non-NMEs within ten months of the date of receipt. Such dates are often referred to as the PDUFA dates. The FDA does not always meet its PDUFA dates for either Standard Reviews or Priority Reviews of NDAs. The review process and the PDUFA date may be extended by three months if the FDA requests or the sponsor otherwise provides additional information or clarification regarding information already provided in the submission within the last three months before the PDUFA date. In addition, the FDA’s review processes can extend beyond, and in some cases significantly beyond, anticipated completion dates due to FDA requests for additional information or clarification, issuance of a complete response letter, difficulties scheduling an advisory committee meeting, negotiations regarding any required risk evaluation and mitigation strategies, FDA workload issues or other reasons.

 The FDA also has established programs to expedite the development and review of drugs intended to treat serious conditions.  For example, the fast track designation is designed to facilitate the development, and expedite the review, of drugs that are intended to treat serious or life-threatening conditions and address an unmet medical need. The FDA generally attempts to facilitate early and frequent meetings with sponsors of fast track drugs.  The breakthrough therapy designation is granted to drugs intended to treat a serious or life-threatening condition where preliminary clinical evidence indicates the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement on one or more clinically significant endpoints over available therapies. In addition to early and frequent meetings between the sponsor and FDA, benefits of breakthrough designation include intensive guidance on efficient drug development from FDA, as well as organizational commitment from FDA.  Finally, accelerated approval may be granted for a drug that treats a serious or life-threatening condition and provides a meaningful therapeutic advantage over available treatments, and the drug demonstrates an effect on a surrogate endpoint reasonably likely to predict a clinical benefit or a clinical endpoint other than irreversible morbidity or mortality.    
The amount of time taken for the approval process is a function of a number of variables, including whether the product has received priority review or has received another expedited program designation, the quality of the submission and studies presented, the potential contribution that the compound will make in improving the treatment of the disease in question, and the workload at the FDA. The FDA may, during its review of an NDA, ask for additional test data or the conducting of additional clinical trials.
 
 Prior to regulatory approval, the FDA may elect to obtain advice from outside experts regarding scientific issues and/or marketing applications under FDA review. These outside experts are convened through the FDA’s Advisory Committee process. An Advisory Committee will report to the FDA and make recommendations. Views of the Advisory Committee may differ from those of the FDA, and the FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an Advisory Committee.      
Before approving an NDA, the FDA generally will inspect the facilities at which the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the NDA unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and are adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. The facilities, procedures and operations for any of our contract manufacturers must be determined to be adequate by the FDA before product approval. Foreign manufacturing facilities are also subject to periodic FDA inspections or inspections by foreign regulatory authorities. Vendors that may supply us with finished products or components used to manufacture, package and label products are also subject to similar regulations and periodic inspections. Among other things, the FDA may withhold approval of NDAs or other product applications if deficiencies are found at any of these facilities.
 
Additionally, before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure that the clinical studies were conducted in compliance with GCP requirements. If the FDA determines that the processes and procedures used are not acceptable, it will outline the deficiencies in the submission and often will request additional clinical testing or information before an NDA can be approved. The FDA may also inspect one or more of the preclinical toxicology research sites to assure that the preclinical studies were conducted in compliance with GLP requirements. If the FDA determines that the studies were not performed in compliance with applicable GLP rules and regulations, the FDA may request additional preclinical testing or information before an NDA can be approved.
 
 The FDA will issue a complete response letter if the agency decides not to approve the NDA. The complete response letter describes the specific deficiencies in the submission identified by the FDA. The deficiencies identified may be minor, for example, requiring labeling changes, or more significant, for example, requiring additional clinical trials. Additionally, the complete response letter may include recommended actions that the applicant might take to place the application in a condition for approval. If a complete response letter is issued, the applicant may resubmit the NDA, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, or withdraw the application. 
 
If a product receives regulatory approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific diseases and dosages or the indications for use may otherwise be limited, which could restrict the commercial value of the product. The FDA also may impose restrictions on the use of the product, which may be difficult and expensive to administer.  Further, the FDA may require that certain contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling.  Moreover, the FDA may require prior approval of promotional materials. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require an applicant to develop a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or REMS.  A REMS uses risk minimization strategies beyond the professional labeling to ensure that the benefits of the product outweigh the potential risks.  REMS can include medication guides, communication plans for healthcare professional, and elements to assure safe use.
 
 In addition, the FDA may require post marketing studies, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 testing, which involves clinical trials designed to further assess drug safety and effectiveness and may require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products that have been commercialized. After approval, certain changes to the approved drug or biologic, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes or additional labeling claims, are subject to further FDA review and approval. Depending on the nature of the change proposed, an NDA supplement must be filed and approved before the change may be implemented. For many proposed post-approval changes to an NDA, the FDA review period can be lengthy and is often significantly extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification.

Post-approval requirements
      Following receipt of regulatory approval, any products that we market continue to be subject to extensive regulation including, among other things, record-keeping requirements; reporting of adverse experiences with the product; providing the FDA with updated safety and efficacy information; product storage, sampling and distribution requirements; complying with certain electronic records and signature requirements; and complying with FDA promotion and advertising requirements, which include, among others, restrictions on direct-to-consumer advertising, promoting drugs for uses or in patient populations that are not described in the product’s approved labeling, known as “off-label” use, and requirements relating to industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities and promotional activities involving the internet. These regulations impact many aspects of our operations, including the manufacture, labeling, packaging, adverse event reporting, storage, distribution, advertising, promotion and record keeping related to the products. The FDA also frequently requires post-marketing testing and surveillance to monitor the effects of approved products or places conditions on any approvals that could restrict the commercial applications of these products. If we fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, we may be subject to fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, disgorgement of money, civil injunctions, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution. 

 In addition, as part of the sales and marketing process, pharmaceutical companies frequently provide samples of approved drugs to physicians. This practice is regulated by the FDA and other governmental authorities, including, in particular, requirements concerning record keeping and control procedures. Any failure to comply with the regulations may result in significant criminal and civil penalties as well as damage to our credibility in the marketplace.  

The FDA closely regulates the post-approval marketing and promotion of drugs, including through standards and regulations for direct-to-consumer advertising, off-label promotion, industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities, and promotional activities involving the Internet. While physicians may choose to prescribe drugs for uses that are not described in the product’s labeling and for uses that differ from those tested in clinical studies and approved by the regulatory authorities, our ability to promote the products is limited to those indications that are specifically approved by the FDA. These “off-label” uses are not unusual across certain medical specialties and may constitute an appropriate treatment for many patients in varied circumstances. Federal regulatory authorities in the U.S. generally do not regulate the behavior of physicians in their choice of treatments. Federal regulatory authorities do, however, restrict communications by pharmaceutical companies on the subject of off-label use. If our promotional activities fail to comply with these regulations or guidelines, we may be subject to warnings from, or enforcement action by, these authorities. In addition, our failure to follow FDA rules and guidelines relating to promotion and advertising may cause the FDA to delay its approval, and could result in other consequences such as recalls, fines, disgorgement of money, operating restrictions, injunctions, civil or criminal prosecution or penalties, or other possible legal or regulatory actions, such as warning letters, seizure of product, mandated corrective advertising or communications with healthcare professionals, or criminal penalties or other negative consequences, including adverse publicity. Any of these consequences could harm our business.
 
 We will rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third-parties for the production of clinical and commercial quantities of our products. Our collaborators may also utilize third-parties for some or all of a product we are developing with such collaborator. Manufacturers are required to comply with applicable FDA manufacturing requirements contained in the FDA’s cGMP regulations. cGMP regulations require among other things, quality control and quality assurance as well as the corresponding maintenance of records and documentation. Drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies and are subject to periodic inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP and other laws. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance.
     Emergency Use Authorization        The Emergency Use Authorization, or EUA, authority allows the FDA to temporarily authorize emergency use of unapproved drugs, biologics and medical devices, or approved drugs, biologics and medical devices for unapproved uses.  FDA may authorize emergency use of products when the Secretary of Health and Human Services has made a declaration that the circumstances justifying emergency use exist, which itself may be made on the basis of a determination regarding a domestic emergency, military emergency, or public health emergency made by the Secretary of Homeland Security, Secretary of Defense, or the Secretary of Health and Human Services, respectively, or on the basis of the identification of a material threat under the Public Health Service Act.   Such emergencies and threats generally are determined to exist on the basis of a chemical, biological, radiological, or nuclear, or CBRN, agent or agents, or a disease or condition that may be attributable to such agent or agents.

 An EUA authorized medical product may be used to diagnose, treat, or prevent serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions caused by a CBRN agent. The FDA may issue an EUA if it determines that (i) a product may be effective in diagnosing, treating, or preventing a disease or condition, (ii) the known and potential benefits of a product outweigh the known and potential risks of the product, (iii) there is no adequate, approved, and available alternative to the product for diagnosing, preventing, or treating such disease or condition, and if other regulatory criteria are met.  An EUA request must be submitted by the product sponsor and generally includes a summary of the available scientific evidence regarding the product’s safety and effectiveness, risks (including an adverse event profile) and benefits, and any available, approved alternatives to the product. Also included are manufacturing information and fact sheets that convey important information about the product.  Even if a product is authorized for emergency use, the FDA may revoke an EUA if it determines that circumstances justifying emergency use no longer exist, the criteria for authorization are no longer met, or other circumstances justify revocation of the authorization.  There are no assurances that, if we seek an EUA for any of our products, any EUAs will be granted or approved for any of our products.

    Section 505(b)(2) New Drug Applications       New drug products may obtain FDA marketing approval pursuant to a Section 505(b)(1) NDA filing or a 505(b)(2) NDA filing.  Whereas a 505(b)(1) NDA requires that the applicant must support its application with its own information or information to which it has a right of reference, a Section 505(b)(2) NDA enables the applicant to rely, in part, on the FDA’s findings of safety and efficacy of an existing product, or published literature, in support of its application. Section 505(b)(2) NDAs often provide an alternate path to FDA approval for new or improved formulations or new uses of previously approved products. Section 505(b)(2) permits the filing of an NDA where at least some of the information required for approval comes from studies not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference. The applicant may rely upon the FDA’s findings with respect to certain pre-clinical or clinical studies conducted for an approved product. The FDA may also require companies to perform additional studies or provide other data to support the change from the approved product. The FDA may then approve the new product candidate for all or some of the label indications for which the referenced product has been approved, as well as for any new indication sought by the Section 505(b)(2) applicant. 
  In seeking approval for a drug through an NDA, applicants are required to submit to the FDA information about each patent that claims the applicant’s drug or a method of using the drug, and for which a claim of patent infringement reasonably could be asserted. Upon approval of a drug, information about each of those patents is then published in the FDA’s Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations, commonly known as the Orange Book.
    To the extent that a Section 505(b)(2) NDA relies on published literature relating to a previously approved drug product or the FDA’s prior findings of safety and effectiveness for a previously approved drug product, where the underlying studies were not conducted by or for the applicant and the applicant lacks a right of reference or use to the underlying data, the Section 505(b)(2) applicant must submit in its Section 505(b)(2) application a patent certification or statement with respect to any patents that are subject to the Orange Book listing requirement in connection with the previously approved product on which the applicant’s application relies. Specifically, the applicant must certify for each such patent that, in relevant part, (1) the required patent information has not been filed; (2) the patent has expired; (3) the patent has not expired, but will expire on a particular date and approval is not sought until after patent expiration; or (4) the listed patent is invalid, unenforceable or will not be infringed by the proposed new product. Alternatively, with respect to a method of use patent, the applicant may submit a statement that the patent does not claim a use for which the applicant is seeking approval. A certification that the new product will not infringe the previously approved product’s listed patent or that such patent is invalid or unenforceable is known as a Paragraph IV certification. If the applicant does not challenge the listed patents through a Paragraph IV certification or submit a statement that a method of use patent does not claim a use for which the applicant is seeking approval, the FDA will not approve the Section 505(b)(2) NDA application until all the listed patents for the previously approved product have expired. Further, the FDA will also not approve a Section 505(b)(2) NDA until any applicable non-patent exclusivity, such as, for example, five-year exclusivity for obtaining approval of a new chemical entity, three-year exclusivity for an approval based on new clinical trials, or pediatric exclusivity, listed in the Orange Book for the referenced product, has expired.
 
If the Section 505(b)(2) NDA applicant has provided a Paragraph IV certification to the FDA, the applicant must also send notice of the Paragraph IV certification to the owner of the referenced NDA for the previously approved product and relevant patent holders within 20 days after the FDA sends the Section 505(b)(2) NDA applicant notice that the Section 505(b)(2) NDA has been accepted for filing by the FDA. The NDA and patent holders may then initiate a patent infringement suit against the Section 505(b)(2) applicant. Under the FDCA, the filing of a patent infringement lawsuit within 45 days of receipt of the notification regarding a Paragraph IV certification automatically prevents the FDA from approving the Section 505(b)(2) NDA for 30 months beginning on the date the patent holder receives notice, unless, before the end of the 30-month period, a court determines that the patent is invalid, unenforceable or not infringed; a court enters a settlement order or consent decree stating that the patent is invalid, unenforceable, or not infringed; the patent owner or exclusive licensee consents to approval of the Section 505(b)(2) NDA; or the court enters an order of dismissal without a finding of infringement. Even if a patent infringement claim is not brought within the 45-day period, a patent infringement claim may be brought under traditional patent law, but it does not invoke the 30-month stay. Moreover, in cases where a Section 505(b)(2) application containing a Paragraph IV certification is submitted during the final year of a previously approved drug’s five-year exclusivity period and the patent holder brings suit within 45 days of notice of certification, the 30-month period is automatically extended to prevent approval of the Section 505(b)(2) application until the date that is seven and one-half years after approval of the previously approved reference product. The court also has the ability to shorten or lengthen either the 30 month or the seven and one-half year period if either party is found not to be reasonably cooperating in expediting the litigation.
 
 As a result, we may invest a significant amount of time and expense in the development of a product and our Section 505(b)(2) applications only to be subject to significant delay and patent litigation before our product may be commercialized. Alternatively, if the prior NDA applicant or relevant patent holder does not file a patent infringement lawsuit within the specified 45-day period, the FDA may approve the Section 505(b)(2) application at any time, assuming the application is otherwise approvable. 
     Notwithstanding the approval of many products by the FDA pursuant to Section 505(b)(2), over the last several years, some pharmaceutical companies and others have objected to the FDA’s interpretation of Section 505(b)(2). If the FDA changes its interpretation of Section 505(b)(2), or if the FDA’s interpretation is successfully challenged in court, this could delay or even prevent the FDA from approving any Section 505(b)(2) NDA that we submit.
     We successfully pursued a Section 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway for our SYMJEPI (epinephrine) Injection 0.3 mg product and our lower dose 0.15 mg version; as well as our ZIMHI naloxone injection product; and we may pursue Section 505(b)(2) applications in connection with other product candidates as appropriate, if successfully developed. Accordingly, if we rely in our section 505(b)(2) application on published literature or the FDA’s prior findings of safety and effectiveness for a previously approved drug product for which patents are listed in the Orange Book, and if the underlying studies were not conducted by or for us and we lack a right of reference or use to the underlying data, then we will need to submit an appropriate patent certification or statement for each such patent as described above. If we make a Paragraph IV certification and the holder of the previously approved product that we referenced in our application initiates patent litigation within the time periods described above, then we will be subject to the risks of patent litigation, with the accompanying delay described above and potentially material expense of patent litigation, before we could commercially market our product. 
     In addition, even if we submit a Section 505(b)(2) application that relies on published literature or the FDA’s prior findings of safety and effectiveness for a previously approved product where there are no patents for such other product with respect to which we have to provide a patent certification or statement, we are subject to the risk that the FDA could disagree with our reliance on the particular previously approved product that we chose to rely on, conclude that such previously approved product is not an acceptable reference product, and require us instead to reference another previously approved product for which patents are listed in the Orange Book, requiring us to make an appropriate patent certification or statement as described above and subjecting us to the risks of delay and expense described above.

    Abbreviated New Drug Applications     
In contrast to the kind of clinical trial and other data that is required for an NDA submitted pursuant to Section 505(b)(1) or Section 505(b)(2) of the FDCA, an Abbreviated New Drug Application, or ANDA, contains data that, when submitted to the FDA pursuant to Section 505(j) of the FDCA, provides for the review and ultimate approval of a product commonly referred to as a “generic equivalent” or a “generic” drug product. These kinds of drug applications are called “abbreviated” because ANDA applicants are generally not required to conduct or submit preclinical (animal) and clinical (human) data to establish safety and effectiveness of their product, other than the requirement for bioequivalence testing. Instead, a generic applicant must scientifically demonstrate that its product is bioequivalent, that is, that the product performs in the same manner as the listed drug. An ANDA provides for marketing of a drug product that has the same active ingredients in the same strengths and dosage form as the listed drug and has been shown through bioequivalence testing to be therapeutically equivalent to the listed drug, among other requirements. Drugs approved in this way are commonly referred to as “generic equivalents” to the listed drug and can often be substituted by pharmacists under prescriptions written for the original listed drug. 
      In seeking approval for a new drug through an NDA, applicants are required to submit to the FDA information about each patent that claims the applicant’s drug or a method of using the drug. Upon approval of a drug, information about each of those patents is then published in the Orange Book. Drugs listed in the Orange Book can, in turn, be referenced by potential competitors in support of approval of an ANDA. The ANDA applicant is required to submit to the FDA an appropriate certification or statement concerning any patents listed for the approved product in the FDA’s Orange Book, in a manner generally similar to the certification or statement that is required in connection with Section 505(b)(2) applications as described above. As with Section 505(b)(2) applications, if the applicant does not challenge the listed patents and has not submitted a statement that a method of use patent does not claim a use for which the applicant is seeking approval, the ANDA application will not be approved until all the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired.

 If the ANDA applicant has provided a Paragraph IV certification to the FDA, then the procedures described above in connection with Section 505(b)(2) applications also apply, and the risks of the patent holder initiating a patent infringement lawsuit as described above also apply. The ANDA application also will not be approved until any applicable non-patent exclusivity, such as exclusivity for obtaining approval of a new chemical entity, listed in the Orange Book for the referenced product has expired. Federal law provides a period of five years following approval of a drug containing a new chemical entity, during which ANDAs for generic versions of those drugs cannot be submitted unless the submission contains a Paragraph IV certification to a listed patent, in which case the submission may be made four years following the original product approval. Federal law provides for a period of three years of exclusivity following approval of a listed drug that does not contain a new chemical entity, but is approved, for example, in a new dosage form, route of administration or combination, or for a new use, the approval of which was supported by new clinical trials (other than bioavailability studies) that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant and were essential to approval of the application, during which FDA cannot grant effective approval of an ANDA referencing that listed drug for the conditions of approval supported by the new clinical trials. 
  
 Regulation Outside the United States     
If we market our products in foreign countries, we also will be subject to foreign regulatory requirements governing human clinical trials, marketing approval, and commercial sales and distribution for pharmaceutical products. The requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product approval, pricing and reimbursement vary widely from country to country. Whether or not FDA approval has been obtained, approval of a product by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries must be obtained before manufacturing or marketing the product in those countries. The approval process varies from country to country and the time required for such approvals may differ substantially from that required for FDA approval. There is no assurance that any future FDA approval of any of our clinical trials or drugs will result in similar foreign approvals or vice versa.  
      Additional Regulation 
     Third-Party Reimbursement     
In the United States, physicians, hospitals and other healthcare providers that purchase pharmaceutical products generally rely on third-party payors, principally private health insurance plans, Medicare, or Medicaid, to reimburse the cost of the product and related procedure, with varying degrees of patient cost sharing. Even if a product is approved for marketing by the FDA, there is no assurance that third-party payors will cover the cost of the product and related medical procedures. If they do not, end-users of the product generally would not be eligible for any reimbursement of the cost, and our ability to successfully market any such product would be materially and adversely impacted. The level of reimbursement also varies significantly by payor and setting of care, and inadequate reimbursement also could materially and adversely impact our ability to successfully market our products. 
      Reimbursement systems vary significantly by country and, within some countries, by region, and coverage and reimbursement for our products must be obtained on a country-by-country basis. In many foreign markets, the pricing of prescription pharmaceuticals is subject to government pricing control or other mechanisms, including health technology assessments, mandatory rebates, and reference pricing. In these markets, once marketing approval is received, establishing coverage and reimbursement could take significant additional time. The lack of satisfactory reimbursement or inadequate government pricing of any of our products would limit their widespread use and lower potential product revenues.

 Fraud and Abuse Laws and Reporting Laws        In addition to FDA restrictions on marketing of pharmaceutical products, several other types of state and federal laws may restrict certain research and marketing practices in the pharmaceutical industry. These laws include federal and state anti-kickback and false claims laws. The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving remuneration to induce or in return for referring an individual to a person for the furnishing or arranging for the furnishing of any item or service reimbursable under a federal healthcare program, or purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for the purchase, lease or order of any healthcare item or service reimbursable under a federal healthcare program. The Anti-Kickback Statute has been interpreted to apply to various arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers and prescribers, purchasers, formulary managers and other entities, including arrangements where any one purpose of the remuneration was a prohibited inducement under the Statute even if the primary purpose was compensation of legitimate services. Violations of the Anti-Kickback Statute are punishable by imprisonment, criminal fines, civil monetary penalties and exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs. Although there are a number of statutory exemptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting certain common activities from prosecution or other regulatory sanctions, the exemptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly, and practices that involve remuneration intended to induce prescribing, purchases or recommendations may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exemption or safe harbor. Regulations finalized by the Department of Health and Human Services have amended existing safe harbors or added new safe harbors, and certain of these regulations are subject to ongoing review.  Additionally, if a drug product is reimbursed by Medicare or Medicaid, pricing and rebate programs must comply with, as applicable, the Medicaid rebate requirements of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990, as amended, and the Medicare Prescription Drug Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003, as amended, and other federal laws. Compliance with these fraud and abuse and reporting requirements requires significant resources. We could be required to devote significant additional financial resources and management attention if we ever become the focus of an investigation for failure to comply with these requirements.
    The federal civil False Claims Act prohibits any person from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to the federal government, including any claim submitted in violation of fraud and abuse and reporting requirements, or knowingly making, or causing to be made, a false statement to have a false claim paid. Claims that include items or services resulting from a violation of the Anti-Kickback Statute can constitute false or fraudulent claims under the False Claims Act. In addition, certain marketing practices, including off-label promotion, may violate the False Claims Act. Actions under the civil False Claims Act may be brought by the Attorney General or by a private individual acting as an informer or whistleblower in the name of the government, and violations can result in significant monetary penalties. The federal government has used the civil False Claims Act, and the threat of significant liability, in its investigations of healthcare providers, suppliers and drug and device manufacturers throughout the country for a wide variety of drug and device marketing and research practices, and has obtained large settlements. Numerous pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have been pursued under this law, including for allegedly inflating drug prices used by the government to set Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement rates, and for allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product. There is also a criminal False Claims Act, which prohibits making or presenting any false, fictitious or fraudulent claims to the government and authorizes penalties including imprisonment and fines for individuals and organizations. Many states also have statutes or regulations similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and False Claims Act, which apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payor. Sanctions under these federal and state laws may include civil monetary penalties, exclusion of a manufacturer’s products from reimbursement under government programs, criminal fines and imprisonment. Federal and state authorities may continue to devote substantial resources toward investigating healthcare providers’, suppliers’ and drug and device manufacturers’ compliance with these and other fraud and abuse and reporting requirements. 
      HIPAA        We may be subject to data privacy and security regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, and its implementing regulations, addresses the privacy, security, and transmission of individually identifiable health information and, among other things, requires the use of standard transactions, imposes privacy and security standards and requires breach notification, by covered entities, which include many healthcare providers, health plans and healthcare clearinghouses. HITECH makes HIPAA’s privacy and security standards directly applicable to business associates, such as independent contractors or agents of covered entities, that receive or obtain protected health information in connection with providing a service on behalf of a covered entity. Material monetary penalties and other remedies can result from violation of these laws and regulations. In addition, many state laws also address the privacy and security of health information, and many of these laws differ from each other in significant ways, thus complicating compliance efforts. In addition, the European Union, or EU, has a separate data security and privacy legal framework, including the European General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, which was adopted in 2018, which contains new provisions specifically directed at the processing of health information.  To the extent that we conduct clinical trials in the EU or otherwise expand our business operations to include operations in the EU, we would be subject to increased governmental regulation in the EU countries in which we might operate, including the GDPR.

Healthcare Reform

The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, or ACA, enacted in 2010, was intended to broaden access to health insurance, reduce or constrain the growth of healthcare spending, enhance remedies against fraud and abuse, add transparency requirements for the healthcare and health insurance industries, impose taxes and fees on the health industry and impose additional health policy reforms. The law thus included changes that significantly impact the pharmaceutical industry. The Physician Payments Sunshine Act, which is part of the ACA, and its implementing regulations impose federal reporting and disclosure requirements for pharmaceutical and device manufacturers with regard to payments or other transfers of value made to covered recipients, including physicians, teaching hospitals, advanced-practice nurses and physician assistants. In addition, pharmaceutical and device manufacturers also are required to report certain investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members during the preceding calendar year. Failure to submit required information may result in civil monetary penalties.

The ACA also established: an annual nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports certain branded prescription drugs and biologic agents; a new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program; and a new formula that increased the rebates that a manufacturer must pay under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program. In December 2017, portions of the ACA dealing with the individual mandate insurance requirement were effectively repealed by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, and other aspects of the ACA may be altered or repealed by future legislation. A recent court challenge to the validity of the ACA failed in June 2021, when the U.S. Supreme Court decided that the plaintiffs in the lawsuit did not have standing to challenge the constitutionality of the individual mandate provisions of the ACA. As of the date of this Report the ACA remains in effect. 
 
In addition, there has been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their commercial products, including several U.S. Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation and regulation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, review the relationship between pricing and patient assistance programs, reduce the cost of drugs under federal and state healthcare programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drugs. Any changes at the federal or state level to drug pricing or reimbursement policies could affect our ability to successfully commercialize approved products. 
 
Additionally, several states require pharmaceutical companies to report information to state agencies, including information relating to drug pricing, marketing and promotion expenses, and gifts and payments to individual health care providers in the states. Other states limit or prohibit certain marketing related activities. In addition, certain states require pharmaceutical companies to implement compliance programs or marketing codes. Additional states may consider similar proposals. Compliance with these laws is difficult and time consuming, and companies that do not comply with these state laws face civil penalties. If in the future some of our business activities were subject to challenge under one or more of such laws, an adverse outcome could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.
 
Other Laws        We are also subject to other federal, state and local laws of general applicability, such as laws regulating working conditions, and various federal, state and local environmental protection laws and regulations, including laws such as the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980, as amended, the Toxic Substances Control Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and other federal and state laws regarding, among other things, occupational safety, the use and handling of radioisotopes, environmental protection and hazardous substance control. There can be no assurance that we will not be required to incur significant costs to comply with environmental and health and safety regulations in the future. Our research and development activities may involve the controlled use of hazardous materials, including chemicals that cause cancer, volatile solvents, radioactive materials and biological materials that have the potential to transmit disease, and our operations may produce hazardous waste. If we fail to comply with these laws and regulations, we could be subjected to criminal sanctions and substantial financial liability or be required to suspend or modify our operations. We cannot completely eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials. In the event of contamination or injury, we could be held liable for damages or penalized with fines in an amount exceeding our resources.
      In addition, as an owner and operator of real property, we may also be subject to liability for environmental investigations and cleanups, including at properties currently or previously owned or operated by us, even if such contamination was not caused by us, as well as to claims for harm to health or property or for natural resource damages arising out of contamination or exposure to hazardous substances. Liability in many situations may be imposed not only without regard to fault, but may also be joint and several, so that we may be held responsible for more than our share of the contamination or other damages, or even for the entire share. We may also be subject to similar liabilities and claims in connection with locations at which hazardous substances or wastes that we have generated have been stored, treated, otherwise managed or disposed. The costs of complying with, or other impact of, current or future environmental, health and safety requirements could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.

 Outsourcing Facility Regulation    
Our compounding business formerly conducted by USC is subject to federal, state and local laws, regulations, and administrative practices, including, among others: requirements relating to federal registration as an outsourcing facility; state and local licensure and registration requirements concerning the operation of outsourcing facilities; HIPAA; ACA and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010; statutes and regulations of the FDA and the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, or DEA; and state laws and regulations promulgated by comparable state agencies concerning the preparation, sale, advertisement and promotion of drugs that were sold by USC. As described elsewhere in this Report, we have ceased the sale of compounding pharmaceutical formulations and are winding down the business of USC, but it is possible that issues could arise in the future relating to our previous activities or the activities of USC under such laws, which could have an adverse impact on our business. In addition, see “Legal Proceedings” elsewhere in this Report for additional matters relating to our former compounding pharmaceutical formulation business. 
  Employees and Human Capital Resources         As of December 31, 2021, we had 15 full-time employees, including one located outside of the United States. None of our employees is subject to a collective bargaining agreement or represented by a labor or trade union, and we believe that our relations with our employees are good.
     Our human capital management goals include, as applicable, identifying, attracting, retaining, and incentivizing our employees, directors and consultants. We seek to create a safe, supportive, and rewarding work environment and to align employees’ goals with our overall strategic direction.
