ITEM 1. BUSINESS.
Overview
 We are a manufacturer and national distributor of medical devices in the United States. We provide a broad portfolio of orthopedic implants including:
  
• | Foot and Ankle: internal and external fixation products;
--+---------------------------------------------------------


• | Orthopedics: upper and lower extremity plating and total joint reconstruction implants;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Sports Medicine: soft tissue fixation and augmentation for sports medicine procedures;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Spine: full spinal implants for trauma, degenerative disc disease, and deformity indications (collectively, we refer to these bulleted products as “Orthopedic Implants”).
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We also provide a wide array of osteo-biologics and regenerative products, which include human allografts, tendons, synthetic skin and bone substitute materials, and regenerative tissues, which we refer to as (“Biologics”). 
 All of our medical devices are approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) for sale in the United States, and all of our Biologics suppliers are licensed tissue banks accredited by the American Association of Tissue Banks. Additionally, we are licensed by the FDA for storage and distribution of human cells, tissues, and cellular and bone-based products (HCT/Ps), and an FDA-registered medical device specification developer and repackager/relabeler, and manufacturer of record, (a “Manufacturer”). We are seeking to grow our manufacturing operations, both by internal product development and by acquiring existing FDA approved devices and related intellectual property.
 
Impact of COVID-19
 
The novel coronavirus COVID-19 global pandemic has presented and continues to present significant risks to our business plan. During 2021, we were introduced to both the Delta and Omicron Variants of COVID-19, each causing a significant surge in infection rates. This surge of COVID-19 cases across the country has had a negative impact on the medical device industry during these periods due to the adverse impact on supply chains and the ability of surgeons to schedule elective surgeries. 
 During the third quarter of 2021, the COVID-19 Delta Variant had a negative impact on our sales. We believe that the increase in hospitalization rates during this period, and resulting decrease in the number of elective surgeries, attributed to the overall reduction in revenue for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to 2020.
 Despite the adverse effects of COVID-19 on our business in the third quarter of 2021, we believe that our revenues for the fourth quarter of 2021 were strengthened due to performance of deferred third quarter elective surgeries. However, the strength of the fourth quarter did not entirely compensate for the third quarter deterioration due to COVID-19. The majority of our products support patient conditions which are degenerative in nature. While most of our products are used in procedures that are currently considered elective, the procedures are typically necessary for a patient to restore mobility, reduce pain and increase quality of life and, therefore, are not typically foregone entirely. Our other cases are emergency in nature, involving trauma, and are not typically deferred.

Customers and Product Distribution Channels
 Retail. Under our retail distribution model, (“Retail Model”), we sell directly to our end customers, which consist of hospitals and medical facilities, utilizing (i) our full-time sales representatives whom we employ or engage as independent contractors and (ii) independent sales representatives who work on a non-exclusive basis. In both instances, we pay the sales representative a commission with respect to sales made by the representative. We refer to sales through our Retail Model as Retail Cases (which are herein referred to as “Retail Cases”). For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, our Retail Cases generated, in aggregate, approximately 92% and 89%, respectively, of our revenues.
 Wholesale. Under our wholesale distribution model, (“Wholesale Model”), we sell our products directly to independent distributors rather than to hospitals and medical facilities who are the ultimate end customer. We do not pay commissions from any sales to independent distributors. We refer to our sales through our Wholesale Model as Wholesale Cases, (which are herein referred to as “Wholesale Cases”). For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, our Wholesale Cases generated, in aggregate, approximately 8% and 11%, respectively, of our revenues.
 For the year ended December 31, 2021, our largest customer represented approximately 8.7% of our consolidated net revenues. We continue to develop and expand our customer portfolio through building relationships with key medical professionals in the expanding geographic areas we serve. We provide on-going product training and support to our full-time sales representatives, independent sales representatives and contractors, and independent distributors, along with product manufacturer marketing materials to ensure customer satisfaction with the products we offer. We believe focusing on these key areas is essential to growing our customer base and increasing revenues, particularly with respect to Retail Cases.
 Manufacture and Supply
 We rely on third-party suppliers for the manufacturing or machining of all our products. Outsourcing product manufacturing reduces our need for capital investment and reduces operational expense. Additionally, outsourcing provides expertise and capacity necessary to scale up or down based on demand for our products. We select our suppliers to ensure that all of our products are safe, effective, adhere to all applicable regulations, and meet our high-quality standards and supply needs. We employ a rigorous supplier assessment, qualification, and selection process targeted to suppliers that meet the requirements of the FDA, and International Organization for Standardizations, (“ISO”), and quality standards supported by our internal policies and procedures. Our quality assurance process monitors and maintains supplier performance through qualification and periodic supplier reviews and audits.
 Our suppliers consist of: 
 Manufacturers. We purchase product directly from the manufacturer on a wholesale basis and serve as a stocking distributor for the manufacturer with respect to the product. We then sell the product utilizing our Retail and Wholesale Models and determine the sales price to the end customer.
 Our primary supplier of Biologics is Vivex Biomedical, Inc. a biomedical company focused on cellular therapies that treat orthopedic, spine, wound, and soft tissue indications. With respect to Orthopedic Implants, our significant suppliers FH Orthopedics, Inc. for shoulder replacement systems, and CoreLink Surgical, Inc. for medical devices used in spine surgeries. 
 Private label manufacturers. We purchase product directly from the manufacturer on an exclusive basis. We then sell the products under one of our own proprietary brands utilizing our Retail Model or our Wholesale Model. With respect to private label products, the manufacturer owns the applicable 510(k) which is an FDA clearance of a premarket notification requesting permission for commercial distribution under Section 510(k) of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (“FDCA”).

We then sell the products under one of our own proprietary brands utilizing our Retail Model or our Wholesale Model. We contract with Vivex Biomedical to process our regenerative tissues and viable bone matrices, and Pinnacle Transplant Technologies for osteobiologics, and demineralized bone matrices. 
 During 2021, we launched and expanded our diverse portfolio of biologics with the introduction of FuseChoiceTM Derm Non-Fenestrated Dermal Matrix, FusePureTM Demineralized Bone Matrix, and FuseTrilogy TM Viable Bone Matrix, an osteoconductive, osteoinductive & osteogenic DMSO-free bone void filler. 
 Contract manufacturers. For products for which we are the Manufacturer of record on the applicable 510(k), we outsource our manufacturing and machining needs to contract manufacturers. Our approved contract manufacturers are all ISO13485 certified and machine and produce our products to our specifications. All finished products go through quality and final inspection at our facility. We then sell the products under one of our own proprietary brands utilizing our Retail Model or Wholesale Model.  Our FDA cleared products for which we are the Manufacturer of record are:
  
• | Maxim X-Treme PEEK Cervical Interbody System
--+---------------------------------------------


• | Fuse PSS open and MIS Pedicle Screw System
--+-------------------------------------------


• | OrbitumTM Compression Staple System
--+------------------------------------

Research and Development
 To further our business objectives, we use our knowledge of the healthcare industry and leverage our relationships with key suppliers, manufacturers, facility materials managers, and distribution channels. In 2021, we continued to utilize our Scientific Advisory Boards, (“SABs”), to assist with our product development and design input. Members of our SABs include the heads of teaching hospitals and universities, clinical residency programs, and clinical fellowship programs at some of the most respected institutions in the United States. Our SABs have provided valuable insight for both our products coming to market as well as the design and development of new products in our pipeline that target unmet needs of the industry, or deficiencies of existing commercialized medical devices. In January of 2022, we formed a New SAB for Sports Medicine and Extremities, to assist with our internal design and development of new product lines utilizing a novel material with osseointegration and anti-bacterial properties. We continuously review our product lines, both internally and with our SABs, proactively evaluating product trends to ensure we offer a comprehensive, high-quality, and cost-effective selection of Orthopedic Implants. We believe these efforts will enable us to become a leader in our industry and to expand our existing customer base.
Public Recognition
 Our strategic acquisitions of CPM Medical Consultants, LLC (“CPM”) and Palms Springs Partners, LLC d/b/a Maxim Surgical (“Maxim”) significantly expanded our product lines, operations, and competitive reach. Fuse was named and ranked 43rd in 2020 and 89th in 2019 on Deloitte’s Technology Fast 500™, an annual ranking of the fastest growing North American companies in the technology, media, telecommunications, life sciences and energy technologies sectors. Fuse was also named and ranked in the top 150 largest public companies by revenue in the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area, by the Dallas Morning News in 2018, 2019 and 2020.

Competition
 As a Manufacturer, distributor, and wholesaler of medical devices, we primarily compete with other distributors, as well as, vertically integrated medical device manufacturers that enjoy well-established distribution channels, national sales networks, direct sales models, and participation in large group purchasing organizations (“GPOs”) contracted with major hospitals, and surgery centers.
 We believe that our ability to offer a diverse selection of products across five different product categories, sets us apart from other distributors and gives us a competitive advantage against distributors who are not able to manufacture their own products, as well as manufacturers who are limited to distributing their own products within a specific product category. 
 Generally, we view Stryker Corporation, Smith & Nephew plc, and Orthofix Medical Inc., as examples of our large vertically integrated competitors. We believe those competitors, and companies like them, only distribute products they manufacture and have significant costs related to new product research and development and organizational support. Conversely, in addition to our own products, we sell a broad portfolio of specialized third-party manufacturers’ products and have significantly lower costs related to research and development, as well as significantly lower costs for organizational support. Thus, we believe our competitive advantage lies primarily with our single-source fulfillment sales model, allowing us to offer a broader assortment of several manufacturers’ products. We also believe that we generally realize higher gross margins than our competitors due to the lower product costs associated with being a Manufacturer and a stocking distributor. 
 We contract primarily with small- and medium-sized manufacturers of Orthopedic Implants and Biologics that are subject to FDA compliance and approval standards. We believe these manufacturers are highly innovative and cost effective because of their streamlined sales infrastructures and substantially lower research and development costs. Because of our organizational structure, large distribution footprint, and sales models, we tend to align well with our specialized suppliers’ competitive strategies, which we believe is the foundation for additional significant relationships with such suppliers compared to our competitors.
 We believe the competition in our industry is primarily driven by continued acquisitions of smaller manufacturers and distributors by larger, vertically integrated companies that produce, market and distribute medical devices, Orthopedic Implants, and Biologics. Our vertically integrated competitors benefit from their ability to control costs for the devices they manufacture and distribute. Moreover, we believe the market in which we operate is sensitive to changes in third-party and government payor reimbursements and, competitive pricing. We believe that our industry will continue to see increased mergers and acquisitions because the market is significantly fragmented with numerous medical device manufacturers, distributors, and specialized suppliers offering similar product portfolios throughout the United States. 
 Intellectual Property
 We maintain stocking distribution agreements providing for exclusive distribution rights in certain geographic areas and use of associated trademarks, service marks, and tradenames for the sale and promotion of the products we offer. In 2021 we entered into two new distribution agreements with Induce Biologics and BRM Extremities. Our distribution agreement with Induce Biologics includes exclusive distribution rights in the state of Texas for the Urist Natural Matrix Protein (“NMP”) bioimplant. Our distribution agreement with BRM Extremities includes exclusive distribution rights in the United States of the SilkToe® metatarsophalangeal joint arthroplasty system. Our stocking distribution agreements typically have terms of one (1) to three (3) years, subject to renewal terms. Furthermore, we require employees, independent contractors, consultants, and advisors to execute agreements, with varying terms of one (1) to three (3) years, that assign to us the intellectual property existing and generated from their work. In 2020, we applied and were granted trademark approval for our GalenTM and KopisTM suture anchors, part of our Fuse Suture Anchor product line. As of 2022, GalenTM became a registered trademark of Fuse.
 Government Regulation
 Our products are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA and other U.S. federal and state regulatory bodies. Our products are subject to regulation under the FDCA, and in the case of our tissue products, also under the Public Health Service Act, (“PHSA”). To ensure that our products are safe and effective for their intended use, the FDA regulates, among other things, the following activities that we or our manufacturing and distribution partners perform and will continue to perform: 

• | product design and development;
--+--------------------------------


• | product testing;
--+-----------------


• | non-clinical and clinical research;
--+------------------------------------


• | product manufacturing;
--+-----------------------


• | product labeling;
--+------------------


• | product storage;
--+-----------------

--+-----------------------


• | post-market surveillance, including reporting deaths or serious injuries related to products and certain product malfunctions.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Government Regulation – Medical Devices
 FDA’s Premarket Clearance and Approval Requirements. Unless an exemption applies, each medical device we seek to commercially distribute in the United States requires either FDA clearance of a premarket notification requesting permission for commercial distribution under Section 510(k) of the FDCA (“510(k) Clearance”), or approval of a premarket approval application (“PMA”). The information that must be submitted to the FDA in order to obtain clearance or approval to market a new medical device varies depending on how the medical device is classified by the FDA. Under the FDCA medical devices are classified as Class I, Class II, or Class III depending on the degree of risk associated with the use of the device and the extent of manufacturer and regulatory controls deemed to be necessary by the FDA to reasonably ensure their safety and effectiveness. 
 Class I devices are those with the lowest risk to the patient for which safety and effectiveness can be reasonably assured by adherence to a set of regulations, referred to as General Controls, which require compliance with the applicable portions of the FDA’s Quality System Regulation (“QSR”), facility registration and product listing, reporting of adverse events and malfunctions, and appropriate, truthful and non-misleading labeling and promotional materials. Some Class I devices also require 510(k) Clearance by the FDA, though most Class I devices are exempt from the premarket notification requirements. Class II devices are those that are subject to the General Controls, as well as Special Controls, which can include performance standards, product-specific guidance documents and post-market surveillance. Manufacturers of most Class II devices are required to submit to the FDA a premarket notification under Section 510(k) of the FDCA. Class III devices include devices deemed by the FDA to pose the greatest risk such as life-supporting or life-sustaining devices, or implantable devices, in addition to those deemed not substantially equivalent following the 510(k) process. The safety and effectiveness of Class III devices cannot be reasonably assured solely by compliance with the General Controls and Special Controls described above. Therefore, these devices must receive an approved PMA. Both 510(k)s and PMAs are subject to the payment of user fees at the time of submission for FDA review.
 If the FDA determines that the device is not “substantially equivalent” to a predicate device following submission and review of a 510(k) premarket notification, or if the manufacturer is unable to identify an appropriate predicate device and the new device or new use of the device presents a moderate or low risk, the device sponsor may either pursue a PMA approval or seek reclassification of the device through the de novo process. The products we currently market in the U.S. are Class I and Class II devices marketed under FDA 510(k) clearance.
 510(k) Clearance Pathway. To obtain 510(k) Clearance, we must submit a 510(k) premarket notification demonstrating that the proposed device is substantially equivalent to a device legally marketed in the United States. A predicate device is a legally marketed device that is not subject to premarket approval, i.e., a device that was legally marketed prior to May 28, 1976 (pre-amendments device) and for which a PMA is not required, a device that has been reclassified from Class III to Class II or I, or a device that was found substantially equivalent through the 510(k) Clearance process. To be “substantially equivalent,” the proposed device must have the same intended use as the predicate device, and either have the same technological characteristics as the predicate device or have different technological characteristics and not raise different questions of safety or effectiveness than the predicate device. Clinical data is sometimes required to support substantial equivalence.
 The FDA’s goal is to review and act on each 510(k) premarket notification within 90 days of submission, but the process usually takes from nine to twelve months, and it may take longer if the FDA requests additional information. Most 510(k) premarket clearances do not require supporting data from clinical trials, but the FDA may request such data. If the FDA agrees that the device is substantially equivalent, it will grant clearance to commercially market the device.
 After a device receives 510(k) Clearance, any modification that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a new or major change in its intended use, will require a new 510(k) Clearance or, depending on the modification, require premarket approval. The FDA requires each manufacturer to determine whether the proposed change requires the submission of a 510(k) premarket notification or PMA, but the FDA can review any such decision and can disagree with a manufacturer’s determination. If the FDA disagrees with a manufacturer’s determination, the FDA can require the manufacturer to cease marketing and/or recall the modified device until 510(k) Clearance or PMA is obtained. If the FDA requires us to seek a new 510(k) Clearance or PMA for any modifications to a previously cleared product, we may be required to cease marketing or recall the modified device until we obtain this clearance or approval. Also, in these circumstances, we may be subject to significant fines or penalties. We have made and plan to continue to make enhancements to our products for which we have not submitted 510(k)s premarket notifications or PMAs, and we will consider on a case-by-case basis whether a new 510(k) premarket notification or PMA is necessary.

The FDA began to consider proposals to reform its 510(k) Clearance process in 2011, and such proposals could include increased requirements for clinical data and a longer review period. Specifically, in response to industry and healthcare provider concerns regarding the predictability, consistency and rigor of the 510(k) regulatory pathway, the FDA initiated an evaluation of the 510(k) program, and as part of the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act (“FDASIA”), Congress reauthorized the Medical Device User Fee Amendments with various FDA performance goal commitments and enacted several “Medical Device Regulatory Improvements” and miscellaneous reforms, which are further intended to clarify and improve medical device regulation both pre- and post-clearance and approval. Further, in December 2016, the 21st Century Cures Act (“Cures Act”), was signed into law. The Cures Act, among other things, is intended to modernize the regulation of devices and spur innovation, but its ultimate implementation is unclear.
 Pervasive and Continuing FDA Regulation. After a device is placed on the market, numerous FDA and other regulatory requirements continue to apply. These include:
  
• | registration and listing requirements, which require manufacturers to register all manufacturing facilities and list all medical devices placed into commercial distribution;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the QSR, which requires manufacturers, including third-party contract manufacturers, to follow stringent design, testing, control, supplier/contractor selection, documentation, record maintenance and other quality assurance controls, during all aspects of the manufacturing process and to maintain and investigate complaints;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | labeling regulations and unique device identification requirements;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------


• | advertising and promotion requirements;
--+----------------------------------------


• | restrictions on sale, distribution or use of a device;
--+-------------------------------------------------------


• | FDA prohibitions against the promotion of products for uncleared or unapproved “off-label” uses;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | medical device reporting obligations, which require that manufacturers submit reports to the FDA of devices that may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if it were to reoccur;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | medical device correction and removal reporting regulations, which require that manufacturers report to the FDA field corrections and product recalls or removals if undertaken to reduce a risk to health posed by the device or to remedy a violation of the FDCA that may present a risk to health;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | device tracking requirements; and
--+----------------------------------


• | other post-market surveillance requirements, which apply when necessary to protect the public health or to provide additional safety and effectiveness data for the device.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can result in enforcement action by the FDA, which may include any of the following:
  
• | warning letters and untitled letters;
--+--------------------------------------


• | fines, injunctions, consent decrees, and civil penalties;
--+----------------------------------------------------------


• | recalls, withdrawals, administrative detention, or seizure of products;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | operating restrictions, partial suspension or total shutdown of production;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | withdrawals of 510(k) Clearances or PMA approvals that have already been granted;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | refusal to grant 510(k) Clearance or PMA approvals of new products; and/or
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | criminal prosecution.
--+----------------------

 Our facilities, records and manufacturing processes are subject to periodic announced and unannounced inspections by the FDA to evaluate compliance with applicable regulatory requirements. 
 Regulation of Human Cells, Tissues, and Cellular and Tissue-based Products. Certain of our products are regulated as human cells, tissues, and cellular and tissue-based products (“HCT/Ps”). Section 361 of the PHSA authorizes the FDA to issue regulations to prevent the introduction, transmission or spread of communicable disease. HCT/Ps regulated as “361” HCT/Ps are subject to requirements relating to registering facilities and listing products with the FDA, screening and testing for tissue donor eligibility, or Good Tissue Practice, when processing, storing, labeling, and distributing HCT/Ps, including required labeling information, stringent record keeping, and adverse event reporting, among other applicable requirements and laws. If the HCT/P is minimally manipulated, is intended for homologous use only and meets other requirements, the HCT/P will not require 510(k) Clearance, PMA approval, a Biologics license application, or other premarket authorization from the FDA before marketing.

Environmental Matters 
 Our facilities and operations are subject to extensive federal, state, and local environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations. These laws and regulations govern, among other things, air emissions; wastewater discharges; the generation, storage, handling, use and transportation of hazardous materials; the handling and disposal of hazardous wastes; the cleanup of contamination; and the health and safety of our employees. Under such laws and regulations, we are required to obtain permits from governmental authorities for some of our operations. If we violate or fail to comply with these laws, regulations or permits, we could be fined or otherwise sanctioned by regulators. We could also be held responsible for costs and damages arising from any contamination at our past or present facilities or at third-party waste disposal sites. We cannot completely eliminate the risk of contamination or injury resulting from hazardous materials, and we may incur material liability as a result of any contamination or injury.
Compliance with Certain Applicable Statutes
 We are subject to various federal and state laws pertaining to healthcare fraud and abuse, including anti-kickback laws, false claims laws, criminal health care fraud laws, physician payment transparency laws, data privacy and security laws and foreign corrupt practice laws. Violations of these laws are punishable by criminal and/or civil sanctions, including, in some instances, fines, imprisonment and, within the United States, exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs, including Medicare, Medicaid and Veterans Administration health programs. These laws are administered by, among others, the U.S. Department of Justice, the Office of Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services and state attorney generals. Many of these agencies have increased their enforcement activities with respect to medical device manufacturers in recent years.
 The federal Anti-Kickback Statute, prohibits persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in exchange for or to induce either the referral of an individual, or the furnishing, arranging for or recommending a good or service, for which payment may be made in whole or in part under federal healthcare programs, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. The Anti-Kickback Statute is broad and prohibits many arrangements and practices that are lawful in businesses outside of the healthcare industry. For example, the definition of “remuneration” has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value, including gifts, discounts, the furnishing of supplies or equipment, credit arrangements, payments of cash, waivers of payments, ownership interests and providing anything at less than its fair market value. In addition, the Patient Protection and Affordable Health Care Act, which, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act (collectively referred to as “ACA”). ACA, among other things, amends the intent requirement of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute. A person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it. In addition, ACA provides that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal False Claims Act.
 In implementing the Anti-Kickback Statute, the Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General (“OIG”), has issued a series of regulations, known as the safe harbors, which began in July 1991. These safe harbors set forth provisions that, in circumstances where all the applicable requirements are met, will assure healthcare providers and other parties that they will not be prosecuted under the Anti-Kickback Statute. The failure of a transaction or arrangement to fit precisely within one or more safe harbors does not necessarily mean that it is illegal or that prosecution will be pursued. However, conduct and business arrangements that do not fully satisfy all requirements of an applicable safe harbor may result in increased scrutiny by government enforcement authorities such as the OIG. Penalties for violations of the Anti-Kickback Statute include criminal penalties and civil sanctions such as fines, imprisonment and possible exclusion from Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs. Many states have anti- kickback laws that are similar to the federal law, some of which apply to the referral of patients for healthcare items or services reimbursed by any source, and may also result in penalties, fines, sanctions for violations, and exclusions from state or commercial programs.
 The federal False Claims Act prohibits persons from knowingly filing or causing to be filed a false or fraudulent claim to, or the knowing use of false statements to obtain payment from, the federal government. Private suits filed under the False Claims Act, known as qui tam actions, can be brought by individuals on behalf of the government. These individuals, sometimes known as “relators” or, more commonly, as “whistleblowers,” may share in any amounts paid by the entity to the government in fines or settlement. The number of filings of qui tam actions has increased significantly in recent years, causing more healthcare companies to have to defend a False Claim Act action. If an entity is determined to have violated the federal False Claims Act, it may be required to pay up to three times the actual damages sustained by the government, plus civil penalties of between $10,000 to $22,000 for each separate false claim and may be subject to exclusion from Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs. Various states have also enacted similar laws modeled after the federal False Claims Act which apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payor.
 The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (“HIPAA”) created two new federal crimes: healthcare fraud and false statements relating to healthcare matters. The healthcare fraud statute prohibits knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private payors. The ACA changed the intent requirement of the healthcare fraud statute to such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it. A violation of this statute is a felony and may result in fines, imprisonment or possible exclusion from Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs. The false statements statute prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. A violation of this statute is a felony and may result in similar sanctions.

ACA also includes various provisions designed to significantly strengthen fraud and abuse enforcement in addition to those changes discussed above. The Physician Payments Sunshine Provision of the Affordable Care Act (Section 6002) (the “Sunshine Act”), requires public disclosure to the U.S. government of payments to physicians and teaching hospitals, including in-kind transfers of value, such as gifts or meals. The Sunshine Act also provides penalties for non-compliance. The Sunshine Act requires that we file an annual report on March 31st of a calendar year for the transfers of value incurred for the prior calendar year. The Sunshine Act also require certain GPOs, including physician-owned distributors, to disclose physician ownership information to Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (“CMS”). In 2018, the Substance Use-Disorder Prevention that Promotes Opioid Recovery and Treatment for Patients and Communities Act (the “SUPPORT Act”) was signed into law. The SUPPORT Act expands the reporting obligation under the Sunshine Act to include payments and other transfers of value made to physician assistants, nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, certified registered nurse anesthetists, and certified nurse midwives. These expanded reporting obligations are effective for payments reported in 2022, with payment tracking beginning in 2021. Non-compliance with the Sunshine Act or SUPPORT Act is subject to civil monetary penalties. There are various state laws and initiatives that require device manufacturers to disclose to the appropriate regulatory agency certain payments or other transfers of value made to physicians, and in certain cases prohibit some forms of these payments, with the risk of fines for any violation of such requirements.
 HIPAA also includes privacy and security provisions designed to regulate the use and disclosure of “protected health information”, (“PHI”), which is health information that identifies a patient and that is held by a health care provider, a health plan or health care clearinghouse. We are not directly regulated by HIPAA, but our ability to access PHI for purposes such as marketing, product development, clinical research or other uses is controlled by HIPAA and restrictions placed on health care providers and other covered entities. HIPAA was amended in 2009 by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (“HITECH”), which strengthened the rule, increased penalties for violations and added a requirement for the disclosure of breaches to affected individuals, the government and in some cases the media. We must carefully structure any transaction involving PHI to avoid violation of HIPAA and HITECH requirements.
 Almost all states have adopted data security laws protecting personal information including social security numbers, state issued identification numbers, credit card or financial account information coupled with individuals’ names or initials. We must comply with all applicable state data security laws, even though they vary extensively, and must ensure that any breaches or accidental disclosures of personal information are promptly reported to affected individuals and responsible government entities. We must also ensure that we maintain compliant, written information security programs or run the risk of civil or even criminal sanctions for non-compliance as well as reputational harm for publicly reported breaches or violations.
 If any of our operations are found to have violated or be in violation of any of the laws described above and other applicable state and federal fraud and abuse laws, we may be subject to penalties, among them being civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, exclusion from government healthcare programs, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations.
 Third-Party Reimbursement
 In the United States, healthcare providers generally rely on third-party payors, principally private insurers and governmental payors such as Medicare and Medicaid, to cover and pay for all or part of the cost of a surgery in which our medical devices are used. We expect that sales volumes and prices of our products will depend in large part on the continued availability of reimbursement from such third-party payors. These third-party payors may deny reimbursement if they determine that a device used in a procedure was not medically necessary in accordance with cost-effective treatment methods, as determined by the third-party payor, or was used for an unapproved indication. Particularly in the United States, third-party payors continue to carefully review, and increasingly challenge, the prices charged for procedures and medical products. Medicare coverage and reimbursement policies are developed by CMS, the federal agency responsible for administering the Medicare program, and its contractors. CMS establishes these Medicare policies for medical products and procedures and such policies are periodically reviewed and updated. While private payors vary in their coverage and payment policies, the Medicare program is viewed as a benchmark. Medicare payment rates for the same or similar procedures vary due to geographic location, nature of the facility in which the procedure is performed (i.e., teaching or community hospital) and other factors. We cannot assure you that government or private third-party payors will cover and provide adequate payment for the procedures in which our products are used. ACA and other reform proposals contain significant changes regarding Medicare, Medicaid and other third-party payors.
 Elements of the ACA include numerous provisions to limit Medicare spending through reductions in various fee schedule payments and by instituting more sweeping payment reforms, such as bundled payments for episodes of care, the establishment of “accountable care organizations” under which hospitals and physicians will be able to share savings that result from cost control efforts, comparative effectiveness research, value-based purchasing, and the establishment of an independent payment advisory board.
 We believe that the overall escalating cost of medical products and services has led to, and will continue to lead to, increased pressures on the healthcare industry to reduce the costs of products and services. We cannot assure you that government or private third-party payors will cover and provide adequate payment for the procedures using our products. In addition, it is possible that future legislation, regulation, or reimbursement policies of third-party payors will adversely affect the demand for procedures using our products or our ability to sell our products on a profitable basis. The unavailability or inadequacy of third-party payor coverage or reimbursement could have a significant adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.
