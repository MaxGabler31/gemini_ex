Company Overview
Incorporated in Delaware in 1996, Commvault Systems, Inc. is a global data management company offering customers enterprise level, intelligent data services via a single platform and unified code base. 
We believe in solving hard problems for our customers by enabling our customers to accelerate their digital transformation in today's ever-evolving workforce. Our product portfolio includes intuitive tools and powerful machine learning technology that drives automation, reduces complexity, reigns in data fragmentation, and accelerates a customer’s cloud journey. Our product functionality share the same back-end technologies to deliver the benefits of a holistic approach to protecting, managing, and securing data. Our products address many aspects of data management, from data protection and security, to data governance, transformation and insights, while providing scalability. We believe our technology and professional services provide the broadest set of capabilities in the industry, which enables customers to efficiently and cost-effectively scale their data on premise or in the cloud. 
Products
Commvault provides a portfolio of intelligent data management solutions that help organizations securely manage their data without increasing costs or complexity. We call the seamless integration of our products the ‘Power of AND’, which creates an intuitive data management experience across customer-managed enterprise software AND SaaS-delivered cloud native solutions that mitigates data sprawl, facilitates cloud adoption, and meets customers wherever they are on their journey to modernize and transform their enterprise IT environment. These offerings are organized into three categories - (1) Data Protection, (2) Data Insights and (3) Data Storage. 
All of Commvault's products are managed seamlessly through a single pane of glass called the Commvault Command Center, which is our user interface for managing data protection and disaster recovery by providing configuration values and streamlined procedures for data protection and recovery tasks. Customers use the Command Center to establish their data protection environment, identify content to be protected, and initiate and monitor backups and restores. The main navigation pane provides customers with easy access to various components including downloads, forms, analytics, and monitoring. The Command Center provides a controlled foundation for self-service, helping to reduce the load on administrators and IT support staff. 
Data Protection
Commvault Backup and Recovery (“CBR”) is designed to meet the needs of any size business covering workloads across all locations: hybrid environments including on-premise and multiple cloud providers; physical servers; virtual machines; applications and databases; endpoint devices; cloud applications and more. CBR provides backup, verifiable recovery and cost-optimized cloud workload mobility, helping to ensure data availability, even across multiple clouds. Our simplified backup and recovery solution allows customers to manage all workloads – cloud, virtual machines ("VMs"), containers, applications, databases and endpoints – from the Command Center while flexible copy data management allows users to multi-purpose backed-up data for DevOps, replication and more, across an entire infrastructure.
Commvault Disaster Recovery (“CDR”) provides an easy-to-use replication and disaster recovery solution from a single extensible platform, all managed through the Command Center. Commvault’s standalone disaster recovery solution is both easy to implement and cost-effective. It provides orchestration and automated compliance reporting, flexible replication, cost-optimized cloud data mobility, and verifiable recoverability via copy data management.
Commvault Complete Data Protection is a comprehensive, easy-to-use data protection solution that combines CBR with CDR. It delivers backup, replication, and disaster recovery for all workloads, on-premises, in the cloud, across multiple clouds, and in hybrid environments. It provides trusted recovery of data and applications, virtual machines, and containers, along with verifiable recoverability of replicas, cost-optimized cloud data mobility, security and resilient ransomware protection, and flexible copy data management to leverage protected data for DevOps, testing, and analytics.
Data Insights
Commvault's Data Insights portfolio is an integrated family of solutions for actionable insights, combining Commvault Data Governance, Commvault File Storage Optimization, and Commvault eDiscovery and Compliance. These solutions can operate independent of Commvault Complete Data Protection or as part of a combined solution to maximize data management capabilities for any business. This means that customers can gain insights to data that isn’t managed by Commvault to drive analytics and other tasks.
Data Backup
Hyperscale X
Commvault HyperScale X is an intuitive and easy-to-deploy, scale-out solution that is fully integrated with Commvault’s intelligent data management platform to help enterprises transition from legacy scale-up infrastructures. It provides scalability, security and resiliency to accelerate an organization’s digital transformation journey as they move to hybrid cloud, container and virtualized environments. Its flexible architecture allows customers to get up and run quickly and scale. HyperScale X technology accelerates hybrid cloud adoption with an integrated solution that delivers comprehensive data management for all workloads, including containers, VMs and databases, from a single, extensible platform. With HyperScale X, customers can leverage the entire Commvault portfolio giving them access to all the features, functions, and industry leading integration with applications, databases, public cloud environments, hypervisors, operating systems, NAS systems and primary storage arrays, wherever the data resides. It is available in two form factors giving customers the flexibility to choose an implementation based on specific needs and preferences:
•Commvault HyperScale X Appliance: A fully integrated appliance that streamlines operations and infrastructure and is ideally suited for smaller deployments with capacity requirements less than 150 terabytes that want the simplicity of an all-in-one integrated appliance from a single vendor.
•Commvault HyperScale X Architecture: Our pre-validated designs for popular server platforms provides greater flexibility and allows customer to leverage existing vendor relationships and is ideally suited for larger environments that require greater scale.
Commvault Distributed Storage
Commvault Distributed Storage provides software-defined storage built on HyperScale architecture that uses modern distributed system techniques to meet our customers primary, secondary and cloud data needs. With the capability to be deployed on any operating system, hypervisor, container or cloud, this unique platform also has the versatility to deploy in hyperscale or hyperconverged mode. Commvault Distributed Storage stores, protects and replicates data across any number of private and public cloud data centers and is integrated into our Hyperscale X technology. The advanced software stack of Commvault Distributed Storage simplifies all aspects of storage with a full set of enterprise data capabilities that can be provisioned at the application level and automated.

Customers
Our current customer base spans thousands of organizations across a variety of sizes, including large global enterprise companies, and small or mid-sized businesses and government agencies. We support customers in a range of industries, including banking, insurance and financial services, government, healthcare, pharmaceuticals and medical services, technology, legal, manufacturing, utilities and energy. 
Strategic Relationships
An important element of Commvault’s strategy is to establish partnerships that support development, marketing, selling and implementation of our technology solutions. We believe that strategic and technology-based relationships with industry leaders are fundamental to our success. We have forged numerous relationships with software application, hardware and cloud vendors to enhance our combined capabilities and to create the optimal combination of data and information management applications. We believe this approach enhances our ability to expand our product offerings and customer base and to enter new markets. We have established the following types of strategic relationships:
Alliance and Technology Partners.    We maintain strategic product and technology relationships with major industry leaders to ensure that our products are integrated with, supported by and add value to our partners’ portfolios. Collaboration with these market leaders allows us to provide applications that enable our customers to improve data and information management efficiency. We also maintain relationships with a broad range of industry operating system, application and infrastructure vendors to verify and demonstrate the interoperability of our portfolio with their equipment and technologies.
Distributors, Value-Added Reseller, Systems Integrator, Corporate Reseller and Original Equipment Manufacturer Relationships.  Our corporate resellers bundle or sell our solutions together with their own products, and our value-added resellers resell our solutions independently. 
In order to broaden our market coverage, we work closely with our global original equipment manufacturer ("OEM") partners, investing significant time and resources to deliver unique, joint solutions incorporating Commvault solutions. These partners team with our technical, engineering, marketing and sales force to enhance integration, tuning, operational management, implementation and vision for solutions that are designed to meet current and future data management needs. Our alliance managers work directly with global OEM partners to design, deliver and support field activities that make it easier for customers to locate, learn about, and purchase these differentiated solutions. 
Additionally, we have a non-exclusive distribution agreement covering our North American commercial markets and our U.S. Federal Government markets with Arrow Enterprise Computing Solutions, Inc. ("Arrow"), a subsidiary of Arrow Electronics, Inc. Arrow's primary role is to enable a more efficient and effective distribution channel for our products and services by managing our reseller partners and leveraging their own industry experience. Sales generated through our distribution agreement with Arrow accounted for 37% of our total revenue in fiscal 2022 and 36% of our total revenue in fiscal 2021.
Service Provider Partners. Our solutions are the data protection platform for many service providers, which provide cloud-based solutions to customers worldwide. As companies of all sizes and markets rapidly adopt cloud infrastructures for cost efficiencies, speed and agility, we remain committed to these strategic relationships to address this growing trend.  Customers looking to move IT operations to the cloud depend on service providers to migrate, manage and protect their data and cloud infrastructures. We partner with a broad ecosystem of managed service providers and cloud partners to effectively deliver data management-as-a-service solutions based on Commvault solutions across geographies, vertical markets and offerings. 
Competition
The data storage management market is intensely competitive, highly fragmented and characterized by either legacy technology or rapidly changing technology and evolving standards. The principal competitive factors in our industry include product functionality, performance, integration, platform coverage, scalability, price, global sales infrastructure, technical support, branding and reputation. The ability of major system vendors to bundle solutions is also a significant competitive factor in our industry.
Our primary competitors in the data and information management software applications market, each of which has one or more products that compete with a part of or our entire product suite, are Dell-EMC, IBM, Veritas, Veeam, Rubrik, Cohesity, Druva, Avepoint and Datto. 
Some of our competitors have greater financial resources and may have the ability to offer their products at lower prices than ours. In addition, some have greater name recognition, longer operating histories, substantially larger technical, sales, marketing and other global resources, and larger installed customer base with broader product offerings. As a result, these competitors can devote greater resources to the development, promotion, sale and support of their products than we can. Refer to our "Risk Factors" below.
Sales and Marketing
We sell our data management solutions to businesses of all sizes, and government agencies. We sell through our global direct sales force and partner channels. 
We have a variety of marketing programs designed to create brand awareness and market recognition for our product offerings and sales lead generation. Our marketing efforts include sales campaigns, webinars, active participation at trade shows, technical conferences and seminars; advertising; content development and distribution; public relations; social media; industry analyst relations; publication of technical and educational articles in industry journals; sales training; and preparation of competitive analyses. In addition, our strategic partners augment our marketing and sales campaigns through seminars, trade shows, joint public relations and advertising campaigns. Our customers and strategic partners provide references and recommendations that we often feature in external marketing activities.
Research and Development
Our research and development organization is responsible for the design, development, testing and certification of our data management solutions. Our engineering efforts support product development across all major operating systems, databases, applications and network storage devices. A substantial amount of our development effort goes into certification, integration and support of our solutions to ensure interoperability with our strategic partners’ solutions. We have also made substantial investments in the automation of our product test and quality assurance laboratories.
Technology, Intellectual Property and Proprietary Rights
We believe our solutions are a major differentiator versus our competitors’ portfolios. Our solutions’ unique indexing, cataloging, data movement, media management and policy technologies are the source of the performance, scale, management, cost of ownership benefits and seamless interoperability inherent in all of our data management solutions. Additional options enable content search, data encryption and auditing features to support data discovery and compliance. Our success and ability to compete depend on our continued development and protection of our solutions. We rely primarily on a combination of trade secret, patent, copyright and trademark laws, as well as contractual provisions, to establish and protect our intellectual property rights. 
We patent our technical infrastructure and key usability and design concepts. Our software’s unique capabilities are covered by a robust portfolio of over 1,000 patents worldwide. Areas such as data protection, security, transformation, insights, and compliance and governance, including our Metallic SaaS and HyperScale X solutions, are core to our competitive advantage. During fiscal year 2022, we were awarded over 120 patents. As of March 31, 2022, we had 968 issued patents and 381 pending patent applications in the United States, as well as 135 issued patents in foreign countries and 12 pending foreign patent applications. We also have established proprietary trademark rights in markets across the globe, and Commvault owns hundreds of U.S. and foreign trademark registrations and pending registration applications. Refer to our “Risk Factors” below.
Government Regulations
The legal environment of technology businesses, both in the United States and internationally, is evolving rapidly and is often unclear. These topics include data privacy and security, pricing, advertising, taxation, content regulation and intellectual property ownership and infringement. 
We are subject to several local, state, federal and foreign laws and regulations regarding privacy and data protection. Regulators around the world have adopted or proposed limitations on, or requirements regarding, the collection, distribution, use, security and storage of personal information, payment card information or other confidential information of individuals, and the FTC and many state attorneys general are applying federal and state consumer protection laws to impose standards on the online collection, use and dissemination of data. In the event of a security breach, these laws may subject us to incident response, notice and remediation costs. Failure to safeguard data adequately or to destroy data securely could subject us to regulatory investigations or enforcement actions under applicable data security, unfair practices or consumer protection laws. The scope and interpretation of these laws could change and the associated burdens and our compliance costs could increase in the future. 
We are also subject to U.S. and foreign laws and regulations that govern or restrict our business and activities in certain countries and with certain persons, including the U.S. Commerce Department’s Export Administration Regulations and economic and trade sanctions regulations maintained by OFAC, as well as anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws and regulations, including the FCPA and the U.K. Bribery Act. 
People
Commvault aims to unlock potential in data, customers and our employees. To accomplish that, our employees are empowered to drive innovation and help our customers—by inspiring one another and working to make what’s already great, even greater—whether that’s product, process or team. As of March 31, 2022, we had 2,848 employees worldwide, including 1,041 in sales and marketing, 763 in research and development, 669 in customer services and support and 375 in general and administration. Approximately 45% were in the United States and 55% were located internationally.
Inclusion and Diversity
At Commvault, we believe that diversity is a business imperative at the heart of our human capital management strategy. In partnership with our leadership team, we not only drive the ability to be a best-in-class data management organization but also uphold our value in the marketplace by leading as an employer of choice. Our commitment is driven and executed by a three-pronged approach to Inclusion and Diversity ("I&D"): Workplace Inclusion, Workforce Diversity and Personal Accountability. 
We continue to elevate our employee engagement efforts – which is the foundation of our approach. We have implemented an Employee Resource Group (“ERG”) operating model and have established four ERGs for cross-cultural learning, mentoring and relationship building across employees: 
1.CV WIT (Women in Technology), 
2.Multi-Culture, 
3.LGBTQ+ & Allies, and 
4.VALOR (Veterans) 
In addition to our continued employee engagement initiatives, we launched a Courageous Conversations platform. Courageous Conversations was designed as a forum where difficult conversations can be broached in an open, safe and respectful manner. This platform has become the hub for all I&D related conversations, where employees and senior leaders share courageous life experiences related to bias and social injustice. Since its inception, we have hosted several powerful sessions, each virtually, reaching our workforce around the globe.
We continue to be committed to securing the very best talent, with a concerted effort to expound on and build an inclusive and diverse pipeline of candidates. We are committed to providing a clear vision to career progression while investing in the development, creativity and aspirational needs of all employees.
Safety and Well-being
Commvault values its people. We are focused on driving business globally while honoring and caring for the health and safety of our employees, customers, and partners. Since 2020, the vast majority of our employees shifted to a remote working environment and have been delivering successful and proactive results ever since. We continue to monitor the COVID-19 pandemic and are adhering to guidelines set forth by the World Health Organization and Centers for Disease Control as we begin to reopen offices. We are committed to creating an environment that supports our employees’ health and overall well-being, focusing on physical, emotional, financial, and personal wellness.
