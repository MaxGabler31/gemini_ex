Item 1. Business
The Merger Agreement
 On February 11, 2019, the Company, Edwards Lifesciences Holding, Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Edwards Lifesciences Corporation ("Edwards" or the "Acquiror") and Crown Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Acquiror ("Merger Sub"), entered into an Agreement and Plan of  Merger (the "Merger Agreement") pursuant to which, subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth therein, Merger Sub will merge with and into the Company (the "Merger"), with the Company continuing as the surviving company and a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Acquiror.  The Board of Directors of the Company has unanimously approved the Merger Agreement, the Merger, and the other transactions contemplated thereby.
 
On the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, at the effective time of the Merger (the "Effective Time") and as a result of the Merger, each share of Company common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than shares of Company common stock owned by the Company as treasury stock or owned directly by the Acquiror or any of its subsidiaries (including Merger Sub) or shares of Company common stock the holders of which have properly perfected their appraisal rights under Delaware law) will be converted into the right to receive $2.45 per share in cash (the "Merger Consideration") without interest or dividends thereon.
 
The Merger Agreement also provides that, as a condition to the Acquiror's obligation to effect the Merger, each holder of Company Series A Convertible Preferred Stock and Series A Exchangeable Preferred Stock outstanding, immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall consent to the conversion of such stock into Company common stock.  Subject to such conversion, at the Effective Time, the holders of such preferred stock will be entitled to receive the Merger Consideration as holders of the Company's common stock.

The parties' obligations to consummate the Merger, which is expected to close during the second quarter of 2019, are subject to stockholder approval and certain additional customary closing conditions, including, among other things, (i) the accuracy of the other party's representations and warranties contained in the Merger Agreement (subject to certain materiality or material adverse effect qualifiers, as described in the Merger Agreement) and the other party's compliance with its covenants and agreements contained in the Merger Agreement in all material respects; (ii) the expiration or termination of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, and the receipt of other required antitrust approvals; and (iii) no law having been enacted after the date of the Merger Agreement that prohibits the Merger and no order having been issued after the date of the Merger Agreement preventing the consummation of the Merger. The obligations of the Acquiror and Merger Sub to consummate the Merger are further subject to the following conditions: (i) no pending proceeding brought by a governmental entity in a U.S. federal district court seeking to restrain, prohibit, challenge, or otherwise materially limit the parties' or their subsidiaries' ability to consummate the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement; and (ii) the absence of any effect, change, development, event, circumstance, occurrence, condition, fact, or state of facts that has had or would reasonably be expected to have a "company material adverse effect" (as defined in the Merger Agreement) with respect to the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole.  The closing of the Merger is not subject to a financing condition.
 
The Merger Agreement contains certain termination rights for the Company and the Acquiror, including the right of the Company to terminate the Merger Agreement to accept a "company superior proposal" (as defined the Merger Agreement) after complying with certain requirements.  In addition, either party may terminate the Merger Agreement if the Merger is not consummated on or before November 8, 2019.  The Merger Agreement further provides that the Company may be required to pay the Acquiror a termination fee of $3.5 million under certain specified circumstances, including if the Acquiror terminates the Merger Agreement due to a change in the recommendation by the Company's Board of Directors for the Merger or due to the Company's material breach of its non-solicitation obligations set forth in the Merger Agreement.  The Merger Agreement also provides that in case it is terminated by either the Acquiror or the Company following a failure to obtain the required vote of the Company's stockholders to adopt the Merger Agreement, the Company shall reimburse the Acquiror up to $1.0 million of certain of its transaction expenses, which payment, if any, will reduce on a dollar-for-dollar basis any termination fee otherwise owed to the Acquiror.
 
The foregoing description of the Merger Agreement is not complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Merger Agreement, which is attached as Exhibit 2.1 to the Company's Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on February 12, 2019.

Our Business
 
We are a medical technology company that develops, manufactures, and markets non-invasive cerebral and tissue oximeters used in patient monitoring that are consistent with our Vision:
 
"That no patient is harmed by undetected tissue hypoxia."
 
Our principal products are the FORE-SIGHT® and FORE-SIGHT ELITE® brand tissue oximeters and sensors.  With a simple non-invasive adhesive sensor applied to the skin, these products alert clinicians to the oxygenation levels of a patient's brain or other body tissue under the sensor during medical procedures to avoid harm caused by insufficient oxygen, otherwise known as hypoxia.  The FORE-SIGHT product line represented nearly all of our 2018 sales from continuing operations.  We also sell a small volume of service repairs for legacy products.
 
We believe our FORE-SIGHT tissue oximetry products are best-in-class and place CASMED in a unique position both to gain accounts from competitors and expand the clinical application for monitoring tissue oxygenation. Standard non-invasive parameters, such as pulse oximetry and blood pressure, provide only surrogate markers of tissue oxygen delivery.  The indirect or systemic nature of these parameters forces clinicians to infer the adequacy of oxygenation in vital organs, including the brain, during medical procedures.  However, data convincingly show that clinician inferences of cerebral oxygenation during medical procedures often do not correlate with actual tissue oxygenation levels. Therefore, potentially dangerously low levels of cerebral oxygenation often go unrecognized, correlating to high levels of patient harm.  However, direct monitoring of cerebral and tissue oxygenation with FORE-SIGHT oximeters provides a unique and powerful tool that empowers clinicians to recognize and treat potentially dangerous tissue hypoxia to avoid adverse clinical outcomes.
 

 - 5 -
 
We believe the FORE-SIGHT tissue oximeter provides clinicians the most accurate and reliable readings and is well-positioned to compete in an expanding market.
 
Our products are typically sold to hospitals. Clinician users include anesthesiologists, perfusionists, and surgeons in an operating room, and intensivists and nurses in intensive care units.
 
Strategy Execution
 
CASMED has completed significant product line divestitures in recent years and has successfully executed its multi-year strategic goal of solely focusing on the market opportunity for FORE-SIGHT oximetry.  With the divestiture of its last two non-FORE-SIGHT legacy product lines completed in 2017, the Company's transformation from a low-margin, commodity, capital medical equipment business into a high-growth, high-margin business is complete, with disposable sensor sales representing 88% of 2018 sales from continuing operations.
 
Our 2018 achievements include the following:
 
 
· | Worldwide FORE-SIGHT sales rebounded in 2018, increasing 18% over 2017.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Worldwide sensor revenue growth accelerated to greater than 20% in the third and fourth quarters, with full-year growth of 18%.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | We shipped a net of 363 FORE-SIGHT ELITE monitors worldwide in 2018, including 203 net monitors in the U.S., raising the U.S. adjusted installed base to 1,458 FORE-SIGHT ELITE monitors, an increase of 17% over the adjusted installed base at December 31, 2017.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | The five-year FORE-SIGHT sales compound average growth rate was 19% at the end of 2018 for overall sales and 20% for U.S. sales.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | We completed a multi-year effort to redesign our FORE-SIGHT ELITE disposable sensors for manufactur-ability, realizing substantial cost reductions beginning in the second quarter of 2018.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | We received FDA 510(k) clearance for our FORE-SIGHT OEM Oximetry Module. The OEM module permits the use of FORE-SIGHT oximetry without a standalone FORE-SIGHT monitor. The design allows tissue oximetry values to be displayed on a third-party monitor with minimal user-interface modifications. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



Description of Products and Services
 The Company reports two categories of sales within one reportable business unit:
  
· | Tissue Oximetry Monitoring – includes sales of the Company's FORE-SIGHT tissue oximeter monitors, sensors, and accessories.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Service and Other – includes sales of service parts and repairs and other miscellaneous sales.

Tissue Oximetry Monitoring
 
CASMED's FORE-SIGHT tissue oximeter technology provides clinicians with a simple, non-invasive, quantitative measurement of oxygenation of cerebral tissue typically during surgery or critical care situations.  The percentage saturation of cerebral hemoglobin with oxygen is obtained by placing a sensor on the skin on both the right and the left side of the patient's forehead. The FORE-SIGHT ELITE sensors emit five different wavelengths of infrared light that harmlessly penetrate into the cerebral tissue and are partially reflected back to photo-detectors in the same sensor.  An exclusive algorithm then determines the percentage of hemoglobin that is saturated with oxygen in the blood of the brain tissue underlying each sensor. Through these proprietary and patented processes, FORE-SIGHT provides clinicians with an accurate, absolute numerical measure of tissue oxygenation.
 
In addition to cerebral monitoring, FORE-SIGHT can also be used to monitor the oxygenation of other tissues such as muscle tissues of adults and the abdominal tissues in newborns even weighing less than four kilograms.
 

 - 6 -
 
By non-invasively and continuously measuring absolute cerebral and tissue oxygen levels, our FORE-SIGHT tissue oximeter enables clinicians to identify and quickly react to dangerously low brain oxygen levels and empowers them to provide better care.
 
We believe that FORE-SIGHT incorporates a combination of features that permit obtained oxygenation values to be more accurate and, therefore, more actionable by clinicians in critical care environments.  Special design features include the following:
 
 
· | CASMED's FORE-SIGHT ELITE sensors emit five wavelengths of light, permitting an increased level of signal acquisition, thus providing sufficient data to solve for other optical variables in the tissue sample, such as melanin in the skin, which would otherwise confound a tissue oximetry reading.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | CASMED's FORE-SIGHT sensors for adults are designed with a preferred geometry, maximizing the distance between the light source and the farthest photo-detector, thereby providing a light pathway that penetrates deeper into the tissue, giving a greater tissue sample for interrogation.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | CASMED'S FORE-SIGHT sensors also are maximized for children and come in different configurations with each being tailored precisely to the size of the patient to maximize accuracy and ease of use, all with the preservation of skin integrity in mind.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | CASMED's FORE-SIGHT patented and proprietary algorithm utilizes a combination of methods including a unique on-patient calibration to sort out optical signals created by non-critical background tissue that otherwise can confound measurement of oxygenated hemoglobin levels.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | CASMED's FORE-SIGHT algorithms are specifically designed for different body locations given that we believe clinicians' expected levels of accuracy cannot be met with the same algorithm for such materially different physiologies as, for example, that of an adult forehead and that of a newborn's flank.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



We believe our FORE-SIGHT oximeter helps clinicians solve a serious deficit in the care of many critical care patients.  Unrecognized and dangerous desaturation events occur with much greater frequency than previously known and can only be properly identified with the direct measurement that tissue oximeters provide.  Given this evidence, we believe our best-in-class FORE-SIGHT technology continues to gain clinical adoption in new and existing accounts and is well-positioned in the market for future growth.
 
During 2018, a net total of 363 monitors were shipped worldwide. As of December 31, 2018, the adjusted installed base of U.S. monitors was 1,458 monitors, up 17% from the adjusted installed base at December 31, 2017. The adjusted installed base includes only FORE-SIGHT ELITE monitors and excludes first-generation devices which are no longer in use by U.S. customers. The quantity of "net units shipped" that we report each fiscal quarter adds to this cumulative total and reflects the number of monitors shipped to customers less returns.  The cumulative total reported installed base is not affected by exchanges or monitor upgrades.
 
The Need for Tissue Oxygenation Monitoring
 
Oxygen is necessary to keep cells viable.  The brain has a very high metabolic rate, consuming approximately 20% of the body's oxygen at rest.  The brain, of course, through cognitive function and memory, defines who we are.  It is also the organ that is least resistant to oxygen deprivation. Lack of sufficient oxygenation in the brain can cause neurologic injury such as cognitive impairment, stroke, paralysis, coma, and/or hypoxic encephalopathy.  These injuries can result in severe morbidity or even death. Dangerous deficits in brain hemoglobin saturation (reflecting decreased brain oxygen levels) are termed "desaturation events" because the hemoglobin of the blood is no longer sufficiently "saturated" with oxygen molecules.  Desaturations can be caused by many factors.  The brain responds to insufficient levels of oxygen by increasing ventilation, cardiac output, and blood pressure in order to increase oxygen delivery.  It also vasodilates to increase brain blood flow.  These biologic processes of optimizing oxygen delivery vs. demand can be compromised by illness, surgical intervention, trauma, and anesthesia; and neonates and children have immature auto-regulation capabilities.
 
 - 7 -
 
Most conventional monitoring is ultimately employed to assure an adequate balance between oxygen supply and demand.  Standard parameters, such as pulse oximetry, heart rate and blood pressure determinations, capnometry, and cardiac output assessment, each provide only indirect predictions of cerebral oxygenation.  From that information, a clinician can only infer that a patient's brain inadequately oxygenated.  Data from cerebral oximetry convincingly shows that the estimations clinicians make about cerebral oxygenation based solely on these indirect measures are frequently wrong and that threatening cerebral desaturation events occur without recognition.   Thus, in many acute care settings, such as surgery, intensive care, and other critical care environments, patients are exposed to potentially damaging cerebral hypoxia that might be prevented if recognized.
 
Data in support of this clinical proposition is substantial.  FORE-SIGHT and FORE-SIGHT ELITE have been well validated with FDA-compliant methods.  FORE-SIGHT also has proven to have high levels of accuracy even when compared to competitive technologies.  The incidence rate of cerebral desaturation events (CDE's) is very high and is prevalent in many common surgeries as indicated in the sampling of studies cited in the following table.

43% | Thoracic Surgery | Roberts, et.al. Cerebral Oximetry and Recovery in Thoracic Surgery Presented at American Society of Anesthesiologists Annual Meeting 2013 #A2030. 

 
The harm associated with these cerebral desaturations is well documented. Low levels of cerebral oxygen saturation correlate to poorer outcomes such as:  post-operative nausea; cognitive impairment including memory loss; longer lengths of stay; stroke; and even death. Yet, very simple interventions are available to clinicians to successfully reverse these low levels of oxygen.  Standard interventions include eliminating mechanical blockage, increasing inspired oxygen levels, increasing blood flow or blood pressures, or transfusing units of blood.
 
This solid and growing body of clinical evidence substantiates the premise that measuring cerebral oximetry offers valuable insight to clinicians during the management of critical care patients which could permit them to increase safety, improve clinical outcomes, and reduce costs.
 
The Market for Tissue Oximetry
 
Cerebral desaturation events occur with much greater frequency than previously believed.  The large and growing body of published literature in support of cerebral oximetry provides a solid academic and data-driven support for 
 

 - 8 -
 
the expanded use of the product in a variety of critical care settings including: heart surgery; lung surgery; major vascular surgery; neurosurgery; surgeries that provide a risk of large blood loss, such as orthopedic hip and spine; surgeries on elderly patients or those with compromised vascular systems or other co-morbidities; surgeries with non-supine patient positioning, such as orthopedic "beach chair" shoulder surgery and bariatric surgery; trauma care; cardiac arrest; and intensive care patient management in adult, pediatric, and neonatal wards, among others. Therefore, in the U.S. alone, cerebral monitoring could prove valuable for millions of patients each year.
 
While we believe the eventual addressable market for tissue oximetry exceeds $800 million, we estimate current total worldwide annual sales of tissue oximetry to be approximately $125 million.  Given the broad potential applicability of this parameter and the small current rate of market penetration, we also believe that market rates of growth can accelerate, particularly as the use of oximetry moves toward becoming a standard of care.
 
The literature in support of tissue oximetry, in general, and FORE-SIGHT oximetry, in particular, will play an increasingly important role in the expansion of the tissue oximetry market as clinicians continue to be educated regarding the potential benefits of this parameter.  Consequently, a significant part of our longer-term strategy is to continue to encourage and support research related to the need for cerebral oximetry and its efficacy in improving care.  FORE-SIGHT has already been referenced in hundreds of papers, abstracts, and posters, and the literature in support of the product grows every year.

Government Regulation
 
Medical products of the type currently being marketed and under development by the Company are subject to regulation under the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (the "FD&C Act") and numerous acts and amendments such as the Quality System Regulations ("QSR").
 
In addition, depending upon product type, the Company must also comply with those regulations governing the Conduct of Human Investigations, Pre‑Market Notification Regulations, and other requirements, as promulgated by the FDA.  The FDA is authorized to inspect a device, its labeling and advertising, and the facilities in which it is manufactured, in order to ensure that the device is not manufactured or labeled in a manner which could cause it to be in violation of the FD&C Act.
 
The FDA has adopted regulations which classify medical devices based upon the degree of regulation believed necessary to assure safety and efficacy.  A device is classified as a Class I, II, or III device.  Class I devices are subject only to general controls.  Class II devices, in addition to general controls, are or will be subject to "performance standards."  Most devices are also subject to the 510(k) pre‑market notification provision.  In addition, some Class III devices require FDA pre‑market studies before they may be marketed commercially because their safety and effectiveness cannot be assured by the general controls and performance standards of Class I or II devices.
 
The Company's products are Class II devices, and most require FDA clearance under Section 510(k) of the FD&C Act.
 
The last factory inspection of the Company by the FDA occurred during April 2016.  The inspection resulted in an FDA-483 Inspection Observation Report which listed various non-conformities.  The Company provided a written response to those observations.  The FDA, satisfied with the Company's response and the related actions taken, closed the inspection on June 2, 2016.
 
International Regulatory Compliance
 
CASMED maintains certification to ISO 13485:2016 by the Notified Body, BSI Inc., for its manufacturing facility. These certifications and compliance with the Medical Device Directive allow CASMED to use the "CE" mark on its products.  The CE mark is required for medical devices to gain access to the European Union ("EU") common market and other non-EU markets as well.  The FDA, recognizing the value of this universally-accepted quality system, has patterned its Quality System Regulations after ISO 9001 and ISO 13485. CASMED believes it maintains full compliance with ISO 13485:2016 and the EU's Medical Device Directive, as evaluated by annual assessment.
Manufacturing and Quality Assurance
 
The Company assembles, tests, packages, or ships its products from its facility in Branford, Connecticut.  The various finished goods or components for the products, which include plastic moldings, wire, printed circuit boards, sub-assemblies, and many other parts, are obtained from outside vendors, some of which are outside of the United States.  The Company has not experienced any sustained interruption in production or the supply of components and does not anticipate any difficulties in obtaining the components necessary to manufacture its products.
 
Quality assurance procedures are performed by the Company at its Branford, Connecticut, facility and at its suppliers' facilities to standards set forth in the FDA's "Quality System Regulations".  These procedures include the initial qualification of the supplier, inspection of components, and testing of finished goods.
 
Customers
 
Our five largest customers accounted for approximately 16% and 14% of sales from continuing operations in 2018 and 2017, respectively.  Each of these customers accounted for less than 10% of sales from continuing operations.
 

 - 11 -
 
Backlog
 
The Company's backlog generally includes orders for products shippable on a current basis.  The majority of the Company orders are shipped within several days of customer purchase order acceptance. Total backlog, therefore, is not a meaningful indicator of the Company's future sales.
