ITEM 1. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS 
History
 
China Grand Resorts, Inc. (“we,” “us,” “our” or the “Company”) was incorporated in the State of Nevada on September 21, 1989 under the name Fulton Ventures, Inc. On September 19, 2002, we changed our name to Asia Premium Television Group, Inc. to more accurately reflect our business at the time. Effective November 16, 2009, we changed our name to China Grand Resorts, Inc. to more accurately reflect its new business efforts. Commencing in 2002, we acquired and sold a series of subsidiary entities that were incorporated in various foreign jurisdictions, including the People’s Republic of China, or PRC, Macau, Hong Kong and the British Virgin Islands. Through 2009, these subsidiaries engaged in a variety of businesses, including, principally, marketing, brand management, advertising, media planning, public relations and direct marketing services to clients in the PRC. 
 
The Company discontinued filing periodic reports under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), after it filed a quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the period ended June 30, 2014 (the “June 2014 10-Q”) on August 14, 2014. As reported in the Company’s annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended September 20, 2013 (the last periodic report filed under the Exchange Act with which the Company furnished audited financial statements) and the June 2014 10-Q, the Company was engaged, through its subsidiaries, in the provision of mobile phone based services in the PRC through Sun New Media Transaction Services Ltd., a Hong Kong corporation, and real estate investment in the PRC through Key Proper Holdings Limited, a British Virgin Islands corporation. 
 
Since the filing of the June 2014 10-Q, current management is not aware of any contact between the Company and incumbent management as of the filing of the June 2014 10-Q, which we refer to as prior management, nor does current management have any knowledge or information relating to the business operations conducted by the Company or its subsidiaries as of that date, other than as reported in the periodic reports it filed with the SEC. Current management does not have in its possession any records of the Company prior to its taking operational control of the Company, other than documents filed with or furnished to the SEC. The financial statements furnished with this report have been prepared under the assumption that prior management abandoned the business of the Company and its operating subsidiaries, all of which were organized under and operated in foreign jurisdictions, and the Company has been dormant since July 1, 2014.

On April 4, 2016, Bryan Glass was appointed to serve as the custodian of the Company pursuant to an order of the District Court of Clark County Nevada and was authorized to take any action on behalf of the Company for the benefit of the Company and otherwise to reinstate the Company’s corporate existence in Nevada and convene a shareholders’ meeting to elect directors of the Company. 
 
On May 6, 2016, the Company entered into a consulting agreement with Mr. Glass under which he agreed to take all the steps reasonably necessary, beyond reinstatement of the corporation in Nevada and holding a shareholders meeting, to create an operating entity, in consideration for which services the Company issued to Mr. Glass 30 million shares of common stock.
 
The Company held a shareholders meeting on May 4, 2016 at which Mr. Glass was elected as the sole director of the Company and the shareholders adopted and approved Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation After Issuance of Stock, a copy of which is furnished as an exhibit to this report. As of the date of this report, Mr. Glass serves as our only director and officer.
 
Current Operations and Strategy
 
The Company currently does not engage in any business operations or generate revenue from any sources. Management has determined to direct its efforts and limited resources to pursue a potential new business opportunity. Management does not intend to limit itself to a particular industry and has not established any particular criteria upon which it shall consider and proceed with a business opportunity.
 
We anticipate that the selection of an appropriate business opportunity will be complex and extremely risky and we cannot assure you that we will be successful in concluding a transaction or if we do, that we will be successful thereafter. Our lack of financial and personnel resources may negatively impact our ability to consummate an attractive transaction or cause us to discontinue operations before we enter such a transaction. 
 
We may never realize any revenues or generate any income unless and until we conclude a transaction with an operating business that is generating revenues and otherwise is operating profitably. Moreover, we can offer no guarantee that the Company will achieve long-term or immediate short-term earnings from any business transaction.
 
Ramifications of Our Blank Check Company and Shell Company Status
 
At present, we have no revenues, no assets and no specific business plan or purpose. Our business plan is to seek new business opportunities through a merger or acquisition with an unidentified company or an acquisition of assets, which transaction we may refer to as a business transaction. Based upon these conditions, under the Exchange Act, we are deemed to be “blank check” company and a “shell company.” Our status as a blank check company and a shell company will impact our company and shareholders in many ways, some of which are described below
Blank Check Company Status and Securities Offerings
 
As a blank check company, any offerings of our securities under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), must comply with Rule 419 promulgated by the SEC under the Securities Act. Rule 419 requires that a blank check company filing a registration statement deposit the securities being offered and proceeds of the offering into an escrow or trust account pending the execution of an agreement for an acquisition or merger. In addition, an issuer is required to file a post-effective amendment to the registration statement upon the execution of an agreement for such acquisition or merger. The rule provides procedures for the release of the offering funds in conjunction with the post effective acquisition or merger. The obligations to file post-effective amendments are in addition to the obligations to file Forms 8-K to report for both the entry into a material definitive (non-ordinary course of business) agreement and the completion of the transaction. Rule 419 applies to both primary and re-sale or secondary offerings. Within five (5) days of filing a post-effective amendment setting forth the proposed terms of an acquisition, the Company must notify each investor whose shares are in escrow. Each investor then has no fewer than 20 and no greater than 45 business days to notify the Company in writing if they elect to remain an investor. A failure to reply indicates that the person has elected to not remain an investor. As all investors are allotted this second opportunity to determine to remain an investor, acquisition agreements should be conditioned upon enough funds remaining in escrow to close the transaction.

Application of Penny Stock Rules
 
Our common stock is a “penny stock,” as defined in Rule 3a51-1 promulgated by the SEC under the Exchange Act. The penny stock rules require a broker-dealer, among other things, prior to a transaction in penny stock not otherwise exempt from the rules, to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document that provides information about penny stocks and the nature and level of risks in the penny stock market. A broker-dealer also must provide the customer with current bid and offer quotations for the penny stock, the compensation of the broker-dealer and its sales person in the transaction, and monthly account statements showing the market value of each penny stock held in the customer's account. In addition, the penny stock rules require that the broker-dealer, not otherwise exempt from such rules, must make a special written determination that the penny stock is suitable for the purchaser and receive the purchaser's written agreement to the transaction. These disclosure rules have the effect of reducing the level of trading activity in the secondary market for a stock that becomes subject to the penny stock rules. So long as our common stock is subject to the penny stock rules, it may be more difficult for us and you to sell your common stock.
Shell Company Status
 
We are a shell company as defined in Rule 405 promulgated by the SEC under the Securities Act. A shell company is one that has no or nominal operations and either: (i) no or nominal assets; or (ii) assets consisting primarily of cash or cash equivalents. As a shell company, we are subject to various laws, regulations and restrictions, including that we will be subject to restrictions on our use of Form S-8 to register stock that we may issue to our employees and consultants and you will be subject to restrictions from relying on Rule 144 for the resale of your common stock, as described below.
 
Shell companies are prohibited from using Form S-8 to register securities under the Securities Act. If a company ceases to be a shell company, it may use Form S-8 sixty calendar days after the date on which it makes required filings with the SEC disclosing the cessation of its status as shell company, provided it has filed all reports and other materials required to be filed under the Exchange Act during the preceding 12 months (or for such shorter period that it has been required to file such reports and materials after the company files “Form 10 information,” which is information that a company would be required to file in a registration statement on Form 10 if it were registering a class of securities under Section 12 of the Exchange Act. This information would normally be reported on a current report on Form 8-K reporting the completion of a transaction that caused the company to cease being a Shell Company.
 
Rule 144 under the Act provides an exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act and allows the holders of restricted securities to sell their securities utilizing one of the provisions of this Rule. However, Rule 144 specifically precludes reliance by holders of securities of shell companies such as ours or any issuer that has been at any time previously a shell company, except if the following conditions are met:
 


· | The issuer of the securities that was formerly a shell company has ceased to be a shell company; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | The issuer of the securities is subject to the reporting requirements of Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act; 
· | The issuer of the securities has filed all Exchange Act reports and material required to be filed, as applicable, during the preceding 12 months (or such shorter period that the issuer was required to file such reports and materials), other than Current Reports on Form 8-K; and
· | At least one year has elapsed from the time that the issuer filed current comprehensive disclosure with the SEC reflecting its status as an entity that is not a shell company. 

 
As a result of our classification as a shell company, our investors are not allowed to rely on the “safe harbor” provisions of Rule 144, promulgated pursuant to the Securities Act, so as not to be considered underwriters in connection with the sale of our securities until one year from the date that we cease to be a shell company. This will likely make it more difficult for us to attract additional capital through subsequent unregistered offerings because purchasers of securities in such unregistered offerings will not be able to resell their securities in reliance on Rule 144, a safe harbor on which holders of restricted securities usually rely to resell securities.
 
Entering into a business transaction
 
General.
 
A business transaction may involve the acquisition of, or merger with, an operating or development stage company or the acquisition of assets that we will develop into a company.

Our management has not developed a specific plan or process for identifying a business opportunity. Our business is predicated upon relationships built by management and the ongoing effort to develop new contacts through which our management may be introduced to prospective business opportunity. Moreover, given the wide-ranging variables inherent in our business, management cannot predict when we will effectuate a business transaction, if ever, or the amount of capital we will require for such purpose.
 
Search for a target.
 
We are currently in the process of identifying and evaluating potential business opportunities. As described below, our management has broad discretion with respect to selecting prospective acquisition candidates. At such time as we affect a business transaction, if ever, we will be impacted by numerous risks inherent in the business and operations in connection with such business. The risks attendant to such business opportunity may include risks typical of a financially unstable company or an entity in its early stage of development or growth, including entities without established records of sales or earnings. Although our management will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in a particular target, we cannot assure you that we will properly ascertain or assess all significant risk factors.
 
Sources of business opportunities.
 
We intend to source our target opportunities from various internal and external sources. Business opportunities may be brought to our attention from affiliated and unaffiliated sources. Our management may call upon personal contacts and relationships he and his affiliates have developed and maintain with various professionals, including accountants, consultants, bankers, attorneys and other advisors. In addition, management may initiate formal or informal inquiries or attend trade shows or conventions. In no event will any of our affiliates be paid any finder’s fee, consulting fee or other compensation prior to or for any services they render in connection with the consummation of a business transaction. 
 
Business opportunities may be brought to our attention by unaffiliated sources as a result of being solicited by us through calls or mailings. These sources may also introduce us to business opportunities in which they believe we may have an interest. We may retain the services of agents or other representatives to identify or locate suitable targets on our behalf, though, to date, we have not engaged any such persons. We have not adopted any policy with respect to utilizing the services of consultants or advisors to assist in the identification of a business opportunity, the criteria to be used in selecting such consultants or advisors, the services to be provided, the term of service or the amount of fees we may pay to them. In the event that we retain the services of professional firms or other individuals that specialize in business acquisitions, we may pay a finder’s fee, consulting fee or other compensation to be determined in an arm’s length negotiation.
 
Selection criteria for a business opportunity.
 
We have not established any specific attributes or criteria (financial or otherwise) for prospective business opportunities. In evaluating a prospective business opportunity, our management will consider, among other factors, the following:
 


· | financial condition and results of operation; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | growth potential; 
· | experience and skill of management and availability of additional personnel; 
· | capital requirements; 
· | competitive position; 
· | barriers to entry in the industry; 
· | stage of development of the products, processes or services; 
· | degree of current or potential market acceptance of the products, processes or services; 
· | proprietary features and degree of intellectual property or other protection of the products, processes or services;
· | regulatory environment within the industry; and 
· | the costs associated with affecting the business transaction with a particular business opportunity. 

 
These criteria are not intended to be exhaustive or to in any way limit the board of director’s unrestricted discretion to enter into a business transaction for any business opportunity. Any evaluation relating to the merits of a particular business transaction will be based, to the extent relevant, on the above factors as well as other considerations deemed relevant by our management.

Due Diligence Investigation.
 
In evaluating a prospective business opportunity, we will conduct as extensive a due diligence review of potential targets as possible. Our review will be constrained by our limited capital resources, lack of full-time employees and management’s inexperience in such endeavors. We may enter into a business transaction with a privately-held company in its early stages of development or that has only a limited operating history on which we could base our decision. Since little public information typically is available about these companies, we will be required to rely on the ability of management to obtain adequate information to evaluate the potential risks and returns from entering into a business transaction with such a company. We expect that our due diligence may include, among other things, meetings with the target business’s incumbent management, an inspection of its facilities and a review of financial and other information made available to us. This due diligence review will be conducted by our management, possibly with the assistance of our counsel, accountants or other third parties.
 
Our financial and personnel limitations may render it impractical for us to conduct an exhaustive investigation and analysis of a business opportunity candidate before we consummate a business transaction. Management’s decisions, therefore, will likely be made without detailed feasibility studies, independent analyses and market surveys or other methodologies which, if we had more funds available to us, would be desirable. We will be particularly dependent in making decisions upon information provided by the principals, promoters, sponsors or others associated with the business opportunity seeking our participation.
 
It is unlikely that our management at the time of a business transaction will continue in any material capacity with the Company after the consummation of a business transaction, other than as stockholders.
 
Our assessment of a business opportunity may not be accurate. If we do not uncover all material information about a business opportunity prior to a business transaction, we may not make a fully informed investment decision and we may lose money on our investment.
 
The time and costs required to select and evaluate a business opportunity and to structure and complete a business transaction cannot presently be ascertained with any degree of certainty. Any costs we incur in furtherance of consummating a business transaction that is not consummated may result in a loss to us.
 
Form of acquisition; Opportunity for stockholder approval.
 
The manner in which we participate in a business transaction will depend upon, among other things, the nature of the opportunity and the respective requirements and desires of management of our Company and of the business opportunity. In addition, the structure of any business transaction will be dispositive as to whether stockholder approval of the business transaction is required.
 
It is likely we will structure a business transaction as either an acquisition of the stock or assets of a target business or a merger of a target business with us or a wholly owned subsidiary we may organize to engage in the transaction. Important factors the parties will consider in structuring a business transaction will be the time and cost of a particular structure and the tax treatment that the structure might receive. If the business transaction is structured as an acquisition of a target business's stock or assets, our Company will not require the vote or approval of stockholders and the transaction may be accomplished in the sole determination of management. If the business transaction is structured as a merger, the transaction would require the approval of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of our common stock which may necessitate calling a stockholders' meeting to obtain such approval and the filing of reports and documents with the SEC and state agencies. This process may result in delays and additional expenses in the consummation of a proposed transaction and afford rights to dissenting stockholders who could require us to purchase their stock for cash. In light of the above, management likely will seek to structure a business transaction as an acquisition so as not to require stockholder approval. In either case, we likely will issue a significant number of shares to the parties with which we enter into a business transaction and our stockholders prior to the transaction likely would hold a small minority of the outstanding shares of our common stock after giving effect to the transaction.

We will seek to structure a business transaction to qualify for tax-free treatment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”). In some cases, the Code mandates very specific parameters for a transaction to qualify as tax free. For example, in order for a stock for stock exchange transaction to qualify as a “tax free” reorganization, the holders of the stock of the target must receive a number of shares of our stock equal to 80% or more of the voting stock of our Company. Depending on the circumstances of an acquisition, we may not be able to structure a transaction in the most tax advantageous manner. Further, we cannot assure you that the Internal Revenue Service or state tax authorities will agree with our tax treatment of any transaction.
 
It is likely that as part of a business transaction, all or a majority of our Company's management at the time of the transaction will resign and new directors will be appointed without any vote by stockholders. 
 
In view of our status as a “shell” company, any acquisition of the stock or assets of or the merger with an operating company would be deemed to be a “reverse acquisition” or “reverse merger” for accounting purposes.
 
We anticipate that the investigation of specific business opportunities and the negotiation, preparation and execution of relevant agreements, disclosure documents and other instruments will require significant management time and attention and substantial cost for accountants, attorneys and others. If a decision is made not to participate in a specific business opportunity, the costs incurred in the related investigation would not be recoverable. Furthermore, even if an agreement is reached for a business transaction, the failure to consummate that transaction may result in the loss to the Company of the related costs incurred.
 
Lack of diversification.
 
We expect that we will be able to consummate a business transaction with only one candidate given that, among other considerations, we will not have the resources to diversify our operations. Moreover, given that we likely will offer a controlling interest in our Company to the persons with which we enter into business transaction in order to achieve a tax-free reorganization, the dilution of interest to present and prospective stockholders will render more than one business transaction unlikely. Therefore, at least initially, the prospects for our success may be entirely dependent upon the future performance of a single business and we will not benefit from the possible spreading of risks or offsetting of losses that business transactions with multiple operating entities would offer. By consummating a business transaction with a single entity, our lack of diversification may result in our dependency upon the development or market acceptance of a single or limited number of products, processes or services and subject us to numerous economic, competitive and regulatory developments, any or all of which may have a substantial adverse impact upon the particular industry in which we may operate subsequent to a business transaction.
 
Competition
 
We expect that in the course of identifying, evaluating and selecting a business opportunity, we may encounter intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours. These include blank check companies that have raised significant capital through sales of securities registered under federal securities laws that have a business plan similar to ours and, consequently, possess a significant competitive advantage over our Company both from a financial and personnel perspective. Additionally, we may be subject to competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours, including venture capital firms, leveraged buyout firms and operating businesses looking to expand their operations through acquisitions. Many of these entities are well established, possess significant capital, may be able to offer securities for which a trading market exists and have extensive experience identifying and affecting these types of business transactions directly or through affiliates. Moreover, nearly all of these competitors possess greater technical, personnel and other resources than us. In addition, we will experience competition from other modestly capitalized shell companies that are seeking to enter into business transactions with targets similar to those we expect to pursue. 
 
If we succeed in affecting a business transaction, there will be, in all likelihood, intense competition from competitors within the industry in which we will operate. We cannot currently apprise you of these risks nor can we assure you that, subsequent to a business transaction, we will have the resources or ability to compete effectively.
 
Smaller Reporting Company
 
We qualify as a “smaller reporting company” under Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act, which is defined as a company with a public equity float of less than $75 million. To the extent that we remain a smaller reporting company, we will have reduced disclosure requirements for our public filings, including: (1) not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes Oxley Act; (2) scaled executive compensation disclosures; and (3) the requirement to provide only two years of audited financial statements, instead of three years.

7

Employees
 
We have one executive officer who has other business interests and who is not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters. He intends to devote only as much time as he deems necessary to our affairs. The amount of time our officer will devote to our affairs in any time period will vary based on whether a business opportunity has been selected for the business transaction and the stage of the business transaction process the Company is in. Accordingly, as management identifies suitable business opportunities, we expect that our management will spend more time investigating such business opportunity and will devote additional time and effort negotiating and processing the business transaction as developments warrant. We do not intend to have any full time employees prior to the consummation of a business transaction.
 
Our management may engage in other business activities similar and dissimilar to those we are engaged in without any limitations or restrictions. To the extent that our management engages in such other activities, there will be possible conflicts of interest in diverting opportunities which would be appropriate for our Company to other entities or persons with which our management is associated or has an interest, rather than offering such opportunities to us. Since we have not established any policy for the resolution of such a conflict, we could be adversely affected should our officer/director choose to place his other business interests before ours. We cannot assure you that such potential conflicts of interest will not result in the loss of potential opportunities or that any conflict will be resolved in our favor.
