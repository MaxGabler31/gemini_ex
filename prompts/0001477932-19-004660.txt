ITEM 1. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS
Overview

The address of our principal executive office is located at 1440 NW 1st Court, Boca Raton, FL 33432. Our telephone number is (561) 757-3585. Our company was incorporated in the State of Nevada on December 5, 2003 under the name Computer Maid, Inc. Our company was inactive until February 2006, when we changed our name to Rose Explorations Inc. and became engaged in the exploration of mining properties.

On March 4, 2008, our company completed a merger with our wholly-owned subsidiary, Silverstar Mining, Inc. and simultaneously changed its name to Silverstar Mining, Inc.

On March 4, 2008, we affected a 3 for 1 forward stock split of our authorized, issued and outstanding common stock. As a result, our authorized capital increased from 75,000,000 shares of common stock with a par value of $0.001 to 225,000,000 shares of common stock with a par value of $0.001.

On April 13, 2011, we incorporated a wholly owned subsidiary, Silverstar Mining (Canada) Inc., under the federal laws of Canada. The subsidiary’s main purpose is to hold title to mineral property rights situated in Canada as the laws of that country require that only local entities can hold title to mineral property rights situated within its borders.

Effective September 26, 2011, we affected a reverse split our common stock on a 1,000 for 1 basis. As a result of the foregoing, we reduced the number of authorized shares of our common stock from 225,000,000 to 225,000.

On February 29, 2012, we filed a Certificate of Amendment to our company’s Articles of Incorporation with the Nevada Secretary of State increasing the number of authorized shares from 225,000 to 225,000,000 shares of common stock $0.001 par value.

On July 22, 2013 we entered into settlement agreements with four debt holders of our company pursuant to which we restructured outstanding demand loans payable in the aggregate amount of $175,028 (inclusive of accrued interest) as convertible debentures.

On February 15, 2013, we closed a Share Exchange Agreement pursuant to which we intended to acquire a wholly owned subsidiary, Arriba Resources Inc. However, effective November 13, 2013 our Board of Directors approved the cancellation and reversal of the Share Exchange Agreement due to a failure of consideration on the part of the seller. As a result of the cancellation and reversal of the Share Exchange Agreement, 2,139,926 shares of our common stock and warrants to acquire 2,078,477 shares of our common stock which were previously authorized (but not issued from treasury) have been cancelled with immediate effect. Consequently, the change of control announced in our current report on Form 8-K filed on May 21, 2013 has been reversed.

As a result of the cancellation and reversal of the Share Exchange Agreement with Arriba, the consolidated financial statements of our Company for the quarterly periods ended March 31, 2013 (filed with the SEC on August 14, 2013) and June 30, 2013 (filed with the SEC on May 20, 2013) may no longer be relied upon owing to their inclusion of the financial information of Arriba. We informed our independent accountants of the cancellation and reversal of the Share Exchange Agreement and intend to file amendments to our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the periods ended March 31 and June 30, 2013 to reflect our financial condition without consolidation of the financial information of Arriba. The financial statements contained in this current report accurately reflect the deconsolidation of the financial information of Arriba.

On January 23, 2015 the board of directors with the consent of a majority of its shareholders approved amended articles of incorporation to include a change of name to Silverstar Resources, Inc. and a reverse split of its common stock resulting in shareholders receiving one share for every five shares (5 to 1) they hold as of record of that date. In addition, the amendment set the authorized shares of common stock at 220,000,000 and preferred stock at 5,000,000 shares both at a par value of $0.001.

On March 10, 2015 the Company formed 1030029 Ltd, an Alberta numbered company as a wholly owned subsidiary to meet the requirements of holding working interest of Alberta producing oil and gas properties

On June 23, 2016, the Company’s Board of Directors approved of a change of name from Silverstar Resources, Inc. to Creative Waste Solutions, Inc.

Current Operational Activities

Waste Management

The company through its subsidiaries provides waste management environmental services to residential, commercial, industrial, and municipal customers in the geographical region of the South East.

The company’s subsidiaries are involved in the brokerage business and operate a waste transfer station. The company’s expansion has taken place by the following membership and asset purchases:

On April 7, 2016, the Company entered into a membership purchase agreement with Creative Waste Solutions, LLC, a Florida limited liability corporation (“Creative”) whereby the Company purchased 100% of the membership interest for $25,000.

On May 22, 2016, the Company entered into a stock purchase agreement with Florida based, Integrated Waste Transportation Services, Inc. (“Integrated”). Pursuant to the agreement, the Company acquired 100% of the outstanding equity of Integrated in exchange for $300,000 and 50,000 Shares of common stock of the Company (see Note 11).

On August 26, 2016, the Company purchased certain assets of Florida based Easy Disposal, Inc., for an aggregate amount of $380,000 which includes 50,000 shares of common stock of the Company, valued at $2.00 per share and the remainder in cash. The Company paid for this acquisition by issuing unsecured notes payable in the aggregate amount of $300,000 that bear interest at 10% per annum and are payable upon demand.

Brokerage Division:

Our brokerage divisions consist of Creative Waste Solutions, LLC and Integrated Waste Transportation Services. Both entities own nominal assets and their accounting only been consolidated since their respective dates of acquisitions of April 7, 2016 and May 22, 2016. Creative Waste Solutions, LLC does not maintain any long term contracts and all revenues are generated through “phone in” orders. Fees are charged based on availability of subcontractors, dumpsters, volume and frequency of pick up. Integrated Waste Transportation maintains a long term contract with a large local Waste Management company and acts as subcontractor for small local waste Management needs.

In connection with the acquisitions of Creative and Integrated on April 7, 2016 and May 22, 2016, respectively, the Company acquired customer lists valued at $25,000 and $350,000, respectively. The customer lists are being amortized over 24 months. Amortization expense for the twelve months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017 was $122,917 and $187,500, respectively. As of September 30, 2018 the customer lists have been fully amortized.

Waste Stations:

We accept various waste at our Hollywood Florida location. Waste is delivered by small local haulers consolidated and compacted to reduce the volume and increase the density of the waste and transported by transfer trucks disposal sites.

Access to transfer stations is critical to haulers who collect waste in areas not in close proximity to disposal facilities. Fees charged to third parties at transfer stations are usually based on the type and volume or weight of the waste deposited at the transfer station, the distance to the disposal site, market rates for disposal costs and other general market factors.

We do not own the physical site, but we operate under a long term lease on the property. We do own the permits and necessary documentation and responsible for any regulatory requirements relating to the operation and closure of the transfer station.

Land Fill Operations.

Currently, we do not own or operate any land fill operations. All waste accepted by our Waste Station and through our brokerage house is transported to legal entities that operate disposal sites.
Mineral Exploration

On April 14, 2015 the Company acquired the working interest of two producing oil and gas properties in Alberta Canada for US $80,000.

The Company has determined that the asset does not fit the future plans of the Company. Under the guidelines of ASC 360 Newly Acquired Asset Classified as Held for Sale, the Company is actively seeking to dispose of the asset through a sale. As part of the treatment of the asset for sale the Company under ASC 205 Discontinued Operations has treated the expenses related with its acquisition of $3,942 as discontinued operations expense. During the year ended September 30, 2015, the Company determined that this asset had become impaired and took a charge to earnings of $80,000 which was reflected in discontinued operations.

Concurrently with the disposition of our two producing oil and gas properties, the company is not actively expanding our business in the oil and natural gas development arenas.

For the balance or our discussion, the company will focus on its current waste management business.

Competition

Within our Waste Management subsidiaries, we encounter intense competition from governmental, quasi-governmental and private sources in all aspects of our operations. In our geographical region, the industry consists primarily of two national waste management companies and regional and local companies of varying sizes and financial resources, including companies that specialize in certain discrete areas of waste management, operators of alternative disposal facilities and companies that seek to use parts of the waste stream as feedstock for renewable energy and other by-products. Some of our regional competitors can be significant competitors in local markets and are pursuing aggressive regional growth strategies. We compete with these companies as well as with counties and municipalities that maintain their own waste collection and disposal operations.

Operating costs, disposal costs and collection fees vary widely throughout the areas in which we operate. The prices that we charge are determined locally, and typically vary by volume and weight, type of waste collected, treatment requirements, risk of handling or disposal, frequency of collections, distance to final disposal sites, labor costs and amount and type of equipment furnished to the customer. We face intense competition in our brokerage business based on pricing and quality of service. We have also begun competing for business based on breadth of service offerings. As companies, individuals and communities look for ways to be more sustainable, we are promoting our comprehensive services that go beyond our core business of collecting and disposing of waste.

Seasonal Trends

Our operating revenues tend to be somewhat higher in summer months, primarily due to the higher volume of construction and demolition waste. The volumes of industrial and residential waste in certain regions where we operate also tend to increase during the summer months. Our second and third quarter revenues and results of operations typically reflect these seasonal trends.

Service disruptions caused by severe storms, extended periods of inclement weather or climate extremes can significantly affect the operating results of the affected Areas. On the other hand, certain destructive weather conditions that tend to occur during the second half of the year, such as the hurricanes that most often impact our operations in the Southern and Eastern U.S., can actually increase our revenues in the areas affected. While weather-related and other “one-time” occurrences can boost revenues through additional work for a limited time, as a result of significant start-up costs and other factors, such revenue can generate earnings at comparatively lower margins.

Employees

As of September 30, 2018, we had no full time employees, and approximately 6-part time employees. All employees are employed within operations, sales and administration.

Financial Assurance and Insurance Obligations

Municipal and governmental waste service contracts generally require contracting parties to demonstrate financial responsibility for their obligations under the contract. Financial assurance is also a requirement for obtaining or retaining disposal site or transfer station operating permits;

We establish financial assurance using surety bonds. The type of assurance used is based on several factors, most importantly: the jurisdiction, contractual requirements, market factors and availability of credit capacity.

Surety bonds and insurance policies are supported by (i) a diverse group of third-party surety and insurance companies; (ii) an entity in which we have a noncontrolling financial interest or (iii) wholly-owned insurance subsidiary.

Insurance

We carry minimal insurance coverages, including general liability, automobile liability, real and personal property, workers’ compensation, directors’ and officers’ liability, pollution legal liability, and business interruption. However, all our subcontractors are required to carry such insurances.

We do not carry any Directors’ and Officers’ Liability Insurance policy.

Regulations

Our business is subject to extensive and evolving federal, state or provincial and local environmental, health, safety and transportation laws and regulations. These laws and regulations are administered by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”), and various other federal, state, provincial and local environmental, zoning, transportation, land use, health and safety agencies. Local agencies regularly examine our operations to monitor compliance with these laws and regulations and have the power to enforce compliance, obtain injunctions or impose civil or criminal penalties in case of violations. In recent years, we have perceived an increase in both the amount of government regulation and the number of enforcement actions being brought by regulatory entities against operations in the waste services industry. We expect this heightened governmental focus on regulation and enforcement to continue.

Because the primary mission of our business is to collect and manage solid waste in an environmentally sound manner, a significant amount of our capital expenditures are related, either directly or indirectly, to environmental protection measures, including compliance with federal, state or provincial and local rules. There are costs associated with siting, design, permitting, operations, monitoring, site maintenance, corrective actions, financial assurance, and facility closure and post-closure obligations. In connection with our acquisition, development or expansion of a waste management or disposal facility or transfer station, we must often spend considerable time, effort and money to obtain or maintain required permits and approvals. There are no assurances that we will be able to obtain or maintain required governmental approvals. Once obtained, operating permits are subject to renewal, modification, suspension or revocation by the issuing agency. Compliance with current regulations and future requirements could require us to make significant capital and operating expenditures. However, most of these expenditures are made in the normal course of business and do not place us at any competitive disadvantage.

Financial Assurance and Insurance Obligations

Financial Assurance

Municipal and governmental waste service contracts generally require contracting parties to demonstrate financial responsibility for their obligations under the contract. Financial assurance is also a requirement for (i) obtaining or retaining disposal site or transfer station operating permits; (ii) supporting variable-rate tax-exempt debt and (iii) estimated final capping, closure, post-closure and environmental remedial obligations at many of our landfills. We establish financial assurance using surety bonds, letters of credit, insurance policies, trust and escrow agreements and financial guarantees. The type of assurance used is based on several factors, most importantly: the jurisdiction, contractual requirements, market factors and availability of credit capacity.
Insurance

We carry a broad range of insurance coverages, including general liability, automobile liability, real and personal property, workers’ compensation, directors’ and officers’ liability, pollution legal liability, business interruption and other coverages we believe are customary to the industry. Our exposure to loss for insurance
