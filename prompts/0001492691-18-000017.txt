Company Overview

Knight-Swift Transportation Holdings Inc. is North America's largest truckload carrier and a provider of transportation solutions, from its Phoenix, Arizona headquarters. The Company provides multiple truckload transportation and logistics services using a nationwide network of business units and terminals in the United States and Mexico to serve customers throughout North America. In addition to its truckload services, Knight-Swift also contracts with third-party capacity providers to provide a broad range of truckload services to its customers while creating quality driving jobs for our driving associates and successful business opportunities for independent contractors. 
During 2017, we covered 0.9 billion loaded miles for shippers throughout North America, contributing to consolidated total revenue of $2.4 billion and consolidated operating income of $200.6 million. As of December 31, 2017, our fleet was comprised of 18,381 company tractors, 4,688 independent contractor tractors, 74,949 trailers, and 9,122 intermodal containers. The Company's six reportable segments are Knight Trucking, Knight Logistics, Swift Truckload, Swift Dedicated, Swift Refrigerated, and Swift Intermodal.
We have historically grown through a combination of organic growth, as well as through mergers and acquisitions (discussed below). Mergers and acquisitions have enhanced Knight's and Swift's businesses and service offerings with additional terminals, driving associates, revenue equipment, and capacity. Our multiple service offerings, capabilities, and transportation modes enable us to transport, or arrange transportation for, general commodities for our diversified customer base throughout the contiguous United States and Mexico using our equipment, information technology, and qualified driving associates and non-driver employees. We are committed to providing our customers with a wide range of truckload and logistics services and continuing to invest considerable resources toward developing a range of solutions for our customers across multiple service offerings and transportation modes. Our overall objective is to provide truckload and logistics services that, when combined, lead the industry for margin and growth, while providing efficient and cost-effective solutions for our customers.

Business Combinations and Investments

2017 Merger
On September 8, 2017, we became Knight-Swift Transportation Holdings Inc. upon the effectiveness of the 2017 Merger. We accounted for the 2017 Merger using the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with GAAP. GAAP requires that either Knight or Swift is designated as the acquirer for accounting and financial reporting purposes ("Accounting Acquirer"). Based on the evidence available, Knight was designated as the Accounting Acquirer while Swift was the acquirer for legal purposes. Therefore, Knight’s historical results of operations replaced Swift’s historical results of operations for all periods prior to the 2017 Merger.
In conjunction with the 2017 Merger announcement, we provided an estimate of $150.0 million in synergies that we expect will be realized from the remainder of 2017 through 2019 with the combined efforts of Knight and Swift. See Note 4 in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report for more details regarding the 2017 Merger.
Historical Acquisitions
Knight — Since 1999, Knight has acquired all of the outstanding stock of five short-to-medium haul truckload carriers, or has acquired substantially all of the trucking assets of such carriers, including Granger, Iowa-based Barr-Nunn, acquired in 2014.
Swift — Since 1966, Swift has completed thirteen acquisitions, including the 2013 acquisition of Central Refrigerated Transportation, LLC (formerly Central Refrigerated Transportation, Inc.)
Joint Ventures
See Note 1 in Part II, Item 8 in this Annual Report, regarding Knight's joint ventures.

Industry and Competition

Truckload carriers represent the largest part of the transportation supply chain for most retail and manufactured goods in North America and typically transport a full trailer (or container) of freight for a single customer from origin to destination without intermediate sorting and handling. Generally, the truckload industry is compensated based on miles, whereas the less-than-truckload industry is compensated based on package size and/or weight. Overall, the United States trucking industry is large, fragmented, and highly competitive. We compete with thousands of truckload carriers, most of whom operate significantly smaller fleets than we do. Our trucking segments compete with other motor carriers for the services of driving associates, independent contractors, and management employees. To a lesser extent, our intermodal services, as well as our freight brokerage and logistics businesses, compete with railroads, less-than-truckload carriers, logistics providers, and other transportation companies. Our logistics businesses compete with other logistics companies for the services of third-party capacity providers and management employees.
Our industry has encountered the following major economic cycles since 2000: 

Period | Economic Cycle 
2000 — 2001 | industry over-capacity and depressed freight volumes 
2002 — 2006 | economic expansion 
2007 — 2009 | freight slowdown, fuel price spike, economic recession, and credit crisis 
2010 — 2013 | moderate recovery. The industry freight data began to show positive trends for both volume and pricing. The slow, steady growth is a result of moderate increases in gross domestic product, coupled with a tighter supply of available tractors. Trends in supply of available tractors were lower due to several years of below average truck builds, an increase in truckload fleet bankruptcies in 2009 and 2010, increasing equipment prices due to stringent EPA requirements, less available credit, and less driver availability. 
2014 — 2016 | return to pre-recession levels and relative stabilization. In 2014, total spending on transportation, which fell during the 2007 – 2009 recession, returned to pre-recession levels. Truck tonnage grew throughout 2014, followed by decelerating growth in 2015, and relative stabilization in 2016. Capacity became looser in 2015 and 2016, as inventory levels were high and large volumes of tractor purchases created a supply/demand imbalance, putting pressure on pricing. Fuel prices declined. 
2017 | Demand increased for transportation services, including non-contract market demand, partially due to a strong retail season. Capacity became tighter in the second half of 2017, due to increasing government regulation, the driver shortage, severe storms interrupting business, among other factors. In addition, US fuel prices increased. 

The principal means of competition in our industry are customer service, capacity, and price. In times of strong freight demand, customer service, and capacity become increasingly important, and in times of weak freight demand, pricing becomes increasingly important. Most truckload contracts (other than dedicated contracts) do not guarantee truck availability or load levels. Pricing is influenced by supply and demand.
The trucking industry faces the following primary challenges, which we believe we are well-positioned to address, as discussed under "Our Competitive Strengths" and "Company Strategy," below:

• | tightening industry capacity;


• | cumulative impacts of regulatory initiatives, such as ELDs, hours-of service limitations for drivers, and others;


• | uncertainty in the economic environment, including changing supply chain and consumer spending patterns;


• | driver shortages;


• | significant and rapid fluctuations in fuel prices; and


• | increased prices for new revenue equipment, design changes of new engines, and volatility in the used equipment sales market.

Our Competitive Strengths

We believe that our principal competitive strengths are our regional presence, customer service (including our ability to provide multiple transportation solutions, and configuration of equipment that satisfies customers' needs), operating efficiency, cost control, and technological enhancements in our revenue equipment and supporting back-office functions.

Regional Presence 
We believe that regional operations, which have recently expanded with the merger between Knight and Swift, offer several advantages, including:• obtaining greater freight volumes,• achieving higher revenue per mile by focusing on high-density freight lanes to minimize non-revenue miles,• enhancing our ability to recruit and train qualified driving associates,• enhancing safety and driver development and retention,• enhancing our ability to provide a high level of service and consistent capacity to our customers,• enhancing accountability for performance and growth,• furthering our trucking capabilities to provide various shipping solutions to our customers, and• furthering our logistics capabilities to contract with more third-party capacity providers. 
Operating Efficiency and Cost Control 
We expect to generate cost and revenue synergies as a result of the 2017 Merger through, among other things, increased operational efficiencies through the adoption of best practices and capabilities from each of Knight and Swift. We operate modern tractors and trailers in order to obtain operating efficiencies and attract and retain driving associates. We believe a generally compatible fleet of tractors and trailers simplifies our maintenance procedures and reduces parts, supplies, and maintenance costs. We regulate vehicle speed, which we believe will maximize fuel efficiency, reduce wear and tear, and enhance safety. We continue to update our fleet with more fuel-efficient post-2014 United States EPA emission compliant engines, install aerodynamic devices on our tractors, and equip our trailers with trailer blades, which have led to meaningful improvements in fuel efficiency. Our logistics and intermodal businesses focus on effectively optimizing and meeting the transportation and logistics requirements of our customers and providing customers with various sources and modes of transportation capacity across our nationwide service network. We invest in technology that enhances our ability to optimize our freight opportunities while maintaining a low cost per transaction.
Customer Service 
We strive to provide superior, on-time service at a meaningful value to our customers and seek to establish ourselves as a preferred truckload and logistics provider for our customers. We provide truckload capacity for customers in high-density lanes, where we can provide them with a high level of service, as well as flexible and customized logistics services on a nationwide basis. Our trucking services include dry van, refrigerated, and drayage, which also include dedicated and cross-border truckload services, customized according to customer needs. Our logistics and intermodal services include brokerage, intermodal, and certain logistics, freight management, and non-trucking services, which provide various shipping alternatives and transportation modes for customers by utilizing our expansive network of third-party capacity providers and rail partners. We price our trucking, logistics, and intermodal services commensurately with the level of service our customers require and market conditions. By providing customers a high level of service, we believe we avoid competing solely based on price. 
Using Technology that Enhances Our Business 
We purchase and deploy technology that we believe will allow us to operate more safely, securely, and efficiently. Substantially all of our company-owned tractors are equipped with in-cab communication devices that enable us to communicate with our driving associates, obtain load position updates, manage our fleets, and provide our customers with freight visibility, as well as with ELDs that automatically record our driving associates' hours-of-service. The majority of our trailers are equipped with trailer-tracking technology that allows us to better manage our trailers. We have purchased and developed software for our logistics businesses that provides greater visibility of the capacity of our third-party providers and enhances our ability to provide our customers with solutions that offer a superior level of service. We have automated many of our back-office functions, and we continue to invest in technology that we expect will allow us to better serve our customers and improve overall efficiency.

Our Mission and Company Strategy

Our mission is to operate truckload businesses that are industry leading in both margin and growth, while providing cost-effective solutions for our customers. Our success depends on our ability to efficiently and effectively manage our resources in providing transportation and logistics solutions to our customers, as well as our ability to leverage efficiencies and best practices between Knight and Swift. We evaluate growth opportunities based on customer demand and supply chain trends, availability of drivers and third-party capacity providers, expected returns on invested capital, expected net cash flows, and our company-specific capabilities.

Segment Operating Strategies
Trucking Segments | Our operating strategy for our trucking segments, which includes Knight Trucking, Swift Truckload, Swift Dedicated, and Swift Refrigerated, is to achieve a high level of asset utilization within a highly disciplined operating system, while maintaining strict controls over our cost structure. We hope to achieve these goals by primarily operating in high-density, predictable freight lanes and attempting to develop and expand our customer base around each of our terminals by providing multiple truckload services for each customer. We believe this operating strategy allows us to take advantage of the large amount of freight transported in the markets we serve. Our terminals enable us to better serve our customers and work more closely with our driving associates. We operate a premium modern fleet that we believe appeals to driving associates and customers, reduces maintenance expenses and driving associate and equipment downtime, and enhances our fuel and other operating efficiencies. We employ technology in a cost-effective manner to assist us in controlling operating costs and enhancing revenue. 
Logistics businesses | Our logistics operating strategy is to match the shipping needs of our customers with the capacity provided by our network of third-party carriers and our rail providers. Our goal is to increase our market presence, both in existing operating regions and in other areas where we believe the freight environment meets our operating strategy, while seeking to achieve industry-leading operating margins and returns on investment. 
Swift Intermodal | Our Swift Intermodal operating strategy is to complement our regional operating model, allowing us to better serve customers in longer haul lanes, and reduce our investment in fixed assets. We have intermodal agreements with most major North American rail carriers, which have helped increase our volumes through more competitive pricing. 


Growth Strategies 
We believe we have the terminal network, systems capability, and management capacity to support substantial growth. We have established a geographically diverse network that we believe can support a substantial increase in freight volumes, organic or acquired. Our network and business lines afford us the ability to provide multiple transportation solutions for our customers, and we maintain the flexibility within our network to adapt to freight market conditions. We believe our unique mix of regional management, together with our consistent efforts to centralize certain business functions to achieve collective economies of scale, allow us to develop future company leaders with relevant operating and industry experience, minimize the potential diseconomies of scale that can come with growth in size, take advantage of regional knowledge concerning capacity and customer shipping needs, and manage our overall business with a high level of performance accountability.
Strengthening our customer relationships | We market our services to both existing and new customers who value our broad geographic coverage, suite of transportation and logistics services, and industry-leading truckload capacity and freight lanes that complement our existing operations. We seek customers who will diversify our freight base. We market our dry van, refrigerated, drayage, brokerage, and intermodal services, including dedicated and cross-border services within those offerings, to logistics customers seeking a single-source provider of multiple services but do not currently take advantage of our array of truckload solutions.
Improving asset productivity | We focus on improving the revenue generated from our tractors and trailers without compromising safety. We anticipate that we can accomplish this objective through increased miles driven and rate per mile. 
Acquiring and growing opportunistically | We regularly evaluate potential opportunities for mergers, acquisitions, and other development and growth opportunities. In addition to the merger between Knight and Swift in 2017, since 1999, Knight has acquired five short-to-medium haul truckload carriers, including the acquisition of Barr-Nunn during 2014, and Swift has acquired thirteen companies since 1966. 
Expanding existing terminals | Historically, a substantial portion of our revenue growth has been generated by our expansion into new geographic regions through the opening of additional terminals. Although we continue to seek opportunities to further increase our business in this manner, our primary focus is on developing and expanding our existing terminals by strengthening our customer relationships, recruiting quality driving associates and non-driver employees, adding new customers, and expanding the range of transportation and logistics solutions offered from these terminals. 
Diversifying our service offerings | We are committed to providing our customers a broad and growing range of truckload and logistics services and continue to invest considerable resources toward developing a range of solutions for our customers. We believe that these offerings contribute meaningfully to our results and reflect our strategy to bring complementary services to our customers to assist them with their supply chain needs. We plan to continue to leverage our nationwide footprint and expertise to add value to our customers through our diversified service offerings.

Customers and Marketing

Marketing
Our marketing mission is to be a strategic, efficient transportation capacity partner for our customers by providing truckload and logistics solutions customizable to the unique needs of our customers. We deliver these capacity solutions through our network of owned assets, independent contractors, third-party capacity providers, and our rail providers. The diverse and premium services we offer provide a comprehensive approach to providing ample supply chain solutions to our customers. At December 31, 2017, we had a sales staff of approximately 85 individuals across the United States, Mexico, and Canada, who work closely with management to establish and expand accounts. Our sales and marketing leaders are members of our senior management team, who are assisted by other sales professionals in each segment. Our sales team emphasizes our industry-leading service, environmental leadership, and our ability to accommodate a variety of customer needs, provide consistent capacity, and financial strength and stability.
Customers
Our customers are typically large corporations in the retail (including discount and online retail), food and beverage, consumer products, paper products, transportation and logistics, housing and building, automotive, and manufacturing industries. Many of our customers have extensive operations, geographically distributed locations, and diverse shipping needs. 
Consistent with industry practice, our typical customer contracts (other than dedicated contracts) do not guarantee shipment volumes by our customers or truck availability by us. This affords us and our customers some flexibility to negotiate rates in response to changes in freight demand and industry-wide truck capacity. Our dedicated services within the Swift Dedicated and Knight Trucking segments assign particular driving associates and revenue equipment to prescribed routes, pursuant to multi-year agreements. This provides individual customers with a guaranteed source of capacity, and allows our driving associates to have more predictable schedules and routes. Under our dedicated transportation services, we provide driving associates, equipment, maintenance, and, in some instances, transportation management services that supplement the customer's in-house transportation department. 
Our terminals are linked to our corporate information technology system in our Phoenix headquarters. The capabilities of this system and its software enhance our operating efficiency by providing cost-effective access to detailed information concerning equipment location and availability, shipment tracking and on-time delivery status, and other specific customer requirements. The system also enables us to respond promptly and accurately to customer requests and assists us in geographically matching available equipment with customer loads. Additionally, our customers can track shipments and obtain copies of shipping documents via our website. We also provide electronic data interchange services to customers desiring these services. 
We believe our fleet capacity, terminal network, customer service and breadth of services offer a competitive advantage to major shippers, particularly in times of rising freight volumes when shippers must quickly access capacity across multiple facilities and regions.
We strive to maintain a diversified customer base. Services provided to the Company's largest customer, Wal-Mart, generated 15.8%, 13.7%, and 12.4% of total revenue in 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. Revenue generated by Wal-Mart is reported in the Knight Trucking, Swift Truckload, Swift Dedicated, Swift Refrigerated, and Swift Intermodal operating segments. No other customer accounted for 10% or more of total revenue in 2017, 2016, or 2015.
Our top 25 customers drive a substantial portion of our total revenue, as follows (amounts reflect only Swift's result prior to the 2017 Merger date, and Knight-Swift's results after the 2017 Merger date):

• | In 2017, our top 25, top 10, and top 5 customers accounted for 56.6%, 39.7%, and 31.7% of our total revenue, respectively.


• | In 2016, our top 25, top 10, and top 5 customers accounted for 53.7%, 37.3%, and 27.7% of our total revenue, respectively.


• | In 2015, our top 25, top 10, and top 5 customers accounted for 53.1%, 36.2%, and 26.2% of our total revenue, respectively.

Revenue Equipment

We operate a modern company tractor fleet to help attract and retain driving associates, promote safe operations, and reduce maintenance and repair costs. The following table shows our owned and leased tractor and trailer ages as of December 31, 2017:

Model Year | Tractors (1) | Trailers
2019 | — | | 9 
2018 | 2,798 | | 3,968 
2017 | 2,232 | | 8,835 
2016 | 5,185 | | 6,913 
2015 | 4,968 | | 8,846 
2014 | 2,223 | | 5,624 
2013 | 374 | | 5,666 
2012 | 123 | | 4,470 
2011 and prior | 478 | | 30,618
Total | 18,381 | | 74,949

_______________
(1) Excludes 4,688 independent contractor tractors.
We typically purchase or lease tractors and trailers manufactured to our specifications in order to meet a wide variety of customer needs. Growth of our tractor and trailer fleet is determined by market conditions and our experience and expectations regarding equipment utilization. In acquiring revenue equipment, we consider a number of factors, including economy, price, rate, economic environment, technology, warranty terms, manufacturer support, driving associate comfort, and resale value. We maintain strong relationships with our equipment vendors and have the financial flexibility to react as market conditions dictate. 
Our current policy is to replace our tractors between 42 months and 60 months after purchase and to replace our trailers over a five- to ten-year period. Changes in the current market for used tractors and trailers, regulatory changes, and difficult market conditions faced by tractor and trailer manufacturers, may result in price increases that may affect the period of time for which we operate our equipment.
Our newer equipment has enhanced features, which we believe tends to lower the overall life cycle costs by reducing safety-related expenses, lowering repair and maintenance expenses, improving fuel economy, and improving driving associate satisfaction. In 2018 and beyond, we will continue to monitor the appropriateness of this relatively short tractor trade-in cycle against the lower capital expenditure and financing costs of a longer tractor trade-in cycle, based on current and future business needs.

Employees

The strength of our company is our people, working together with common goals. There were approximately 25,200 full-time employees in our total headcount of approximately 25,400 employees as of December 31, 2017, which was comprised of:

Company driving associates (including driver trainees) | 19,200
Technicians and other equipment maintenance personnel | 1,400 
Support personnel (such as corporate managers, sales, and administrative personnel) | 4,800 
Total | 25,400

As of December 31, 2017, we had approximately 780 Trans-Mex driving associates in Mexico that were represented by a union.
Company Driving Associates
We recognize that the recruitment, training, and retention of a professional driving associate workforce, which is one of our most valuable assets, are essential to our continued growth and meeting the service requirements of our customers. In order to attract and retain safe driving associates who are committed to the highest levels of customer service and safety, we focus our operations for driving associates around a collaborative and supportive team environment. We provide late model and comfortable equipment, direct communication with senior management, competitive wages and benefits, and other incentives designed to encourage driving associate safety, retention, and long-term employment. We have established various driving academies across the United States. Our academies are strategically located in areas where external driver-training organizations were lacking. In other areas of the US, we have contracted with driver training schools, which are managed by third parties. There are certain minimum qualifications for candidates to be accepted into the academy, including passing the DOT physical examination and drug/alcohol screening.

KNIGHT-SWIFT TRANSPORTATION HOLDINGS INC.

Terminal Staff
Most of our large terminals are staffed with terminal leaders, fleet leaders, driver leaders, planners, safety coordinators, shop leaders, technicians, and customer service representatives. Our terminal leaders work with driver leaders, customer service representatives, and other operations personnel to coordinate the needs of both our customers and our driving associates. Terminal leaders are also responsible for serving existing customers in their areas. Fleet leaders supervise driver leaders, who are responsible for the general operation of our trucks and their driving associates, focusing on driving associate retention, productivity per truck, fuel consumption, fuel efficiency (with respect to driver-controllable idle time), safety, and scheduled maintenance. Customer service representatives are assigned specific customers to ensure specialized, high-quality service, and frequent customer contact.

Independent Contractors

In addition to Knight-Swift-employed driving associates, we enter into contractor agreements with third parties who own and operate tractors (or hire their own driving associates to operate the tractors) that service our customers. We pay these independent contractors for their services, based on a contracted rate per mile. By operating safely and productively, independent contractors can improve their own profitability and ours. Independent contractors are responsible for most costs incurred for owning and operating their tractors. For convenience, we offer independent contractors maintenance services at our in-house shops and fuel at our terminals at competitive and attractive prices. As of December 31, 2017, independent contractors comprised 20.3% of our total fleet, as measured by tractor count.

Safety and Insurance

Safety
We are committed to safe and secure operations. We conduct a mandatory intensive driver qualification process, including defensive driving training for all drivers, which includes our company driving associates. We require prospective drivers to meet higher qualification standards than those required by the DOT. We regularly communicate with drivers to promote safety and instill safe work habits through effective use of various media and safety review sessions. We dedicate personnel and resources designed to ensure safe operation and regulatory compliance. We employ technology to assist us in managing risks associated with our business. In addition, we have an innovative recognition program for driver safety performance and emphasize safety through our equipment specifications and maintenance programs. Our Corporate Directors of Safety review all accidents and report weekly to the Senior Director of Safety and Risk Management. 
Insurance
The primary claims arising in our business consist of auto liability, including personal injury, property damage, physical damage, and cargo loss. We self-insure for a significant portion of our claims exposure and related expenses. We also maintain insurance that covers our directors and officers for losses and expenses arising out of claims, based on acts or omissions in their capacities as directors or officers. While under dispatch and the Company's operating authority, the independent contractors the Company contracts with are covered by the Company's liability coverage and self-insurance retention limits. However, each is responsible for physical damage to his or her own equipment, occupational accident coverage, and liability exposure while the truck is used for non-company purposes. Additionally, fleet operators are responsible for any applicable workers' compensation requirements for their employees.
Swift — The following table includes Swift's self-insured retention amounts, maximum benefits per claim, and other limitations:

Insurance | Limits 
Automobile Liability, General Liability, and Excess Liability | $250.0 million of coverage per occurrence, subject to a $10.0 million self-insured retention per-occurrence. 
Cargo Damage and Loss | $2.0 million limit per truck or trailer with a $10.0 million limit per occurrence; provided that there is a $1.0 million limit for tobacco loads and a $250 thousand deductible 
Property and Catastrophic Physical Damage | $150.0 million limit for property and $100.0 million limit for vehicle damage, excluding over the road exposures, subject to a $1.0 million deductible 
Workers' Compensation/Employers' Liability | Statutory coverage limits; employers' liability of $1.0 million bodily injury by accident and disease, subject to a $5.0 million self-insured retention for each accident or disease
Employment Practices Liability | Primary policy with a $10.0 million limit subject to a $2.5 million self-insured retention 
Health Care | As of January 1, 2015, Swift is fully insured for medical, subject to contributed premiums. 

Swift insures certain casualty risks through its wholly-owned captive insurance subsidiaries, Mohave and Red Rock. Mohave and Red Rock provide reinsurance associated with a share of our automobile liability risk. In addition to insuring a proportionate share of our corporate casualty risk, Mohave provides reinsurance coverage to third-party insurance companies associated with Swift affiliated companies' independent contractors.

Knight — The following table includes information regarding Knight's main insurance programs:

Insurance | Limits 
Automobile Liability | $130.0 million of coverage per occurrence, subject to a $1.0 million self-insured retention per-occurrence, and a $2.5 million aggregate deductible for any loss within the excess coverage layer.
Workers' Compensation | $1.0 million self-insured retention per occurrence. 
Employee Medical and Hospitalization | Primary and excess coverage for employee medical expenses and hospitalization, with $0.2 million self-insured retention per claimant. 


Fuel

We actively manage our fuel purchasing network in an effort to maintain adequate fuel supplies and reduce our fuel costs. Additionally, we utilize a fuel surcharge program to pass a majority of increases in fuel costs to our customers. In 2017, we purchased 14.8% of our fuel in bulk at our Swift, Knight, and dedicated customer locations across the United States and Mexico. We purchased substantially all of the remainder through a network of retail truck stops with which we have negotiated volume purchasing discounts. The volumes we purchase at terminals and through the fuel network vary based on procurement costs and other factors. We seek to reduce our fuel costs by routing our driving associates to truck stops when fuel prices at such stops are cheaper than the bulk rate paid for fuel at our terminals. We primarily store fuel in above-ground storage tanks at most of our other bulk fueling terminals. We believe that we are sufficiently in compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations relating to the storage and dispensing of fuel.

Seasonality

In the transportation industry, results of operations generally follow a seasonal pattern. Freight volumes in the first quarter are typically lower due to less consumer demand, customers reducing shipments following the holiday season, and inclement weather impeding operations. At the same time, operating expenses generally increase, and tractor productivity of our fleet, independent contractors, and third-party carriers decreases during the winter months due to decreased fuel efficiency, increased cold-weather-related equipment maintenance and repairs, and increased insurance claims and costs attributed to higher accident frequency from harsh weather. During this period, the profitability of our operations is generally lower than during other parts of the year. Additionally, we have seen surges between Thanksgiving and Christmas resulting from holiday shopping trends toward delivery of gifts purchased over the Internet, as well as the impact of shorter holiday seasons (Thanksgiving holiday recently falling closer to Christmas).

Environmental Regulation

General
We have bulk fuel storage and fuel islands at many of our terminals, as well as vehicle maintenance, repair, and washing operations at some of our facilities, which exposes us to certain environmental risks. Soil and groundwater contamination have occurred at some of our facilities in prior years, for which we have been responsible for remediating the environmental contamination. Also, a small percentage of our total shipments contain hazardous materials, which are generally rated as low- to medium-risk, and subject us to a wide array of regulation. In the past, we have been responsible for the costs of clean-up of cargo and diesel fuel spills caused by traffic accidents or other events. 
We have instituted programs to monitor and mitigate environmental risks and maintain compliance with applicable environmental laws dealing with the hauling, handling, and disposal of hazardous materials, fuel spillage or seepage, emissions from our vehicles and facilities, engine-idling, discharge and retention of storm water, and other environmental matters. As part of our safety and risk management program, we periodically perform internal environmental reviews. We are a Charter Partner in the EPA's SmartWay Transport Partnership, a voluntary program promoting energy efficiency and air quality. We believe that our operations are sufficiently in compliance with current laws and regulations and do not know of any existing environmental condition that would reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on our business or operating results. 
If we are held responsible for the cleanup of any environmental incidents caused by our operations or business, or if we are found to be in violation of applicable laws or regulations, we could be subject to clean-up costs and other liabilities, including substantial fines or penalties or civil and criminal liability, any of which could have a material, adverse effect on our business and results of operations. We have paid penalties for spills and violations in the past; however, they have not been material to our financial results or position.

Greenhouse Gas ("GHG") Emissions and Fuel Efficiency Standards
California ARB — In 2008 the State of California's Air Resources Board ("ARB") approved the Heavy-Duty Vehicle GHG Emission Reduction Regulation in efforts to reduce GHG emissions from certain long-haul tractor-trailers that operate in California by requiring them to utilize technologies that improve fuel efficiency (regardless of where the vehicle is registered). The regulation required owners of long-haul tractors and 53-foot trailers to be EPA SmartWay certified or replace or retrofit their vehicles with aerodynamic technologies and low-rolling resistance tires. The regulation also contained certain emissions and registration standards for refrigerated trailers. 
In December 2013, California's ARB approved regulations to align its GHG emission standards and test procedures, as well as its tractor-trailer GHG regulation, with the feder Phase 1 GHG regulation (see below). 
Additionally, in February 2017 California's ARB proposed California Phase 2 standards that would generally align with the federal Phase 2 Standards (see below), with some minor additional requirements, and as proposed would stay in place even if the federal Phase 2 Standards are affected by action from President Trump's administration.  California's ARB has announced it plans to bring a formal proposed program to its board of directors in early 2018.
Complying with current and proposed GHG regulations has increased the cost of our new tractors, may increase the cost of any new trailers that will operate in California, may require us to retrofit certain of our pre-2011 model year trailers that operate in California, and could impair equipment productivity and increase our operating expenses.  These adverse effects, combined with the uncertainty as to the reliability of the newly designed diesel engines and the residual values of these vehicles, could materially increase our costs or otherwise adversely affect our business or operations. We will continue monitoring our compliance with California's ARB regulations.
EPA and NHTSA — The EPA and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration ("NHTSA") began taking coordinated steps in support of a new generation of clean vehicles and engines through reduced GHG emissions and improved fuel efficiency at a national level. 

• | Phase 1 — In September 2011, the EPA finalized federal regulations for controlling GHG emissions, beginning with model-year 2014 medium- and heavy-duty engines and vehicles and increasing in stringency through model-year 2018. The federal regulations relate to efficient engines, use of auxiliary power units, mass reduction, low-rolling resistance tires, improved aerodynamics, improved transmissions, and reduced accessory loads.

In December 2013, California's ARB approved regulations to align its GHG emission standards and test procedures, as well as its tractor-trailer GHG regulation, with the federal Phase 1 GHG regulation. 

• | Phase 2 — In June 2015, the EPA and NHTSA, working in concert with California's ARB, formally announced a proposed national program establishing Phase 2 of the GHG emissions and fuel efficiency standards for medium- and heavy-duty vehicles for model-year 2018 and beyond. In August 2016, the EPA and NHTSA announced the final rule regarding Phase 2, which builds upon Phase 1, and would apply to certain trailer types beginning with model-year 2018 for EPA standards (voluntary for NHTSA standards through model-year 2020). Tractors and certain trailer types would be subject to the Phase 2 standards beginning with model-year 2021, increasing in stringency through model-year 2024, and phasing in completely by model-year 2027. This rule marks the first time federal mandates will be applied to trailers, with respect to aerodynamics and low-rolling resistance tires. The final rule was effective December 27, 2016. 

In October 2017, the EPA announced a proposal to repeal the Phase 2 Standards as they relate to gliders (which mix refurbished older components, including transmissions and pre-emission-rule engines, with a new frame, cab, steer axle, wheels, and other standard equipment). Additionally, implementation of the Phase 2 Standards as they relate to trailers has been delayed due to a provisional stay granted in October 2017 by the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, which is overseeing a case against the EPA by the Truck Trailer Manufacturers Association, Inc. regarding the Phase 2 Standards. If the glider provisions are removed from the Phase 2 standards, there would be no direct effect on our results of operations. If the trailer provisions of the Phase 2 Standards are permanently removed, we would expect a lessened impact on our operations.
We believe the EPA and NHTSA GHG requirements will result in additional increases in new tractor and trailer prices and additional parts and maintenance costs incurred to retrofit our tractors and trailers with technology to achieve compliance with such standards, which could adversely affect our operating results and profitability, particularly if such costs are not offset by potential fuel savings. We cannot predict, however, the extent to which our operations and productivity will be impacted. 
Climate-change Proposals
Federal and state lawmakers are considering a variety of other climate-change proposals related to carbon emissions and GHG emissions. The proposals could potentially limit carbon emissions for certain states and municipalities, which continue to restrict the location and amount of time that diesel-powered tractors (like ours) may idle. 
These restrictions could force us to purchase on-board power units that do not require the engine to idle or to alter our drivers' behavior, which could result in a decrease in productivity, or increase in driving associate turnover.

Industry Regulation

Our operations are regulated and licensed by various federal, state, and local government agencies in North America, including the DOT, the FMCSA, and the United States Department of Homeland Security, among others. Our company, as well as our driving associates and independent contractors, must comply with enacted governmental regulations regarding safety, equipment, and operating methods. Examples include regulation of equipment weight, equipment dimensions, driver hours-of-service, driver eligibility requirements, on-board reporting of operations, and ergonomics. The following discussion presents recently enacted federal, state, and local regulations that have an impact on our operations.
Hours-of-service
From time to time, the FMCSA proposes and implements changes to regulations impacting hours-of-service. Such changes can negatively impact our productivity and affect our operations and profitability by reducing the number of hours per day or week our drivers may operate and/or disrupting our network. No such changes are currently proposed. However, any future changes to hours-of-service regulations could materially and adversely affect our operations and profitability.
Safety and Fitness Ratings
There are currently two methods of evaluating the safety and fitness of carriers: CSA BASICS, which evaluates and ranks fleets on certain safety-related standards by analyzing data from recent safety events and investigation results, and DOT SafeStat, which is based on an on-site investigation and affects a carrier's ability to operate in interstate commerce. Additionally, the FMCSA has proposed rules in the past that would change the methodologies used to determine carrier safety and fitness. 
DOT SafeStat — SafeStat is currently the only safety measurement system in effect. Both Knight and Swift currently have a satisfactory SafeStat DOT rating, which is the best available rating under the current safety rating scale. If we were to receive a conditional or unsatisfactory DOT safety rating, it could adversely affect our business, as some of our existing customer contracts require a satisfactory DOT safety rating.
CSA BASICs — In December 2010, the FMCSA introduced an enforcement and compliance model that ranks on seven categories of safety-related data. The seven categories of safety-related data, known as BASICs, currently include Unsafe Driving, Fatigued Driving (hours-of-service), Driver Fitness, Controlled Substances/Alcohol, Vehicle Maintenance, Hazardous Materials Compliance, and Crash Indicator.  Carriers are grouped by category with other carriers that have a similar number of safety events (i.e. crashes, inspections, or violations) and carriers are ranked and assigned a rating percentile or score to prioritize them for interventions if they are above a certain threshold.  
Certain CSA BASICs information was initially published and made available to carriers, as well as the general public. However, in December 2015, as part of the Fixing America's Surface Transportation ("FAST") Act, Congress mandated that the FMCSA remove all CSA scores from public view until a more comprehensive study regarding the effectiveness of CSA BASICs improving truck safety could be completed. During this period of review by the FMCSA, we will continue to have access to our own scores and will still be subject to intervention by the FMCSA when such scores are above the intervention thresholds. The study was conducted and delivered to the FMCSA in June 2017 with several recommendations to make the CSA program more fair, accurate, and reliable. The FMCSA is expected to provide its report to Congress in early 2018 outlining the changes it will make to the CSA program in response to the study.
It is unclear if, when, and to what extent any such changes will occur. However, any changes that increase the likelihood of us receiving unfavorable scores could adversely affect our results of operations and profitability.
CSA BASICS scores do not currently have a direct impact on a carrier's safety rating.  However, the occurrence of unfavorable scores in one or more categories may affect driving associate recruiting and retention by causing qualified driving associates to seek employment with other carriers, cause our customers to direct their business away from us and to carriers with higher fleet rankings, subjecting us to an increase in compliance reviews and roadside inspections, or causing us to incur greater than expected expenses in our attempts to improve unfavorable scores, any of which could adversely affect our results of operations and profitability.

Safety Fitness Determination — In January 2016, the FMCSA published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking ("NPRM") in the Federal Register, regarding carrier safety fitness determination. The NPRM proposed new methodologies that would have determined when a motor carrier was not fit to operate a commercial motor vehicle. Key proposed changes that were included in the NPRM are as follows:

• | There would be only one safety rating of "unfit," as compared to the current rules, which have three safety ratings (satisfactory, conditional, and unsatisfactory).


• | Carriers could be determined "unfit" by failing two or more BASICs, investigation results, or a combination of the two.


• | Stricter standards would be used for BASICs with a higher correlation to crash risk (Unsafe Driving and Hours-of-Service Compliance).


• | All investigation results would be used, not just results from comprehensive on-site reviews.


• | Violations of a revised list of "critical" and "acute" safety regulations would result in failing a BASIC.


• | Carriers would be assessed monthly.

Public comments on the proposed rule were due in June 2016 and several industry groups and lawmakers expressed their disagreement with the proposed rule, arguing that it violates the requirements of the FAST Act and that the FMCSA must first finalize its review of the CSA scoring system. Based on this feedback and other concerns raised by industry stakeholders, in March 2017, the FMCSA withdrew the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking related to the new safety rating system. In its notice of withdrawal, the FMCSA noted that a new rulemaking related to a similar process may be initiated in the future. Therefore, it is uncertain if, when, or under what form any such rule could be implemented.
Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Bill
In July 2012, Congress passed the Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century bill into law. Included in the highway bill was a provision that mandates electronic logging devices in commercial motor vehicles to record hours-of-service. Additionally, in response to the bill, a final rule related to entry-level driver training was passed in 2016, as well as amendments to the Drug and Alcohol Clearinghouse rules.
ELD — During 2012, the FMCSA published a Supplemental NPRM, announcing its plan to proceed with the ELDs and hours-of-service supporting documents rulemaking. The ELD rule became final in December 2015, as published in the Federal Register, with an effective date of February 16, 2016. The ELD rule phases in over a four-year period: 

• | Phase 1 (February 16, 2016 through December 18, 2017): Carriers and drivers subject to the rule may voluntarily use ELDs or use other forms of logging devices.


• | Phase 2 (December 18, 2017 through December 16, 2019): Carriers and drivers subject to the rule can use Automatic On-board Recording Devices ("AOBRD") that were installed prior to December 18, 2017 or ELDs certified and registered after December 16, 2015.


• | Phase 3 (after December 16, 2019): All drivers and carriers subject to the rule must use certified and registered ELDs that comply with the requirements of the ELD regulations.

Although the final ELD rule may have a large impact on the industry as a whole, we have not experienced an adverse impact on Knight-Swift, as we previously installed ELDs in our operational trucks in conjunction with our efforts to improve efficiency and communications with driving associates and independent contractors. However, we believe that more effective hours-of-service enforcement under the ELD Rule may improve our competitive position by causing all carriers to adhere more closely to hours-of-service requirements.
Entry-Level Driver Training — In December 2016, the FMCSA established new minimum training standards for certain individuals applying for (or upgrading) a Class A or Class B commercial driver's license, or obtaining a hazardous materials, passenger, or school bus endorsement on their commercial driver's license for the first time. These individuals are subject to the Entry-level driver training requirements and must complete a prescribed program of theory and behind-the wheel instruction. The final rule requires that behind-the-wheel proficiency of an entry-level truck driver be determined solely by the instructor's evaluation of how well the driver-trainee performs the fundamental vehicle controls skills and driving procedures set forth in the curricula, but does not have a minimum training hours requirement, as proposed by the FMCSA earlier in 2016. The final rule went into effect on February 6, 2017, with a compliance date of February 7, 2020. Upon the compliance date, training schools will be required to register with the FMCSA's Training Provider Registry and certify that their program meets the classroom and driving standards. The effect of this rule could result in a decrease in fleet production and driver availability, either of which could adversely affect our business or operations.

Commercial Driver's License Drug and Alcohol Clearinghouse — In December 2016, the FMCSA amended the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations to establish requirements of the Commercial Driver's License Drug and Alcohol Clearinghouse, a database under its administration that will contain information about violations of the FMCSA's drug and alcohol testing program for holders of commercial driver's licenses. In addition to requiring employers to check the database for driver applicant drug and alcohol test failures, the final rule requires employers to check the database to determine whether current employees have incurred a drug or alcohol violation that would prohibit them from performing safety-sensitive functions. The final rule became effective on January 4, 2017, with a compliance date of January 6, 2020. Upon implementation, the rule may reduce the number of available drivers in an already constrained driver market.
Prohibiting Coercion of Commercial Motor Vehicle Drivers
In November 2015, the Prohibiting Coercion of Commercial Motor Vehicle Drivers rule became final, as published in the Federal Register and adopted by the FMCSA. The rule explicitly prohibits motor carriers from coercing drivers to violate certain FMCSA regulations, including driver hours-of-service limits, Commercial Drivers' License regulations, drug and alcohol testing rules, and hazardous materials regulations, among others. Under the rule, drivers can report incidents of coercion to the FMCSA, who is authorized to issue penalties against the motor carrier. We have not experienced any significant impacts from this rule.
Speed Limiting Devices
In September 2016, the NHTSA and FMCSA proposed regulations that would require speed limiting devices on vehicles with a gross vehicle weight rating of more than 26,000 pounds for the service life of the vehicle. The speed was expected to be limited to 62, 65, or 68, but ultimately would have been be set by the final rule. Based on the agencies' review of the available data, limiting the speed of these heavy vehicles would reduce the severity of crashes involving these vehicles and reduce the resulting injuries and fatalities. Public comments on the proposed rule were due in November 2016, and in July 2017, the DOT announced that it would no longer pursue a speed limiter rule, but left open the possibility that it could resume such a pursuit in the future. The effect of this rule, to the extent it became effective, could result in a decrease in fleet production and driver availability, either of which could adversely affect our business or operations.
For safety, we electronically govern the speed of substantially all of our company tractors. Additionally, our independent contractor agreements include statements that independent contractors must comply with the Company's speed policy.
Food Safety Modernization Act of 2011 ("FSMA")
In April 2016, the Food and Drug Administration published a final rule establishing requirements for shippers, loaders, carriers by motor vehicle and rail vehicle, and receivers engaged in the transportation of food, to use sanitary transportation practices to ensure the safety of the food they transport as part of the FSMA.  This rule sets forth requirements related to:

• | the design and maintenance of equipment used to transport food,


• | the measures taken during food transportation to ensure food safety,


• | the training of carrier personnel in sanitary food transportation practices, and


• | maintenance and retention of records of written procedures, agreements, and training related to the foregoing items.

These requirements took effect for larger carriers such as us in April 2017 and are also applicable when we perform as a carrier or as a broker. We believe we have been in compliance with these requirement since that time. However, if we are found to be in violation of applicable laws or regulations related to the FSMA, we could be subject to substantial fines, penalties and/or criminal liability, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

Legislation Regarding Independent Contractors
Tax and other regulatory authorities have sought in the past to assert that independent contractors in the trucking industry are employees rather than independent contractors.  Federal legislators continue to introduce legislation concerning the classification of independent contractors as employees, including legislation that proposes to increase the tax and labor penalties against employers who intentionally or unintentionally misclassify employees as independent contractors and are found to have violated employees' overtime or wage requirements.  Additionally, federal legislators have sought to:

• | abolish the current safe harbor allowing taxpayers meeting certain criteria to treat individuals as independent contractors if they are following a long-standing, recognized practice,


• | extend the FLSA to independent contractors, and


• | impose notice requirements based upon employment or independent contractor status and fines for failure to comply.

Some states have adopted initiatives to increase their revenues from items such as unemployment, workers' compensation, and income taxes, and we believe a reclassification of independent contractors as employees would help states with this initiative.  Federal and state taxing and other regulatory authorities and courts apply a variety of standards in their determination of independent contractor status. 
Further, class actions and other lawsuits have been filed against us and other members of our industry seeking to reclassify independent contractors as employees for a variety of purposes, including workers' compensation and health care coverage. Our defense of such class actions and other lawsuits has not always been successful, and we have been subject to adverse judgments with respect to such matters.  If our independent contractors were determined to be our employees, we would incur additional exposure under federal and state tax, workers' compensation, unemployment benefits, labor, employment, and tort laws, which could potentially include prior periods, as well as potential liability for employee benefits and tax withholdings.  We currently observe and monitor our compliance with current related and applicable laws and regulations, but we cannot predict whether laws and regulations adopted in the future regarding the classification of our independent contractors will adversely affect our business or operations.

Other Regulation

Executive Order
The regulatory environment has changed under the administration of President Trump.  In January 2017, the President signed an executive order requiring federal agencies to repeal two regulations for each new one they propose and imposing a regulatory budget, which would limit the amount of new regulatory costs federal agencies can impose on individuals and businesses each year.  We do not believe the order has had a significant impact on our industry. However, the order, and other anti-regulatory action by the President and/or Congress, may inhibit future new regulations and/or lead to the repeal or delayed effectiveness of existing regulations. Therefore, it is uncertain how we may be impacted in the future by existing, proposed, or repealed regulations. 
The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act
On December 22, 2017, the United States enacted significant changes to its tax law following the passage and signing of H.R.1, "An Act to Provide for Reconciliation Pursuant to Titles II and V of the Concurrent Resolution on the Budget for Fiscal Year 2018" (previously known as "The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act"). The new tax law is complex and includes various changes which may impact the Company. See Note 14 in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report for further details, including the financial impact on the Company.
