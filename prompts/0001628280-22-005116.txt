ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Our Mission
To Build Healthier Communities by Connecting People to Real Food
Overview
Sweetgreen, Inc., a Delaware corporation (together with its subsidiaries, “sweetgreen”, “we”, “us” or the “Company”) is a mission-driven, next generation restaurant and lifestyle brand that serves healthy food at scale. Our bold vision is to be as ubiquitous as traditional fast food, but with the transparency and quality that consumers increasingly expect. As of December 26, 2021, we owned and operated 150 restaurants in 13 states and Washington, D.C.
Our Food Ethos
We believe the choices we make about what we eat, where it comes from and how it is prepared have a direct impact on our health, our communities and the planet. This is our Food Ethos, and it is firmly rooted in every aspect of our business. At sweetgreen, we only serve Real Food, which for us means:
•Plant-forward
•Celebrates seasonality
•Made fresh in our restaurants
•Prioritizes organic, regenerative, and local sourcing
•Meets strict and humane animal welfare and seafood standards
•Free of highly-processed preservatives, artificial flavors, and refined or hidden sugars
•Mindful of the carbon impact of each ingredient to protect future generations
This commitment to our Food Ethos keeps our food delicious, nutrient dense and sustainable. At sweetgreen, Real Food tastes better, makes you feel better, and drives the frequency that has defined our success.
Our Menu Offering
We have designed our menu to be delicious, customizable and convenient to empower our customers to make healthier choices for both lunch and dinner. We are constantly seeking ways to enhance our menu, all while honoring our Food Ethos. 
Our Core Menu
•Our core menu features 11 curated, signature items which are offered year-round in all of our locations.
•In addition to our core menu items, our single most popular item is the “custom” salad or bowl, which can include millions of combinations from 40-plus ingredients prepared fresh in each of our restaurants every day, as well as our made-from-scratch dressings.
•We keep our menu fresh by curating a smaller seasonal menu five times per year. We believe our seasonal menu rotation, which celebrates the strength of our regional supply chain by highlighting 
7


fresh local ingredients, increases order frequency by introducing new flavor combinations for our customers to sample.
•On our Owned Digital Channels, we offer exclusive menu items, including seasonal digital exclusives and curated “collections” relevant to each customer. 
Our Supply Chain
We have built a differentiated, end-to-end supply chain that begins with more than 200 domestic food partners, such as farmers and bakers, and culminates in delicious, high-quality food for our customers. Consistent with our Food Ethos, we prioritize ingredients that are certified organic, regenerative, or locally sourced, and meet strict and humane animal welfare and seafood standards. We build direct relationships with our farmers and growers and we are proud to showcase them on the walls of every restaurant and spotlight them on our digital platform. Our national supply chain is organized into regional distribution networks that align retail proximity with cultivation, while also making it easy to leverage existing relationships as we enter new markets in that region. 
Quality Control and Food Safety
At sweetgreen, we refer to food safety as our “license to operate.” For sweetgreen, food safety starts with our food supply. All of our suppliers provide appropriate food safety certification and third-party audits as part of the onboarding process. After onboarding, we work closely with our suppliers to ensure they adhere to our product quality specifications. We also follow a Comprehensive Food Safety Plan (“CFSP”), which includes our Approved Supplier Program, Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points Program, guidelines for restaurant design, construction and maintenance, new product commercialization processes, and crisis management. As part of our CFSP, we have a set of “sweet clean standards” in each of our restaurants, which are guides for operators to ensure our approach to food safety is consistent and scalable across our restaurant fleet. Food safety is an integral element of our field leadership bonus plan; our operators do not receive certain bonuses unless they meet our food safety thresholds for the relevant period. On top of our CFSP sits a system of verification, audits, and monitoring to ensure our food safety is not compromised.
Our Real Estate
We opened 31 domestic, company-owned restaurants in fiscal year 2021 and plan to approximately double our current footprint of restaurants over the next three to five years with a goal of operating 1,000 restaurants by the end of the decade. As we continue to expand, we are confident that our compelling restaurant-level economics will continue to work across geographies and market types. 
We utilize a rigorous, data-driven real estate selection process to identify new restaurant sites with both high anticipated foot traffic and proximity to workplaces and residences that support our multi-channel approach. We have incorporated additional capacity, including secondary lines, in the majority of our restaurants so they can flex to handle fluctuations in order volumes.
We are constantly testing new restaurant design concepts to densify our markets and to bring sweetgreen into a wider variety of neighborhoods. We have thoughtfully designed all of our restaurants to both reflect the culture and feel of our local communities and to support our multiple digital channels. For instance, we recently added exterior pick-up windows as well as curbside pick-up at several locations. We continue to explore other design features and real estate formats, such as smaller format digital-only fulfillment restaurants and drive-thru and drive-up ordering concepts in more suburban markets. 
Our Technology
Our Customer-Facing Digital Platform
We have a five-channel model that is designed to make it easy for our customers to order sweetgreen how they want, whenever they want.
8


Pick-Up.    Customers place their order through our mobile app or website and pick it up from their chosen sweetgreen location at the time most convenient for them.
Native Delivery.    We launched our Native Delivery Channel in January 2020, and believe it offers a superior customer experience to our Marketplace Channel, with lower menu item pricing than our Marketplace Channel, greater delivery radii than our Marketplace Channel in many locations, enhanced customization features, exclusive access to our seasonal menu items and ingredients, and online exclusives and promotions.
Outpost.    Our Outpost Channel enables office workers, hospital workers, or building residents to get their custom sweetgreen order delivered directly to an outpost station at their location during a dedicated time window each day, with lower customer fees than our delivery channels. As of the end of fiscal year 2021, we had 481 live Outpost locations.
In-Store.    Despite a strategic focus on our Owned Digital Channels, our In-Store Channel is core to our platform and serves as a critical path to attract new customers via our iconic physical locations. Customers can pay digitally using the “scan-to-pay” feature on our mobile app, which can provide customers access to certain digital-only promotions.
Marketplace.    Our Marketplace Channel often serves as an effective means to reach new digital customers who have not used our native mobile app or website before. We then aim to convert Marketplace customers to our digital platform.
For fiscal year 2021, 46.1% of our revenue was from our Owned Digital Channels. When including orders placed on our Marketplace Channel, this digital share increases to 67.4% of our fiscal year 2021 revenue. The convenience of our multi-channel approach, combined with our ability to offer personalized content and recommendations, results in a highly engaged cohort of habitual sweetgreen customers. Not only are our owned digital users our most frequent customers, but the average order value (which is the dollar value of an order exclusive of taxes and any fees paid by the customer) for orders placed on our Owned Digital Channels is significantly higher than Non-Digital orders placed through our In-Store Channel.
Proprietary Technology Powers our Operations at Scale
In addition to our customer-facing digital platform, we have also invested in technology to support our back of house operations and simplify the work of our team members. These investments include leveraging systems that manage daily inventory in our restaurants to ensure freshness, guides prep work, optimizes our meal assembly process, and manages our team members’ output to enhance our order fulfillment times.
Our Marketing Strategy
Our brand is designed to inspire consumers to live healthier lives without compromising their values. Our goal is to connect food and culture to amplify our mission both in our restaurants and on our digital platform. We use a carefully crafted combination of brand, retail and performance marketing to build awareness and generate sales. In October 2021, we were named as one of Fast Company’s Brands That Matter, which recognized companies and nonprofits that have had an undeniable impact on business and culture.
Since inception, we have collaborated with some of the world’s best chefs, athletes, musicians and thought leaders in our communities to help us amplify the power of healthy food. During fiscal year 2021 we announced our partnership with Naomi Osaka. Naomi is sweetgreen’s first ever national athlete ambassador and youngest investor. Together, our goal is to shift the paradigm of food sponsorships and create a positive impact on how the next generation connects to healthy eating. 
In order to drive customers from awareness to consideration to conversion, we have invested in robust customer relationship management capabilities and paid media strategies across search, social media, and search engine optimization, as well as implemented mobile push notifications through our app. Our investment in a sophisticated marketing technology stack enables us to better understand our customers—how they first discover sweetgreen, what they order, and what makes them return. We also use our restaurants, which are the face of our brand and a powerful acquisition tool for new customers, as a canvas to execute national brand

campaigns, seasonal menu launches, and local promotions to maintain the direct relationship with our customers.
Our People. 
Our Team and Culture
Our approach to team and culture is consistent with one of our core values of “Win, Win, Win”. We believe that obsessing over the team member experience is a “win” for our team members, our customers, and our company. We benefit from the ability to attract and retain the best talent, and from having team members that are motivated to deliver an exceptional experience to our customers. We hire team members who are passionate about our purpose and strive to maintain a friendly, fun, and positive work environment. We pay competitive wages and believe we offer best-in-class benefits relative to the industry, including medical, dental, and vision insurance for eligible employees and their spouses or domestic partners, 401K matching, paid time off, paid parental leave, and equity incentives for our Head Coaches. In October 2021, we were ranked 18th by Newsweek in their Top 100 Most Loved Workplaces rankings.
Our Restaurant Team Structure and the Pathway to Opportunity
We believe we have designed a transparent and structured career learning path. By providing opportunities for advancement, professional development, and ultimately leadership, we have been able to promote high-performing talent and by extension scale our sweetgreen culture. At sweetgreen, the best leaders come from within—we develop a talent-rich pipeline by having a clear promotional track for team members to become a Head Coach (our title for a store manager) within as few as three years. 
Commitment to Diversity and Inclusion
We are committed to holding ourselves accountable to have gender and ethnic representation at all levels of our organization. Specifically, we have an internal Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (“DEI”) council and have an associated set of DEI-related goals that have been embedded into our leadership principles. We also require annual DEI training for all Senior Leaders, People Managers, Individual Contributors, and Field Leadership. In July 2021, we were named in Mogul’s Top 100 Workplaces with the Greatest Diversity & Inclusion Initiatives.
Employees
As of December 26, 2021, we had a total of 4,877 employees, 363 of whom worked at our sweetgreen Support Center and 4,514 of whom worked in our restaurants.
Our Impact
Our mission to build healthier communities by connecting people to real food also extends to our goal of building a healthier and more equitable society. Below are just a few select examples of the many ways in which we contribute to our local communities:
•Donations from New Restaurant Openings: For every meal sold on the opening day of each of our new restaurants, we provide a meal-for-meal donation to a local food access non-profit partner to help alleviate food insecurity in the community. These opening day donations, which typically amount to around 600 meals on average per new restaurant, are the beginning of a long-term relationship with our local communities.
•Impact Outpost: Connecting Hospitals to Real Food: At the onset of COVID-19, we pivoted our entire Outpost operation to deliver free sweetgreen meals to frontline healthcare heroes. We also partnered with Chef Jose Andres’ non-profit, World Central Kitchen, to create the Impact Outpost Fund to provide even more meals to hospital workers and medical personnel. From April 2020 through August 2020, we raised over $2.5 million and provided close to 400,000 meals to frontline hospital heroes via our Impact Outpost program.
10


•Increasing Access to Real Food: We have provided funding over the last several years to various non-profits to expand access to real food by supporting programs that double SNAP benefits, also known as Food Stamps, at farmers’ markets. We have partnered with organizations across the nation, including SEE-LA (Los Angeles, CA), Green City Market (Chicago, IL), Freshfarm (Washington, D.C.), About Fresh (Boston, MA), and Urban Harvest (Houston, TX).
Competition
We face significant competition from restaurants in the fast-casual dining and traditional fast-food segments of the restaurant industry. These segments are highly competitive with respect to, among other things, taste, price, food quality and presentation, service, location, and the ambience and condition of each restaurant. Our competition includes a variety of locally owned restaurants and national and regional chains offering dine-in, carry-out, delivery, and catering services. Many of our competitors have existed longer and have a more established market presence with substantially greater financial, marketing, personnel, and other resources than we do, and as a result, these competitors may be better positioned to succeed in the highly competitive restaurant industry. Among our competitors are a number of multi-unit, multi-market, fast-food, or fast-casual restaurant concepts, some of which are expanding nationally, including companies like Chipotle, McDonald's, Panera Bread, and Shake Shack, as well as other quick service salad and health food concepts.
As we expand into new geographic markets and further develop our digital channels (including our Owned Digital Channels), we will face competition from these restaurants as well as new competitors that strive to compete with our market segments, particularly as many of our competitors have increased their digital presence to better navigate the COVID-19 pandemic, including by enabling delivery and take-out through their digital applications. In particular, we will face increasing competition from delivery kitchens, food aggregators and food delivery marketplaces (such as DoorDash, GrubHub, Uber Eats, and others), grocery stores (particularly those that focus on freshly prepared and organic food), and other companies that are enabling the delivery of food to customers, including delivery marketplaces that we partner with to deliver sweetgreen food to customers. These food delivery marketplaces own the customer data for sweetgreen orders placed on such marketplaces and may use such customer data to encourage these customers to order from other restaurants on their marketplaces. Competition from food aggregators and food delivery marketplaces has also increased in recent years, particularly with the significant increase in restaurants that previously focused on dine-in service and have increased their reliance on take-out or delivery during the COVID-19 pandemic, and competition is expected to continue to increase. Any of these competitors may have, among other things, greater operational or financial resources, lower operating costs, better locations, better facilities, better management, better digital technology, increased automation and production efficiency, more effective marketing, and more efficient operations. Additionally, we face the risk that new or existing competitors will copy, and potentially improve upon, our business model, menu options, technology, presentation, or ambience, among other things.
Trademarks and Other Intellectual Property
We protect our intellectual property primarily through a combination of trademarks, domain names, copyrights, and trade secrets. Since our inception, we have undertaken to strategically and proactively develop our trademark portfolio by registering our trademarks and service marks in the United States and various strategic foreign jurisdictions. Domestically, we registered our core marks (“sweetgreen,” “SG,” and the sweetgreen logo) and certain other marks, such as “SG Outpost” and “sweetgreen Outpost.” Internationally, we currently have registered our core sweetgreen and SG marks, along with selected other marks, in foreign jurisdictions including Australia, Canada, China, the European Union, Hong Kong, Japan, Mexico, South Korea, and the United Kingdom. These marks are registered in multiple international trademark classes, including for restaurant services and related goods and services. We are currently pursuing additional trademark and trade dress registrations in the United States and abroad and will continue to pursue additional trademark registrations to the extent we believe they would be beneficial and cost-effective. Additionally, as a result of the acquisition of Spyce, we have two issued patents and five patent applications pending in the United States, and one issued patent in the People’s Republic of China. We intend to pursue additional patent protection (including in respect of Spyce’s automation technology) to the extent we believe it would be beneficial and cost-effective. We have obtained a registration of the sweetgreen.com domain name as well.

We have procedures in place to monitor for potential infringement of our intellectual property, and it is our policy to take appropriate action to enforce our intellectual property, taking into account the strength of our claim, likelihood of success, cost, and overall business priorities.
Government Regulation
We are subject to various federal, state, and local regulations, including those relating to building and zoning requirements, public health and safety and the preparation and sale of food. The development and operation of restaurants depends to a significant extent on the selection and acquisition of suitable sites, which are subject to zoning, land use, environmental, traffic, and other regulations and requirements. Our restaurants are also subject to state and local licensing and regulation by health, sanitation, food and occupational safety, and other agencies, which regulation has increased in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. We may experience material difficulties or failures in obtaining the necessary licenses, approvals or permits for our restaurants, which could delay planned restaurant openings or affect the operations at our existing restaurants. In addition, stringent and varied requirements of local regulators with respect to zoning, land use, and environmental factors could delay or prevent development of new restaurants in particular locations.
Our operations are subject to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Act, which governs worker health and safety, as well as rules and regulations regarding COVID-19, the U.S. Fair Labor Standards Act, which governs such matters as minimum wages and overtime, and a variety of similar federal, state and local laws (such as fair work week laws, immigration laws, various wage & hour laws, termination and discharge laws, and state occupational safety regulations) that govern these and other employment law matters. We may also be subject to lawsuits or investigations from our current or former employees, the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, the Department of Labor, or others alleging violations of federal and state laws regarding workplace and employment matters, discrimination and similar matters, and we have been a party to a number of such matters in the past. These lawsuits and investigations require significant resources from our senior management and can result in material fines, penalties and/or settlements, some or all of which may not be covered by insurance, as well as significant remediation efforts that may be costly and time consuming, and which we may not implement effectively.
We are also subject to the Americans with Disabilities Act (the “ADA”) and similar state laws that give civil rights protections to individuals with disabilities in the context of employment, public accommodations and other areas, including our restaurants, website, and smartphone applications. In the past, we have settled various lawsuits related to our alleged ADA non-compliance, which resulted in accommodations to our website, smartphone applications and physical restaurant locations.
Seasonality
Our revenue fluctuates as a result of seasonal factors. Historically, our revenue is lower in the first and fourth quarters of the year due, in part, to the holiday season and the fact that fewer people eat out during periods of inclement weather (the winter months) than during periods of mild to warm weather (the spring, summer, and fall months). In addition, a core part of our menu, salads, has proven to be more popular among consumers in the warmer months.
Privacy, Data Protection, and Data Security
Because our business and platform involve the collection, use, storage, and transmission of personal information, we are subject to numerous laws, regulations, industry standards, and other obligations relating to privacy, data protection, and data security. Such laws, regulations, and industry standards may include Section 5(a) of the Federal Trade Commission Act, the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991 and all regulations promulgated thereunder, the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, the California Privacy Rights Act of 2020, and the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard. We are also affected by the policies of third-party application stores on which our mobile application depends. Our compliance with our obligations related to privacy, data protection, and data security is important to improving user experience on the platform and building user trust. Countries around the world have adopted or are proposing similar laws and regulations relating to privacy, data protection, and data security, and we may become subject to them as we expand our operations into new geographic markets. For example, if we expand our operations to Europe, we would 
12


become subject to the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation, the Privacy and Electronic Communications Directive (2002/58/EC), and the data protection laws of the member states of the European Union, United Kingdom, and Switzerland, as applicable.
