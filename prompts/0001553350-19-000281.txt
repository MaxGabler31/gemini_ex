Characteristics of our FireIce® Product
FireIce® is the registered trade name of our line of fire suppression products. The FireIce® products consist of dry powders that when added to water in very low concentrations, rapidly absorb water to produce a gel whose viscosity depends on the selected concentration. The dry powder can be easily mixed with water. Within seconds of being mixed with water, FireIce® products are ready to use, almost instantaneously becoming a fire preventing, heat absorbing and fire suppressing gel. In many applications the gel forms a cohesive layer which acts as a vapor barrier prolonging the effectiveness of the water. Due to the gel layer created by FireIce® products on burning and adjacent objects, FireIce® products also have the ability to suffocate a fire. 
 
FireIce® products have the following properties. They are:
 
·
 non-toxic,
 
·
 environmentally safe,
 
·
 less corrosive to metals,
 

1


·
 mix easily with water,
 
·
 reduce the threat of a fire rekindling,

·
 have superior vertical adhesion ability for structure / exposure protection,
 
·
 extinguish fires more rapidly than traditional methods, and
 
·
 are lighter when mixed with water than competing products thus reducing airframe stress in aerial applications.

Industry Segments

Wildland Agencies 

The United States Forest Service (the Forest Service) operating under the Department of Agriculture and the Department of the Interior are responsible for protecting most federal lands from wildland fires. For their fiscal year ending September 30, 2019, approximately $4.8 billion has been appropriated to the Forest Service and the Department of the Interior for the purpose of protecting federal lands from wildland fires, which includes approximately $1.2 billion to be used in the suppression of wildland fires.
 
FireIce® is used to combat wildland fires in several ways. Our product is dropped from airplanes either directly on wildland fires to extinguish them or it is dropped in the path of an advancing wildland fire to create a firebreak or to protect property. Aerial applications utilize FireIce® which is offered in several colored variations, designed to be visible from the air. Two of the colorants, a Fugitive Orange (Sunset Orange) and a Fugitive Blue (Cool Blue) are on the Forest Service Qualified Product List (QPL). The colored products are designed specifically for wildland applications, and compete with existing long-term retardant products that are on the market. In addition, wildland firefighters can use our non-colored FireIce®561 product to fight wildland fires on the ground or in direct attack from the air. 

Recognizing the potential for FireIce® and the tremendous marketplace for aerial firefighting in conjunction with the Federal and State forestry agencies, GelTech applied and has been listed on the QPL List since March 2012. Inclusion on the QPL List qualifies our product for use to fight brush and wildland fires on Federal lands, including the Department of Agriculture and Department of Interior. Under the terms of our approval by the Forest Service, FireIce® may be deployed for use on wildland fires except in fixed-tank helicopters and multi-engine planes. 

In addition, since 2014, FireIce® has been used by state agencies to suppress wildland fires in 18 states, and has been used by provincial agencies in two provinces in Canada. During 2018, sales to wildland agencies accounted for approximately 43.2% of our revenues.

The FireIce HVO-F product, which is not on the QPL List, is currently being used by state and provincial agencies is a formulation that includes the product, FireIce 561 that is listed on the QPL, plus additional compounds to improve the visibility and performance of the product. The FireIce HVO-F product produced by the Company is a next generation line of product which is superior to FireIce 561, the Companys QPL listed product formulation. 

In December 2018, the Company entered into a new collection agreement with the Forest Service under which the Company is submitting a new mixed colored product for inclusion on the QPL list. The Forest Service has agreed to test the new formulation on an expedited basis and, upon the successful completion of certain toxicity testing, will allow this new product to be used to combat wildland fires on federal land on an experimental basis until such time as the remainder of their testing can be completed. This would allow our new product to be used on federal land beginning in the summer of 2019.

In 2018, in an effort to broaden our product offerings to the wildland market, the Company became a distributor of FireIce Polar Eco-fom, a Class A foam that is currently listed on the QPL and is manufactured in Sweden. During 2018, sales of FireIce Polar Eco-Fom accounted for approximately 1.1% of our revenues.

Municipal Agencies

Municipal Agencies use FireIce® in multiple ways. FireIce® is educted (mixed on the fly), using our patented FireIce® eductor, directly into firelines utilizing pumper trucks or fire hydrants to either be sprayed directly on structural fires to suppress them or sprayed on adjacent structures to protect them. In addition, FireIce® is also deployed from FireIce® Class A UL Rated fire extinguishers to combat fires in close quarters. 

In September 2015, the Company entered into an exclusive distribution agreement with FireIce Solutions, LLC (FireIce Solutions) to sell FireIce® and its related equipment to municipal fire departments and first responders in the United States. GelTech waived the minimum purchase requirements for year one and two in order for FireIce Solutions to maintain its exclusivity. In September 2018, the Company informed FireIce Solutions that they failed to meet the minimum sales required to maintain their exclusivity. As such FireIce Solutions remains a distributor but on a nonexclusive basis. During 2018, sales of FireIce® and FireIce Shield® to this distributor represented 10.5% of our revenues. 

Power Utilities

According to a Harris Williams & Co. 2010 White Paper, power companies will invest between $1.5 and $2.0 billion in transmission and distribution infrastructure through 2030 to meet the growing demand for electrical power. The low voltage electricity transmission infrastructure includes approximately 64 million utility poles spanning 2.1 million overhead transmission miles and 1.1 million manholes servicing 66,000 underground transmission miles according to a February 2013 article in PowerGrid International magazine. FireIce® can be instrumental in protecting this infrastructure investment and in the process provide a safer work environment for utility workers. FireIce® is used by utility companies to protect wooden utility poles and surrounding property either by coating the poles during routine right-of-way controlled burn maintenance or by extinguishing poles that have ignited. To date these utilities have accomplished these tasks using FireIce® UL rated fire extinguishers which are rated for use on Class A combustibles such as wood, paper, plastic, cloth and the products derived from these materials. 

We have performed research and development in conjunction with three Northeastern utility companies (Northeast Utilities), to develop a preferred solution to combat or prevent fires in underground utility structures (manholes). This led to the development of the EMFIDS and EMFIDS II (collectively, the EMFIDS) which are innovative systems designed to deliver a mixture of FireIce® and water into a manhole. This stream of FireIce® and water is intended to coat the ladder and the utility worker in the event of an incident involving an explosion or fire in the manhole while utility workers are performing routine repairs or maintenance. The unit has been designed by GelTech to be quickly set up and disassembled by utility crews. EMFIDS delivers FireIce® from custom designed strategically located spray nozzles. The FireIce® and water mixture is contained in a pressurized tank which is mounted to the utility companys maintenance vehicle and is connected to the unit by one hose; that connects to the spray device which is deployed inside the manhole. EMFIDS can be activated either manually by pressing an activation button on the control panel located in the maintenance vehicle, automatically by either a heat sensor located near the opening to the manhole or an arc sensor positioned inside the manhole. Once activated, the system is designed to deliver FireIce® continuously for at least one minute. The main purpose of EMFIDS is to maintain the integrity of the ladder in the manhole and to coat the utility worker with FireIce®, providing the worker the opportunity to escape the manhole thereby improving the workers chance for survival. We sold one of these units in 2018 and have begun marketing the EMFIDS II units to other utility companies.

During 2018, working with an electric utility company in Texas, the Company developed and installed two fire suppression systems that were installed in the transformer rooms in a high-rise condo building. Much of the utility industrys transformer infrastructure is nearing the end of the planned useful life of the equipment. As such, they are looking for ways to extend the lives of this equipment without sacrificing safety. Consequently, we anticipate installing more of these suppression systems in the future.

Revenues from the utilities industry amounted to 24.3% of revenues during 2018.
 
Other Industries

Due to its environmentally friendly and nontoxic characteristics, FireIce® is uniquely suited to suppress and retard fires related to biomass and agricultural stockpiles that routinely spontaneously combust and easily spread. FireIce® can be sprayed directly on these fires to extinguish them and can be used to protect adjacent stockpiles. As this is a new market for our products, we are encouraged by the initial response from customers. Sales to these entities made up 6.5% of revenues during 2018.

In March 2018, the Company provided product in support of the Bahamian government in connection with the flareup of a landfill fire. Using our product and ground tactics, the Company trained the Bahamians to use during a 2017 fire, the fire was once again brought under control. We see landfill fires as a potential new source of revenue as many countries throughout the world have difficulty managing these facilities. Revenue from this event made up 2.2% of revenues during 2018. 

In 2017, we identified that FireIce® fire retardant is capable of fully extinguishing lithium ion batteries that are in full thermal runaway. Thermal runaway occurs when plastic casing allows air into the battery causing the lithium to ignite. Because most battery pack configurations consist of numerous individual lithium-ion cells, the heat from one cell catching fire generally creates a chain reaction causing all of the cells to ignite. FireIce® is able to coat the cells, depriving them of the oxygen needed for combustion and also immediately cools the affected cells reducing the potential impact on unaffected cells. We believe this will open new markets for our product with the proliferation of electric automobiles and trucks, as well as with companies that use large banks of batteries as backup power or as energy storage facilities. 

FireIce Shield®

In 2015, we began selling an asset protection product under the name FireIce Shield®. The initial product offering under this line is being marketed to plumbers and welders who use the product to protect areas in close proximity to welding or soldering. In 2016, we began selling our FireIce Shield spray bottles in an 80-store plumbing supply chain in the Northeast through FireIce Solutions. Sales of this product in 2018 represented 3.0% of total revenues. 

Communication Towers 

Companies that own communication towers are constantly performing structural maintenance, equipment upgrades and additions to improve the towers and increase revenues. This work involves cutting and welding on the tower structures which creates a high risk of setting fire to the extensive cabling within the tower, as well as, surrounding vegetation and property. These fires can result in significant property damage and loss of revenue to the tower owners. In 2015, we began working with Crown Castle, a company that owns approximately 40,000 cell phone towers, to develop a portable system to be used to spray FireIce Shield® CTP on communication towers and surrounding vegetation to protect the tower cabling and vegetation during cutting and welding. FireIce Shield® CTP is a special formulation designed to improve visibility and product adhesion. 

In September 2017, the largest contractor for communication tower maintenance, Sabre Industries, began requiring the use of FireIce Shield CTP beginning December 1, 2017. Despite this requirement, adoption of the CTP system and product has been slower than expected. During the year ended December 31, 2018, revenue from sales of FireIce Shield CTP units and product represented 1.8% of revenue. 

Industrial Manufacturing Applications

For the past few years we have been working with several industrial companies that manufacture products that are either flammable during the manufacturing process or that utilize manufacturing processes that create a high probability of fire during production. These companies have shown an interest in the use of FireIce® for the suppression and FireIce Shield® to prevent fires in areas prone to frequent fires. Sales to industrial customers represented 1.3% of revenues in 2018.
Sales and Marketing

We market and sell FireIce® and FireIce Shield® through FireIce Solutions, our non-exclusive municipal distributor, through other fire equipment distributors, online and direct marketing, wildland fire industry conferences and through our sales staff members who call on potential customers and respond to inquiries. In addition, we added a new distributor in California that has already made inroads and sales to the California Parks department. 

In July 2017, the Company hired a sales executive with 30 years of experience in the utility industry to focus on sales to both the utility industry and the communication tower industry.
 
Although not a significant focus of our marketing efforts, we recognize the opportunities that international markets provide and added a new distributor in Chile during 2017, added a new distributor in Israel in early 2018 and continue to pursue credible inquiries to sell FireIce® to certain markets overseas.

Raw Materials and Suppliers
 
The raw materials for FireIce® are in abundant supply. The base ingredients of FireIce® are manufactured by a third party and packaging is performed for us by other third parties. There are several other companies that are able to manufacture the base ingredients and there are numerous sources for the parts needed to manufacture the EMFIDS II and FireIce Shield CTP units.
Competition

The fire suppression market is highly competitive. However, we believe we will be able to compete effectively because:
 
·
 FireIce® is more effective than other fire suppressants.

·
 FireIce is the only suppression agent capable of fully extinguishing a lithium-ion battery in thermal runaway and preventing reignition.
 
·
 The price per mixed gallon of FireIce® is significantly less than our competitors products.
 
·
 The effectiveness of FireIce® to rapidly extinguish and deter rekindling, allows fire departments to put out fires faster which saves manpower and overtime costs associated with spending extra time on a fire scene.

·
 Once a fire has been extinguished, any dispensing system used to apply FireIce® can be easily cleaned with water.
 
·
 FireIce® is the only water enhancing gel that can be easily mixed and applied to fires as a suppressant.

·
 When mixed with water, FireIce® weighs less than other fire retardants/suppressants currently being used thus reducing stress on aircraft airframes and improving pilot safety. 
 
In the wildland firefighting industry, the market is made up of the numerous state and federal agencies responsible for protecting state and federal wildlands and parks. The market leader in the wildland chemicals industry is Phoschek. Because of the strong relationships Phoschek has with these agencies, many dating back to the 1960s, and the natural resistance to change, which can be even greater in the government sector, we have encountered significant resistance as we attempt to gain market share. Nonetheless, we believe that FireIce® has distinct advantages over Phoscheks products in aerial attack and ground operations. FireIce® is significantly less expensive to purchase and operate, more effective at suppressing fires, is non-corrosive to aircraft parts, is lighter than current Phoschek products thus reducing airframe stress and maximum load issues while increasing pilot safety, is not harmful to plant, fish or wildlife and has superior drop characteristics. Phoschek is classified by the Forest Service as a long-term retardant, but current tactics include using it in direct attack. FireIce® is classified by the Forest Service as a water enhancer and has been effectively used by multiple agencies in direct attack and as medium-term retardant used in indirect attack. Direct attack is when the product is dropped directly on the edge of a fire. Indirect attack is when the product is used to create a fire break in front of the fire. Some long-term retardant gels take time to dry and cure in order to create a fire break. FireIce® is ready immediately to be used on fires. Based on these factors and our successes with the state and federal agencies that have used FireIce®, we believe we will eventually overcome the competitive barriers. 

Another significant competitor is Tyco Fire & Security, a major business segment of publicly-traded Tyco International Ltd. (NYSE: TYC). Tyco Fire & Security produces ANSUL®, a premium brand of special hazard fire protection products including fire extinguishers and hand line units, pre-engineered restaurant, vehicle, and industrial systems; sophisticated fire detection/suppression systems and a complete line of dry chemical, foam, and gaseous extinguishing agents. Tyco Fire & Security is a well-funded company and has significantly more financial, marketing and sales resources than us. Ansuls main sales thrust is the installation of in building fire suppression systems, but they manufacture a wide variety of products. They also have an extensive distributor list and have a significant share of the market that we are attempting to enter.

National Foam, part of the Kidde Fire Fighting organization, is a manufacturer of foam concentrate, foam proportioning systems, fixed and portable foam firefighting equipment, monitors, nozzles and specialized big flow pumping solutions. National Foam has historically been at the forefront of foam firefighting and fire control technology and is the acknowledged world leader in providing foam-based solutions. National Foam has significant financial resources and is part of a large firefighting company conglomerate. Thus, it has significantly more financial, marketing and sales resources than we do.
 
Thermo-Gel® provides the firefighting industry with a product that can be used for structure protection, exposure protection, defensible perimeters and wet lines. This product consists of superabsorbent polymers-polyacrylamide and sodium polyacrylate, mineral oil, and surfactants, and is supplied as a liquid concentrate which is mixed in an eductor. It requires expensive specialized equipment to use. Thermo-Gel is used in fighting active fires, wildland fires, prescribed burns, aviation applications, and in the protection of all types of structures from homes to commercial and industrial investments. This product has been approved by the Forest Service. In addition to the expense of the equipment needed to use the product, ThermoGel also requires frequent agitation to remain usable, has poor drop characteristics, requires a 30-minute hydration time and is difficult to clean off of aircraft, mixing equipment and airport tarmacs. 

There are no systems comparable to EMFIDS that are readily available in the market. There are other safety products for utility workers, but none are capable of delivering fire suppression and structure protection immediately following an underground event. 

Seasonality
 
There is no real seasonality to structural fires. These occur throughout the year. In wildland fires, FireIce® use will be more likely during the warmer, drier summer months when forest and other wildland fires are more prevalent. This seasonality may be minimized if we are able to expand our distribution internationally to countries in the Southern hemisphere. 

Utility workers perform maintenance on underground vault systems throughout the year. As such, demand for EMFIDS II should be year-round, however there may be some seasonality based upon utility capital budgeting cycles. The occurrence rate for manhole fires is highest in the summer and winter months during periods of peak demand for electricity.

Dust Control 
 
Industry Overview
Dust control is vital to several industries including agriculture, construction, mining and transportation. In response to the level of dust emissions from agricultural, mining and other industries, the Environmental Protection Agency (the EPA), issued proposed rules titled National Ambient Air Quality Standards for Particulate Matter which were published in the Federal Register on June 29, 2012. These proposed rules reduce the amount of allowable dust released in the air by one-half. According to the EPAs website, dust accounts for over 25% of particle matter smaller than 2.5 micrometers in diameter, which are the major cause of reduced visibility or haze in parts of the U.S., and it accounts for over 78% of particle matter smaller than 10 micrometers in diameter, which causes respiratory related health issues. Dust also causes environmental damage such as acid rain, increased acidity in lakes and streams, depletion of nutrients in the soil and damage to sensitive forests and farm crops. In terms of agriculture, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) estimates the total annual cost of soil erosion from agriculture in the U.S. is about $44 billion per year. According to the Global Education Project, nearly one-third of the worlds cropland has been abandoned because of soil erosion and degradation over the past 40 years. 
The Products

GelTech currently sells two products for dust control, Soil₂O® “Dust Control” and Soil₂O® Soil Cap.

Soil₂O® “Dust Control”

GelTech launched Soil₂O® “Dust Control” in 2011. Soil₂O® “Dust Control” is highly effective in a variety of commercial and industrial markets with dust control and moisture retention problems including road construction sites, rock pits, unpaved roadways, landfills and coal piles. In contrast to the standard product used on gravel roads and rock pits and other dust causing surfaces, Soil₂O® “Dust Control” is environmentally friendly and requires significantly less water. Water is commonly transported to sites in large trucks. Thus, Dust Control reduces a companys carbon footprint by reducing the number of vehicle trips. In addition, fewer trips reduces labor, water and fuel costs and reduces the wear and tear on vehicles and equipment. 
Soil₂O® Soil Cap

GelTech launched Soil₂O® Soil Cap in July 2014. Soil₂O® Soil Cap is a dust control solution designed to stabilize stockpile erosion caused by wind and rain. Soil₂O® Soil Cap is an easy to use, non-corrosive, environmentally safe solution used by mining operations and quarries on non-traffic areas of construction sites. The product leaves no residue and is non-flammable and non-volatile, unlike many competing products. 
Uses

Soil₂O® “Dust Control” may be used in a variety of ways to control dust in multiple industries, including the following:

·
 Soil₂O® “Dust Control” may be sprayed on mining, rock quarry or landfill haul roads to eliminate dust from traffic areas, and
 
·
 Soil₂O® “Dust Control” can be sprayed on quarry conveyor belts to reduce airborne dust, and
 
·
 Soil₂O® “Dust Control” can be sprayed on horse tracks and corrals to reduce airborne dust, and
 
·
 Soil₂O® “Dust Control” can be used to maintain unpaved raceways and parking lots at rural dirt tracks and other venues used for auto racing.

Soil₂O® Soil Cap may be used in a variety of ways to control dust in multiple industries, including the following:

·
 Soil₂O® Soil Cap may be sprayed on mining or rock quarry stockpiles to reduce erosion and dust, and
 
·
 Soil₂O® Soil Cap can be sprayed on non-traffic areas of construction sites.

Benefits

Soil₂O® “Dust Control” is beneficial because it will reduce the number of times companies will need to spray haul roads, thus reducing water usage, fuel, vehicle maintenance and labor costs. In addition, the product is non-toxic and environmentally friendly and can be integrated into the reclamation process for mining companies.
Soil₂O® Soil Cap is beneficial because it very easy to mix and apply, is environmentally friendly and reduces erosion of product stockpiles while also reducing airborne dust on mining and construction sites.
Sales and Marketing
We began sales of Soil₂O® “Dust Control” in Southern California in March 2011 and currently have one full-time employee based in Florida  responsible for selling the product, focusing on dust control for rural unpaved roads, construction sites, agricultural applications and most recently solar farms. 

In January 2014, we entered into a national vendor agreement with White Cap HD Supply, the leading distributor of specialty hardware, tools and materials for large and medium-sized contractors. Under the agreement, White Cap is currently stocking 
Soil₂O® “Dust Control”, Soil₂O® Soil Cap and related equipment in the southwestern United States, primarily in the southern California market. In 2017, we added a distributor in Southern California who is focusing on Soil2O products including Soil₂O® “Dust Control” and Soil₂O® Soil Cap.

Sales of dust control products accounted for 5.5% of revenues during 2018.

Competition

Competition in the dust control industry runs the gamut from regional providers of product, trucks and equipment to multinational chemical companies providing chemical solutions and application equipment on a global basis. Generally speaking, the industry consists of products made up of chemical compounds that are in some form or fashion petroleum based, are much more expensive per application and are not environmentally friendly. A large number of companies have chosen to use water alone to mitigate airborne particulate matter. For these companies, our product can be most helpful by reducing the number of watering trips necessary to control dust thus reducing the overall cost of dust control and reducing the cost of any remediation which may be required by current EPA guidelines.

There are a few niche dust control products in the marketplace. The main and most widely used product is Magnesium Chloride (MagChloride). MagChloride has a hygroscopic quality which has the ability to absorb moisture from the air, controlling the number of small particles which become airborne. MagChloride still needs many laps with a water truck to keep it hydrated and working. After just a few applications, our “Dust Control” product helps to limit the times a water truck is needed, saving fuel, labor costs, and thousands of gallons of water per day.

Soil₂O®- Agricultural Application

Industry Overview
 
According to the USDA, although less than 15% of U.S. cropland is irrigated, agriculture accounts for 80 percent of the nations consumptive water use. According to the World Bank, agricultural water management is a vital practice in ensuring food security, poverty reduction, and environmental protection. However, irrigation in all forms costs billions of dollars a year. Specifically, irrigation for golf courses can be costly as well. According to the United States Golf Association, it is not uncommon for irrigation systems to cost more than $1 million per golf course. Effective irrigation and water management practices can help maintain profitability for farmers and golf course managers in an era of increasingly limited and more costly water supplies. 
The Product
 
We market two distinct versions of Soil₂O®: a unique, topically applied version, called Soil₂O® Topical, and a long-term version called Soil₂O® Granular, that is applied prior to planting. Soil₂O® Topical is a fine particle blend that is mixed with water and is for use on existing grass and landscaping and can be applied using any type of spray rig or backpack sprayer. Soil₂O® Granular has been formulated to be tilled into the top four to six inches of the soil to assist in replacing and replanting of grass, including sodding and seeding, and is also recommended to be used during the planting of trees, shrubs, and annuals. Soil₂O® Granular is appropriate for planting situations in which the grass is not already established. We are now selling both versions to our distributors which are marketing the products to the agricultural and other markets. 

Soil₂O® Granular’s main ingredient is polyacrilamide cross-linked polymer. Versions of this product have been used in the agricultural industry for many years. Soil₂O® can absorb hundreds of times its weight in water. Water is rapidly drawn into a polymer network where it is stored. As the soil dries out, the polymer releases up to 95% of the water it has absorbed back into the soil. Therefore, the water becomes available when the plants need it most. 

Both Soil₂O® Topical and Granular naturally degrade over time in soil. Sunlight and salinity exposure make it break down faster. Soil₂O® Topical is used as a top dressing and sprayed onto already established turf and grasses. Our formulation provides a specifically formulated particle size which, with irrigation, gets down to the roots to supply turf and grasses with water and nutrients. Since the Soil₂O® Topical particle size is very small and not as protected from the ultraviolet light given off by the sun as the granular form, it is broken down much more rapidly than the granular. Soil₂O® Granular is tilled directly into the soil and will last for three to five years without having to be reapplied. The market for the granular product includes newly-designed golf courses, courses doing replanting as part of their continual golf course maintenance or any new landscaping project. Although granular form re-orders for large scale use may be limited due to its long duration in soil, we expect it to be used in both industrial and retail markets for the planting of landscaping which always has constant turnover due to landscaping re-design, re-planting and young tree mortality rates. We are marketing both versions of Soil₂O® to the agricultural market.

Uses

Soil₂O® has multiple potential uses in the agricultural market:
 
·
 Soil₂O® products are specially designed for use as a soil conditioner for water and nutrient retention, interior and exterior farming including growers, turf farms and greenhouses, landscaping, forestry, horticulture and golf course maintenance. Each products goal is to increase the water holding capacity of soils and potting mixes, thereby reducing the frequency of irrigation, as well as reducing leaching of valuable nutrients.
 
·
 In 2019, we began marketing Soil₂O® Golf which can also be beneficial for lawns and sod by improving germination and promoting regular even growth of lawns. This is especially useful for turf farms, golf courses and grass in parks and gardens.
 
·
 Soil₂O® can be effective in agriculture, particularly in commercial farming. By storing water for later release as the soil becomes drier, Soil₂O® delays wilting and makes it possible for certain plants to become better established while waiting for rain or irrigation to begin. 
 
·
 By absorbing fertilizer, Soil₂O® and Soil₂O® Golf reduces the amount that runs out of the soil and makes it available to the plants for a longer period of time.
 
·
 Soil₂O® can be used in the planting of trees, bushes and saplings by enhancing root development and reducing mortality rates due to transplant shock.
 
·
 Soil₂O® can keep plants, trees and cut flowers hydrated and thereby facilitate their transportation over long distances.

We believe that the water scarcity in the U.S. has created an opportunity to demonstrate to governments that Soil₂O® can provide a solution for the agricultural market in areas where farmers use irrigation to water crops. In addition, the agriculture market has a substantial problem related to fertilizer and nutrient leaching. Soil₂O® has been shown to be successful in retaining fertilizer and nutrients at the root level, thus reducing leaching.

Sales and Marketing 
 
GelTech has focused its marketing efforts for Soil₂O®, Soil₂O® Golf and Granular to applications for agriculture, golf courses and commercial landscapers. Golf course superintendents find the product works well on berms and around sand traps where water run-off is an issue. Commercial landscapers use our granular product to improve growth and reduce plant mortality for new plantings. 
During 2018, Soil₂O® accounted for 0.9% of our revenue. 

Raw Materials and Suppliers
 
Our Soil₂O® base ingredients are manufactured for us by a third party. There are several other companies that are also capable of manufacturing the main ingredients.
 
Competition

Polymers have been marketed on and off for over 20 years as additions to soil to increase water retention and reduce irrigation. Numerous companies appear to have products that are very similar to Soil₂O®. Some of these companies are:
 
·
 Horticultural Alliance, Inc.
 
·
 American Soil Technologies, Inc. 
 
Each of these companies are private companies and it is unclear what financial, marketing and sales resources they have compared to us.

Seasonality
 
We anticipate that sales of Soil₂O® and Soil₂O® Golf will be higher during the spring and summer quarters. However, we do not expect as much seasonality in the Southeastern areas that generally experience year-round growing cycles, with the sale of the agricultural products preceding the growing cycle of various crops. We also believe a demand may be higher in areas where drought conditions persist.
