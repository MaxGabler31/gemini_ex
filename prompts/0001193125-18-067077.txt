 Item 1. Business 
 Business Overview 
 Ziopharm Oncology, Inc. is a biopharmaceutical company focused on discovering, acquiring, developing and commercializing next generation immunotherapy platforms that leverage gene- and cell-based therapies to treat patients with cancer on its own and with partners. We are developing two immuno-oncology platform technologies designed to utilize the patients immune system by employing novel, controlled gene expression and innovative cell engineering technologies to deliver safe, effective, and scalable cell- and viral-based therapies for the treatment of multiple cancer types. Our first platform is Controlled IL-12, which delivers interleukin 12 or IL-12, a master regular of the immune system, in a controlled and safe manner to focus the patients immune system to cancer. Our second platform is referred to as Sleeping Beauty and is based on the genetic engineering of T-cells using the Sleeping Beauty (SB) system to rapidly reprogram T-cells outside of the body for subsequent infusion. We believe these two platforms provide or will provide unique and powerful solutions intended to advance the field of immune-oncology and address the issues associated with (1) treating heterogenous solid tumors and unknown antigens therein through control of IL-12 and (2) providing rapid and cost-effective manufacturing solutions for CAR and TCR-based cell therapies for hematologic malignancies and solid tumors against known antigens. 
 With our partner Precigen, Inc., or Precigen, a wholly owned subsidiary of Intrexon Corporation we are in late stage development of a gene therapy that delivers controlled IL-12 to treat patients with brain cancer, and based on technology licensed from MD Anderson Cancer Center, we are developing chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell (CAR+ T) and T-cell receptor (TCR) T-cell (TCR+ T) therapies. These programs are being advanced in collaboration with Precigen and selectively with MD Anderson Cancer Center (MD Anderson), the National Cancer Institute (NCI) and Ares Trading, or Ares, a biopharmaceutical division of Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany. 
 Control of IL-12 is achieved from a replication-incompetent adenoviral (AD) vector administered via a single injection of virus into the brain tumor and engineered to conditionally express human IL-12 (hIL-12. The conditional expression of hIL-12 is modulated with the RheoSwitch Therapeutic System® (RTS®) by the small molecule veledimex, an activator ligand orally administered which has been shown to cross the blood-brain barrier. A Phase 1 trial in patients at high risk for death due to disease progression produced data demonstrating the safety of controlled local expression of IL-12 and showed that IL-12 by itself apparently can improve the survival of patients with recurrent glioblastoma, or rGBM. The mechanism by which these patients developed an anti-tumor effect is due to IL-12 turning cold tumors hot as shown from repeat biopsies that revealed a new and sustained infiltrate of activated T-cells producing interferon gamma (IFN-g) within the brain-tumor lesion. These data are consistent with biopsy data from patients with breast cancer that also showed IL-12 turning cold tumors hot, which could have a profound impact for oncology in general. 
 Initially, we are developing this controlled IL-12 therapy as a mono therapy entering a Phase 3 randomized control trial for the treatment of rGBM in 2018 and as Phase 1 trials that are underway to evaluate stereotactic administration and for pediatric brain tumors. In addition, we are pursuing the development of controlled IL-12 combined with a checkpoint inhibitor, for which a Phase 1 trial is currently underway. 
 We are using the non-viral SB transposon/transposase system to develop targeted therapies relating to novel CARs and TCRs. The SB technology reprograms T-cells to recognize and attack cancer cells with certain pre-defined antigens. We believe our manufacturing process for producing and then infusing genetically-modified T-cells holds significant potential to greatly reduce time of manufacture and cost which, we predict, will improve scalability to meet demand. SB-modified T-cells are being studied in Phase 1 studies to treat hematologic cancers, and we, together with our partners, intend to pursue other Phase 1 trials this year in additional indications, including solid tumors.

 We are developing these technologies pursuant to an exclusive channel partner agreement, or Channel Agreement, with Precigen, through which we obtained certain exclusive rights to Precigens technologies for use in the fields of oncology. In addition, we, together with Precigen, hold exclusive worldwide rights to certain additional immuno-oncology technologies owned and licensed by MD Anderson, including technologies relating to SB. The Channel Agreement and the MD Anderson License, as well as other licensing agreements and collaborations with the NCI, Merck KGaA and others are discussed in more detail below. 
 Recent Developments 
 Controlled IL-12 Platform 
 In January 2018, we provided updates on the continued development of our Controlled IL-12 platform and development programs for the treatment of brain cancer [at JPM?]. We announced the initiation of a Phase I clinical trial to evaluate Ad-RTS-hIL-12 plus veledimex in combination with OPDIVO® (nivolumab), an immune checkpoint, or PD-1 inhibitor, in adult patients with rGBM. We also updated guidance on our planned pivotal trial of Ad-RTS-hIL-12 plus veledimex and announced that we currently anticipate initiation in the second half of 2018, subject to regulatory approval. We have designed a Phase 3 randomized control trial to evaluate Controlled IL-12 for the treatment of patients with rGBM and following meetings with U.S. and European regulators, we are completing execution of Chemistry Manufacturing and Control (CMC) technical requirements. 
 In November 2017, during the 22nd Annual Meeting and Education Day of the Society for Neuro-Oncology (SNO) in San Francisco, we made multiple presentations on controlled IL-12. New data presented included sustained median overall survival (mOS) of 12.5 months for patients treated with Ad-RTS-hIL-12 plus 20mg of veledimex (n=15) at a longer mean follow-up time of 11.1 months as of October 18, 2017, which compares favorably to the 5- to 8-months overall survival data of approved therapies. Additional data relative to an influx of cytotoxic T-cells, increased expression levels of PD-1 and PD-L1, peripheral biomarkers and the impact of low-dose steroids on survival were presented. 
 In October 2017, we announced the first patient dosed in a Phase 1 trial of Ad-RTS-hIL-12 + veledimex for the treatment of pediatric brain tumors. 
 Sleeping Beauty Platform 
 In December 2017, we delivered multiple presentations on our adoptive cell therapy programs and application of the SB technology at the 59th American Society of Hematology (ASH) Annual Meeting and Exposition in Atlanta. We presented on the advancement of our SB platform towards point-of-care (P-O-C) for very rapid manufacturing of genetically modified CAR+ T cells. Data presented from first- and second-generation SB clinical trials demonstrate tolerability, disease response, long-term survival and persistence of infused CD19-specific CAR+ T cells. Preclinical studies presented at ASH and at the Keystone Symposia in February 2018 showed that P-O-C CAR+ T cells co-expressing membrane-bound interleukin-15 (mbIL15) and a control switch manufactured within two days do not require activation or propagation in tissue culture to achieve anti-tumor effects and prolonged T-cell survival in mice. Building on these data, we plan to initiate an investigator-led first P-O-C clinical trial in the second half of 2018 at MD Anderson. 
 We also updated guidance on the anticipated start of the NCI-led Phase 1 trial to evaluate adoptive cell transfer (ACT)-based immunotherapies genetically modified using the SB transposon/transposase system to express TCRs for the treatment of solid tumors. We, Intrexon (now Precigen), and NCI last year entered into a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) to develop and evaluate ACT for patients with advanced cancers using autologous peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) genetically modified using the non-viral SB system to express TCRs that recognize specific immunogenic mutations, or neoantigens, expressed within a patients cancer. We expect this Phase 1 trial, which is being led by and conducted at the NCI, to be initiated in the second half of 2018.

 Refocusing of Research and Development Efforts 
 We previously entered into an agreement with Intrexon (now Precigen) to pursue, through collaboration, the potential treatment and prevention of graft versus host disease, or GvHD. As a result of an in-depth review of our research and development portfolio, we determined that the pursuit of GvHD as an indication was not a material part of our corporate strategy and therefore have decided to stop pursuing the development of engineered cell therapy strategies, used either separately or in combination, for targeted treatment of GvHD. We have reverted our rights under the GvHD program back to Precigen [and are in the process of winding down the related activities]. We made this decision to focus our efforts and resources on the development of our Controlled IL-12 and Sleeping Beauty platforms for the treatment of oncology indications. 
 Platform Technologies 
 Immuno-oncology, which typically utilizes a patients own immune system to treat cancer, is one of the most actively pursued areas of research by biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies today. Cancer cells contain mutated proteins and may overexpress other proteins usually found in the body at low levels. The immune system typically recognizes unusual or aberrant cell protein expression and eliminates these cells in an efficient process known as immune surveillance. Central to immune surveillance are types of white blood cells known as T-cells and NK cells. In healthy individuals, T-cells and NK cells can identify and kill infected or abnormal cells, including cancer cells. Cancer cells develop the ability to evade immune surveillance, which is a key factor in their growth, spread, and persistence. In the recent past, there has been substantial scientific progress in countering these evasion mechanisms using immunotherapies, or therapies that activate the immune system. 
 Our approach to immuno-oncology entails the application of engineering principles to biological systems for designing and constructing new biological systems or redesigning/modifying existing biological systems. Biological systems are governed by DNA, the building block of genetic programs, which control cellular processes by coding to produce proteins and other molecules that have a functional purpose and by regulating the activities of these molecules. This regulation occurs via complex biochemical and cellular reactions working through intricate cell signaling pathways, and control over these molecules modifies the output of biological systems. Our approach to immuno-oncology has been enabled by the application of information technology and advanced statistical analysis, also known as bioinformatics, to genetic engineering, as well as by improvements in DNA synthesis. This approach aims to engineer gene-based programs or codes to modify cellular function to achieve a desired biological outcome. Its application is intended to allow more precise control of drug concentration and dose, thereby improving the therapeutic index associated with the resulting drug. A further embodiment of this technology is the ability to eliminate genetically modified immune cells after infusion. 
 We are developing two platform technologies which we use in the implementation of our product candidates: 
 

 | Controlled IL-12: An immune system master regulator which weaponizes the immune system delivered in a tunable dose;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Sleeping Beauty: A non-viral genetic manipulation that empowers and directs T-cells to fight cancer.

 Controlled IL-12 Platform 
 Background 
 Ad-RTS-hIL-12 plus veledimex, our most advanced product candidate, uses our gene delivery system to produce IL-12, a potent, naturally occurring anti-cancer protein. We have developed a replication-incompetent adenoviral vector, Ad-RTS-IL-12, administered intra-tumorally under the control of a switch referred to as the RTS®, expression platform. Activation of the switch and therefore conditional gene expression and subsequent IL-12 protein production is tightly controlled by the activator ligand, veledimex, delivered to the patient as an oral capsule. When veledimex is administered to a patient, the switch is turned on and IL-12 as well as downstream IFN-g, are produced; when veledimex is withdrawn, the switch is turned off and production of recombinant IL-12 ceases. IL-12 is a potent pro-inflammatory cytokine capable of reversing immune escape mechanisms and improving the function of tumor fighting natural killer, or NK, and T-cells. We have found direct evidence of infiltration of activated T-cells in previously cold tumors (i.e. turning cold tumors hot) following administration of Ad-RTS-IL-12 plus veledimex; the presence of such T-cells has furthermore been sustained months after administration of the Ad-RTS-hIL-12 plus veledimex. Gliomas represent a unique form of aggressive cancer that spreads loco-regionally and are particularly well suited to IL-12 local therapy. 
 

We tested Ad-RTS-IL-12 plus veledimex in several Phase 1 and 2 clinical trials including the treatment of metastatic melanoma, breast cancer, and brain cancer patients. Since 2015, our focus has been on clinical trials of the product in rGBM, a deadly form of brain cancer with limited treatment options. 
 Glioblastoma Market 
 We are developing controlled IL-12 to treat patients with rGBM. Glioblastoma is an aggressive primary brain tumor affecting approximately 74,000 people worldwide each year; it is a fast-growing, aggressive type of central nervous system tumor, with an estimated 12,390 new adult cases predicted in the United States for 2017 according to the American Brain Tumor Association. Recurrence rates for this type of cancer are near 90 percent, and prognosis for adult patients is poor with treatment often combining multiple approaches including surgery, radiation and chemotherapy.

 Ad-RTS-hIL-12 An adenoviral vector administered via a single injection into the tumor and engineered to express and control hIL-12, a powerful cytokine that stimulates a targeted, immune anti-tumor response. 


 Recurrent glioblastoma is an aggressive cancer with one of the lowest 3-year survival rates, at 3%, among all cancers. For patients who have experienced multiple recurrences, the prognosis is particularly poor, with a mOS of 6-7 months, while overall survival in patients who have failed temozolomide and bevacizumab, or equivalent salvage chemotherapy, is approximately 3-5 months. Given the poor overall prognosis and lack of effective treatments, new therapeutic approaches for malignant gliomas are needed. 
 In children, the incidence of brain cancer is approximately 4.84 per 100,000, according to the NCI. Glioma in the cortex (cerebrum) of children is unusual and is treated along the same lines as in adults with occurrence common and survival poor. Glioma in the pontine region of the brain, or diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG), accounts for approximately 15 percent of all cases of pediatric brain tumors, with a median survival time of less than one year. Because of where these tumors are situated, DIPG is inaccessible to surgery and there are no curative options. 
 Monotherapy: Clinical development Ad-RTS-IL-12 + veledimex for rGBM 
 Our multi-center Phase 1 trial in patients with rGBM, which was initiated in June 2015, continues to show promising data with preliminary evidence of a survival benefit and a good safety profile. 
 The primary objective of the Phase 1 trial is to determine the safety and tolerability of a single intratumoral Ad-RTS-hIL-12 injection activated upon dosing with oral veledimex. Secondary objectives are to determine the maximum tolerated dose, the immune responses elicited, and assessment of biologic response. The study has enrolled patients at doses ranging from 10 mg to 40 mg of veledimex. 20 mg has been identified as the target dose for further study; we plan to continue to enroll patients at the 20 mg dose level and are preparing for initiation of a pivotal trial later in the year. 
 We have presented updates of data from the ongoing Phase 1 study at a variety of major medical conferences including the annual meetings of American Society for Clinical Oncology (ASCO), American Academy of Neurological Surgery (AAcNS) and Society for Neuro-oncology (SNO). 
 Most recently, during the 22nd Annual Meeting and Education Day of SNO on November 16-19, 2017, we delivered an oral presentation entitled, A Phase 1 study of Ad-RTS-hIL-12 + veledimex in adult rGBM with new data showing median overall survival (mOS) of 12.5 months had been sustained for patients treated with Ad-RTS-hIL-12 plus 20mg of veledimex (n=15) and a longer mean follow-up time of 11.1 months in this on-going study. This mOS of 12.5 months continues to compare favorably to the 5 to 8 months survival established in historical controls for patients with rGBM. We also reported an anti-tumor effect evident with centralized review of magnetic resonance imaging showing decreasing size of brain tumor lesions in several patients. 
 Additionally, data linking the intra-tumor production of hIL-12 to patients overall survival was presented: 
 

 | Immunohistochemistry analyses from three of three patient biopsies after completion of veledimex demonstrated that IL-12 activates and sustains an immune response in rGBM;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | All three biopsies of rGBM lesions demonstrated evidence of an anti-tumor response with extensive infiltration of CD8+ T cells within the rGBM;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Biopsies all showed sustained (greater than 4 months) production of interferon-gamma, a cytokine crucial to arming an immune response in the tumor microenvironment;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Ratio of circulating killer CD8+ T cells to suppressor FOXP3+ T cells appeared to correlate with survival;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Interferon-gamma was undetectable in the blood at the time of biopsies while observed in the tumor providing further evidence of a sustained on-target response;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
9 


 
 | Expression levels of both PD-1 and PD-L1 were upregulated in all the biopsies, which suggests added potential efficacy for combining Ad-RTS-hIL-12 plus veledimex with an immune checkpoint inhibitor;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Dr. Chiocca, the 2017 President of the Society for Neuro-Oncology, was the lead author of this presentation. 
 We also delivered two additional oral presentations: Controlled expression of IL-12 improves survival in glioma by activating the immune response in mice and humans and Controlled local expression of IL-12 as gene therapy concomitant with systemic chemotherapy improves survival in glioma. 
 In our Phase 1 trial in rGBM, Ad-RTS-hIL-12 plus veledimex continues to be safe and well tolerated, as adverse events (AE) were predictable and reversible, neurologic AEs were relatively mild and transient, and there were no drug-related deaths. 
 We plan to conduct a multi-center, randomized pivotal trial to evaluate Ad-RTS-hIL-12 plus veledimex as a treatment for patients with rGBM. We have met with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in an End-of-Phase 2 meeting as well with European regulators in multiple meetings during 2017. We have designed a pivotal trial consistent with this guidance and are completing CMC technical requirements. We continue to engage in partnership discussions for further development in this indication and are collecting additional clinical data from the open Phase 1 trial, including a combination study with an immune checkpoint inhibitor (iCPI). 
 Ad-RTS-IL-12 + veledimex for the treatment of malignant glioma was granted orphan drug designation by the FDA in July 2015. Orphan drug designation provides eligibility for a seven-year period of market exclusivity in the United States after product approval, an accelerated review process, accelerated approval where appropriate, grant funding, tax benefits and an exemption from user fees. 
 Pediatrics 
 On October 16, 2017, we announced the first patient dosed in a new Phase 1 trial of Ad-RTS-hIL-12 with veledimex for the treatment of pediatric brain tumors. This open label study will assess the safety and tolerability of a single intratumoral injection of Ad-RTS-hIL-12, and is conducted in two groups: the first is comprised of pediatric patients with recurrent or progressive brain tumors, while the second is comprised of pediatric patients with DIPG. This Phase 1 trial is being conducted at leading pediatric cancer centers across the United States, including Ann & Robert H. Lurie Childrens Hospital in Chicago, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston and the University of California, San Francisco. The first pediatric patient has received Ad-RTS-hIL-12 plus veledimex at Lurie Childrens Hospital. Stewart Goldman, MD, presented a poster, entitled Phase 1 study of Ad-RTS-hIL-12 + veledimex in pediatric brain tumors at the 2017 Annual Meeting of SNO describing the study design. 
 Combination therapy 
 Our enthusiasm about Controlled IL-12 as a platform has recently increased based on emerging clinical data demonstrating that this cytokine recruits immune cells such as T-cells into rGBM turning cold tumor sites hot for long periods of time. As the Phase 1 survival data matured over the latter half of 2017, we saw compelling evidence from biopsies, taken more than four months after administration of Ad-hIL-12 plus veledimex, demonstrating that Controlled IL-12 causes a sustained influx of activated killer T-cells into brain tumors and upregulated expression of PD-1/PDL-1 biomarkers. 
 We have previously reported, in May 2016 at the Annual Meeting of the American Society of Gene and Cell Therapy, or ASGCT, preclinical trials suggesting that combination of Ad-RTS-hIL-12 plus veledimex with an iCPI improves the anti-tumor effect. We believe these data support a first-in-human study combining Ad-RTS-IL-12 + veledimex with an iCPI for the investigational treatment of rGBM. 
 
10 


 Our first study with an iCPI is with nivolumab and will explore the potentially synergistic effect of this combination. This study was initiated in 2018. 
 Other indications 
 Ad-RTS-IL-12 plus veledimex has been evaluated in four clinical trials prior to shifting our focus to brain cancer. The first, a Phase 1/2 study for the treatment of metastatic melanoma, and the second, a Phase 2 study for the treatment of unresectable recurrent or metastatic breast cancer. We have also concluded enrollment of a single-center Phase 1b/2 study, following standard chemotherapy, for the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer. In January 2017, we announced that we paused the breast cancer studies after successfully collecting the desired biomarker data demonstrating the intratumoral influx of CD8+ T cells. Prospective partnership discussions include GBM, breast cancer, and melanoma indications. 
 SB-Modified T-cells Platform 
 We are actively pursuing non-viral genetic engineering technologies to develop novel CAR+ T and TCR
therapies. The platform we, together with Intrexon (now Precigen), exclusively licensed from MD Anderson uses the SB, non-viral genetic modification system to generate and characterize new CAR+ T and TCR designs. We believe this non-viral gene transfer using the SB system is the most advanced non-viral gene transfer system in the field of oncology and has distinct advantages in terms of cost and time to produce compared with viral gene transfer, e.g., retrovirus and lentivirus. First, it may reduce the manufacturing expense and challenges associated with viral gene transfer systems in creating T-cells engineered to express CAR and TCR. The SB system simply uses DNA plasmid and does not require time-consuming and laborious manufacture of virus. 
 Furthermore, the T-cell manufacturing process with SB has the potential to significantly shorten virus-based manufacturing time. Our technology referred to as P-O-C enables rapid manufacture of autologous (patient-derived) genetically modified T-cells in near real time. In the preclinical setting, the time to administration of third-generation SB-modified T-cells co-expressing mbIL15 and kill switch has been reduced to less than two days through elimination of the need for in vitro T-cell activation and propagation which avoids the need to culture T-cells. The addition of our proprietary mbIL15 likely enables the administration of CAR-expressing younger T-cells with an ability to be long-lived after infusion in animals. The ability of CAR+ T cells to signal via recombinant IL-15 increases CAR persistence and has the potential to eliminate lymphodepletion. 
 Non-viral gene transfer and our P-O-C technology also enables the potential for a hospital-based, manufacturing model rather than the centralized manufacturing approach currently being employed for other CAR+ T products, including Kymriah and Yescarta. For example, patient-derived cells may no longer need to be shipped to and from the manufacturing site, thereby eliminating cumbersome and time-consuming shipment and receipt. 
 Finally, the use of the SB platform may be significantly more customizable, therefore enabling us to prepare personalized TCR therapies against unique, and potentially multiple, patient-specific neoantigens. This approach would be cost prohibitive with viral gene transfer and may allow us to develop TCR therapies against both hematologic malignancies and solid tumors. 
 We expect to build upon these data to co-express immunoreceptors with cytokines and to leverage its ability to control expression with the RTS® and/or kill switches. The IL-12 data arising from the brain cancer trial with Ad-RTS-hIL-12 + veledimex firmly establishes that the RTS® is a controllable switch in humans. The RTS® technology is being further developed for use in T-cells. In addition, kill switches have been developed to eliminate gene-modified T-cells in the event of adverse events. 
 The improvements our P-O-C technology may bring to both the reduction in vein-to-vein time as well as the personalization of treatment will be significant advances in the field of immuno-oncology. The development technology platform is focused on (1) shortening the time the patient must wait for treatment with engineered T-cells, (2) increasing the access of hospitals to deliver, and patients to receive, cell therapies, and (3) providing safe and efficacious personalized cell therapies to patients across a wide range of cancers.

 Hematologic and solid tumor malignancy market 
 According to the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society, an estimated 1,237,824 people in the U.S. are living with, or are in remission from leukemia, lymphoma, or myeloma. New diagnoses for such hematologic malignancies in the U.S. were estimated to be 171,500 and represented approximately 10% of the new cancer cases in the U.S. in 2016. Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is the most common form of acute leukemia in adults and has a particularly poor prognosis with a relative 5-year survival rate of only 26% overall. An estimated 19,950 new cases of AML were estimated in the US in 2016. 
 In 2016 more than 15.5 million people in the U.S. were living with, or are in remission from some form of cancer. Approximately 1,688,780 new cancer cases were expected to be diagnosed in the US in 2017 according to the American Cancer Society. Of these, the majority were caused by solid tumors. Malignancies of epithelial tissue, or carcinomas, represent 80 to 90 percent of all cancer cases according to the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program of the National Cancer Institute. These diseases include colorectal, non-small cell lung, skin, bladder and head and neck cancers, among others. Despite significant advances in immunotherapy many patients with metastatic carcinomas will die from disease progression. Cancer is the second most common cause of death in the US, accounting for nearly 1 of every 4 deaths. 
 Clinical Development CAR+ T 
 Through the MD Anderson License, we entered the clinic with three CAR+ T therapies in 2015 utilizing the non-viral genetic modification capabilities of the SB system. Two of these trials are with first generation technologies, the results from which were published in the Journal of Clinical Investigation in September 2016. An update on patients in the first-generation trials was presented in a poster at the 2017 Annual Meeting of ASH. The trials demonstrated that first-generation SB-modified CD19-specific CAR+ T cells appear to provide long term cancer control when infused after hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation (HSCT) for patients with advanced CD19+ malignancies and could be detected years after administration in some recipients. All seven patients with advanced CD19+ non-Hodgkins lymphoma (NHL) that received autologous T-cells were alive at a median survival of 40 months since infusion, with progression-free survival (PFS) reported at 86% and overall survival (OS) at 100%. For 19 patients with advanced CD19+ acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and NHL infused with allogeneic T-cells following HSCT, nine patients were alive with a median survival of 31 months. The PFS rate and OS rates are 32% and 49%, respectively. Of the subset of eight patients who received donor-derived T-cells after haploidentical HSCT, PFS and OS rates are 50% and 63%, respectively. Persistence of circulating SB-modified CAR+ T cells was demonstrated at two years in an autologous and allogeneic patient and for four years in two autologous patients. 
 We are currently enrolling patients in an investigator-led Phase 1 study using second-generation CD19-specific CAR+ T cells with a revised CAR structure in patients with advanced lymphoid malignancies at MD Anderson. Our second-generation CD19 trial employs a revised CAR design and shortened manufacturing process advancement, with culturing times as short as two weeks. A summary of this ongoing trial was presented by Dr. Partow Kebriaei of MDACC in a presentation at the 2017 Annual Meeting of ASH in December. Interim data from the trial demonstrated that autologous T-cells infused after lymphodepleting chemotherapy could be detected, and exhibited anti-tumor effects and an encouraging safety profile in patients with relapsed/refractory CD19+ malignancies. Complete responses at one month were reported in four of eight patients with either ALL (n=5), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (n=1), or diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (n=2), with two morphologic complete responses at three months. Follow up blood tests demonstrated sustained persistence of infused T-cells and targeting of malignant and normal B cells. There were no dose limiting toxicities with only grade 1 or 2 adverse events being reported. T-cell dose escalation continues. We anticipate stopping enrollment in this trial in 2018 as our third-generation trial moves forward in the clinic. 
 In the preclinical setting, the time to manufacture and administration of third-generation SB-modified CAR+ T cells co-expressing mbIL15 has been reduced to less than two days. This shortened very rapid manufacturing

  process, referred to as P-O-C, delivers genetically modified T-cells with superior proliferative potential in vivo. Preclinical studies of third generation SB CAR+ T cells, presented at the 2017 Annual Meeting of ASH, demonstrated that a single low-dose of T-cells co-expressing a CD19-specific CAR, mbIL15, and kill switch resulted in sustained in vivo persistence that produced potent anti-tumor effects and superior leukemia-free survival in mice. These preclinical data support our P-O-C plans to very rapidly infuse SB CAR+ T cells in a Phase 1 trial in 2018. Our intent to administer clinical-grade SB CAR+ T cells in less than 48 hours, this non-viral CAR+ T approach has the potential to outpace viral-based methods in terms of time to the administration of therapy concomitant with a reduction in cost. The P-O-C technology is based on the non-viral gene transfer to stably integrate both CAR and mbIL15 with a kill switch. 
 Overview of the Point-of-Care (P-O-C) using the Sleeping Beauty (SB) system to very rapidly generate CAR+ T cells against known tumor antigens. 
 

We are also progressing an ongoing Phase 1 adoptive cellular therapy clinical trial at MD Anderson infusing autologous T-cells transduced with lentivirus to express a CD33-specific CAR co-expressed with a kill switch in patients with relapsed or refractory AML. Preclinical studies, presented at the 2017 annual meeting of ASH, demonstrated that lentiviral transduced CAR-T cells targeting CD33 exhibit specific cytotoxic activity for CD33+ AML cells. A proof-of-concept study utilizing an in vivo mouse model for AML showed that these CAR-T cells could reduce disease burden and significantly enhance survival as compared to control groups. These positive preliminary results indicated biological activity and are suggestive of potential therapeutic effect for the treatment of AML. This Phase 1 clinical trial is now open for enrollment at MD Anderson. The anticipated clinical data may establish that CD33 can be targeted by CAR on genetically modified T-cells, which will provide a foundation for considering then to advance this program under the P-O-C approach. 
 Clinical Development TCR 
 Many of these genetic engineering technologies can also be applied toward targeting intracellular antigens with one or more tumor-specific TCRs. This approach is particularly important for addressing the complexity of solid tumors. We believe that the SB non-viral platform is ideally suited for targeting intracellular antigens by TCR as it may be more cost-effective, should allow for rapid manufacturing, and is expected to be customizable for individual patient therapies with the ability to include multiple TCRs in a single therapy. We are pursuing a discovery program in TCR therapies for neoantigen targets. The development of an approach to create a truly personalized therapy for each cancer patient based on his/her unique neoantigens is a strategic goal of ours. 
 On January 10, 2017, we announced the signing of a CRADA with the NCI for the development of ACT-based immunotherapies genetically modified using the SB transposon/transposase system to express TCRs for the 
 
13 


  treatment of solid tumors. The principal goal of the CRADA is to develop and evaluate ACT for patients with advanced cancers using autologous PBL genetically modified using the non-viral SB system to express TCRs that recognize specific immunogenic mutations, or neoantigens, expressed within a patients cancer. Clinical evaluations of the ability of these SB-engineered PBL to express TCRs reactive against cancer mutations to mediate cancer regression in patients with metastatic disease will be performed. Research conducted under the CRADA will be at the direction of Steven A. Rosenberg, M.D., Ph.D., Chief of the Surgery Branch at the NCI, in collaboration with researchers at Ziopharm and Precigen. Preparations for the clinical trial are underway at the NCI. Following validation of the manufacturing process, we anticipate submission of the IND and initiation of the clinical trial in 2018. 
 Preclinical Development 
 In collaboration with Precigen, we continue to develop additional CAR+ T targets, using our Sleeping Beauty platform. Under the collaboration, Ares Trading has elected two CAR+ T targets for which we will perform certain research activities that will, in part, be funded by Ares Trading. We and Precigen will also independently conduct research and development on other CAR+ T candidates, with Ares Trading having the opportunity during clinical development to opt-in to these candidates for additional payments to us and Precigen. We anticipate further advancement of at least one target toward the clinic in 2018. 
 In addition, we will continue efforts to genetically modify allogeneic NK cells to improve their persistence and anti-tumor efficacy. 
 License Agreements, Intellectual Property and Other Agreements 
 Our goal is to obtain, maintain, and enforce patent protection for our products, formulations, processes, methods, and other proprietary technologies to preserve our trade secrets and to operate without infringing upon the proprietary rights of other parties. Our policy is to actively seek the broadest possible intellectual property protection for our product candidates through a combination of contractual arrangements and patents, both in the United States and abroad. 
Exclusive Channel Partner Agreement with Precigen for the Cancer Programs 
 On January 6, 2011, we entered into the Channel Agreement with Intrexon (now Precigen), that governs a channel partnering arrangement in which we use Precigens technology to research, develop and commercialize products in which DNA is administered to humans for expression of anti-cancer effectors for treatment or prophylaxis of cancer, which we collectively refer to as the Cancer Program. This Channel Agreement establishes committees comprising representatives of us and Precigen that govern activities related to the Cancer Program in the areas of project establishment, chemistry, manufacturing and controls, clinical and regulatory matters, commercialization efforts and intellectual property. 
 The Channel Agreement grants us a worldwide license to use patents and other intellectual property of Precigen in connection with the research, development, use, importing, manufacture, sale, and offer for sale of products involving DNA administered to humans for expression of anti-cancer effectors for the purpose of treatment or prophylaxis of cancer, which are collectively referred to as the Ziopharm Products. Such license is exclusive with respect to any clinical development, selling, offering for sale or other commercialization of Ziopharm Products, and otherwise is non-exclusive. Subject to limited exceptions, we may not sublicense these rights without Precigens written consent. 
 Under the Channel Agreement, and subject to certain exceptions, we are responsible for, among other things, the performance of the Cancer Program, including the development, commercialization and certain aspects of manufacturing of Ziopharm Products. Precigen is responsible for establishing manufacturing capabilities and facilities for the bulk manufacture of products developed under the Cancer Program, certain other aspects of manufacturing and costs of discovery-stage research with respect to platform improvements and costs of filing, prosecution and maintenance of Precigens patents. 
 
14 


 After the 2016 Exclusive Channel Partner (ECP) Amendment, discussed below, and subject to certain expense allocations and other offsets provided in the Channel Agreement, we are obligated to pay Precigen on a quarterly basis 20% of net profits derived in that quarter from the sale of Ziopharm Products, calculated on a Ziopharm Product-by- Ziopharm Product basis. We likewise agreed to pay Precigen on a quarterly basis 50% of revenue obtained in that quarter from a sublicensor in the event of a sublicensing arrangement. In addition, in partial consideration for each partys execution and delivery of the Channel Agreement, we entered into a stock purchase agreement with Precigen. 
 Upon termination of the Channel Agreement, we may continue to develop and commercialize any Ziopharm Product that, at the time of termination: 
 

 | Is being commercialized by us;
--+-------------------------------


 | Has received regulatory approval;
--+----------------------------------


 | Is a subject of an application for regulatory approval that is pending before the applicable regulatory authority; or
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Is the subject of at least an ongoing Phase 2 clinical trial (in the case of a termination by Precigen due to an uncured breach or a voluntary termination by us), or an ongoing Phase 1 clinical trial in the field (in the case of a termination by us due to an uncured breach or a termination by Precigen following an unconsented assignment by us or its election not to pursue development of a Superior Therapy (as defined in the Channel Agreement)).
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 With respect to these retained Ziopharm Products, our obligation to pay 20% of net profits derived from the sale of Ziopharm Products and 50% of revenue derived from a sublicensor will survive termination of the Channel Agreement. 
 Amendment of Collaborations with Precigen 
 On March 27, 2015, we, together with Intrexon, now Precigen, entered into an ECP Amendment, amending the Channel Agreement. The ECP Amendment modifies the scope of the parties collaboration under the Channel Agreement in connection with the Ares Trading Agreement discussed below. Pursuant to the ECP Amendment, the chimeric antigen receptor T-cell products to be developed and commercialized pursuant to the Ares Trading Agreement shall be included within the Precigen/ Ziopharm collaboration under the Channel Agreement. The ECP Amendment provides that Precigen will pay us fifty percent of all payments Precigen receives for upfronts, milestones and royalties under the Ares Trading Agreement. 
 On June 29, 2016, we entered into (1) the 2016 ECP Amendment with Intrexon (now Precigen), amending the Channel Agreement, and (2) the 2016 GvHD Amendment, amending our Exclusive Channel Collaboration Agreement we entered into with Intrexon (now Precigen) in September 2015, or the GvHD Agreement. The 2016 ECP Amendment reduced the royalty percentage that we will pay to Precigen under the Channel Agreement on a quarterly basis from 50% to 20% of net profits derived in that quarter from the sale of Ziopharm Products, calculated on a Ziopharm Product-by- Ziopharm Product basis, subject to certain expense allocations and other offsets provided in the Channel Agreement. The 2016 GvHD Amendment reduced the royalty percentage that we would pay to Precigen under the GvHD Agreement on a quarterly basis from 50% to 20% of net profits derived in that quarter from the sale of Products (as defined in the GvHD Agreement), subject to certain expense allocations and other offsets provided in the GvHD Agreement. The reductions in the royalty percentages provided by the 2016 ECP Amendment and the 2016 GvHD Amendment do not apply to sublicensing revenue or royalties under the Channel Agreement and GvHD Agreement, nor do they apply to any royalties or other payments made with respect to sublicensing revenue from our existing collaboration with Ares Trading S.A., or Ares Trading, a subsidiary of the biopharmaceutical business of Merck KGaA. We have recently announced our decision to stop pursuing the development of engineered cell therapy strategies for targeted treatment of GvHD. We have reverted our rights under the GvHD Agreement back to Precigen [and are in the process of winding down the related activities]. 
 
15 


 In consideration for the execution and delivery of the 2016 ECP Amendment and the 2016 GvHD Amendment, we agreed to issue to Intrexon 100,000 shares of its Series 1 preferred stock. Each share of our Series 1 preferred stock has a stated value of $1,200, subject to appropriate adjustment in the event of any stock dividend, stock split, combination or other recapitalization, and certain other rights, preferences, privileges and obligations (see Note 9 to the accompanying financial statements). 
 Exclusive Channel Collaboration Agreement with Precigen for GvHD 
 On September 28, 2015, we entered into the GvHD Agreement with Intrexon (now Precigen), whereby we would use Precigens technology directed towards in vivo expression of effectors to research, develop and commercialize products for use in the treatment or prevention of GvHD. The GvHD Agreement granted us a worldwide license to use specified patents and other intellectual property of Precigen in connection with the research, development, use, importing, manufacture, sale, and offer for sale of products developed under the GvHD Agreement. 
 We paid Intrexon a technology access fee of $10.0 million in cash in October 2015 and agreed to reimburse Intrexon for all related research and development costs pursuant to the GvHD Agreement. We have determined that the rights acquired in the GvHD Agreement represent in-process research and development with no alternative future use. Accordingly, we recorded a charge of $10.0 million to research and development expense in September 2015. 
 As a result of an in-depth review of our research and development portfolio, we determined that the pursuit of GvHD as an indication was not a material part of our corporate strategy and therefore have decided to stop pursuing the development of engineered cell therapy strategies, used either separately or in combination, for targeted treatment of GvHD. We have reverted our rights under the GvHD program back to Precigen [and are in the process of winding down the related activities]. We made this decision to focus our efforts and resources on the development of our Controlled IL-12 and Sleeping Beauty platforms for the treatment of oncology indications. 
 License AgreementThe University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center 
 On January 13, 2015, we, together with Intrexon (now Precigen), entered into a License Agreement, or the MD Anderson License, with The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, or MD Anderson. Pursuant to the MD Anderson License, we, together with Precigen, hold an exclusive, worldwide license to certain technologies owned and licensed by MD Anderson including technologies relating to novel chimeric antigen receptor, or CAR, T cell therapies, non-viral gene transfer systems, genetic modification and/or propagation of immune cells and other cellular therapy approaches, Natural Killer, or NK Cells, and T-cell receptors, or TCRs, arising from the laboratory of Laurence Cooper, M.D., Ph.D., who became our Chief Executive Officer in May 2015 and was formerly a tenured professor of pediatrics at MD Anderson and is now currently a visiting scientist under that institutions policies, as well as either co-exclusive or non-exclusive licenses under certain related technologies. 
 Pursuant to the terms of the MD Anderson License, MD Anderson received consideration consisting of $50.0 million in shares of our common stock (or 10,124,561 shares), and $50.0 million in shares of Intrexons common stock, in each case based on a trailing 20 day volume weighted average of the closing price our and Intrexons common stock ending on the date prior to the announcement of the entry into the MD Anderson License, collectively referred to as the License Shares, pursuant to the terms of the License Shares Securities Issuance Agreement described below. The License Shares were issued to MD Anderson on March 11, 2015, pursuant to the terms of the MD Anderson License. 
 On January 9, 2015, in order to induce MD Anderson to enter into the MD Anderson License on an accelerated schedule, we, together with Intrexon entered into a letter agreement, or the Letter Agreement, pursuant to which MD Anderson received consideration of $7.5 million in shares of our common stock (or 1,597,602 shares), and 
 
16 


  $7.5 million in shares of Intrexons common stock, in each case based on a trailing 20-day volume-weighted average of the closing price of our and Intrexons common stock ending on the date prior to the execution of the Letter Agreement, collectively referred to as the Incentive Shares, in the event that the MD Anderson License was entered into on January 14, 2015. The Incentive Shares were issued to MD Anderson on March 11, 2015, pursuant to the terms of the Incentive Shares Securities Issuance Agreement described below. 
 On August 17, 2015, we, Intrexon (now Precigen) and MD Anderson entered into a research and development agreement, or the Research and Development Agreement, to formalize the scope and process for the transfer by MD Anderson, pursuant to the terms of the MD Anderson License, of certain existing research programs and related technology rights, as well as the terms and conditions for future collaborative research and development of new and ongoing research programs. 
 Pursuant to the Research and Development Agreement, we, Intrexon (now Precigen) and MD Anderson have agreed to form a joint steering committee that will oversee and manage the new and ongoing research programs. As provided under the MD Anderson License, we provided funding for research and development activities in support of the research programs under the Research and Development Agreement for a period of three years and in an amount of no less than $15.0 million and no greater than $20.0 million per year. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, we made payments in the aggregate amount of $13.0 million to MD Anderson compared to $15.0 million during the twelve months ended December 31, 2016. The decrease in cash paid to MD Anderson during 2017 is a result of approved expenditures incurred by us being deducted from the April, July, and October quarterly payments. As of December 31, 2017, MD Anderson had used $7.3 million to offset costs incurred pursuant to the MD Anderson License and the Research and Development Agreement. The net balance of cash resources on hand at MD Anderson is $31.9 million, of which $18.5 million is included in other current assets and the remaining $13.4 million is included in non-current assets at December 31, 2017. Subsequent to the balance sheet date, the final payment to MD Anderson was made in January 2018 for $2.7 million. 
 The term of the MD Anderson License expires on the last to occur of (a) the expiration of all patents licensed thereunder, or (b) the twentieth anniversary of the date of the MD Anderson License; provided, however, that following the expiration of the term of the MD Anderson License, we, together with Precigen, shall then have a fully-paid up, royalty free, perpetual, irrevocable and sublicensable license to use the licensed intellectual property thereunder. After ten years from the date of the MD Anderson License and subject to a 90-day cure period, MD Anderson will have the right to convert the MD Anderson License into a non-exclusive license if we and Precigen are not using commercially reasonable efforts to commercialize the licensed intellectual property on a case-by-case basis. After five years from the date of the MD Anderson License and subject to a 180-day cure period, MD Anderson will have the right to terminate the MD Anderson License with respect to specific technology(ies) funded by the government or subject to a third-party contract if we and Precigen are not meeting the diligence requirements in such funding agreement or contract, as applicable. MD Anderson may also terminate the agreement with written notice upon material breach by us and Precigen, if such breach has not been cured within 60 days of receiving such notice. In addition, the MD Anderson License will terminate upon the occurrence of certain insolvency events for both us and Precigen and may be terminated by the mutual written agreement of us, Precigen and MD Anderson. 
 In connection with the MD Anderson License and the issuance of the License Shares and the Incentive Shares, on January 13, 2015, we, together with MD Anderson, entered into a Registration Rights Agreement, or the Registration Rights Agreement, pursuant to which the we agreed to file a resale registration statement, or the Registration Statement, registering the resale of the License Shares, the Incentive Shares and any other shares of the our common stock held by MD Anderson on the date that the Registration Statement is filed. Under the terms of the Registration Rights Agreement, we are obligated to maintain the effectiveness of the Registration Statement until all securities therein are sold or are otherwise can be sold pursuant to Rule 144, without any restrictions. A prospectus supplement under our already effective registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-201826) was filed on April 1, 2015 in satisfaction of our obligations under the Registration Rights Agreement. 
 
17 


 We determined that the rights acquired in the MD Anderson License represented in process research and development with no alternative future use. Accordingly, we recorded a charge of $67.3 million to research and development expense in 2015, representing the fair value of the 11,722,163 shares of its common stock on the date the MD Anderson License was executed. 
 Ares Trading License and Collaboration Agreement 
 On March 27, 2015, we, together with Intrexon (now Precigen), signed a worldwide License and Collaboration Agreement, or the Ares Trading Agreement, with Ares Trading S.A., or Ares Trading, a subsidiary of the biopharmaceutical business of Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany, through which the parties established a collaboration for the research and development and commercialization of certain products for the prophylactic, therapeutic, palliative or diagnostic use for cancer in humans. 
 Under the collaboration, Ares Trading has elected two CAR+ T targets for which we will perform certain research activities that will, in part, be funded by Ares Trading. Once these candidates reach investigational new drug, or IND, stage, the programs will be transferred to Ares Trading for clinical development and commercialization. We expect to perform multiple preclinical development programs, each consisting of the development of one product candidate, pursuant to the agreement. We, together with Precigen, will also independently conduct research and development on other CAR+ T candidates, with Ares Trading having the opportunity during clinical development to opt-in to these candidates for additional payments to us and Precigen. 
 Precigen is entitled to receive $5.0 million, from Ares Trading, payable in equal quarterly installments over two years for each identified product candidate, which will be used to fund discovery work. We are responsible for costs exceeding the quarterly installments and all other costs of the preclinical research and development. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, we have expensed $1.6 million under the Ares Trading Agreement, respectively. 
 Ares Trading paid a non-refundable upfront fee of $115.0 million to Intrexon as consideration for entry into the Ares Trading Agreement. Pursuant to the ECP Amendment, we were entitled to receive 50% of the upfront fee, or $57.5 million, which we received from Intrexon in July 2015. 
 The Ares Trading Agreement provides for up to $60.0 million in development milestone payments, up to $148.0 million in regulatory milestone payments and up to $205.0 million in commercial milestone payments for each product candidate. Development milestone payments are triggered upon initiation of a defined phase of clinical research for a product candidate. Regulatory milestone payments are triggered upon approval to market a product candidate by the FDA, or other global regulatory authorities. Commercial milestone payments are triggered when an approved pharmaceutical product reaches certain defined levels of net sales by the licensee. The Ares Trading Agreement also provides for up to $50.0 million of one-time payments upon the achievement of certain technical milestones evidenced by the initiation of a defined phase of clinical research. All development, regulatory and technical milestones are considered substantive based on the contingent nature of the milestone, specifically reviewing factors such as the scientific, clinical, regulatory, commercial and other risks that must be overcome to achieve the milestone as well as the level of effort and investment required. Accordingly, such amounts will be recognized as revenue in full in the period in which the associated milestone is achieved, assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met. All commercial milestones will be accounted for in the same manner as royalties and recorded as revenue upon achievement of the milestone, assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met. The next potential milestone payment that Precigen could be entitled to receive under the Ares Trading Agreement is a $15.0 million substantive milestone for the initiation of a Phase 1 clinical trial. In addition, to the extent any of the product candidates licensed by Ares Trading are commercialized, Precigen would be entitled to receive royalties ranging from the lower-single digits to the low-teens of net sales derived from the sale of products developed under agreement. Precigen will pay 50% of all milestone and royalty payments that it receives under the Ares Trading Agreement to us pursuant to the ECP Amendment. 
 
18 


 The term of the Ares Trading Agreement commenced in May 2015 and may be terminated by either party in the event of a material breach as defined in the agreement and may be terminated voluntarily by Ares Trading upon 90 days written notice to us. 
 We considered FASB Accounting Standards Codification 605-25, Multiple-Element Arrangements, in evaluating the appropriate accounting for the Ares Trading Agreement. In accordance with this guidance, we identified the license and research and development services as our deliverables in the arrangement. We concluded that the license does not have standalone value independent from the research and development services. Accordingly, the Ares Trading Agreement is accounted for by us as a single unit of accounting. The $57.5 million upfront payment received by us was recorded as deferred revenue and is being recognized over the estimated period of performance of the research and development services which are currently estimated to be nine years, beginning with the commencement of the research and development services. During the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, we recognized $1.6 million, each quarter, of revenue related to the Ares Trading Agreement. As of December 31, 2017, the remaining balance of deferred revenue associated with the upfront payment is $41.5 million, of which $6.4 million is current and $35.1 million is classified as long-term. As of December 31, 2016, the remaining balance of deferred revenue associated with the upfront payment was $47.9 million, of which $6.4 million was current and $41.5 million was classified as long term. 
Patent and Technology License AgreementThe University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center and the Texas A&M University System 
 On August 24, 2004, we entered into a patent and technology license agreement with MD Anderson and the Texas A&M University System, which we refer to, collectively, as the Licensors. Under this agreement, we were granted an exclusive, worldwide license to rights (including rights to U.S. and foreign patent and patent applications and related improvements and know-how) for the manufacture and commercialization of two classes of organic arsenicals (water- and lipid-based) for human and animal use. The class of water-based organic arsenicals includes darinaparsin. 
 We issued options to purchase 50,222 shares outside of our stock option plans following the successful completion of certain clinical milestones, of which 37,666 shares have vested. The remaining 12,556 shares vested upon enrollment of the first patient in a multi-center pivotal clinical trial i.e. a human clinical trial intended to provide the substantial evidence of efficacy necessary to support the filing of an approvable New Drug Application, or NDA. An expense of $87 thousand was charged to research and development expense for the vesting event which occurred in March 2016. This trial was initiated by Solasia Pharma K.K., or Solasia, on March 28, 2016 and triggered a $1.0 million milestone payment to us from Solasia which was received in May 2016. An equivalent of $1.0 million milestone payment was subsequently made to MD Anderson and reported net. In addition, the Licensors are entitled to receive certain milestone payments. In addition, we may be required to make additional payments to the Licensors (as defined in the MD Anderson License) upon achievement of certain other milestones in varying amounts which, on a cumulative basis could total up to an additional $4.5 million. In addition, the Licensors are entitled to receive single digit percentage royalty payments on sales from a licensed product and will also be entitled to receive a portion of any fees that we may receive from a possible sublicense under certain circumstances. 
Collaboration Agreement with Solasia Pharma K.K. 
 On March 7, 2011, we entered into a License and Collaboration Agreement with Solasia. Pursuant to the License and Collaboration Agreement, we granted Solasia an exclusive license to develop and commercialize darinaparsin in both intravenous and oral forms and related organic arsenic molecules, in all indications for human use in a pan-Asian/Pacific territory comprising Japan, China, Hong Kong, Macau, Republic of Korea, Taiwan, Singapore, Australia, New Zealand, Malaysia, Indonesia, Philippines and Thailand. 
 As consideration for the license, we received an upfront payment of $5.0 million to be used exclusively for further clinical development of darinaparsin outside of the pan-Asian/Pacific territory and will be entitled to 
 
19 


  receive additional payments of up to $32.5 million in development-based milestones and up to $53.5 million in sales-based milestones. We will also be entitled to receive double digit royalty payments from Solasia based upon net sales of licensed products in the applicable territories, once commercialized, and a percentage of sublicense revenues generated by Solasia. The $5.0 million upfront payment received in March 2011 was amortized over the period of the research and development effort, which was completed in March 2016. 
 On July 31, 2014, we entered into an amendment and restatement of the License and Collaboration Agreement granting Solasia an exclusive worldwide license to develop and commercialize darinaparsin, and related organoarsenic molecules, in both intravenous and oral forms in all indications for human use. In exchange, we will be eligible to receive from Solasia development- and sales-based milestones, a royalty on net sales of darinaparsin, once commercialized, and a percentage of any sublicense revenues generated by Solasia. 
 Solasia will be responsible for all costs related to the development, manufacturing and commercialization of darinaparsin. Our Licensors, as defined in the agreement, will receive a portion of all milestone and royalty payments made by Solasia to us in accordance with the terms of our license agreement with the Licensors. 
 On March 28, 2016, Solasia initiated a multi-center pivotal clinical trial intended to provide substantial evidence of efficacy necessary to support the filing of an application for an NDA for darinaparsin in certain of the territories assigned to Solasia. The initiation of the trial on March 28, 2016 triggered a $1.0 million milestone payment from Solasia to us which was received in May 2016. We subsequently made an equivalent payment to MD Anderson as the ultimate licensor of darinaparsin (see above). 
 License Agreement with Baxter Healthcare S.A. 
 On November 3, 2006, we entered into a definitive Asset Purchase Agreement for indibulin and a License Agreement to proprietary nanosuspension technology with affiliates of Baxter Healthcare S.A. The purchase included the entire indibulin intellectual property portfolio as well as existing drug substance and capsule inventories. The terms of the Asset Purchase Agreement included an upfront cash payment and an additional payment for existing inventory. During the year ending December 31, 2017, we made the final payment of $250 thousand under the asset agreement. We are not actively pursuing the development of indibulin. 
Patents and Other Intellectual Property Rights and Protection 
 Patents extend for varying periods according to the date of patent filing or grant and the legal term of patents in the various countries where patent protection is obtained. The actual protection offering by a patent, which can vary from country to country, depends of the type of patent, the scope of its coverage and the availability of legal remedies in the country. 
 Pursuant to the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Amendments, some of our patents, under certain conditions, may be eligible for limited patent term extension for a period of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during drug development and the FDA regulatory review process. However, this extension period cannot be extended beyond 14 years from the drugs approval date. The patent term restoration period is generally one-half the period of time elapsed between the effective date of an IND application or the issue date of the patent, whichever is later, and the submission date of an NDA, plus the period of time between the submission date of the NDA or the issue date of the patent, whichever is later, and FDA approval. The United States Patent and Trademark Office, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves applications for any patent term extension or restoration. We intend to seek the benefits of this statute, but there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain any such benefits. 
 We also depend upon the skills, knowledge, and experience of our scientific and technical personnel, as well as those of our advisors, consultants, and other contractors, none of which is patentable. To help protect proprietary know-how, which is not patentable, and for inventions for which patents may be difficult to enforce, we currently 
 
20 


  rely, and in the future, will continue to rely, on trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements to protect our interests. To this end, we generally require employees, consultants, advisors and other contractors to enter into confidentiality agreements that prohibit the disclosure of confidential information and, where applicable, require disclosure and assignment to us of the ideas, developments, discoveries and inventions important to our business. 
 Our patent position and proprietary rights are subject to certain risks and uncertainties. Please read the Risk Related to Our Intellectual Property section for further information about certain risks and uncertainties that may affect our patent position and proprietary rights. 
 Additional information as of December 31, 2017 about material patents and other proprietary rights covering our product candidates is set forth below. 
 Ad-RTS-IL-12 + veledimex and DC-RTS-IL-12 + veledimex 
 The patent estate licensed to us by Precigen covering Ad-RTS-IL-12 + activator ligands, such as veledimex and DC-RTS-IL-12 + activator ligand compositions, methods of use, methods of manufacture, and formulations includes over one hundred patents and applications. This portfolio also includes issued and pending foreign patents in Europe, Canada, Japan, Australia and other countries. The term of one or more of the issued patents may be extended due to the regulatory approval process. 
 CAR+ T 
 In January 2015, we in-licensed from MD Anderson a technology portfolio that includes intellectual property directed to certain non-viral SB system and CAR+ T cell and bioprocessing technology. Under the terms of the agreement, we have an exclusive license to certain of the intellectual property, a co-exclusive license to certain of the intellectual property technology and a non-exclusive license to certain of the intellectual property technology. Our rights to the MD Anderson intellectual property flow to us via our agreement with Precigen. 
 Governmental Regulation and Product Approval 
 As a biopharmaceutical company, we are subject to extensive regulation. Our programmed T-cell product candidates, if approved, will be regulated as biologics. With this classification, commercial production of our products will need to occur in registered and licensed facilities in compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMPs, for biologics. 
 Human immunotherapy products are a new category of therapeutics. The FDA categorizes human cell- or tissue-based products as either minimally manipulated or more than minimally manipulated, and has determined that more than minimally manipulated products require clinical trials to demonstrate product safety and efficacy and the submission of a Biologics License Application, or BLA, for marketing authorization. 
 Government authorities in the United States (at the federal, state and local level) and in other countries and jurisdictions, including the European Union, extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, preclinical and clinical testing, manufacturing, quality control, labeling, packaging, storage, record-keeping, promotion, advertising, sale, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, marketing and export and import of biopharmaceutical products such as those we are developing. Our product candidates must be approved by the FDA before they may be legally marketed in the United States and by the appropriate foreign regulatory agency before they may be legally marketed in foreign countries. Generally, our activities in other countries will be subject to regulation that is similar in nature and scope as that imposed in the United States, although there can be important differences. Additionally, some significant aspects of regulation in Europe are addressed in a centralized way, but country-specific regulation remains essential in many respects. The process for obtaining regulatory marketing approvals and the subsequent compliance with applicable federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources.

 U.S. Product Development Process 
 In the United States, the FDA regulates biological products under the Public Health Service Act, or PHSA, and the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and implementing regulations. Products are also subject to other federal, state and local statutes and regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval, may subject an applicant to administrative or judicial sanctions. FDA sanctions could include, among other actions, refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, a clinical hold, warning letters and similar public notice of alleged non-compliance with laws, product recalls or withdrawals from the market, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement of profits, or civil or criminal penalties. Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us. The process required by the FDA before a biological product may be approved for marketing in the United States generally involves the following: 

 | completion of preclinical laboratory tests and animal studies according to Good Laboratory Practices, or GLPs, and applicable requirements for the humane use of laboratory animals or other applicable regulations;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | submission to the FDA of an Investigational New Drug Application, or IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials according to the FDAs regulations commonly referred to as Good Clinical Practices, or GCPs, and any additional requirements for the protection of human research subjects and their health information, to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed biological product for its intended use;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | preparation and submission to the FDA of a Biologics License Application, or BLA, for marketing approval that includes substantive evidence of safety, purity, and potency from results of nonclinical testing and clinical trials;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | satisfactory completion of one or more FDA inspections of the manufacturing facility or facilities where the biological product is produced to assess compliance with cGMP to assure that the facilities, methods and controls used in product manufacture are adequate to preserve the biological products identity, strength, quality and purity and, if applicable, the FDAs current Good Tissue Practices, or GTPs, for the use of human cellular and tissue products;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | potential FDA audit of the nonclinical study and clinical trial sites that generated the data in support of the BLA;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | payment of user fees for FDA review of the BLA; and
--+----------------------------------------------------


 | FDA acceptance, review and approval, or licensure, of the BLA, which might include review by an advisory committee, a panel typically consisting of independent clinicians and other experts who provide recommendations as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Before testing any biological product candidate, including our product candidates, in humans, the product candidate must undergo rigorous the preclinical testing. Preclinical tests, also referred to as nonclinical studies, include laboratory evaluations as well as in vitro and animal studies to assess the potential safety and efficacy of the product candidate. After sufficient preclinical testing has been conducted, the conduct of the preclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements including GLPs. The clinical trial sponsor must submit an IND to the FDA before clinical testing can begin in the United States. An IND must contain the results of the preclinical tests, manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature, a proposed clinical protocol, an investigators brochure, a sample informed consent form, and other materials. Clinical trial protocols detail, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, dosing procedures, subject selection and 
 
22 


  exclusion criteria, and the parameters to be used to monitor subject safety, including stopping rules that assure a clinical trial will be stopped if certain adverse events should occur. Each protocol and any amendments to the protocol must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Some preclinical testing, such as toxicity studies, may continue even after the IND is submitted. 
 The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA raises concerns or questions regarding the proposed clinical trials or places the trial on a clinical hold within that 30-day time period. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. The FDA may also impose clinical holds on a biological product candidate at any time before or during clinical trials due to safety concerns or non-compliance. If the FDA imposes a clinical hold, trials may not recommence without FDA authorization and then only under terms authorized by the FDA. Accordingly, we cannot be sure that submission of an IND will result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to begin, or that, once begun, issues will not arise that suspend or terminate such trials. 
 Further, each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, at or servicing each institution at which the clinical trial will be conducted. An IRB is charged with protecting the welfare and rights of trial participants and considers such items as whether the risks to individuals participating in the clinical trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB also approves the form and content of the informed consent that must be signed by each clinical trial subject or his or her legal representative and must monitor the clinical trial until completed. Clinical trials involving recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid molecules also must be reviewed by an institutional biosafety committee, or IBC, a local institutional committee that reviews and oversees basic and clinical research conducted at that institution. The IBC assesses the safety of the research and identifies any potential risk to public health or the environment. 
 Clinical trials involve the administration of the biological product candidate to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of qualified investigators, generally physicians not employed by or under the trial sponsors control. Clinical trials must be conducted and monitored in accordance with the FDAs regulations comprising the GCP requirements, including the requirement that all research patients provide informed consent. 
 Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined: 
 

 | Phase 1. The biological product is initially introduced into healthy human subjects and tested for safety. In the case of some products for severe or life-threatening diseases, especially when the product may be too inherently toxic to ethically administer to healthy volunteers, the initial human testing is often conducted in patients with the target disease or condition.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Phase 2. The biological product is evaluated in a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance, optimal dosage and dosing schedule.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Phase 3. Clinical trials are undertaken to further evaluate dosage, clinical efficacy, potency, and safety in an expanded patient population, generally at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. These clinical trials are intended to generate enough data to statistically evaluate the efficacy and safety of the product for approval, to establish the overall risk to benefit profile of the product and to provide an adequate basis for product labeling.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, if at all. 
 Post-approval clinical trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These clinical trials are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication, particularly for long-term safety follow-up.
During all phases of clinical development, regulatory agencies require extensive monitoring and auditing of all clinical activities, clinical data, and clinical trial investigators. Annual progress reports detailing the results of the 
 
23 


  clinical trials must be submitted to the FDA. Written IND safety reports must be promptly submitted to the FDA, the NIH and the investigators for serious and unexpected adverse events, any findings from other studies, tests in laboratory animals or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk for human patients, or any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure. The sponsor must submit an IND safety report within 15 calendar days after the sponsor determines that the information qualifies for reporting. The sponsor also must notify the FDA of any unexpected fatal or life-threatening suspected adverse reaction within seven calendar days after the sponsors initial receipt of the information. The FDA or the sponsor or its data safety monitoring board, an independent group of experts that evaluates study data for safety and makes recommendations concerning continuation, modification, or termination of clinical trials, may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk, including risks inferred from other unrelated immunotherapy trials. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRBs requirements or if the biological product has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. 
 Because this is a relatively new and expanding area of novel therapeutic interventions, there can be no assurance as to the length of the trial period, the number of patients the FDA will require to be enrolled in the trials in order to establish the safety, efficacy, purity and potency of immunotherapy products, or that the data generated in these trials will be acceptable to the FDA to support marketing approval. 
 Concurrently with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional nonclinical studies and must also develop additional information about the physical characteristics of the biological product as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. To help reduce the risk of the introduction of adventitious agents with use of biological products, the PHSA emphasizes the importance of manufacturing control for products whose attributes cannot be precisely defined. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, the sponsor must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality, potency and purity of the final biological product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the biological product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life. 
 U.S. Review and Approval Processes 
 After the completion of clinical trials of a biological product, FDA approval of a BLA must be obtained before commercial marketing of the biological product. The BLA must include results of product development, laboratory and animal studies, human trials, information on the manufacture and composition of the product, proposed labeling and other relevant information. The testing and approval processes require substantial time and effort and there can be no assurance that the FDA will accept the BLA for filing and, even if filed, that any approval will be granted on a timely basis, if at all as the FDA has significant discretion to approve or reject the BLA and to require additional preclinical or clinical trials. 
 Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, as amended, each BLA must be accompanied by a significant user fee. The FDA adjusts the PDUFA user fees on an annual basis. PDUFA also imposes an annual program fee for approved biological products. Fee waivers or reductions are available in certain circumstances, including a waiver of the application fee for the first application filed by a small business. Additionally, no user fees are assessed on BLAs for products designated as orphan drugs, unless the product also includes a non-orphan indication. 
 Within 60 days following submission of the application, the FDA reviews a BLA submitted to determine if it is substantially complete before the agency accepts it for filing. The FDA may refuse to file any BLA that it deems incomplete or not properly reviewable at the time of submission and may request additional information. In this event, the BLA must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application also is subject 
 
24 


  to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review of the BLA. The FDA reviews the BLA to determine, among other things, whether the proposed product is safe, potent, and/or effective for its intended use, and has an acceptable purity profile, and whether the product is being manufactured in accordance with cGMP to assure and preserve the products identity, safety, strength, quality, potency and purity. The FDA may refer applications for novel biological products or biological products that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. During the biological product approval process, the FDA also will determine whether a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, is necessary to ensure that the benefits of the product outweigh its risks and to assure the safe use of the biological product, which could include medication guides, physician communication plans, or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. FDA determines the requirement for a REMS, as well as the specific REMS provisions, on a case-by-case basis. If the FDA concludes a REMS is needed, the sponsor of the BLA must submit a proposed REMS. The FDA will not approve a BLA without a REMS, if required. 
 Before approving a BLA, the FDA will inspect the facilities at which the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the product unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. For immunotherapy products, the FDA also will not approve the product if the manufacturer is not in compliance with the GTPs, to the extent applicable. These are FDA regulations and guidance documents that govern the methods used in, and the facilities and controls used for, the manufacture of human cells, tissues, and cellular and tissue based products, or HCT/Ps, which are human cells or tissue intended for implantation, transplant, infusion, or transfer into a human recipient. The primary intent of the GTP requirements is to ensure that cell and tissue based products are manufactured in a manner designed to prevent the introduction, transmission and spread of communicable disease. FDA GTP regulations also require tissue establishments to register and list their HCT/Ps with the FDA and, when applicable, to evaluate donors through screening and testing. Additionally, before approving a BLA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure that the clinical trials were conducted in compliance with IND trial requirements and GCP requirements. To assure cGMP, GTP and GCP compliance, an applicant must incur significant expenditure of time, money and effort in the areas of training, recordkeeping, production, and quality control. 
 Notwithstanding the submission of relevant data and information, the FDA may ultimately decide that the BLA does not satisfy its regulatory criteria for approval and deny approval. If the agency decides not to approve the BLA in its present form, the FDA will issue a Complete Response Letter, which generally outlines the specific deficiencies in the BLA identified by the FDA and may require additional clinical or other data or impose other conditions that must be met in order to secure final approval of the application. The deficiencies identified may be minor, for example, requiring labeling changes, or major, for example, requiring additional clinical trials. Even with the submission of additional information, the FDA may ultimately decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval. If a Complete Response Letter is issued, the applicant may either resubmit the BLA, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, or withdraw the application. 
 If a product receives regulatory approval, the approval is limited to the conditions of use (e.g., patient population, indication) described in the application. 
 Further, the FDA may require that certain contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling, or otherwise limit the scope of any approval. In addition, the FDA may require post marketing clinical trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, designed to further assess a biological products safety and effectiveness, and testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products that have been commercialized. After approval, many types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes and additional labeling claims, are subject to further testing requirements and FDA review and approval. 
 
25 


 In addition, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, or PREA, a BLA or supplement to a BLA must contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of the product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDA may grant deferrals for submission of data or full or partial waivers. 
 Post-Approval Requirements 
 Any products for which we receive FDA approvals are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, record-keeping requirements, reporting of adverse experiences with the product, providing the FDA with updated safety and efficacy information, product sampling and distribution requirements, and complying with FDA promotion and advertising requirements, which include, among others, standards for direct-to-consumer advertising, restrictions on promoting products for uses or in patient populations that are not described in the products approved uses (known as off-label use), limitations on industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities, and requirements that important safety information and material facts related to the product be disclosed. Although physicians may prescribe legally available products for off-label uses, if the physicians deem to be appropriate in their professional medical judgment, manufacturers may not market or promote such off-label uses. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability. 
 In addition, quality control and manufacturing procedures must continue to conform to applicable manufacturing requirements after approval to ensure the long-term stability of the product. We rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the production of clinical and commercial quantities of our products in accordance with cGMP regulations. cGMP regulations require among other things, quality control and quality assurance as well as the corresponding maintenance of records and documentation and the obligation to investigate and correct any deviations from cGMP. Manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved products are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP and other laws. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance. Discovery of problems with a product after approval may result in restrictions on a product, manufacturer, or holder of an approved BLA, including, among other things, recall or withdrawal of the product from the market. 
 The FDA also may require post-marketing testing, known as Phase 4 testing, and surveillance to monitor the effects of an approved product. Discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, with manufacturing processes, or the failure to comply with applicable FDA requirements can have negative consequences, including adverse publicity, judicial or administrative enforcement, complete withdrawal from the market, product recalls, warning letters from the FDA, mandated corrective advertising or communications with doctors, product seizure or detention, injunctions, and civil or criminal penalties, among others. Newly discovered or developed safety or effectiveness data may require changes to a products approved labeling, including the addition of new warnings and contraindications, and also may require the implementation of other risk management measures. Also, new government requirements, including those resulting from new legislation, may be established, or the FDAs policies may change, which could delay or prevent regulatory approval of our products under development. 
 U.S. Marketing Exclusivity 
 The Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act, or BPCIA, amended the PHSA to authorize the FDA to approve similar versions of innovative biologics, commonly known as biosimilars. Biosimilars are approved pursuant to an abbreviated pathway whereby applicants need not submit the full slate of preclinical and clinical data, and approval is based in part on the FDAs findings of safety, purity, and potency for the original biologic (i.e., the reference product). Original BLAs are eligible to receive 12 years of exclusivity from the time of first 
 
26 


  licensure of the product, which prevents the FDA from approving any biosimilars to the reference product through the abbreviated pathway, but does not prevent approval of BLAs that are accompanied by a full data package and that do not rely on the reference product. A biosimilar may be approved if the product is highly similar to the reference product notwithstanding minor differences in clinically inactive components and there are no clinically meaningful differences with the reference product in terms of the safety, purity, and potency. 
 Pediatric exclusivity is another type of regulatory market exclusivity in the United States. Pediatric exclusivity, if granted, adds six months to existing exclusivity periods and patent terms. This six-month exclusivity, which runs from the end of other exclusivity protection or patent term, may be granted based on the voluntary completion of a pediatric trial in accordance with an FDA-issued Written Request for such a trial. 
 Coverage, Pricing and Reimbursement 
 Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any product candidates for which we obtain regulatory approval. In the United States and markets in other countries, sales of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale will depend, in significant part, on the extent to which third-party payors provide coverage, and establish adequate reimbursement levels for such products. In the United States, third-party payors include federal and state healthcare programs, private managed care providers, health insurers and other organizations. The process for determining whether a third-party payor will provide coverage for a product may be separate from the process for setting the price of a product or for establishing the reimbursement rate that such a payor will pay for the product. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific products on an approved list, also known as a formulary, which might not include all of the FDA-approved products for a particular indication. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the price, examining the medical necessity of and reviewing the cost-effectiveness of medical products, therapies and services, in addition to questioning their safety and efficacy. 
 Reimbursement may impact the demand for, and/or the price of, any product candidate which obtains marketing approval. Even if coverage and reimbursement is obtained for a given product candidate by a third-party payor, the resulting reimbursement payment rates may not be adequate or may require co-payments that patients find unacceptably high. Patients who are prescribed medications for the treatment of their conditions, and their prescribing physicians, generally rely on third-party payors to reimburse all or part of the costs associated with those medications. Patients are unlikely to use a product, and physicians may be less likely to prescribe a product, unless coverage is provided and reimbursement is adequate to cover all or a significant portion of the cost of the product. Therefore, coverage and adequate reimbursement is critical to new drug product acceptance. 
 The downward pressure on health care costs in general, particularly prescription drugs and biologics, has become very intense. Governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. The marketability of any product candidates for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale may suffer if the government and third-party payors fail to provide favorable coverage and adequate reimbursement. In addition, emphasis on managed care in the United States has increased and we expect will continue to increase the pressure on healthcare pricing. Coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which we receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future. 
 Health Care Laws Governing Interactions with Healthcare Providers 
 In addition to FDA restrictions on marketing of pharmaceutical products, several other types of state and federal laws restrict our business activities, including certain marketing practices. These laws include, without limitation, anti-kickback laws, false claims laws, data privacy and security laws, as well as transparency laws regarding payments or other items of value provided to healthcare providers. 
 
27 


 The federal healthcare program Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward, or in return for, purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for the purchase, lease or order of any healthcare item, good, facility or service reimbursable, in whole or in part, under Medicare, Medicaid or other federal healthcare programs. The term remuneration has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value. This statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on the one hand and prescribers, purchasers and formulary managers on the other hand. Although there are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting certain common activities from prosecution or other regulatory sanctions, the exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly, and practices that involve remuneration that are alleged to be intended to induce prescribing, purchases or recommendations may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exception or safe harbor. Failure to meet all of the requirements of a particular applicable statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor does not make the conduct per se illegal under the federal healthcare program Anti-Kickback Statute. Instead, the legality of the arrangement will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis based on a cumulative review of all its facts and circumstances. Several courts have interpreted the statutes intent requirement to mean that if any one purpose of an arrangement involving remuneration is to induce referrals of federal healthcare covered business, the federal healthcare program Anti-Kickback Statute has been violated. Additionally, the intent standard under the federal healthcare program Anti-Kickback Statute was amended by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, collectively the Affordable Care Act, or ACA, to a stricter standard such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. In addition, the ACA codified case law that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal healthcare program Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act. 
 Federal civil and criminal false claims laws, including the civil False Claims Act, and civil monetary penalties laws, prohibit any person or entity from, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to the federal government, or knowingly making, or causing to be made, a false statement to have a false claim paid. Pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have been prosecuted under these laws for, among other things, allegedly inflating drug prices they report to pricing services, which in turn were used by the government to set Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement rates, and for allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product. In addition, certain marketing practices, including off-label promotion, may also violate false claims laws. Further, pharmaceutical manufacturers can be held liable under the False Claims Act even when they do not submit claims directly to government payors if they are deemed to cause the submission of false or fraudulent claims. 
 The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, created new federal criminal statutes that prohibit among other actions, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third- party payors, knowingly and willfully embezzling or stealing from a healthcare benefit program, willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a healthcare offense, and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Like the federal healthcare program Anti-Kickback Statute, the ACA amended the intent standard for certain healthcare fraud under HIPAA such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. 
 In addition, we may be subject to data privacy and security regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, and its implementing regulations, imposes certain requirements on covered entities, including healthcare providers, health plans and healthcare clearinghouses, as well as their respective business associates that create, receive, maintain or transmit individually identifiable health information for or on behalf of a covered entity, relating to the privacy, security, transmission and breach of 
 
28 


  individually identifiable health information. Further, HITECH also created four new tiers of civil monetary penalties, amended HIPAA to make civil and criminal penalties directly applicable to business associates, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorneys fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. 
 Additionally, the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act, created under the ACA, and its implementing regulations, require certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Childrens Health Insurance Program (with certain exceptions) to report information related to certain payments or other transfers of value provided to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors) and teaching hospitals, or to entities or individuals at the request of, or designated on behalf of, the physicians and teaching hospitals and to report annually certain ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. 
 Finally, the majority of states also have statutes or regulations similar to the aforementioned federal laws, some of which are broader in scope and apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payor. Some state laws require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industrys voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government in addition to requiring drug manufacturers to report information related to payments to clinicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures. State and foreign laws also govern the privacy and security of health information in some circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts. 
 Because of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of their exceptions and safe harbors, it is possible that business activities can be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws. The scope and enforcement of each of these laws is uncertain and subject to rapid change in the current environment of healthcare reform, especially in light of the lack of applicable precedent and regulations. Federal and state enforcement bodies have recently increased their scrutiny of interactions between healthcare companies and healthcare providers, which has led to a number of investigations, prosecutions, convictions and settlements in the healthcare industry. 
 Ensuring that business arrangements with third parties comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations is costly and time consuming. If business operations are found to be in violation of any of the laws described above or any other applicable governmental regulations a pharmaceutical manufacturer may be subject to penalties, including civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, individual imprisonment, exclusion from governmental funded healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, additional reporting obligations and oversight if subject to a corporate integrity agreement or other agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, and curtailment or restructuring of operations, any of which could adversely affect a pharmaceutical manufacturers ability to operate its business and the results of its operations. 
 Healthcare Reform Efforts 
 A primary trend in the United States healthcare industry and elsewhere is cost containment. Over the last several years, there have been federal and state proposals and legislation enacted regarding the pricing of pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical products, limiting coverage and reimbursement for drugs and other medical products, and making changes to healthcare financing and the delivery of care in the United States. 
 In March 2010, the ACA was enacted, which includes measures that have significantly changed health care financing by both governmental and private insurers. The provisions of the ACA of importance to the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry are, among others, the following: 
 

 | an annual, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports certain branded prescription drug agents or biologic agents, which is apportioned among these entities according to their market share in certain government healthcare programs;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
29 


 
 | an increase in the rebates a manufacturer must pay under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program to 23.1% and 13% of the average manufacturer price for branded and generic drugs, respectively;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | a new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program, in which manufacturers must agree to offer 50% (and 70% commencing January 1, 2019) point-of-sale discounts to negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition for the manufacturers outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | extension of manufacturers Medicaid rebate liability to covered drugs dispensed to individuals who are enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations, unless the drug is subject to discounts under the 340B drug discount program;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | expansion of eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs by, among other things, allowing states to offer Medicaid coverage to additional individuals and by adding new mandatory eligibility categories for certain individuals with income at or below 133% of the federal poverty level, thereby potentially increasing manufacturers Medicaid rebate liability;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | expansion of the entities eligible for discounts under the Public Health Service pharmaceutical pricing program;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | new requirements under the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act for drug manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value made to physicians and teaching hospitals as well as ownership or investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | establishment of a Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation at CMS to test innovative payment and service delivery models to lower Medicare and Medicaid spending, potentially including prescription drug spending; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | a licensure framework for follow on biologic products.
--+-------------------------------------------------------

 Some of the provisions of the ACA have yet to be implemented, and there have been legal and political challenges to certain aspects of the ACA. Since January 2017, President Trump has signed two executive orders and other directives designed to delay, circumvent or loosen certain requirements mandated by the ACA. Concurrently, Congress has considered legislation that would repeal or repeal and replace all or part of the ACA. While Congress has not passed repeal legislation, two bills affecting the implementation of certain taxes under the ACA have been signed into law. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, includes a provision repealing, effective January 1, 2019, the tax-based shared responsibility payment imposed by the ACA on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year that is commonly referred to as the individual mandate. Additionally, on January 22, 2018, President Trump signed a continuing resolution on appropriations for fiscal year 2018 that delayed the implementation of certain ACA- mandated fees, including the so-called Cadillac tax on certain high cost employer-sponsored insurance plans, the annual fee imposed on certain health insurance providers based on market share, and the medical device excise tax on non-exempt medical devices. Further, the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, or the BBA, among other things, amends the ACA, effective January 1,2019, to close the coverage gap in most Medicare drug plans, commonly referred to as the donut hole. Congress may consider other legislation to repeal or replace elements of the ACA. 
 In addition, other federal health reform measures have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the ACA was enacted. For example, as a result of the Budget Control Act of 2011, providers are subject to Medicare payment reductions of 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect on April 1, 2013 and, due to subsequent legislative amendments to the statute, including the BBA, will remain in effect through 2027 unless additional

  Congressional action is taken. Further, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 reduced Medicare payments to several providers and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments from providers from three to five years. The Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015 also introduced a quality payment program under which certain individual Medicare providers will be subject to certain incentives or penalties based on new program quality standards. Payment adjustments for the Medicare quality payment program will begin in 2019. At this time, it is unclear how the introduction of the quality payment program will impact overall physician reimbursement under the Medicare program. 
 Further, there has been heightened governmental scrutiny in the United States of pharmaceutical pricing practices in light of the rising cost of prescription drugs and biologics. Such scrutiny has resulted in several recent Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for products. At the federal level, the Trump administrations budget proposal for fiscal year 2019 contains further drug price control measures that could be enacted during the 2019 budget process or in other future legislation, including, for example, measures to permit Medicare Part D plans to negotiate the price of certain drugs under Medicare Part B, to allow some states to negotiate drug prices under Medicaid, and to eliminate cost sharing for generic drugs for low-income patients. While any proposed measures will require authorization through additional legislation to become effective, Congress and the Trump administration have each indicated that it will continue to seek new legislative and/or administrative measures to control drug costs. At the state level, legislatures have increasingly enacted legislation and implemented regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. In addition, regional healthcare authorities and individual hospitals are increasingly using bidding procedures to determine what pharmaceutical products and which suppliers will be included in their prescription drug and other healthcare programs. These measures could reduce the ultimate demand for our products, once approved, or put pressure on our product pricing. 
 U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, U.K. Bribery Act and Other Laws 
 The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or the FCPA, prohibits any U.S. individual or business from paying, offering, or authorizing payment or offering of anything of value, directly or indirectly, to any foreign official, political party or candidate for the purpose of influencing any act or decision of the foreign entity in order to assist the individual or business in obtaining or retaining business. The FCPA also obligates companies whose securities are listed in the United States to comply with accounting provisions requiring the company to maintain books and records that accurately and fairly reflect all transactions of the corporation, including international subsidiaries, and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls for international operations. Activities that violate the FCPA, even if they occur wholly outside the United States, can result in criminal and civil fines, imprisonment, disgorgement, oversight, and debarment from government contracts. 
 Our operations are also subject to non-U.S. anti-corruption laws such as the U.K. Bribery Act 2010, or the Bribery Act. As with the FCPA, these laws generally prohibit us and our employees and intermediaries from authorizing, promising, offering, or providing, directly or indirectly, improper or prohibited payments, or anything else of value, to government officials or other persons to obtain or retain business or gain some other business advantage. Under the Bribery Act, we may also be liable for failing to prevent a person associated with us from committing a bribery offense. 
 We are also subject to other laws and regulations governing our international operations, including regulations administered by the governments of the United Kingdom and the United States and authorities in the European Union, including applicable export control regulations, economic sanctions and embargoes on certain countries and persons, anti-money laundering laws, import and customs requirements and currency exchange regulations, collectively referred to as trade control laws.

 Failure to comply with the Bribery Act, the FCPA and other anti-corruption laws and trade control laws could subject us to criminal and civil penalties, disgorgement and other sanctions and remedial measures, and legal expenses. 
 Competition 
 The development and commercialization for new products to treat cancer, including the indications we are pursuing is highly competitive, and considerable competition exists from major pharmaceutical, biotechnology and specialty cancer companies. In addition, many of these companies have more experience in preclinical and clinical development, manufacturing, regulatory, and global commercialization. We are also competing with academic institutions, governmental agencies, and private organizations that are conducting research in the field of cancer. Competition for highly qualified employees and their retention is intense, particularly as companies adjust to the current economic environment. 
 The biopharmaceutical industry, and the rapidly evolving market for developing genetically engineered T-cells and NK cells, is characterized by intense competition and rapid innovation. Genetically engineering T-cells and NK cells faces significant competition in the CAR and TCR technology space from multiple companies and their collaborators. Two such companies have now commercialized autologous CAR+ T cells against CD19: Novartis (Kymriah for treatment of pediatric and young adult patients with relapsed/refractory B-cell precursor ALL) and Kite Pharma/Gilead (Yescarta for treatment of adult patients with relapsed/refractory DLBCL). Additional companies developing autologous CAR+ T targets include Juno Therapeutics/Celgene (CD19), bluebird bio, in collaboration with Celgene (BCMA), Nanjing Legend Biotech and Janssen Biotech, Inc., a subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson (BCMA), Kite Pharma/Gilead (BCMA), Bellicum Pharmaceuticals (PSCA), Juno Therapeutics (CD22, BCMA, WT1, MUC16, L1CAM, ROR1), Autolus Limited (BCMA and TACI), CARsgen (EGFRvIII, Claudin-18.1), Mustang Bio (CD123, IL-13Ralpha2) and Aurora BioPharma (HER2 and CMV). 
 At least one company, Cellectis is pursuing the development of allogeneic CAR+ T therapies (in collaboration with Pfizer) and CD123 which may compete with our product candidates. 
 In the TCR arena, we face competition from companies targeting shared antigens including Adaptimmune in collaboration with GlaxoSmithKline (NY ESO, MAGE-A10, MAGE-A4, AFP), Kite Pharma/Gilead (MAGE-A3/A6), Tmunity and others. Additional competitors are pursuing a vaccine platform to target neoantigens for solid tumors. This includes Advaxis/Amgen, BioNTech, Neon Therapeutics and Gritstone Oncology. Neon has also announced that they are developing a T-cell therapy against neoantigens using a technology which may compete with our product candidates. 
 Other companies are developing non-viral gene therapies including Poseida Therapeutics (piggyBac). The CRISPR technology is being developed by several competitors and is being adapted for stable integration; although this genetic approach for insertion of transgenes is not yet in the clinic. 
 We also face competition from non-cell based treatments offered by other companies such as Amgen, AstraZeneca, Bristol-Myers, Incyte, Merck, and Roche. 
 In addition, our gene therapy, immuno-oncology product Ad-RTS-hIL-12 + veledimex faces competition in glioblastoma. Immunotherapy is an attractive approach for the treatment of glioma, an aggressive cancer with few treatment options. IL-12 is among the most potent anti-cancer immune cytokines, yet carries equally significant potential for immune-mediated toxicities. Our ability to control IL-12 expression e.g., on and off and up and down using an orally activated gene switch, particularly in the brains immune privileged environment, is an advancement in the potential of this therapeutic approach. Delivery of Ad-RTS-hIL-12 is done at the time of surgery and takes approximately one minute to administer and then the patient takes an oral pill. We believe this is an important distinction between the Ziopharm immunotherapy and other immunotherapies. 
 Companies that sell marketed drugs for recurrent glioblastoma are Genentech and Roche with Avastin (bevacizumab), a vascular endothelial growth factor directed antibody indicated for the treatment of adults with

  rGBM. Arbor Pharmaceuticals markets GLIADEL Wafer which is indicated in patients with newly diagnosed high-grade malignant glioma as an adjunct to surgery and radiation and is also indicated in patients with recurrent glioblastoma multiforme as an adjunct to surgery. 
 Four companies have product candidates in Phase 3 development for the treatment of glioblastoma. Immunocellular Therapeutics is developing ICT-107, a dendritic cell immunotherapy, for the treatment of newly diagnosed glioblastoma. Tocagen is conducting a Phase 2/3 randomized, open-label study of Toca 511, a retroviral replicating vector, combined with Toca FC in subjects undergoing planned resection for recurrent glioblastoma. VBL Therapeutics is developing VB-111, an anti-angiogenic non-replicating adenovirus, combined with bevacizumab vs. bevacizumab monotherapy in patients with recurrent glioblastoma. DelMar is developing VAL-083, dianhydrogalactitol a systemic alkylating agent, in patients with recurrent glioblastoma who have failed standard temozolomide/radiation therapy and bevacizumab. 
 Other competitors with product candidates currently in Phase 2 clinical trials include Abbvies Depatus-M (ABT-414) and DNA-2401, a conditionally replicative adenovirus being evaluated in combination with pembrolizumab (KEYTRUDA®) for recurrent glioblastoma by DNATrix and Merck. Duke University is enrolling a randomized Phase 2 study of oncolytic polio/rhinovirus recombinant (PVSRIPO) alone or in combination with lomustine in recurrent WHO Grade IV malignant glioma patients. Also, MedImmune/Astra-Zenecas durvalumab was evaluated in a Phase 2 trial in patients with rGBM. 
 In addition, OncoSec is advancing IL-12 for the treatment of melanoma and has generated Phase 2 data for ImmunoPulse® IL-12 in combination with pembrolizumab. 
 Employees 
 As of February 21, 2018, we had 46 full-time employees, 33 of whom were engaged in research and development activities and 13 of whom were engaged in business development, finance, information systems, facilities, human resources or administrative support. None of our employees are subject to a collective bargaining agreement. 
Corporate Information 
 We originally incorporated in Colorado in September 1998 (under the name Net Escapes, Inc.) and later changed our name to EasyWeb, Inc. in February 1999. We re-incorporated in Delaware on May 16, 2005 under the same name. On September 13, 2005, we completed a reverse acquisition of privately held Ziopharm, Inc., a Delaware corporation. To affect this transaction, we caused ZIO Acquisition Corp., our wholly-owned subsidiary, to merge with and into Ziopharm, Inc., with Ziopharm, Inc. surviving as our wholly owned subsidiary. In accordance with the terms of the merger, the outstanding common stock of Ziopharm, Inc. automatically converted into the right to receive an aggregate of approximately 97.3% of our outstanding common stock (after giving effect to the transaction). Following the merger, we caused Ziopharm, Inc. to merge with and into us and we changed our name to Ziopharm Oncology, Inc. Although EasyWeb, Inc. was the legal acquirer in the transaction, we accounted for the transaction as a reverse acquisition under generally accepted accounting principles. As a result, Ziopharm, Inc. became the registrant with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC, and the historical financial statements of Ziopharm, Inc. became our historical financial statements. 
 Our principal executive offices are located at One First Avenue, Parris Building 34, Navy Yard Plaza, Boston, Massachusetts 02129, and our telephone number is (617) 259-1970.
