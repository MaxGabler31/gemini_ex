 Our Business 
 We are a global provider of 3D printing machines and 3D printed and other products, materials and services to industrial customers. Our business primarily consists of manufacturing and selling 3D printing machines and printing products to specification for our customers using our installed base of 3D printing machines. Our machines serve direct and indirect applications.  Direct printing produces a component; indirect printing makes a tool to produce a component. We offer pre-production collaboration and print products for customers through our network of PSCs and EACs. We also supply the associated materials, including consumables and replacement parts, and other services, including training and technical support, that are necessary for purchasers of our 3D printing machines to print products. We believe that our ability to print in a variety of industrial materials, as well as our industry-leading volumetric output (as measured by build box size and printing speed), uniquely position us to serve the needs of industrial customers. 
 Our History 
 Our business began as the advanced manufacturing business of the Extrude Hone Corporation, which manufactured its first 3D printing machine in 2003 using licensed technology developed by researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (“MIT”). 
 1


In 2005, our business assets were transferred to The Ex One Company, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, when Extrude Hone Corporation was purchased by another company. In 2007, we were acquired by S. Kent Rockwell through his wholly-owned company, Rockwell Forest Products, Inc. On January 1, 2013, the Company was formed when The Ex One Company, LLC was merged with and into a newly created Delaware corporation, which changed its name to The ExOne Company. On February 12, 2013, we completed our initial public offering, raising approximately $90.4 million in unrestricted net proceeds after underwriting commissions and offering costs. Subsequent secondary offerings of our common stock have resulted in raising approximately $78.0 million in additional unrestricted net proceeds after underwriting commissions and offering costs.
 The Additive Manufacturing Industry and 3D Printing 
 3D printing is the most common type of an emerging manufacturing technology that is broadly referred to as additive manufacturing (“AM”). In general, AM is a term used to describe a manufacturing process that produces 3D objects directly from digital or computer models through the repeated deposit of very thin layers of material. 3D printing is the process of joining materials from a digital 3D model, usually layer by layer, to make objects using a printhead, nozzle, or other printing technology. The terms “AM” and “3D printing” are increasingly being used interchangeably, as the media and marketplace have popularized the term 3D printing rather than AM, which is the industry term. 
 AM represents a transformational shift from traditional forms of manufacturing (e.g., machining or tooling), which are sometimes referred to as subtractive manufacturing. We believe that AM and 3D printing are increasingly poised to displace traditional manufacturing methodologies in a growing range of industrial applications. Our 3D printing process differs from other forms of 3D printing processes, in that we use a chemical binding agent and focus on industrial applications. 
 AM has focused on prototyping and small, limited production in order to find acceptance of its varying technologies by end users in order to convince users of traditional methods of the viability of such new applications. As AM has evolved, the focus has evolved into production readiness and increasing reliability and repeatability standards associated with higher volumetric output and specifications that industrial applications demand.
 ExOne and 3D Printing  
 We provide 3D printed and other products, materials and services primarily to industrial customers and other end-market users. We are an early entrant into the AM industrial products market, which we believe provides us with a competitive advantage over future entrants. 
 Our binder jetting technology was developed over 20 years ago by researchers at MIT. Our 3D printing machines build or print products from computer-aided drafting (“CAD”) models by depositing successive thin layers of particles of materials such as silicate sand or metal powder in a “build box.” A moveable printhead passes over each layer and deposits a chemical binding agent in the selected areas where the finished product will be materialized. Each layer can be unique. 
 Depending on the industrial material used in printing, printed products may need post-production processing. We generally use silica sand or foundry sand for casting, both of which typically require no additional processing. Products printed in other materials, such as metals, or for use in specific applications, may need varying amounts of heat treating or sintering, drying or curing, or other post-processing or finishing.
 Pre-Print. We believe that our customers have the opportunity to take greater advantage of the design freedom that our 3D printing technology provides. We collaborate with our customers to develop and refine CAD designs that meet our customers’ specifications and can be read and processed by our 3D printing machines. We continue to invest in additional pre-print capabilities and resources that empower our customers to fully exploit the design freedom of 3D printing. 
 Industrial Materials. We supply printing materials to our customers that have been qualified for use with our machines. As we experience increased demand for our products globally, it is essential that the material supply chain and distribution channels be in close proximity to our current and prospective customers. For the highest quality printed products, the sand grains and metal particles used in the 3D printing process must be uniform in size and meet very specific tolerances. We continue to focus on material development activities associated with our 3D printing process, including collaborative arrangements with customers targeted at local supply resources. In addition, we have specifically targeted fine powder printing with respect to our direct printing technologies as one of our strategic priorities as an organization.
 Our Machines. Our 3D printing machines consist of a build box that includes a machine platform and a computer processor controlling the printheads for applying layers of industrial materials and binding agents. We currently build our 3D printing machines in both Germany and the United States. Our machines serve direct and indirect applications.  Direct printing produces a component; indirect printing makes a tool to produce a component. Our focus is on enhancing our existing machine technologies and developing large format printers for both direct and indirect applications, with specific emphasis on fine powder printing for our direct technologies.
 Our 3D printing machines are used primarily to manufacture industrial products that are ordered in relatively low volumes, are highly complex and have a high value to the customer. Our technology is not appropriate for the mass production of simple parts, such as certain higher volume injection molded parts or certain higher volume parts made in metal stamping machines. Traditional manufacturing technology is more economical in making those parts. While we expect over time to be able to increase the kinds of parts that we can make more economically than using subtractive manufacturing, we do not ever expect to use our technology to make simple, low-cost, mass-produced parts. 
 2


Post-Print Processing. After a product is printed, the bound and unbound powder in the build box requires curing of the chemical binding agent. For indirect printing of sand molds and cores, curing may occur at room temperature and the printed product is complete after the binder is cured. For certain binder types, a drying process (utilizing an industrial microwave or other means) may be necessary. The mold or core is then poured at a foundry, yielding the finished metal product. We believe that our casting technology offers a number of advantages over traditional casting methods, including increased yield, weight reduction and improved thermal range. 
 For direct printing, the product needs to be either sintered, or sintered and infiltrated. With sintering, the product is placed into a furnace in an inert atmosphere to sinter the bonded particles and form a strong bonded porous structure. The porous structure can be further infiltrated with another material to fill the voids. After the sintering and infiltration, the product can be polished and finished with a variety of standard industrial methods and coatings. We believe that our 3D printing capabilities enable customers to develop the ideal design for products, freeing them of some of the design constraints inherent in traditional manufacturing, in the industrial metal of choice and in a more efficient manner than traditional manufacturing methods. 
 Customers and Sales 
 Our Customers
 Our customers are located primarily in the Americas, Europe/Middle East/Africa (“EMEA”) and Asia Pacific regions. We are a party to non-disclosure agreements with many of our customers and, therefore, are often prohibited from disclosing many of our customers’ identities. Our customers include a number of Fortune 500 companies that are leaders in their respective markets, as well as mid-cap and smaller public and private companies. During 2018 and 2017, we conducted a significant portion of our business with a limited number of customers, though not necessarily the same customers for each respective period. During 2018 and 2017, our five most significant customers represented approximately 16.5% and 20.5% of our total revenue, respectively. During 2018 and 2017, there were no customers that individually represented 10.0% or greater of our total revenue. Sales of 3D printing machines are low volume, but generate significant revenue based on their per-unit pricing. Generally, sales of 3D printing machines are to different customers in each respective period. The timing of such sales may be dependent on various factors, including a customer’s capital budgeting cycle, its facility preparedness and the terms of the underlying arrangement with a customer (including certain substantive acceptance provisions) which may vary from period to period. The nature of our revenue from 3D printing machines does not leave us dependent upon a single or a limited number of customers. Sales of 3D printed and other products, materials and services generally result in a significantly lower aggregate price per order as compared to 3D printing machine sales. The nature of the revenue from 3D printed and other products, materials and services does not leave us dependent upon a single or a limited number of customers.
Educating Our Customers
 Educating our customers and raising awareness in our target markets about the many uses and benefits of our 3D printing technology is an important part of our sales process. We believe that customers who experience the efficiency gains, decreased lead-time, increased design flexibility, and decreased cost potential of 3D printing, as compared to subtractive manufacturing, are more likely to purchase our 3D printing machines and be repeat customers of our products and services. We educate our customers on the design freedom, speed, and other benefits of 3D printing by providing printing and design services and support through our PSCs and EACs. We also seek to expose key potential users to our products through our PSCs and EACs, installed machines at customers’ locations, university programs, and sales and marketing efforts. Additionally, our EACs provide our customers exposure to a greater variety of our latest machine platforms and material sets. 
Production Service Centers and ExOne Adoption Centers 
 We have established a network of PSCs and EACs in North Huntingdon, Pennsylvania; Troy, Michigan; Gersthofen, Germany; and Kanagawa, Japan. Each of our PSCs and EACs are certified to ISO 9001:2015 standards with various scopes. Through our PSCs and EACs, we provide sales and marketing and delivery of support and printing services to our customers. Our customers see our 3D printing machines in operation and can evaluate their production capabilities before ordering a 3D printing machine or a printed product or service. While our centers are scalable and have a well-defined footprint that can be easily replicated to serve additional regional markets, we are focusing on enhancing our existing centers to enable adoption rather than geographic expansion. As described below, enhancing our positon in strategic locations around the world is an important part of our business strategy. 
 For all customers, we offer the following support and services through our PSCs and EACs: 
  
• | Pre-production Collaboration. Our pre-print services include data capture using software that enables customers to translate their product vision into a digital design format that can be used as an input to our 3D printing equipment. We help our customers successfully move from the design stage to the production stage, and help customers evaluate the optimal design and industrial materials for their production needs. For example, we worked with a customer to design and manufacture certain critical parts of a helicopter that significantly improved the weight-strength ratio for the related parts, which was possible because of the flexibility and precision of our AM process. Our 3D printing machines are also able to deliver a replacement for a product broken by the customer rapidly or often immediately because we will already have the production computer file. Using subtractive manufacturing would take significantly longer.

• | Training and Technical Support. Our technicians train customers to use our 3D printing machines through hands-on experience at our PSCs and EACs and provide field support to our customers, including design assistance, education on industrial materials, operations and printing training, instruction on cleaning, and maintenance and troubleshooting.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Aftermarket. We generally offer a standard warranty with the sale of our 3D printing machines. Thereafter, we offer a variety of service and support plans.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our Competitive Strengths 
 We believe that our competitive strengths include: 
  
• | Volumetric Output Rate. We believe that our 3D printing machines provide us the highest rate of volume output per unit of time among competing AM technologies. Because of our early entrance into the industrial market for AM and our investment in our core 3D printing technology, we have been able to improve the printhead speed and build box size of our 3D printing machines. As a result, we have made strides in improving the output efficiency of our 3D printing machines, as measured by volume output per unit of time. With continued advances in our core 3D printing technologies, we believe that our cost of production will continue to decline, increasing our ability to compete with subtractive manufacturing processes, particularly for complex products, effectively expanding our addressable market.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Printing Platform Size. The size of the build box area and the platform upon which we construct a product is important to industrial customers who may want to either make a high number of products per job run or make an industrial product that has large dimensions and is heavy in final form. We believe that our technology and experience give us the potential to develop large build platforms to meet the production demands of current and potential industrial customers. In addition, we have created machine platforms in various size ranges in order to cater to the varying demands of our customers.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Industrial Materials. Our indirect 3D printing machines are able to manufacture sand molds and cores from specialty sands and ceramics, which are the traditional materials for these casting products. Our direct 3D printing machines are capable of printing in a variety of industrial metals and other materials. We are in varying stages of qualifying additional industrial materials for both indirect and direct applications and advancing materials that are printable in our machines, including fine powder capability development.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Chemical Binding. We use liquid chemical binding agents during the printing process. We believe that our unique chemical binding agent technology can more readily achieve efficiency gains over time than other AM technologies, such as laser-fusing technologies.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | International Presence. Since our inception, we have structured our business to cater to major international markets. We have strategically established one or more PSCs or EACs in each of the Americas, EMEA and Asia Pacific regions. Because many of our current or potential customers are global industrial companies, it is important that we have a presence in or near the areas where these companies have manufacturing facilities.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our Business Strategy 
 The principal elements of our growth strategy include: 
  
• | Increase the Efficiency and Capabilities of Our Machines to Expand the Addressable Market. We intend to invest in further developing our machine technology so as to increase the volumetric output per unit of time that our machines can produce for both direct and indirect applications. We also intend to invest in continued advancements to the core capabilities of our equipment, which include broadening the range of material particle sizes that can be printed in our equipment (with particular emphasis on fine powder capabilities for direct printing technologies), enhancing real-time process monitoring, improving material handling, and improving overall machine post-printing productivity.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Qualify New Industrial Materials Printable In Our Systems. Our 3D printing machines are used for both development and commercial printing. We believe that the variety of materials printable in our printing systems is more diverse than competing 3D printing technologies. By expanding both qualified and printable materials (with particular emphasis on fine powder capabilities for direct printing technologies), we believe we can expand our market share and better serve our industrial customer base.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Reduce Overall Costs of Operating Our Machines. We continue to reduce costs associated with operating our 3D printing machines. We collaborate with customers and suppliers to qualify locally-based, lower cost printing materials. We seek to reduce the cost of ownership of our 3D printing machines by targeting reductions in consumable materials cost and replacement part cost for our 3D printing machines. We use a variety of means, including traditional supply chain and development projects, to reduce those costs. We believe as we lower the cost of ownership of our 3D printing machines, we will improve the adoption rate by forming more cost-efficient production processes.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

• | Advance Pre-Print Design and Post-Print Processing Capabilities to Accelerate the Growth of Our 3D Printing Technology. Our next generation 3D printing machine platforms have achieved the volumetric output rate and quality necessary to serve industrial markets on a production scale. We believe that there is an opportunity to similarly advance the pre-print and post-print processing phases of product materialization to more fully exploit the transformative power of our 3D printing machines and drive growth. These opportunities relate to both direct and indirect printing. For direct printing, we believe that enhancing pre-print processes, notably design optimization tools and suitable print material availability, can greatly accelerate our capture of market share. Additionally, enhancements to post-print processing will increase the applications for printed products. In indirect printing utilizing 3D printed molds and cores, advanced performance casting technologies can be leveraged to increase yields and reduce weight of casted products. To promote this advantage to the market, we have developed a suite of processes, many of which are proprietary, for producing high-quality castings.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Pursue Growth Opportunities Through Alliances and/or Strategic Investments. We may opportunistically identify and, through alliances and/or strategic investment, integrate and advance complementary businesses, technologies and capabilities. Our goal is to expand the functionality of our products, provide access to new customers and markets, and increase our production capacity.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Marketing and Sales 
 We market our products under the ExOne brand name in three major geographic regions — the Americas, EMEA and Asia Pacific. Our sales are made primarily by our global sales force. Our sales force is augmented, in certain territories, by representatives with specific industry or territorial expertise. Even where we are supported by a representative, substantially all of our product and service offerings provided by our PSCs and EACs are sold directly to customers by us. 
 We believe that our direct selling relationship helps to create one of the building blocks for our business — the creation of true collaboration between us and industrial customers who are interested in 3D printing. Increasingly, industrial producers are considering shifting from subtractive manufacturing techniques to 3D printing. Our marketing efforts include educating potential customers about 3D printing technology through collaboration, starting with pre-production services and continuing with production and technical support at our PSCs and EACs. 
 Suppliers 
 Our largest suppliers in 2018, based upon dollar volume of purchases, were Bauer GmbH & Co KG, Fuji Film Dimatix, ASK Chemicals, Astro Manufacturing & Design and Erhardt & Leimer GmbH. 
 We buy our industrial materials from several suppliers and, except as set forth below, the loss of any one would not materially adversely affect our business. We currently have a single supplier of certain printhead components for our 3D printing machines. While we believe that this printhead component supplier is replaceable, in the event of the loss of this supplier, we could experience delays and interruptions that might adversely affect the financial performance of our business. Additionally, we obtain certain pre-production services through design and data capture providers, and certain post-production services though vendors with whom we have existing and good relationships. The loss of any one of these providers or vendors would not materially adversely affect our business. 
 Research and Development 
 We spent approximately $10.7 million and $9.9 million on research and development during 2018 and 2017, respectively. We expect to continue to invest in our research and development activities in the future. 
 A significant portion of our research and development expenditures have been focused on the following: 
  
• | Chemistry of print materials and binder formulation;
--+-----------------------------------------------------


• | Mechanics of droplet flight into beds of powder;
--+-------------------------------------------------


• | Metallurgy of thermally processing metals that are printed through AM;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Mechanical design elements of our 3D printing machines;
--+--------------------------------------------------------


• | Mechanics of spreading powders in a job box;
--+---------------------------------------------


• | Evaluation of product applications utilizing our 3D printing machines;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Transfer of digital data through a series of software links to drive a printhead; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Synchronizing all of the above to print ever-increasing volumes of material per unit time.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Intellectual Property 
 Patents and Licenses. Significant portions of our technology are covered by a variety of patents. Through December 31, 2016, we were the worldwide licensee of certain patents held by MIT for certain AM printing processes (the “MIT Patents”), with exclusive rights to practice the patents in certain fields including the application of the printing processes to metals (with sublicensing rights), 
 5


and non-exclusive rights to practice the patents in certain fields including the application of the printing processes to certain non-metals (without sublicensing rights) which gave us a significant head start in the AM industry. 
 We continue from time to time to evaluate our current licenses and patents. On March 1, 2018, our ExOne GmbH subsidiary notified Voxeljet AG that it has materially breached a 2003 Patent and Know-How Transfer Agreement and asserted its rights to set off damages as a result of the breaches against the annual license fee that we pay to Voxeljet AG under the agreement.
 We hold patents as a result of our own technological developments. Our patents were issued in the United States and in various foreign jurisdictions, including Germany and Japan. As a result of our commitment to research and development, we also have applied for other patents for equipment, processes, materials and 3D printing applications in the United States and in various foreign countries. The expiration dates of our patents range from 2023 to 2036. We are also a minority owner of patent rights of several patents in the United States and in various foreign jurisdictions as a successor interest to a 2003 agreement made between Generis GmbH and Extrude Hone GmbH.
 We have developed know-how and trade secrets relative to our 3D printing technology and believe that our early entrance into the industrial market provides us with a timing and experience advantage. Through our investment in our technology, we have been able to qualify industrial materials for use in our 3D printing machines and we intend to continue such efforts. In addition, we have taken steps to protect much of our technology as a trade secret. Given the significant steps that we have taken to establish our experience in AM for industrial applications, as well as our ongoing commitment to research and development, we intend to maintain our preeminent position in the AM industry market.
Trademarks. We have registrations in the United States for the following trademarks: EXONE, X1 ExOne Digital Part Materialization (plus design), EXCAST, EXMAL, EXTEC, INNOVENT, M-FLEX, M-PRINT, S MAX, S-MAX, S-PRINT, X1, and X1-LAB. We also have an application in the United States for registration pending for the following trademarks: INNOVENT+ and X1 25PRO. We also have registrations for EXONE in Canada, China, Europe (Community Trade Mark), Japan, and South Korea. We have registrations for X1 ExOne Digital Part Materialization (plus design) in Brazil, Canada, China, Europe (Community Trade Mark), Japan, and South Korea. We have a registration for the mark X1 in Europe (Community Trade Mark). We have registrations for a stylized form of X1 in Europe (Community Trade Mark). We have registrations for DIGITAL PART MATERIALIZATION in Japan and South Korea. We have registrations for the trademarks EXERIAL, INNOVENT, M-FLEX, S-MAX, and S-PRINT in Europe (Community Trade Mark). We also have registration for the trademark S-PRINT in Canada, China, and Japan.
 Trade Secrets. The development of our products, processes and materials has involved a considerable amount of experience, manufacturing and processing know-how and research and development techniques that are not easily duplicated. We protect this knowledge as a trade secret through the confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements which all employees, customers and consultants are required to sign at the time they are employed or engaged by us. Additional information related to the risks associated with our intellectual property rights are described within Item 1A, “Risk Factors” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
Competition 
 Other companies are active in the market for 3D printing products and services. These companies use a variety of AM methods, including: 
  
• | Material extrusion;
--+--------------------


• | Material jetting;
--+------------------


• | Powder bed fusion;
--+-------------------


• | Directed energy deposition;
--+----------------------------


• | Vat photopolymerization;
--+-------------------------


• | Sheet lamination; and
--+----------------------


• | Binder jetting
--+---------------

 Some of the companies that have developed and employ one or more AM technologies include: 3D Systems Corporation, Stratasys Inc., HP Inc., Desktop Metal, EOS GmbH, EnvisionTEC, Concept Laser, Solid Model Ltd., Viridus3d, Voxeljet AG and General Electric Co.
 Some of these processes and companies compete with some of the products and services that we provide. Despite the challenging competitive landscape, we believe that we are the only AM printing solutions provider that focuses primarily on metal industrial applications on a production scale. Our competitive advantages, including the size of our build platforms, the speed of our printheads, the variety of materials used by industrial manufacturers in which we can print, the industry qualification of many of the materials we print in, our robust market capabilities, our considerable global installed base of 3D printing machines, and our suite of machine system families offering scale and flexibility, also serve to differentiate us from the other competitors in the AM market. 
 6


We also compete with established subtractive manufacturers in the industrial products market. These companies often provide large-scale, highly capitalized facilities that are designed or built to fill specific production purposes, usually mass production. However, we believe that we are well positioned to expand our share of the industrial products market from these manufacturers as AM gains recognition. As our technologies improve and our unit cost of production decreases, we expect to be able to compete with subtractive manufacturing on a wide range of products, thereby expanding our addressable market. 
 Seasonality 
 Purchases of our 3D printing machines are often subject to the capital expenditure cycles of our customers. Generally, 3D printing machine sales are higher in our third and fourth quarters than in our first and second quarters; however, as acceptance of our 3D printing machines as a credible alternative to traditional methods of production grows, we expect to limit the seasonality we experience. 
Backlog 
 At December 31, 2018, our backlog was approximately $12.3 million, of which approximately $9.6 million is expected to be fulfilled during the next twelve months. At December 31, 2017, our backlog was approximately $21.3 million. 
Environmental Matters 
 Compliance with federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment has not had a material impact on capital expenditures, earnings or the competitive position of us and our subsidiaries. We are not the subject of any legal or administrative proceeding relating to the environmental laws of the United States or any country in which we have an office. We have not received any notices of any violations of any such environmental laws. 
Employees
