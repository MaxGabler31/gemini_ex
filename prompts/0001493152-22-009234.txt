DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS
 
The financial statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K as well as the description of our business contained herein, unless otherwise indicated, principally reflect the status of our business and the results of our operations as of December 31, 2021.
COVID–19 Pandemic
 
Since early 2020, economies throughout the world have been and continue to be disrupted by the continuing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, which may limit access to our management, support staff and professional advisors. In addition, the capital markets have experienced disruptions and our efforts to raise necessary capital may be adversely impacted by the continuing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. We cannot forecast with any certainty when the disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic will cease to impact our business and the results of our operations. In reading this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including our discussion of our ability to continue as a going concern set forth herein, in each case, consider the additional uncertainties caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. These factors may not only impact our operations, financial condition and our ability to raise capital to support our operations but our overall ability to react timely to mitigate the impact of this event. Furthermore, it may hamper our efforts to comply with our filing obligations with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”).

Overview
 
Historically, the Company has been an oil and natural gas exploration, development and production company, which was primarily in the business of drilling and operating oil and gas wells. From 2009 to 2020, the Company had pursued the exploration of potential oil and gas resources in the United States and in the Perlas and Tyra concession blocks in offshore Nicaragua in the Caribbean Sea (the “Concessions”), which contain a total of approximately 1.4 million acres. In January 2020, the Company decided to cease its activities, exploration and production in the Concessions.
 
Recently, the Company has changed its focus to include the exploration and development of noble gas and rare earth minerals. Noble gases and rare earth minerals are generally present in either the natural gas or brine water produced by conventional oil and gas wells. Therefore, we are now focusing on exploration and development of areas that may contain noble gas and rare earth mineral reserves in addition to exploration and development of traditional oil and gas.
 
The Company is assessing various opportunities and strategic alternatives involving the acquisition, exploration and development of natural gas and oil properties in the United States that may include noble gases and rare earth minerals, including the possibility of acquiring businesses or assets that provide support services for the production of oil, gas, noble gas and rare earth minerals in the United States.
 
Acquisition of Kansas Oil and Gas Properties
 
On April 1, 2021, we completed the acquisition of the production and mineral rights/leasehold for oil and gas properties, subject to overriding royalties to third parties, in the Central Kansas Uplift geological formation covering over 11,000 contiguous acres (the “Properties”). In addition to the Properties, the assets purchased included existing production equipment, infrastructure and ownership of 11 square miles of existing 3-D seismic data on the acreage. The Properties include a horizontal producing well, horizontal saltwater injection well, conventional saltwater disposal well and two conventional vertical producing wells, which currently produce oil from the Reagan Sand zone (a Cambrian age formation producing heavy oil) at an approximate depth of 3,600 feet.
 
We have commenced with certain rework to the existing production wells subsequent to the acquisition of the Properties and intend to continue doing so during 2022. We plan to develop the Properties’ existing oil and gas reserves, including the exploration for the existence of new oil and gas zones and other mineral reserves, in particular the Noble gases, that the Properties may hold.
 
Farmout Agreement to Explore and Develop Unconventional Gas and Brine Materials in the Hugoton Gas Field
 
On April 4, 2022, the Company acquired a 40% interest in a joint venture (the “AMGAS JV”) that has a farmout agreement (the “Farmout Agreement”) with Scout Energy Management, LLC (“Scout”) with regards to the oil and gas interests of Scout in the Hugoton Gas Field, located in Haskell and Finney Counties, Kansas. The Farmout Agreement covers drilling and completion of up to 50 wells, with the first exploratory well scheduled to begin in April 2022. The AMGAS JV will utilize Scout’s existing infrastructure assets, including water disposal, gas gathering and helium processing. In addition, the Farmout Agreement provides the AMGAS JV with rights to take in-kind and market its share of helium at the tailgate of Jayhawk Gas Plant, located in Grant County, Kansas, which will enable the AMGAS JV to market and sell the helium produced at prevailing market prices.
 
The AMGAS JV also acquired the right to all brine minerals, subject to a ten percent (10%) royalty to Scout, across Finney and Haskell Counties. Brine minerals are harvested from the formation water produced from active, and to be drilled, oil and gas wells and may include a variety of dissolved minerals, including bromine and iodine. The AMGAS JV plans to target brine minerals with commercial quantities of bromine and iodine. The AMGAS JV is currently developing proprietary technology to recover brine minerals, particularly with respect to bromine, which is well underway and has demonstrated recovery efficiency and is expected to be available for use in existing and future development wells. The Farmout Agreement covers drilling and completion of up to 50 wells, with the first exploratory well scheduled to be spudded in April 2022. The AMGAS JV will utilize Scout’s existing infrastructure assets including water disposal, gas gathering and helium processing as part of the Farmout Agreement. The Farmout Agreement provides our JV with rights to take in-kind, and market its share of helium at the tailgate of Jayhawk Gas Plant. AMGAS JV will be able to market and sell the helium produced at prevailing market prices by taking its helium in-kind.

Nicaraguan Concessions
 
We began pursuing an oil and gas exploration opportunity in offshore Nicaragua in the Caribbean Sea in 1999. Since then, we have built relationships with the Instituto Nicaraguense de Energia (“INE”) and undertook the geological and geophysical research that helped us to become one of only six companies qualified to bid on offshore blocks in the first international bidding round held by INE in January 2003.
 
On March 5, 2009, we acquired the Concessions. After the acquisition of the Concessions, we conducted an environmental study and developed geological information from the reprocessing and additional evaluation of existing 2-D seismic data of the Concessions. In April 2013, the Nicaraguan government formally approved our environmental impact assessment, at which time we had commenced significant activity under an initial work plan involving the acquisition of new seismic data on the Concessions. We undertook seismic shoots during late 2013 that resulted in the acquisition of new 2-D and 3-D seismic data and had reviewed it to select initial drilling sites for exploratory wells.
 
We were in default of various provisions of the Concessions agreements for several years and the Nicaraguan government subsequently terminated the Concessions agreements. We had been seeking a resolution of these defaults, including the ability to renew and/or renegotiate the terms of the Concessions contracts, with the Nicaraguan government to permit us to cure such defaults. However, the Nicaraguan political climate and domestic issues, as well other factors, caused the Company to abandon such efforts and the Concessions in 2020. As a result, as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the Concessions agreements are no longer in effect and the Company has abandoned all of its efforts to renew and/or renegotiate the terms of the Concessions agreements with the Nicaraguan government to cure such defaults.

Acquisition of Kansas Oil and Gas Properties
 
On July 31, 2019, we acquired an option (the “Option”) from Core Energy, LLC, a closely held company (“Core”), to purchase the production and mineral rights/leasehold of the Properties. We paid a non-refundable deposit of $50,000 to bind the Option, which provided us the right to acquire the Properties for $2.5 million prior to December 31, 2019, which right was not exercised. On September 2, 2020, the Company acquired a new option from Core under similar terms as the previous Option, which permitted the Company to purchase the Properties at a reduced price of $900,000 at any time prior to November 1, 2020 and the Company agreed to immediately conduct a capital raise of between approximately $2-10 million to fund its acquisition and development of the Properties. On December 14, 2020, the parties executed an asset purchase and sale agreement (the “Asset Purchase Agreement”) which extended the new option to January 11, 2021.
 
We and Core, as well as all of the members of Core, Mandalay LLC and Coal Creek Energy, LLC (entered into a side letter agreement on September 2, 2020 and a second side letter on March 31, 2021 (collectively, the “Side Letters”), pursuant to which we and Core agreed to set the closing date of the acquisition of the Properties under the Asset Purchase Agreement, to April 1, 2021. Pursuant to the Side Letters, the Company is responsible for reimbursing Core, Mandalay LLC and Coal Creek Energy, LLC for certain prorated revenues and expenses from January 1, 2021 through April 1, 2021.
 
On April 1, 2021, we completed the acquisition of the Properties, under the same terms of the Asset Purchase Agreement. The purchase of the Properties included the existing production equipment, infrastructure and ownership of 11 square miles of existing 3-D seismic data on the acreage. The Properties include a horizontal producing well, horizontal saltwater injection well, conventional saltwater disposal well and two conventional vertical producing wells, which currently produce from the Reagan Sand Zone with an approximate depth of 3,600 feet.

Following the acquisition, we commenced rework of the existing production wells of the Properties and have performed testing and evaluation of the existence of noble gas reserves on the Properties including helium, argon and other rare earth minerals/gases. Testing of the Properties for noble gas reserves has provided encouraging but not conclusive results and the Company has yet to determine the possibility of commercializing the noble gas reserves on the Properties. The Company plans to assess the Properties existing oil and gas reserves while continuing the evaluation of the existence of new oil and gas zones and other mineral reserves and specifically the noble gas reserves that the Properties may hold.
 
Farmout Agreement to Explore and Develop Unconventional Gas and Brine Materials in the Hugoton Gas Field
 
On April 4,  2022, the Company acquired a 40% interest in the AMGAS JV that holds the Farmout Agreement with Scout with regards to its oil and gas interests in the Hugoton Gas Field, located in Haskell and Finney Counties, Kansas.
 
The Farmout Agreement covers drilling and completion of up to 50 wells. The AMGAS JV will utilize Scout’s existing infrastructure assets, including water disposal, gas gathering and helium processing. In addition, the Farmout Agreement provides the AMGAS JV with rights to take in-kind and market its share of helium at the tailgate of Jayhawk Gas Plant, located in Grant County, Kansas, which will enable the AMGAS JV to market and sell the helium produced at prevailing market prices.
 
The AMGAS JV also acquired the right to all brine minerals subject to a ten percent (10%) royalty to Scout, across Finney and Haskell Counties. Brine minerals are harvested from the formation water produced from active, and to be drilled, oil and gas wells and may include a variety of dissolved minerals including bromine and iodine. The AMGAS JV plans to target brine minerals with commercial quantities of bromine and iodine. AMGAS, pursuant to the terms of the USNG Letter Agreement (as defined below), is currently developing proprietary technology to recover brine minerals, particularly with respect to bromine, which is well underway and has demonstrated recovery efficiency and is expected to be available for use in existing and future development wells.
 
The first exploratory well is scheduled to commence in April 2022 near Garden City, Kansas with a goal to evaluate the first of two separate silty shale members of the Chase group of formations – the Gage Shale and the Holmesville Shale. These two shale members have not previously been targeted for exploration by historical operations in the field.
 
The exploration and development activities will be directed and coordinated under the terms of the USNG Letter Agreement (as defined below) entered in November 2021 with input from the Board of Advisors (as defined below).
 
USNG Letter Agreement
 
On November 9, 2021, the Company entered into a letter agreement (the “USNG Letter Agreement”) with U.S. Noble Gas, LLC (“USNG”), pursuant to which USNG would provide consulting services to the Company for exploration, testing, refining, production, marketing and distribution of various potential reserves of noble gases and rare earth element/minerals on the Properties. The USNG Letter Agreement would cover all of the noble gas, specifically helium, and rare earth elements/minerals potentially existing on the Properties and the future acquisitions of the Company, if any, including the Hugoton Gas Field.
 
The USNG Letter Agreement also provided that USNG would supply a large vessel designed for flows up to 5,000 barrels of water per day at low pressures, known as a gas extraction/separator unit. The gas extraction/separator unit is a dewatering vessel that the Company may use for multiple wells in the future.
 
The USNG Letter Agreement required the Company to establish a four-member board of advisors (the “Board of Advisors”) comprised of various experts in noble gas and rare earth elements/minerals. The Board of Advisors will help attract both industry partners and financial partners for developing a large helium, noble gas and/or rare earth element/mineral resources that may exist in the region where the Company currently operates. The industry partners would include helium, noble gas and/or rare earth element/mineral purchasers and exploration and development companies from the energy industry. The financial partners may include large family offices or small institutions.

The Company is required to pay USNG a $8,000 monthly cash fee beginning at the onset of commercial helium or minerals production and sales, subject to certain thresholds. Such monthly fees will become due and payable for any month that AMGAS receives cash receipts in excess of $25,000 derived from the sale of noble gases and/or rare earth elements/minerals. The Company has not yet achieved the $25,000 cash receipts threshold, therefore there has been no payment or accrual liability relative to this cash fee provision as of December 31, 2021.
 
[The USNG Letter Agreement has an initial term of 5 years, which shall thereafter continue for successive one-year periods, provided that there is no uncured breach, unless otherwise terminated by either party upon a written notice of intent to non-renew.]
 
In consideration for the consulting services to be rendered and pursuant to the terms of the USNG Letter Agreement, the Company issued warrants to purchase, in the aggregate, 2,060,000 shares of Common Stock, at an exercise price of $0.50 to three of USNG’s principal consultants and four third-party service providers. The Company also issued warrants to purchase, in the aggregate, 1,200,000 shares of Common Stock at $0.50 per share exercise price to three members of the Board of Advisors. The Company granted a total of 3,260,000 warrants to purchase its Common Stock with an exercise price of $0.50 per share in connection with the USNG Letter Agreement and the arrangements described therein. The warrants expire five years after the date of the USNG Letter Agreement.

Gain on exchange and extinguishment of liabilities - On March 31, 2021, the Company entered into Debt Settlement Agreements with six creditors (five of which were related parties), which extinguished accounts payable and accrued liabilities totaling $2,866,497 in exchange for the issuance of $28,665 in principal balance of the 3% Notes with detachable warrants to purchase 5,732,994 shares of Common Stock for $0.50 per share. The 3% Notes allow for prepayment at any time with all principal and accrued interest becoming due and payable at maturity on March 30, 2026, the 3% Notes Maturity Date. The 3% Notes are convertible as to principal and any accrued interest, at the option of holder, into shares of the company’s Common Stock at any time after the issue date and prior to the close of business on the business day preceding the 3% Notes Maturity Date at the rate of fifty cents ($0.50) per share, subject to normal and customary adjustment.
 
The warrants to purchase 5,732,994 shares of Common Stock issued pursuant to the Debt Settlement Agreements were valued at $1,605,178 using the Black-Scholes methodology.
 
An aggregate of $2,577,727 of the total accounts payable and accrued liabilities that were extinguished were with the five related parties. Such related parties were issued $25,777 principal balance of the 3% Notes and warrants to purchase 5,155,454 shares of Common Stock in exchange for the extinguishment of their respective debt obligations. The Company recognized a gain on extinguishment of liabilities for the portion of the extinguishment with non-related parties. Furthermore, it recognized the portion of the gain on extinguishment of liabilities with related parties as a contribution of capital.
 
The gain on extinguishment of liabilities from the Debt Settlement Agreements was determined as follows:
 

 | Amount | 
------------------------------------------------------------------+--------+-----------
Total accounts payable and accrued liabilities extinguished | $ | 2,866,497 | 
Less: Principal balance of 3% Convertible Promissory Notes issued | | (28,665 | )

Acquisition of mineral rights to properties
 
Acquisition of Kansas Oil and Gas Properties - On April 1, 2021, we completed the acquisition of the Properties in the Central Kansas Uplift geological formation covering over 11,000 contiguous acres, subject to overriding royalties to third parties. The acquisition price aggregated $900,000 in cash and included the existing production equipment, infrastructure and ownership of 11 square miles of existing 3-D seismic data on the acreage. The Properties include a horizontal producing well, horizontal saltwater injection well, conventional saltwater disposal well and two conventional vertical producing wells, which currently produce from the Reagan Sand Zone with an approximate depth of 3,600 feet.

We have commenced with certain rework to the existing production wells subsequent to the acquisition and have performed testing and evaluation of the existence of noble gas reserves on the Properties, including helium, argon and other rare earth minerals/gases. Testing for noble gas reserves has provided encouraging but not conclusive results, and we have yet to determine the possibility of commercializing the noble gas reserves on the Properties. We plan to assess existing oil and gas reserves while continuing the evaluation of the existence of new oil and gas zones and other mineral reserves, specifically the noble gas reserves, that the Properties may hold.
 
Hugoton Gas Field Farmout Agreement - On April 4, 2022, the Company acquired a 40% interest in the AMGAS JV that holds a Farmout Agreement with Scout with regards to its oil and gas interests in the Hugoton Gas Field, located in Haskell and Finney Counties, Kansas. The Farmout Agreement covers drilling and completion of up to 50 wells, with the first exploratory well scheduled to be spudded in April 2022. The AMGAS JV will utilize Scout’s existing infrastructure assets including water disposal, gas gathering and helium processing. The Farmout Agreement provides the JV with rights to take in-kind and market its share of helium at the tailgate of Jayhawk Gas Plant, which will enable the AMGAS JV to market and sell the helium produced at prevailing market prices. The AMGAS JV also acquired the rights to all brine minerals subject to a ten percent (10%) royalty to Scout, across Finney and Haskell Counties.
 
Competition
 
We compete in virtually all facets of our businesses with numerous other companies in the oil and gas industry, including many that have significantly greater financial and other resources. Such competitors will be able to pay more for desirable oil and gas leases and to evaluate, bid for, and purchase a greater number of properties than our financial or personnel resources permit.
 
Our business strategy includes highly competitive oil and natural gas exploration, development and production and the exploration and development of noble gas and rare earth minerals. We face intense competition from a large number of independent exploration and development companies as well as major oil and gas companies in a number of areas, such as obtaining the capital necessary to pursue the development of our recently acquired Kansas Oil and Gas Properties and the Hugoton Gas Field. We may find it difficult to acquire the services, equipment, labor and materials necessary to explore, operate and develop those properties with the intense competition in our industry. Most of our competitors have financial and technological resources substantially exceeding those available to us. We cannot be sure that we will be successful in developing and operating profitably the Kansas Oil and Gas Properties and the Hugoton Gas Field in the face of this competition.
 
Government Regulation of the Oil and Gas Industry
 
General
 
Our business is affected by numerous laws and regulations, including, among others, laws and regulations relating to energy, environment, conservation and tax. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative, civil and/or criminal penalties, the imposition of injunctive relief or both. Moreover, changes in any of these laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business. In view of the many uncertainties with respect to current and future laws and regulations, including their applicability to us, we cannot predict the overall effect of such laws and regulations on our future operations.
 
The following is a summary discussion of the framework of key environmental and land use regulations and requirements affecting oil and natural gas exploration, development, production and transportation operations and is qualified as mentioned above.

Environmental and Land Use Regulation
 
Various federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment may affect our operations and costs. The areas affected include:
 

● | unit production expenses primarily related to the control and limitation of air emissions, spill prevention and the disposal of produced water; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | capital costs to drill development wells resulting from expenses primarily related to the management and disposal of drilling fluids and other oil and natural gas exploration wastes; 
● | capital costs to construct, maintain and upgrade equipment and facilities; 
● | operational costs associated with ongoing compliance and monitoring activities; and 
● | exit costs for operations that we are responsible for closing, including costs for dismantling and abandoning wells and remediating environmental impacts. 

 
The environmental and land use laws and regulations affecting oil and natural gas operations have changed frequently in the past, and in general, these changes have imposed more stringent requirements that increase operating costs and/or require capital expenditures to remain in compliance. Failure to comply with these requirements can result in civil and/or criminal fines and liability for non-compliance, clean-up costs and other environmental damages. It is also possible that unanticipated developments or changes in law could cause us to make environmental expenditures significantly greater than those we currently expect.
 
Operating Hazards and Insurance
 
The oil and natural gas business involves a variety of operating risks. Historically, we were unable to maintain insurance against such potential risks and losses. The Company has relevant liability insurance coverage on its Kansas Oil and Gas Properties which is maintained by the licensed operator of the lease.
 
In addition, pollution and environmental risks are not insured. If a significant accident or other event occurs that is not covered by insurance, it could adversely affect us.
 
Employees
 
We have three employees, our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer, whose compensations have primarily been in the form of restricted stock grants. Recurring cash salaries for our employees were suspended effective January 1, 2018. During 2021, our Chief Executive Officer was awarded a cash bonus of $30,000. We also use outside contractors to perform services.
