ITEM 1.    BUSINESS
Astronics Corporation (“Astronics” or the “Company”) is a leading provider of advanced technologies to the global aerospace, defense and other mission-critical industries. Our products and services include advanced, high-performance electrical power generation, distribution and seat motion systems, lighting and safety systems, avionics products, systems and certification, aircraft structures and automated test systems.
We have principal operations in the United States (“U.S.”), Canada, France and England, as well as engineering offices in the Ukraine and India.
Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic
The spread of the COVID-19 outbreak has disrupted businesses on a global scale. On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization classified the outbreak as a pandemic. COVID-19 has caused disruption and volatility in the global capital markets, and has authored an economic slowdown in the Aerospace industry in particular. As we entered this crisis, the Company established two clear priorities: first and foremost the health and safety of our employees and their families, and second, continuing to meet the needs of our customers and secure the financial well-being of the Company. Substantially all of our operations and production activities have, to-date, remained operational. In response to the COVID-19 crisis, we implemented changes in our work practices to maintain a safe working environment for production employees at our facilities, while enabling other employees to productively work from home. As we bring employees back to the workplace and return to in-person meetings with customers and suppliers, we have adopted a flexible work approach. This allows for a smooth transition from COVID-19 conditions to a future that better meets the needs of the business and the interests of our employees. In terms of maintaining our financial health and liquidity, in early 2020, we implemented workforce reduction activities to align capacity with expected demand. We also implemented significant cost conservation measures, and we continue to closely monitor spending priorities. As economic activity recovers, we continue to monitor the situation, to assess further possible implications on our operations, supply chain, liquidity, cash flow and customer orders, and to take actions in an effort to mitigate adverse consequences. While the industry is seeing some improvement on rising vaccination rates and easing travel restrictions, the ultimate impact of COVID-19 on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows is dependent on future developments, including the duration of the pandemic, vaccination rates and efficacy and the related length of impact on the global economy, supply chain and the aerospace industry, which are uncertain and cannot be predicted at this time. We believe that our existing financial arrangements are sufficient to meet our operating needs.
See Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors, for an additional discussion of risk related to supply chain disruptions and the recent government vaccine mandates.
The Company qualified for government subsidies from the Canadian and French governments as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic’s impact on our foreign operations. The Canadian and French subsidies are income-based grants intended to reimburse the Company for certain employee wages. The grants are recognized as income over the periods in which the Company recognizes as expenses the costs the grants are intended to defray. 
In September 2021 the Company was awarded a grant of up to $14.7 million from the U.S. Department of Transportation (“USDOT”) under the Aviation Manufacturing Jobs Protection Program (“AMJP”). The Company received $7.4 million under the grant in 2021, and expects to receive the remainder in 2022. The receipt of the full award is primarily conditioned upon the Company committing to not furlough, lay off or reduce the compensation levels of a defined group of employees during the six-month period of performance between September 2021 and March 2022. The grant benefit is being recognized ratably over the six-month performance period as a reduction to cost of products sold in proportion to the compensation expense that the award is intended to defray. During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company recognized $8.7 million of the award. 
For additional details regarding the subsidies and grants, and their impact on consolidated results of operations and financial position, see Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this report. 
Acquisitions
On July 1, 2019, the Company acquired Freedom Communication Technologies, Inc. (“Freedom”) for $21.8 million, net of $0.6 million in cash acquired. Freedom is a leader in wireless communication testing, primarily for the civil land mobile radio market and is included in our Test Systems segment.
On October 4, 2019, the Company acquired mass transit and defense market test solution provider, Diagnosys Test Systems Limited, for $7.0 million in cash. Contingent purchase consideration (“earnout”), estimated at a fair value of $2.5 million at acquisition, was reduced to zero in 2021 based on actual and forecasted order levels. Diagnosys Inc. and its affiliates 
(“Diagnosys”) is included in our Test Systems segment. Diagnosys is a developer and manufacturer of comprehensive automated test equipment providing test, support, and repair of high value electronics, electro-mechanical, pneumatic and printed circuit boards focused on the global mass transit and defense markets. The acquired business has operations in Westford, Massachusetts as well as Ferndown, England, and an engineering center of excellence in Bangalore, India. 
Divestitures
On February 13, 2019, the Company completed a divestiture of its semiconductor test business within the Test Systems segment. The business was not core to the future of the Test Systems segment. The total proceeds of the divestiture amounted to $103.8 million. The Company recorded a pre-tax gain on the sale of $80.1 million in the first quarter of 2019. The Company recorded income tax expense relating to the gain of $19.7 million.
The transaction also includes two elements of contingent earnouts. No earnout was payable to the Company for calendar 2019 activity. In December 2021, the Company agreed to a payment of $10.7 million for the calendar 2020 earnout, which was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2021 and was received by the Company in early January 2022. On February 14, 2022, the Company was notified by the purchaser that they have calculated $11.2 million as being payable for the calendar 2021 earnout. We are in the process of reviewing the calculation, and expect to record the additional gain on the sale related to the 2021 earnout and receive the payment in the first quarter of 2022. For further information, see Note 22 of Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data in this report.
On July 12, 2019, the Company sold intellectual property and certain assets associated with its Airfield Lighting product line for $1.0 million in cash. The Airfield Lighting product line, part of the Aerospace segment, was not core to the business and represented less than 1% of revenue. The Company recorded a pre-tax loss on the sale of approximately $1.3 million.
On October 6, 2021, the Company sold one of its Aerospace facilities for $9.2 million. Net cash proceeds were approximately $8.8 million and a gain on sale of approximately $5.0 million was recorded.
Products and Customers
Our Aerospace segment designs and manufactures products for the global aerospace industry. Product lines include lighting and safety systems, electrical power generation, distribution and motions systems, aircraft structures, avionics products, systems certification, and other products. Our Aerospace customers are the airframe manufacturers (“OEM”) that build aircraft for the commercial, military and general aviation markets, suppliers to those OEM’s, aircraft operators such as airlines, suppliers to the aircraft operators, and branches of the U.S. Department of Defense. During 2021, this segment’s sales were divided 55% to the commercial transport market, 19% to the military aircraft market, 16% to the business jet market and 10% to other markets. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and its adverse impact on air travel worldwide, the commercial aerospace industry has been significantly disrupted. Most of this segment’s sales are a result of contracts or purchase orders received from customers, placed on a day-to-day basis or for single year procurements rather than long-term multi-year contract commitments. On occasion, the Company does receive contractual commitments or blanket purchase orders from our customers covering multiple-year deliveries of hardware to our customers.
Our Test Systems segment designs, develops, manufactures and maintains automated test systems that support the aerospace and defense, communications and mass transit industries as well as training and simulation devices for both commercial and military applications. In the Test Systems segment, Astronics’ products are sold to a global customer base including OEM's and prime government contractors for both electronics and military products. The nature of our Test Systems business is such that it pursues large, often multi-year, projects.
Sales by segment, geographic region, major customer and foreign operations are provided in Note 20 of Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data in this report.
We have historically had a significant concentration of business with two major customers; Panasonic Avionics Corporation (“Panasonic”) and The Boeing Company (“Boeing”). While sales to Panasonic accounted for less than 10% of sales in 2021, they accounted for 11.1% of sales in 2020, and 13.0% of sales in 2019. Sales to Boeing accounted for 10.0% of sales in 2021, 9.5% of sales in 2020, and 13.6% of sales in 2019. Sales to Panasonic and Boeing are primarily in the Aerospace segment. 
Strategy
Our strategy is to increase our value by developing technologies and capabilities either internally or through acquisition, and use those capabilities to provide innovative solutions to the aerospace and defense and other markets where our technology can be beneficial.
Practices as to Maintaining Working Capital
Liquidity is discussed in Part II, Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, in the Liquidity and Capital Resources section of this report.
Competitive Conditions
We experience considerable competition in the market sectors we serve, principally with respect to product performance and price, from various competitors, many of which are substantially larger and have greater resources. Success in the markets we serve depends upon product innovation, customer support, responsiveness and cost management. We continue to invest in developing the technologies and engineering support critical to competing in our markets.
Government Contracts
All U.S. government contracts, including subcontracts where the U.S. government is the ultimate customer, may be subject to termination at the election of the government. Our revenue stream relies on military spending. Approximately 18% of our 2021 consolidated sales were made to government-related markets.
Raw Materials
Materials, supplies and components are purchased from numerous sources. We believe that the loss of any one source, although potentially disruptive in the short-term, would not materially affect our operations in the long-term. The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly disrupted the global supply chain for certain components. See further discussion within the Risk Factor discussion in Item 1A.
Seasonality
Our business is typically not seasonal.
Backlog
At December 31, 2021, our consolidated backlog was $415.7 million. At December 31, 2020, our backlog was $283.4 million. The increase in backlog is driven primarily by recovering demand from our commercial aerospace and business jet customers, with increased OEM build rates and increased spending by commercial airlines on fleet improvements. 
Backlog in the Aerospace segment was $334.7 million at December 31, 2021, of which $299.4 million is expected to be recognized as revenue in 2022. Backlog in the Test Systems segment was $81.0 million at December 31, 2021. The Test Systems segment expects to recognize $40.5 million of backlog as revenue in 2022. 
Patents
We have a number of patents. While the aggregate protection of these patents is of value, our only material business that is dependent upon the protection afforded by these patents is our cabin power distribution products. Our patents and patent applications relate to electroluminescence, instrument panels, cord reels and handsets, and a broad patent covering the cabin power distribution technology. We regard our expertise and techniques as proprietary and rely upon trade secret laws and contractual arrangements to protect our rights. We have trademark protection in our major markets.
Research, Development and Engineering Activities
We are engaged in a variety of engineering and design activities as well as basic research and development activities directed to the substantial improvement or new application of our existing technologies. These costs are expensed when incurred and included in cost of products sold. Research, development and engineering costs amounted to approximately $85.3 million in 2021, $86.8 million in 2020 and $108.9 million in 2019.
Human Capital Resources
Human Capital Management and Corporate Culture
As of December 31, 2021, we employed approximately 2,100 employees, of whom approximately 1,700 were employed in the United States and approximately 400 were employed outside of the United States. We have approximately 70 hourly production employees at PECO who are subject to collective bargaining agreements. We also leverage temporary workers to provide flexibility for our business and manufacturing needs.
We greatly value our employees and recognize that, without them, the Company would not have achieved the success it has accomplished since inception. We strive to provide a positive, supportive work culture with a clear global vision and a collaborative work style. We strongly believe that a focus on learning and supporting career development can lead to success. Astronics Corporation regularly earns “best employer” awards. 
As it relates to customers, investors, suppliers and partners, our Company is dedicated to conducting business with integrity and responsibility for the greater good. We promote honest and ethical conduct, compliance with applicable government regulations and accountability by all of its directors, officers and employees.
When considering an acquisition or partnership, we embed questions specific to human capital management within our due diligence approach. These questions are in the areas of culture, equal employment opportunity, compliance with governing bodies, ethics, as well as employee benefits. We ask these in an effort to ensure that the acquisition candidate is a positive cultural fit and to minimize any risk when assessing the acquisition candidate.
In addition, our Corporate Governance Guidelines outline expectations that the Board establish and promote policies that encourage a positive, supportive work culture. The Board recognizes that culture is critical to the long-term success of Astronics and our strategy.
Compensation Programs and Employee Benefits
We believe that future success largely depends upon our continued ability to attract and retain highly skilled employees. We provide employees with competitive salaries and bonuses, opportunities for equity ownership, development programs that enable continued learning and growth and a robust employment package that promotes well-being across all aspects of their lives, including;
•Health and dental insurance
•Generous paid time off
•401K, profit sharing, and bonus programs
•Flexible spending accounts
•Employee stock purchase plan
•Disability and life insurance
•Commute reduction, fitness, tuition programs
•Community service opportunities
The COVID-19 pandemic had a sudden and significant impact on the global economy, and particularly in the aerospace industry, causing us to make difficult cost conservation measures including workforce reductions activities to align capacity with expected demand as well as suspension of certain benefit programs. These measures were taken to maintain the financial health and liquidity of the business. We are continuously evaluating the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, which is dependent on future developments, including the duration of the pandemic and the its impact on the global economy and the aerospace industry, which are uncertain and cannot be predicted at this time. While we have already reinstituted several of the previously-suspended benefits, we will continue to strive to return to a normal level of employment opportunity and benefit offerings for the valued employees of Astronics.
Employee Engagement 
The lifeblood of any organization is its employee base. We rely on our individual subsidiaries to regularly gather employee feedback, using the method each subsidiary believes is most appropriate. In some instances that feedback is obtained through “Town Hall” formats; in other instances, it is obtained through surveys. We also expect our managers to solicit and, where applicable, use employee feedback to improve its business practices and working environment. We are proud to have received numerous awards, recognizing both product quality as well as the ability to provide an excellent work environment.
Diversity and Inclusion 
The Company believes that diversity and inclusion is critical for the attraction and retention of top talent and employs policies and procedures to recruit women and minority talent as well as policies to ensure pay equality. Astronics has an Equal Employment Opportunity Policy whereby the Company commits to providing equal employment opportunity for all qualified employees and applicants without regard to race, color, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, religion, national origin, disability, veteran status, age, marital status, pregnancy, genetic information or other legally protected status. 
Health and Safety
Astronics is committed to the safety of our customers and our employees. Each Astronics operation maintains environmental, health and safety policies that seek to promote the operation of its businesses in a manner that is protective of the health and safety of the public and its employees, particularly in the response to the global COVID-19 pandemic. We have implemented actions to maintain the health of our employees including social distancing measures, the use of masks, restricting visitors and unnecessary travel, and working from home whenever possible.
Our operations offer several health and welfare programs to employees to promote fitness and wellness and to encourage preventative healthcare. In addition, our employees are offered a confidential employee assistance program that provides professional counseling to employees and their family members. Also, many of our operations offer green space for employees to use during their breaks.
