Sales Channels, Residential Leasing Program, and other Financing Options
We sell our residential solar energy solutions to end customers through a variety of means, including cash sales and long-term leases directly to end customers, sales to resellers, including the Company's third-party global dealer network, and sales of the Company's operations and maintenance (“O&M”) services. 
We offer financing programs that are designed to offer customers a variety of options to obtain high efficiency solar products and systems, including loans arranged through our third-party lending partners, in some cases for no money down, or by leasing high efficiency solar systems at competitive energy rates. Our residential lease program, in partnership with third-party investors, provides U.S. customers SunPower systems under 20-year lease agreements that include system maintenance and warranty coverage, including warranties on system performance. SunPower residential lease customers have the option to purchase their leased solar systems upon the sale or transfer of their home. These financing options enhance our ability to provide individually-tailored solar solutions to a broad range of residential customers.
Historically, we have had the ability to sell portfolios of residential system leases to 8point3 Energy Partners LP ("8point3 Energy Partners"), a joint Yieldco vehicle formed by us and First Solar, Inc. ("First Solar") in which we have an approximately 36.5% ownership stake. In fiscal 2017, following a review of our strategic alternatives, we decided to explore a divestiture jointly with First Solar. On February 5, 2018, 8point3 Energy Partners entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “8point3 Merger Agreement”) with CD Clean Energy and Infrastructure V JV, LLC, an equity fund managed by Capital Dynamics, Inc. and certain other co-investors (collectively, “Capital Dynamics” and the transaction, the "Divestiture Transaction"), and we entered into a Support Agreement which obligates us to support the Divestiture Transaction. The Divestiture Transaction is subject to customary conditions and approvals, and the details and timing are subject to change. Successful closure of the Divestiture Transaction is not assured. While the Divestiture Transaction is pending, 8point3 Energy Partners is limited in its ability to acquire projects from us; however, we are not restricted in selling residential systems to other parties. In the event that the 8point3 Merger Agreement terminates without the closing of the Divestiture Transaction, 8point3 Energy Partners will retain rights of first offer on certain of our solar energy projects.
For additional information on transactions with, and our current plan to divest our interest in, 8point3 Energy Partners, please see "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—Note 10. Equity Method Investments" and "—Note 18. Subsequent Events."

Power Plants
SunPower Solutions
In 2017, SunPower established the SunPower Solutions division of the Power Plant segment to deliver products and services to utility-scale photovoltaic ("PV") customers around the world. SunPower Solutions enables developers, independent power producers and EPCs to benefit from SunPower's extensive experience over the past decade developing, financing, constructing, operating and maintaining solar power plants. The Company remains focused on transitioning from project development to equipment supply through SunPower Solutions.
We offer Power Plant customers the Oasis system, a modular product which combines SunPower solar panels, DC electrical components, and sun tracking technology into a scalable 2.5 MW solar power block. Oasis streamlines the construction process while optimizing the use of available land by conforming to the contours of the production site. The power block kits are shipped pre-assembled to the job site for rapid field installation. More than 2 GW of the Oasis system is installed or under contract worldwide. The Oasis system was deployed at the 748 MW Solar Star Projects in California, one of the world's largest operating solar power plants. The Oasis system also offers a variety of value-added features such as the Oasis GEO design optimization software, Oasis plant operating software, and the Oasis robotic cleaning system which has been used to clean over 10 GW of panels globally offering significant performance and operational benefits to project owners.
The Oasis single axis tracking system automatically pivots solar panels to track the sun's movement throughout the day. This tracking feature increases the amount of sunlight that is captured and converted into energy by up to 30% over flat or fixed-tilt systems, depending on geographic location and local climate conditions. The third-generation Oasis tracking system offers significant customer benefits such as improved land utilization, higher energy production, lower-cost operations and maintenance, and higher reliability over competing products.
In addition to the Oasis platform, the SunPower Solutions division sells SunPower’s high performance P-Series, E-Series, and X-Series panels to power plant customers around the world. SunPower’s family of utility power plant PV panels deliver higher efficiency and energy yield with lower degradation than competing panels.
Utility-Scale Solar Power System Construction and Development
Our global project teams have established a scalable, fully-integrated, vertical approach to constructing and developing utility-scale photovoltaic power plants in a sustainable way. Our industry-experienced power plant development and project finance teams evaluate sites for solar developments, obtain land rights through purchase and lease options, conduct environmental and grid transmission studies, and obtain building, construction and grid-interconnection permits, licenses, and regulatory approvals. 
We enter into turnkey EPC agreements with customers under which we design, engineer, construct, commission, and deliver functioning rooftop- and ground-mounted solar power systems. This includes the development, execution, and sale of solar power plants, which generally include the sale or lease of related real estate. In connection with such development projects, the plants and project development rights, initially owned by us, are later sold to third parties. In the United States, commercial and electric utility customers typically choose to purchase solar electricity under a PPA with an investor or financing company that buys the system from us. In other areas, such as the Middle East, Africa, and South America, projects are typically purchased by an investor or financing company and operated as central-station solar power plants.
Project Development and Financing 
Our project development business refers to sales of our large-scale solar systems, including power plant project development and project sales, EPC services for power plant construction, and power plant O&M services. Our utility-scale solar power systems are typically purchased by an investor or financing company and operated as central-station solar power plants. 
 6

We are able to utilize various means to finance our utility-scale power plant development and construction projects, which include arranging tax equity financing structures, utilizing non-recourse project debt facilities in conjunction with project sales to 8point3 Energy Partners. For additional information on our current plan to divest our interest in 8point3 Energy Partners, see "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—Note 10. Equity Method Investments" and "—Note 18. Subsequent Events."
Operations and Maintenance
Our solar power systems are designed to generate electricity over a system life typically exceeding 25 years. We offer our customers various levels of post-installation O&M services with the objective of optimizing our customers' electrical energy production over the life of the system. The terms and conditions of post-installation O&M services may provide for remote monitoring of system production and performance, including providing performance reports, preventative maintenance, including solar module cleanings, corrective maintenance, and rapid-response outage restoration, including repair or replacement of all system components covered under warranty or major maintenance agreements. 
We incorporate leading information technology platforms to facilitate the management of our solar power systems operating worldwide. Real-time flow of data from our customers' sites is aggregated centrally where an engine applies advanced solar specific algorithms to detect and report potential performance issues. Our work management system routes any anomalies to the appropriate responders to help ensure timely resolution. Our performance model, PVSim, was developed over the last 20 years and has been audited by independent engineers. Solar panel performance coefficients are established through independent third-party testing. The SunPower Monitoring System also provides customers real-time performance status of their solar power system, with access to historical or daily system performance data through our customer website (www.sunpowermonitor.com). The SunPower Monitoring System is available through applications on Apple® and Android™ devices. Some customers choose to install "digital signs" or kiosks to display system performance information from the lobby of their facility. We believe these displays enhance our brand and educate the public and prospective customers about solar power.
We typically provide a system output performance warranty, separate from our standard solar panel product warranty, to customers that have subscribed to our post-installation O&M services. In connection with system output performance warranties, we agree to pay liquidated damages in the event the system does not perform to the stated specifications, with certain exclusions. The warranty excludes system output shortfalls attributable to force majeure events, customer curtailment, irregular weather, and other similar factors. In the event that the system output falls below the warrantied performance level during the applicable warranty period, and provided that the shortfall is not caused by a factor that is excluded from the performance warranty, the warranty provides that SunPower will pay the customer an amount based on the value of the shortfall of energy produced relative to the applicable warrantied performance level. For leased systems, we provide a system output performance warranty with similar terms and conditions as that for non-leased systems.
We calculate our expectation of system output performance based on a particular system’s design specifications, including the type of panels used, the type of inverters used, site irradiation measures derived from historical weather data, our historical experience as a manufacturer, EPC services provider, and project developer as well as other unique design considerations such as system shading. The warrantied system output performance level varies by system depending on the characteristics of the system and the negotiated agreement with the customer, and the level declines over time to account for the expected degradation of the system. Actual system output is typically measured annually for purposes of determining whether warrantied performance levels have been met. 
Our primary remedy for the system output performance warranty is our ongoing O&M services which enable us to quickly identify and remediate potential issues before they have a significant impact on system performance. We also have remedies in the form of our standard product warranties and third-party original equipment manufacturer warranties that cover certain components, such as inverters, to prevent potential losses under our system output performance warranties or to minimize further losses. 
Technology
We believe that we possess a technological advantage as the leading manufacturer of back-contact, back-junction cells that enables our panels to produce more electricity, last longer and resist degradation more effectively. We believe that our technology allows us to deliver:

• | superior performance, including the ability to generate up to 45% more power per unit area than conventional solar cells;

 7


• | superior aesthetics, with our uniformly black surface design that eliminates highly visible reflective grid lines and metal interconnection ribbons;


• | superior reliability, as confirmed by multiple independent reports and internal reliability data;


• | superior energy production per rated watt of power, as confirmed by multiple independent reports; and


• | solar power systems that are designed to generate electricity over a system life typically exceeding 25 years.

With industry-leading conversion efficiencies, we continuously improve our Maxeon solar cells and believe they perform better and are tested more extensively to deliver maximum return on investment when compared with the products of our competitors. 
Panels
Solar panels are solar cells electrically connected together and encapsulated in a weatherproof panel. Solar cells are semiconductor devices that convert sunlight into direct current electricity. Our solar cells are designed without highly reflective metal contact grids or current collection ribbons on the front of the solar cell, which provides additional efficiency and allows our solar cells to be assembled into solar panels with a more uniform appearance. Our X-Series solar panels, made with our Maxeon Gen 3 solar cells, have demonstrated panel efficiencies exceeding 22% in high-volume production. In fiscal 2016, one of our standard production modules set a world record for aperture area efficiency as tested by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory. We believe our X-Series solar panels are the highest efficiency solar panels available for the mass market, and we continue to focus on increasing cell efficiency even as we produce solar cells with over 25% efficiency in a lab setting. Because our solar cells are more efficient relative to conventional solar cells, when our solar cells are assembled into panels, the assembly cost per watt is less because more power is incorporated into a given size panel. Higher solar panel efficiency allows installers to mount a solar power system with more power within a given roof or site area and can reduce per watt installation costs. Our suite of SunPower solar panels provides customers a variety of features to fit their needs, including the SunPower Signature black design which allows the panels to blend seamlessly into the rooftop. We offer panels that can be used both with inverters that require transformers as well as with the highest performing transformer-less inverters to maximize output. Both our X-Series and E-Series panels have proven performance with low levels of degradation, as validated by third-party performance tests. Additionally, since fiscal 2016, we launched a line of solar panels under the Performance Series ("P-Series") product name. These products utilize a proprietary manufacturing process to assemble conventional silicon solar cells into panels with increased efficiency and reliability compared with conventional panels. Designed to target a new set of customers and global markets, we expect P-Series panels to contribute to the growth of all three of SunPower’s business segments.
Balance of System Components
"Balance of system components" are components of a solar power system other than the solar panels, and include mounting structures, charge controllers, grid interconnection equipment, and other devices, depending on the specific requirements of a particular system and project. 
Inverters
Every solar power system needs an inverter to transform the direct current electricity collected from the solar panels into utility-grade AC power that is ready for use. We sell inverters manufactured by third parties, some of which are SunPower-branded. We also have integrated microinverter technology that converts DC generated by a single solar photovoltaic panel into AC directly on the panel. We continue to develop next generation microinverters for use with our high efficiency solar panels. Panels with these factory-integrated microinverters perform better in shaded applications compared to conventional string inverters and allow for optimization and monitoring at the solar panel level, enabling maximum energy production by the solar system.
Warranties
SunPower provides a combined 25-year standard solar panel product and power warranty for defects in materials and workmanship. The solar product warranty also warrants that E-Series and X-Series panels will provide 98% of the panel’s minimum peak power (MPP) rating for the first year, declining due to expected degradation by no more than 0.25% per year for the following 24 years, such that the power output at the end of year 25 will be at least 92% of the panel’s MPP rating. Our P-Series panels are warranted to provide 97% of the panel’s MPP rating for the first year, declining due to expected degradation by no more than 0.6% per year for the following 24 years, such that the power output at the end of year 25 will be at least 82.6% of the panel’s MPP rating. Our warranty provides that we will repair or replace any defective solar panels during the 
 8

warranty period. We also pass through long-term warranties from the original equipment manufacturers of certain system components to customers for periods ranging from five to 20 years. In addition, we generally warrant our workmanship on installed systems for periods ranging up to 25 years.
Smart Energy
We see “Smart Energy” as a way to harness our world’s energy potential by connecting the most powerful and reliable solar systems on the market with an increasingly vast array of actionable data that can help our customers make smarter decisions about their energy use. Our Smart Energy initiative is designed to add layers of intelligent control to homes, buildings and grids—all personalized through easy-to-use customer interfaces. In order to enhance the portfolio of Smart Energy solutions we offer, we continue to invest in integrated technology solutions to help customers manage and optimize their CCOE measurement.
We have an investment in Tendril Networks, Inc. We believe their data-driven, cloud-based, Energy Services Management Platform provides the infrastructure, analytics and understanding required to power the development of new Smart Energy applications that will deliver personalized energy services to residential customers. 
We have also negotiated several agreements with residential and commercial energy storage providers to integrate storage technology into our residential and commercial solar solutions. By combining storage with energy management, we lower our customers' cost of energy through improvements in self-consumption, rate arbitrage, demand management, and grid and market participation. We continue to work to make combined solar and storage solutions broadly commercially available. 
We continue to develop next generation microinverters for use with our high efficiency solar panels in order to enhance our portfolio of Smart Energy solutions. Panels with these factory-integrated microinverters can convert direct current generated by the solar panel into alternating current, enabling optimization and monitoring at the solar panel level to ensure maximum energy production by the solar system. 
Research and Development
We engage in extensive research and development efforts to improve solar cell efficiency through enhancement of our existing products, development of new techniques, and reducing manufacturing cost and complexity. Our research and development group works closely with our manufacturing facilities, our equipment suppliers and our customers to improve our solar cell design and to lower solar cell, solar panel and system product manufacturing and assembly costs. In addition, we have dedicated employees who work closely with our current and potential suppliers of crystalline silicon, a key raw material used in the manufacture of our solar cells, to develop specifications that meet our standards and ensure the high quality we require, while at the same time controlling costs. Under our Research & Collaboration Agreement with Total, our majority stockholder, we have established a joint committee to engage in long-term research and development projects with continued focus on maintaining and expanding our technology position in the crystalline silicon domain and ensuring our competitiveness. Please see "Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of 
Operations—Research and Development."
Supplier Relationships, Manufacturing, and Panel Assembly
We purchase polysilicon, ingots, wafers, solar cells, balance of system components, and inverters from various manufacturers on both a contracted and a purchase order basis. We have contracted with some of our suppliers for multi-year supply agreements. Under such agreements, we have annual minimum purchase obligations and in certain cases prepayment obligations. Please see "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources—Contractual Obligations" for further information regarding the amount of our purchase obligations in fiscal 2018 and beyond. Under other supply agreements, we are required to make prepayments to vendors over the terms of the arrangements. As of December 31, 2017, advances to suppliers totaled $216.0 million. We may be unable to recover such prepayments if the credit conditions of these suppliers materially deteriorate or if we are otherwise unable to fulfill our obligations under these supply agreements. For further information regarding our future prepayment obligations, please see "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—Note 9. Commitments and Contingencies—Advances to Suppliers." We currently believe our supplier relationships and various short- and long-term contracts will afford us the volume of material and services required to meet our planned output over the next several years. For more information about risks related to our supply chain, including without limitation risks relating to announced tariffs on solar cells and modules imported into the U.S., please see "Item 1A. Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Supply Chain."

We are working with our suppliers and partners along all steps of the value chain to reduce costs by improving manufacturing technologies and expanding economies of scale. Crystalline silicon is the principal commercial material for solar cells and is used in several forms, including single-crystalline, or monocrystalline silicon, multicrystalline, or polycrystalline silicon, ribbon and sheet silicon, and thin-layer silicon. Our solar cell value chain starts with high purity silicon called polysilicon. Polysilicon is created by refining quartz or sand.

Polysilicon is melted and grown into crystalline ingots and sawed into wafers by business partners specializing in those processes. The wafers are processed into solar cells in our manufacturing facilities located in the Philippines and Malaysia. During fiscal 2017, we completed the construction of the solar cell manufacturing facility that we own and operate in the Philippines which has an annual capacity of 400 MW. The solar cell manufacturing facility we own and operate in Malaysia has a total rated annual capacity of over 800 MW.
We use our solar cells to manufacture our X- and E-series solar panels at our solar panel assembly facilities located in Mexico and France, while we source solar cells from third parties for use in our P-Series solar panels at our solar panel assembly facility in Mexico. Our solar panel manufacturing facilities have a combined total rated annual capacity of close to 1.9 GW.
We source the solar panels and balance of system components based on quality, performance, and cost considerations both internally and from third-party suppliers. We typically assemble proprietary components, while we purchase generally available components from third-party suppliers. The balance of system components, along with the EPC cost to construct the project, can comprise as much as two-thirds of the cost of a solar power system. Therefore, we focus on standardizing our products with the goal of driving down installation costs, such as with our Equinox, Helix, and SunPower Oasis systems.
Customers
We operate in three end-customer segments: (i) Residential Segment, (ii) Commercial Segment and (iii) Power Plant Segment. The Residential and Commercial Segments combined are referred to as Distributed Generation. Our scope and scale allow us to deliver solar solutions across all segments, ranging from consumer homeowners to the largest commercial and governmental entities in the world. Our customers typically include investors, financial institutions, project developers, electric utilities, independent power producers, commercial and governmental entities, production home builders, residential owners and small commercial building owners. We leverage a combination of direct sales as well as a broad partner ecosystem to efficiently reach our global customer base.
We work with development, construction, system integration, and financing companies to deliver our solar power products and solutions to wholesale sellers, retail sellers, and retail users of electricity. In the United States, commercial and electric utility customers typically choose to purchase solar electricity under a PPA with an investor or financing company that buys the system from us. End-user customers typically pay the investors and financing companies over an extended period of time based on energy they consume from the solar power systems, rather than paying for the full capital cost of purchasing the solar power systems. Our utility-scale solar power systems are typically purchased by an investor or financing company, and operated as central-station solar power plants. In addition, our third-party global dealer network and our new homes division have deployed thousands of SunPower rooftop solar power systems to residential customers. See "Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Revenue" for our significant customers. 
Competition
The market for solar electric power technologies is competitive and continually evolving. In the last year, we faced increased competition, resulting in price reductions in the market and reduced margins, which may continue and could lead to loss of market share. Our solar power products and systems compete with many competitors in the solar power market, including, but not limited to:

• | Residential and Commercial: Canadian Solar Inc., Hanwha Corporation, JA Solar Holdings Co., Kyocera Corporation, LG Corporation, Jinko Solar, Mitsubishi Corporation, NRG Energy, Inc., Panasonic Corporation, Recurrent Energy, Sharp Corporation, SunRun, Inc., Tesla, Inc., Trina Solar Ltd., Vivint, Inc., and Yingli Green Energy Holding Co.

 10

We also face competition from resellers that have developed related offerings that compete with our product and service offerings, or have entered into strategic relationships with other existing solar power system providers. We compete for limited government funding for research and development contracts, customer tax rebates and other programs that promote the use of solar, and other renewable forms of energy with other renewable energy providers and customers.
In addition, universities, research institutions, and other companies have brought to market alternative technologies, such as thin films, which compete with our technology in certain applications. Furthermore, the solar power market in general competes with conventional fossil fuels supplied by utilities and other sources of renewable energy such as wind, hydro, biomass, solar thermal, and emerging distributed generation technologies such as micro-turbines, sterling engines and fuel cells.
In the large-scale on-grid solar power systems market, we face direct competition from a number of companies, including those that manufacture, distribute, or install solar power systems as well as construction companies that have expanded into the renewable sector. In addition, we will occasionally compete with distributed generation equipment suppliers.
We believe that the key competitive factors in the market for solar systems include:

• | total system price;


• | LCOE evaluation;


• | CCOE evaluation;


• | power efficiency and performance;


• | aesthetic appearance of solar panels and systems;


• | speed and ease of installation through modular solutions such as Oasis and Helix systems;


• | strength of distribution relationships;


• | availability of third-party financing and investments;


• | established sales channels to customers;


• | timeliness of new product introductions;


• | bankability, strength, and reputation of our company; and


• | warranty protection, quality, and customer service.

We believe that we can compete favorably with respect to each of these elements, although we may be at a disadvantage in comparison to larger companies with broader product lines, greater technical service and support capabilities, and financial resources. For more information on risks related to our competition, please see the risk factors set forth under the caption "Item 1A. Risk Factors" including "Risks Related to Our Sales Channels—The increase in the global supply of solar cells and panels, and increasing competition, may cause substantial downward pressure on the prices of such products and cause us to lose sales or market share, resulting in lower revenues, earnings, and cash flows."
Intellectual Property
We rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trade secret, trademark, and contractual protections to establish and protect our proprietary rights. "SunPower" and the "SunPower" logo are our registered trademarks in countries throughout the world for use with solar cells, solar panels, energy monitoring systems, inverters, and mounting systems. We also hold registered trademarks for, among others, “Demand Better Solar,” “Equinox Energy Systems and Design,” “Equinox Solar Systems and Design,” “Light on Land,” “Oasis Geo,” “PowerGuard,” “Powering a Brighter Tomorrow,” “PV-Dock,” “SunPower Horizons,” "Maxeon," "Oasis," "EnergyLink," "Equinox," "Helix," "InvisiMount," "Pantheon," "Serengeti," "Smarter Solar," "Solar Showdown," "SolarBridge," "Solaire," "Solaire Generation," "SunTile," "SunPower Electric," "SuPo Solar," "Tenesol, sun access provider," "TrueAC," "Greenbotics," "More Energy. For Life.," "The Planet's Most Powerful Solar," "The Power of One," and "The World's Standard for Solar," in certain countries. We are seeking and will continue to seek registration of the "SunPower" trademark and other trademarks in additional countries as we believe is appropriate. As of December 31, 2017, we held registrations for 34 trademarks in the United States, and had 10 trademark registration applications pending. We also held 107 trademark registrations and had 43 trademark applications pending in foreign jurisdictions. We typically require our business partners to enter into confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements before we 
 11

disclose any sensitive aspects of our solar cells, technology, or business plans. We typically enter into proprietary information agreements with employees, consultants, vendors, customers, and joint venture partners.
We own multiple patents and patent applications that cover aspects of the technology in the solar cells, mounting products, and electrical and electronic systems that we currently manufacture and market. We continue to file for and receive new patent rights on a regular basis. The lifetime of a utility patent typically extends for 20 years from the date of filing with the relevant government authority. We assess appropriate opportunities for patent protection of those aspects of our technology, designs, methodologies, and processes that we believe provide significant competitive advantages to us, and for licensing opportunities of new technologies relevant to our business. As of December 31, 2017, we held 507 patents in the United States, which will expire at various times through 2036, and had 310 U.S. patent applications pending. We also held 545 patents and had 896 patent applications pending in foreign jurisdictions. While patents are an important element of our intellectual property strategy, our business as a whole is not dependent on any one patent or any single pending patent application. We additionally rely on trade secret rights to protect our proprietary information and know-how. We employ proprietary processes and customized equipment in our manufacturing facilities. We therefore require employees and consultants to enter into confidentiality agreements to protect them.
When appropriate, we enforce our intellectual property rights against other parties. For more information about risks related to our intellectual property, please see the risk factors set forth under the caption "Item 1A. Risk Factors" including "Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property—We depend on our intellectual property, and we may face intellectual property infringement claims that could be time-consuming and costly to defend and could result in the loss of significant rights," "Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property—We rely substantially upon trade secret laws and contractual restrictions to protect our proprietary rights, and, if these rights are not sufficiently protected, our ability to compete and generate revenue could suffer," and "Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property—We may not obtain sufficient patent protection on the technology embodied in the solar products we currently manufacture and market, which could harm our competitive position and increase our expenses."
Backlog
We believe that backlog is not a meaningful indicator of our future business prospects. In the residential and commercial markets we often sell large volumes of solar panel, mounting systems, and other solar equipment to third parties, which are typically ordered by our third-party global dealer network and customers under standard purchase orders with relatively short delivery lead-times.  We often require project financing for development and construction of our solar power plant projects, which require significant investments before the equity is later sold to investors.  Our solar power system project backlog would therefore exclude sales contracts signed and completed in the same quarter and contracts still conditioned upon obtaining financing.  Based on these reasons, we believe backlog at any particular date is not necessarily a meaningful indicator of our future revenue for any particular period of time.
Regulations
Public Policy Considerations
Different policy mechanisms have been used by governments to accelerate the adoption of solar power. Examples of customer-focused financial mechanisms include capital cost rebates, performance-based incentives, feed-in tariffs, tax credits, and net metering. Some of these government mandates and economic incentives are scheduled to be reduced or to expire, or could be eliminated altogether. Capital cost rebates provide funds to customers based on the cost and size of a customer’s solar power system. Performance-based incentives provide funding to a customer based on the energy produced by their solar power system. Feed-in tariffs pay customers for solar power system generation based on energy produced, at a rate generally guaranteed for a period of time. Tax credits reduce a customer’s taxes at the time the taxes are due. Net metering allows customers to deliver to the electric grid any excess electricity produced by their on-site solar power systems, and to be credited for that excess electricity at or near the full retail price of electricity.
In addition to the mechanisms described above, new market development mechanisms to encourage the use of renewable energy sources continue to emerge. For example, many states in the United States have adopted renewable portfolio standards which mandate that a certain portion of electricity delivered to customers come from eligible renewable energy resources. Some states, such as California and Hawaii, have significantly expanded their renewable portfolio standards in recent years. In certain developing countries, governments are establishing initiatives to expand access to electricity, including initiatives to support off-grid rural electrification using solar power.

Risk Factors" including "Risks Related to Our Sales Channels—The reduction, modification or elimination of government 
 12

incentives could cause our revenue to decline and harm our financial results," "Risks Related to Our Sales Channels—Existing regulations and policies and changes to these regulations and policies may present technical, regulatory, and economic barriers to the purchase and use of solar power products, which may significantly reduce demand for our products and services," and "Tariffs imposed pursuant to Section 201 of the Trade Act of 1974 could significantly and adversely affect our business, revenues, margins, results of operations, and cash flows."
Environmental Regulations
We use, generate, and discharge toxic, volatile, or otherwise hazardous chemicals and wastes in our research and development, manufacturing, and construction activities. We are subject to a variety of foreign, U.S. federal and state, and local governmental laws and regulations related to the purchase, storage, use, and disposal of hazardous materials. We believe that we have all environmental permits necessary to conduct our business and expect to obtain all necessary environmental permits for future activities. We believe that we have properly handled our hazardous materials and wastes and have appropriately remediated any contamination at any of our premises. For more information about risks related to environmental regulations, please see the risk factors set forth under the caption "Item 1A. Risk Factors" including "Risks Related to Our Operations—Compliance with environmental regulations can be expensive, and noncompliance with these regulations may result in adverse publicity and potentially significant monetary damages and fines."
The Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act of 2012
Section 13(r) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), requires us to disclose whether Total S.A. or any of its affiliates (collectively, the “Total Group”) knowingly engaged during the 2017 calendar year in certain Iran-related activities. While the Total Group has not engaged in any activity that would be required to be disclosed pursuant to subparagraphs (B) or (C) of Section 13(r) (1), affiliates of Total S.A. may be deemed to have engaged in certain transactions or dealings with the government of Iran that would require disclosure pursuant to Section 13(r) (1) (A) and (D), as discussed below. Unless otherwise noted, all foreign currency translations to U.S. dollars in this section are made using exchange rates as of December 31, 2017.
Exploration & Production
Following the suspension of certain international economic sanctions against Iran on January 16, 2016, the Total Group commenced various business development activities in Iran. Following the Heads of Agreement (“HOA”) signed on November 8, 2016 by National Iranian Oil Company (“NIOC”), Total E&P South Pars S.A.S. (“TEPSP”) (a wholly-owned affiliate of Total S.A.), CNPC International Ltd. (“CNPCI”) (a wholly-owned affiliate of China National Petroleum Company) and Petropars Ltd. (“Petropars”) (a wholly-owned affiliate of NIOC), these parties negotiated and then signed a 20-year risked service contract on July 3, 2017 (the “Risked Service Contract”) for the development and production of phase 11 of the South Pars gas field (“SP11”). The project is expected to have a production capacity of 2 Bcf/d or 400,000 boe/d including condensate, and to supply the Iranian domestic market starting in 2021. TEPSP (50.1%) is the operator of the SP11 project alongside CNPCI (30%) and Petropars (19.9%). These companies entered into a joint operating agreement in July 2017 concerning, among other things, the governance of their obligations under the Risked Service Contract and the designation of TEPSP as the project’s operator. A branch office of TEPSP was opened in 2017 in Tehran for this purpose.
The SP11 project is expected to be developed in two phases. The first phase, with an estimated cost of approximately $2 billion-equivalent, consists of 30 wells and 2 wellhead platforms connected to existing onshore treatment facilities by 2 subsea pipelines. Since the November 2016 HOA signature, Total S.A. has conducted engineering studies on behalf of the consortium and it initiated calls for tender during the third quarter of 2017 in order to award the contracts required to start developing the project in early 2018. At a later stage, once required by reservoir conditions, a second phase is expected to be launched involving the construction of offshore compression facilities.
The total required investment for the SP11 project is expected to be approximately $4 billion-equivalent, of which TEPSP would finance 50.1% via equity contributions and payments in non-U.S. currency. In the event of new or reinstated international economic sanctions, if such sanctions were to prevent TEPSP from performing under the Risked Service Contract, TEPSP expects to be able to withdraw from the Contract and recover its past costs from NIOC (unless such recovery is prevented by sanctions).
Also in 2017, the memorandum of understanding (“MOU”) entered into between Total S.A. and NIOC on January 16, 2016 to assess potential developments in Iran in compliance with remaining applicable international economic sanctions was amended to extend the MOU’s duration and include an additional potential oil and gas project, North Azadegan. In 2017, NIOC provided Total S.A. with technical data on the Azadegan oil field so that it could assess potential development of this field. 
 13

Representatives of Total S.A. held technical meetings in 2017 with representatives of NIOC and its affiliated companies in 2017 and carried out a technical review of the Azadegan (South & North) oil field as well as the Iran LNG Project (a project contemplating a 10 Mt/y LNG production facility at Tombak Port on Iran’s Persian Gulf coast), the results of which were partially disclosed to NIOC and relevant affiliated companies. In addition, Total S.A. signed two MOUs in 2017 with two international companies to evaluate the Azadegan oil field opportunity with NIOC. 
During 2017, in connection with anticipated activities under the aforementioned Risked Service Contract and MOUs, and to discuss other new project opportunities, representatives of Total S.A. attended meetings with the Iranian oil and gas ministry and several Iranian companies with ties to the government of Iran. After the signing ceremony of the Risked Service Contract, senior management of Total S.A. attended a meeting with the President of Iran. In connection with travel to Iran in 2017 by employees of the Total Group, Total S.A. made payments to Iranian authorities for visas, airport services, exit fees, and similar travel-related charges. In addition, representatives of Total S.A. had a meeting in France with the Iranian ambassador and hosted official visits in France of representatives from the Iran Ministry of Petroleum, NIOC, and affiliates of NIOC for demonstrations of Total S.A.’s technical capabilities and expertise. 
Following the signature of a confidentiality agreement in late 2016 among the Oman Ministry of Oil and Gas, NIGEC (a subsidiary of NIOC) and a group of international companies, including Total S.A., representatives of the Total Group attended meetings in 2017 with the parties to the agreement, including NIGEC, to discuss a potential project for the construction, operation and maintenance of a pipeline to supply natural gas from Iran to Oman as well as to market such gas. 
Neither revenues nor profits were recognized from any of the aforementioned activities in 2017, except that TEPSP received payments of approximately $15 million equivalent from its partners under the Risked Service Contract, including NIOC, for the reimbursement of their respective shares of past costs incurred by TEPSP under the HOA and their respective shares of the costs and expenditures incurred in 2017 under the Risked Service Contract. 
Concerning payments to Iranian entities in 2017, Total Iran BV (100%) and TEPSP (on behalf of the SP11 project joint venture partners) collectively made payments of approximately IRR 7 billion (approximately $210,000) to (i) the Iranian administration for taxes and social security contributions concerning the personnel of the aforementioned branch office and residual buyback contract-related obligations, and (ii) Iranian public entities for payments with respect to the maintenance of the aforementioned branch office (e.g., utilities, telecommunications). Total S.A. expects similar types of payments to be made by these affiliates in 2018 albeit in higher amounts due to increased business development activity in Iran. 
Furthermore, Total E&P UK Limited (“TEP UK”), a wholly-owned affiliate, holds a 43.25% interest in a joint venture at the Bruce field in the UK with BP Exploration Operating Company Limited (“BP”, 37%), BHP Billiton Petroleum Great Britain Ltd (16%) and Marubeni Oil & Gas (North Sea) Limited (3.75%). This joint venture is party to an agreement (the “Bruce Rhum Agreement”) governing certain transportation, processing and operation services provided to a joint venture at the Rhum field in the UK that is co-owned by BP (50% operator) and the Iranian Oil Company UK Ltd (“IOC”), a subsidiary of NIOC (50%). In 2017, TEP UK liaised directly with IOC concerning its interest in the Bruce Rhum Agreement and it provided services to IOC under the Bruce Rhum Agreement. TEP UK is also party to an agreement with BP whereby TEP UK shall under certain conditions use reasonable endeavors to export Rhum natural gas liquids from the St Fergus Terminal. TEP UK conducts activities pursuant to this agreement only when the primary export route for Rhum natural gas liquids is not available, and is subject to BP having title to all of the Rhum natural gas liquids to be exported, and a valid OFAC license for the activity. In 2017, the aforementioned activities generated for TEP UK gross revenue of approximately £3.9 million (approximately $5.3 million) and net profit of approximately £2.3 million (approximately $3.1 million). TEP UK expects to continue these activities in 2018. 
Other segments
The Total Group does not own or operate any refineries or chemical plants in Iran and did not purchase Iranian hydrocarbons prior to 2016 when prohibited by applicable EU and U.S. economic.
The Total Group continued its trading activities with Iran in 2017 via its wholly-owned affiliate TOTSA TOTAL OIL TRADING SA, which purchased approximately 58 Mb of Iranian crude oil for nearly €2.6 billion (approximately $3.1 billion) pursuant to a mix of spot and term contracts. In connection with these purchases, CSSA Chartering and Shipping Services SA, a wholly-owned affiliate, chartered vessels owned by an entity with ties to the government of Iran to transport this crude oil. Total S.A. is not able to estimate the gross revenue and net profit related to these purchases, because most of this crude oil was used to supply the Total Group’s refineries. However, approximately 6.6 Mb of this crude oil were sold to entities outside of the Total Group. In addition, in 2017 approximately 14 Mb of petroleum products were bought from/sold to entities with ties to the 
 14

government of Iran. These activities generated gross revenue of nearly €1.1 billion (approximately $1.3 billion) and a net loss of approximately €5.7 million (approximately $6.9 million). The affiliates expect to continue these activities in 2018.
Saft Groupe S.A. (“Saft”), a wholly-owned affiliate of the Total Group, in 2017 sold signaling and backup battery systems for metros and railways as well as products for the utilities and oil and gas sectors to companies in Iran, including some having direct or indirect ties with the Iranian government. In 2017, this activity generated gross revenue of approximately €3.2 million (approximately $3.8 million) and net profit of approximately €0.4 million (approximately $0.5 million). Saft expects to continue this activity in 2018.

The company expects to continue this activity in 2018.
Paulstra S.N.C., a wholly-owned affiliate of Total S.A., obtained in 2017 an order from Iran Khodro to sell vehicular anti-vibration systems over a 5-year period. In 2017, this activity generated gross revenue of approximately €270,000 (approximately $324,594) and net profit of approximately €20,000 (approximately $24,044). Paulstra S.N.C. also sold vehicular anti-vibration systems in 2017 to Saipa, an Iranian company in which the Industrial & Development Organization of Iran holds a 35.75% interest. This activity generated gross revenue of approximately €3,000 (approximately $3,607) and net profit of approximately €900 (approximately $1,082). The company expects to continue these activities in 2018.
Hutchinson S.N.C., a wholly-owned affiliate of Total S.A., sold vehicular body sealing and hoses in 2017 to Iran Khodro.

Hanwha Total Petrochemicals (“HTC”), a joint venture in which Total Holdings UK Limited (a wholly-owned affiliate of Total S.A.) holds a 50% interest and Hanwha General Chemicals holds a 50% interest, purchased nearly 44 Mb of condensates from NIOC for approximately KRW 2,600 billion (approximately $2.4 billion). These condensates are used as raw material for certain of HTC’s steam crackers. HTC also chartered seven tankers of condensates with National Iranian Tanker Company (NITC), a subsidiary of NIOC, for approximately KRW 16 billion (approximately $14.9 million). The Total Group expects to continue these activities in 2018.
Total Research & Technology Feluy, a wholly-owned affiliate of Total S.A., Total Marketing & Services, a company wholly-owned by Total S.A. and six employees (“TMS”), and TRC paid in 2017 fees totaling approximately €4,000 (approximately $4,809) to Iranian authorities related to various patents, consistent with the authorization for certain transactions and payments in connection with patent, trademark, copyright or other intellectual property protection under Section 560.509 of the U.S. Iranian Transactions and Sanctions Regulations. Similar payments are expected to be made in 2018.
 15

The members of the Total Group paid fees in 2017 of approximately €2,000 (approximately $2,404) to Iranian authorities related to the maintenance and protection of trademarks and designs. Similar payments are expected to be made in 2018.
Until December 2012, at which time it sold its entire interest, the Total Group held a 50% interest in the lubricants retail company Beh Total (now named Beh Tam) along with Behran Oil (50%), a company controlled by entities with ties to the government of Iran. As part of the sale of the Total Group’s interest in Beh Tam, Total S.A. agreed to license the trademark “Total” to Beh Tam for an initial 3-year period for the sale by Beh Tam of lubricants to domestic consumers in Iran. In 2014, Total E&P Iran (“TEPI”), a wholly-owned affiliate, received, on behalf of Total S.A., royalty payments of approximately IRR 24 billion (nearly $1 million) from Beh Tam for such license. These payments were based on Beh Tam’s sales of lubricants during the previous calendar year. In 2015, royalty payments were suspended notably due to a procedure brought by the Iranian tax authorities against TEPI. As of the end of 2017, no royalty payments had been received since 2015, but the payment of outstanding royalties in favor of Total S.A. is expected in 2018. In addition, representatives of Total Oil Asia-Pacific Ltd, a wholly-owned affiliate of Total S.A., made several visits to Behran Oil during 2017 regarding the potential purchase of 50% of the share capital of Beh Tam. As of the end of 2017, no agreement had been reached and no money was paid or received by either company. Further discussions are expected to take place in 2018.
Total Marketing Middle East FZE, a wholly-owned affiliate of Total S.A., sold lubricants to Beh Tam in 2017. The sale in 2017 of approximately 392 tons of lubricants and special fluids generated gross revenue of approximately AED 8.1 million (approximately $2.2 million) and net profit of approximately AED 3.7 million (approximately $1.0 million). The company expects to continue this activity in 2018.
Total Marketing France (“TMF”), a company wholly-owned by TMS, provided in 2017 fuel payment cards to the Iranian embassy and delegation to UNESCO in France for use in the Total Group’s service stations. In 2017, these activities generated gross revenue of approximately €17,000 (approximately $20,437) and net profit of approximately €1,000 (approximately $1,202). The company expects to continue this activity in 2018.
TMF also sold jet fuel in 2017 to Iran Air as part of its airplane refueling activities in France. The sale of approximately one million liters of jet fuel generated gross revenue of approximately €450,000 (approximately $540,990) and net profit of approximately €9,500 (approximately $11,421). The company expects to continue this activity in 2018.
Total Belgium, a wholly-owned affiliate of Total S.A., provided in 2017 fuel payment cards to the Iranian embassy in Brussels (Belgium) for use in the Total Group’s service stations.

The company expects to continue this activity in 2018.
Proxifuel, a wholly-owned affiliate of Total S.A., sold in 2017 domestic heating oil to the Iranian embassy in Brussels. In 2017, these activities generated gross revenue of less than €1,000 (approximately $1,202) and net profit of less than €100 (approximately $120). The company expects to continue this activity in 2018.
Caldeo, a company wholly-owned by TMS, sold in 2017 domestic heating oil to the Iranian embassy in France, which generated gross revenue of approximately €1,100 (approximately $1,322) and net profit of less than €200 (approximately $240). The company expects to continue this activity in 2018.
Total Lubrifiants, a company owned 99.99% by TMS (the remaining shares being held by one employee and five non-Total Group individual shareholders), received in 2017 three payments totaling €350,000 (approximately $420,770) from NITC in payment of unpaid invoices from 2010. The company may receive similar payments in 2018.

Geographic Information
Information regarding financial data by segment and geographic area is available in Note 5 and Note 17 under "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements."
Seasonal Trends
Our business is subject to industry-specific seasonal fluctuations including changes in weather patterns and economic incentives, among others. Sales have historically reflected these seasonal trends with the largest percentage of total revenues realized during the last two quarters of our fiscal year. The construction of solar power systems or installation of solar power components and related revenue may decline during cold winter months. In the United States, many customers make purchasing decisions towards the end of the year in order to take advantage of tax credits or for other budgetary reasons. In addition, revenues may fluctuate due to the timing of project sales, construction schedules, and revenue recognition of certain projects, such as those involving real estate, which may significantly impact the quarterly profile of the Company's results of operations. We may also retain certain development projects on our balance sheet for longer periods of time than in preceding periods in order to optimize the economic value we receive at the time of sale in light of market conditions, which can fluctuate after we have committed to projects. Delays in disposing of projects, or changes in amounts realized on disposition, may lead to significant fluctuations to the period-over-period profile of our results of operations and our cash available for working capital needs.
