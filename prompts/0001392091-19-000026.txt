Item 1.    Business.
Overview

We are a publicly traded master limited partnership with operations in 27 states. We provide integrated terminalling, gathering and transportation services for companies engaged in the production, distribution and marketing of liquid asphalt and crude oil.  We manage our operations through four operating segments: (i) asphalt terminalling services, (ii) crude oil terminalling services, (iii) crude oil pipeline services and (iv) crude oil trucking services. On April 24, 2018, the Partnership sold the producer field services business. As a result of the sale of the producer field services business, the Partnership changed the name of the crude oil trucking and producer field services operating segment to crude oil trucking services during the second quarter of 2018. See Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information. 
Our Operations
We were formed as a Delaware limited partnership in 2007 to own, operate and develop a diversified portfolio of complementary midstream energy assets.  Our operating assets are owned by, and our operations are conducted through, our subsidiaries.  Our General Partner has sole responsibility for conducting our business and for managing our operations.  On October 5, 2016, Ergon purchased 100% of the outstanding voting stock of Blueknight GP Holding, L.L.C., which owns 100% of the capital stock of our General Partner, pursuant to a Membership Interest Purchase Agreement dated July 19, 2016, among CB-Blueknight, LLC (“CBB”), an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Charlesbank, Blueknight Energy Holding, Inc. (“BEHI”), an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Vitol, and Ergon Asphalt Holdings, LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Ergon (the “Ergon Change of Control”). In conjunction with the Ergon Change of Control, Ergon contributed nine asphalt facilities plus $22.1 million in cash in return for total consideration of approximately $144.7 million, which consisted of the issuance of 18,312,968 Preferred Units in a private placement. We also repurchased 6,667,695 Preferred Units from each of Vitol and Charlesbank in a private placement for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $95.3 million. Vitol and 
1

Charlesbank each retained 2,488,789 Preferred Units upon completion of these transactions. In addition, Ergon acquired an aggregate of $5.0 million of common units for cash in a private placement, pursuant to a Contribution Agreement between us, Blueknight Terminal Holding, L.L.C. and three indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries of Ergon. 

Our General Partner has no business or operations other than managing our business.  In addition, outside of its investment in us, our General Partner owns no assets or property other than a minimal amount of cash, which has been distributed by us to our General Partner in respect of its interest in us. Our partnership agreement imposes no additional material liabilities upon our General Partner or obligations to contribute to us other than those liabilities and obligations imposed on general partners under the Delaware Revised Uniform Limited Partnership Act.

The following diagram depicts our organizational structure, including our relationship with our affiliates and subsidiaries, as of March 11, 2019:

Our Strengths and Strategies
Strategically placed assets.  We own and operate a diversified portfolio of complementary midstream energy assets that includes approximately 8.8 million barrels of liquid asphalt storage located at 53 terminals in 26 states which we believe are well positioned to provide services in the market areas they serve throughout the continental United States. Our primary crude oil terminalling facilities are located within the Cushing Interchange in Cushing, Oklahoma, one of the largest crude oil marketing hubs in the United States and the designated point of delivery specified in all New York Mercantile Exchange (“NYMEX”) crude oil futures contracts. We believe that the Cushing Interchange will continue to serve as one of the largest crude oil marketing hubs in the United States. In addition, we have approximately 646 miles of strategically positioned gathering and transportation pipelines, primarily located in Oklahoma. 
Growth opportunities.  Ergon has indicated that it views us as a vehicle of growth in the midstream sector. We cannot say with any certainty whether or not Ergon will pursue future acquisition or expansion opportunities in the midstream energy space with us, or if we will choose to pursue any such opportunity Ergon presents. 

Experienced management team.  Our General Partner has an experienced and knowledgeable management team with extensive experience in the energy industry. We expect to directly benefit from this management team’s strengths, including significant relationships throughout the energy industry with customers of our asphalt terminalling services and with producers, marketers and refiners of crude oil.
Our relationship with Ergon.  Ergon owns our General Partner and therefore controls our operations.  Ergon is a privately held company formed in 1954 and is based in Jackson, Mississippi, with over 3,000 employees globally. Ergon and its subsidiaries are engaged in a wide range of operations that are categorized into seven primary business segments: Refining & Marketing, Asphalt & Emulsions, Midstream & Logistic, Specialty Chemicals, Construction and Real Estate and Corporate & Other. This relationship may provide us with additional capital sources for future growth as well as increased opportunities to provide terminalling, gathering and transportation services. While this relationship may benefit us, it may also be a source of potential conflicts.  Ergon is not restricted from competing with us and may acquire, construct or dispose of additional assets in the future without any obligation to offer us the opportunity to purchase or construct those assets. 
Industry Overview

Asphalt Industry

We provide asphalt terminalling services to marketers and distributors of liquid asphalt and asphalt-related products. We do not take title to the product. We lease certain facilities for operation by our customers and at some facilities we process, blend and manufacture products to meet our customers’ specifications. Our terminal network consists of 53 facilities located coast-to-coast throughout the United States.
Liquid asphalt, which includes liquid asphalt cement and residual fuel oils, is one of the oldest engineering materials. Liquid asphalt’s adhesive and waterproofing properties have been used for building structures, waterproofing ships, mummification and numerous other applications.

Production of liquid asphalt begins with the refining of crude oil. When crude oil is separated in distillation towers at a refinery, the heaviest hydrocarbons with the highest boiling points settle at the bottom. These tar-like fractions, called residuum, require relatively little additional processing to become products such as liquid asphalt cement or residual fuel oil. Liquid asphalt production typically represents only a small portion of the total product production in the crude oil refining process. The liquid asphalt produced by petroleum distillation can be sold by the refinery either directly into the wholesale and retail liquid asphalt markets or to a liquid asphalt marketer.

In its normal state, liquid asphalt is too viscous to be used at ambient temperatures. For paving applications, asphalt can be heated (hot mix asphalt), diluted or cut back with petroleum solvents (cutback asphalts), or emulsified in a water base with emulsifying chemicals by a colloid mill (asphalt emulsions). Hot mix asphalt is produced by mixing hot asphalt cement and heated aggregate (stone, sand and/or gravel). The hot mix asphalt is loaded into trucks for transport to the paving site, where it is placed on the road surface by paving machines and compacted by rollers. Hot mix asphalt is used for new construction, reconstruction and for thin maintenance overlay on existing roads.

Asphalt emulsions and cutback asphalts are used for a variety of applications, including spraying as a tack coat between an old pavement and a new hot mix asphalt overlay, cold mix pothole patching material and preventive maintenance surface applications such as chip seals. Asphalt emulsions are also used for fog seal, slurry seal, scrub seal, sand seal and 
3

microsurfacing maintenance treatments, warm mix emulsion/aggregate mixtures, base stabilization and both central plant and in-place recycling. Asphalt emulsions and cutback asphalts are generally sold directly to government agencies but are also sold to contractors.

The asphalt industry in the United States is characterized by a high degree of seasonality. Much of this seasonality is due to the impact that weather conditions have on road construction schedules, particularly in cold weather states. Refineries produce liquid asphalt year-round, but the peak asphalt demand season is during the warm weather months when most of the road construction activity in the United States takes place.  Liquid asphalt marketers and finished asphalt product producers with access to storage capacity possess the inherent advantage of being able to purchase supply from refineries on a year-round basis and then sell finished asphalt products in the peak summer demand season.

Crude Oil Industry

We provide crude oil gathering, marketing, transportation and terminalling services to producers, marketers and refiners of crude oil products. The market we serve, which begins at the source of production and extends to the point of distribution to the end user customer, is commonly referred to as the “midstream” market. Our crude oil operations are located primarily in Oklahoma and Kansas, where there are extensive crude oil production operations in place, and our assets extend from gathering systems and trucking networks in and around producing fields to transportation pipelines carrying crude oil to logistics hubs, such as the Cushing Interchange, where we have terminalling facilities that aid our customers in managing their crude oil.

Gathering, marketing and transportation.  Pipeline transportation is generally considered the lowest cost and safest method for shipping crude oil and refined petroleum products to other locations. Crude oil pipelines transport oil from the wellhead to logistics hubs and/or refineries. Logistics hubs like the Cushing Interchange provide storage and connections to other pipeline systems and other modes of transportation, such as truck, railroad, barge and tanker ship. Vessels and railroads provide additional transportation capabilities for shipping crude oil between gathering storage systems, pipelines, terminals and end users. Vessel transportation is typically a cost-efficient mode of transportation that allows for the ability to transport large volumes of crude oil over long distances.

Trucking complements pipeline gathering systems by gathering crude oil from operators at remote wellhead locations not served by pipeline gathering systems. Trucks can also be used to transport crude oil to aggregation points and storage facilities, which are generally located along pipeline gathering and transportation systems. Trucking is generally limited to low-volume, short-haul movements where other alternatives to pipeline transportation are unavailable. Trucking costs escalate sharply with distance, making trucking the most expensive mode of crude oil transportation. Despite being small in terms of both volume per shipment and distance, trucking is an essential component of the oil distribution system.

Terminalling.  Terminalling facilities complement the crude oil pipeline gathering and transportation systems. Terminals are facilities where crude oil is transferred to or from a storage facility or transportation system, such as a gathering pipeline, to another transportation system, such as trucks or another pipeline. Terminals play a key role in moving crude oil to end users such as refineries by providing storage and inventory management and distribution. 

Terminalling assets generate revenues through a combination of storage and throughput charges to third parties. Storage fees are generated when tank capacity is provided to third parties. Terminalling fees, also referred to as throughput fees, are generated when a terminal receives crude oil from a shipper and redelivers it to another shipper. Both storage fees and terminalling fees are earned from pipeline operators, refiners, gatherers and traders that need segregated storage, traders who make or take delivery under NYMEX contracts, and producers and marketers who seek to increase their marketing alternatives.

Overview of the Cushing Interchange.  The Cushing Interchange, located in Cushing, Oklahoma, is one of the largest crude oil marketing hubs in the United States and the designated point of delivery specified in NYMEX crude oil futures contracts. As the NYMEX delivery point and a cash market hub, the Cushing Interchange serves as the primary source of refinery feedstock for Midwest refiners and plays an integral role in establishing and maintaining markets for many varieties of foreign and domestic crude oil. The following table lists certain of the entities with incoming pipelines connected to the Cushing Interchange, the proprietary terminals within the complex and outgoing pipelines from the Cushing Interchange for delivery throughout the United States:

With our pipeline and terminalling infrastructure, we have the ability to receive and/or deliver, directly or indirectly, to almost all pipelines and terminals within the Cushing Interchange.
Residual Fuel Oil Industry

Like liquid asphalt, residual fuel oil is another by-product of the crude oil distillation process. Residual fuel oil is primarily used as a burner fuel in numerous industrial and commercial applications, including the utility industry, the shipping and paper industry, steel mills, tire manufacturing and food processors. 

The residual fuel oil industry in the United States is characterized by a high degree of seasonality, with much of the seasonality driven by the impact of weather on the need to produce power for heating and cooling applications. The residual fuel oil market is largely a commodity market with price functioning as the primary decision-making criterion. However, many customers have unique product specifications driven by their particular business applications that require the blending of various components to meet those specifications.

Residual fuel oil is purchased from a variety of refiners by our customers and transported to our terminalling facilities via numerous transportation methods, including truck, railroad, barge, and tanker ship. Some of our customers use our asphalt assets to service their residual fuel oil business.
Asphalt Terminalling Services
With approximately 8.8 million barrels of asphalt cement storage capacity, we are able to provide our customers the ability to effectively manage their liquid asphalt inventories while allowing significant flexibility in their processing and marketing activities. As of March 1, 2019, we have 53 terminals located in 26 states and, as such, are well-positioned to provide asphalt terminalling services in the market areas we serve throughout the continental United States.

We serve the asphalt industry by providing our customers access to their market areas through a combination of leasing our liquid asphalt facilities and providing terminalling services at certain facilities. We generate revenues by charging a fee for the lease of a facility or for services provided as asphalt products are terminalled in our facilities.

As of March 1, 2019, we have leases and storage agreements relating to all of our 53 asphalt facilities. These agreements have, on average, approximately four years remaining under their terms. Six of the agreements expire by the end of 2019, and the remaining agreements expire at varying times thereafter, including 23 that expire in 2023. We may not be able to extend, renegotiate or replace these contracts when they expire and the terms of any renegotiated contracts may not be as favorable as the contracts they replace. We operate the asphalt facilities that are contracted by storage, throughput and handling agreements, while our contract counterparties operate the asphalt facilities that are subject to lease agreements.

At facilities where we have storage contracts, we receive, store and/or process our customer’s asphalt products until we deliver those products to our customers or other third parties.  Our asphalt assets include the logistics assets, such as docks and rail spurs and the piping and pumping equipment necessary to facilitate the unloading of liquid asphalt into our terminalling and storage facilities, as well as the processing and manufacturing equipment required for the processing of asphalt emulsions, 
5

asphalt cutbacks, polymer modified asphalt cement and other related finished asphalt products. After initial unloading, the liquid asphalt is moved via heat-traced pipe into storage tanks. Those tanks are insulated and contain heating elements that allow the liquid asphalt to be stored in a heated state. The liquid asphalt can then be directly sold by our customers to end users or used as a raw material for the processing of asphalt emulsions, asphalt cutbacks, polymer modified asphalt cement and related finished asphalt products that we process in accordance with the formulations and specifications provided by our customers.  Depending on the product, the processing of asphalt entails combining asphalt cement and various other products such as emulsifying chemicals and polymers to achieve the desired specification and application requirements.

At leased facilities, our customers conduct the operations at the asphalt facility, including the storage and processing of asphalt products, and we collect a monthly rental fee relating to the lease of such facility.  Generally, under the terms of those leases, (i) title to the asphalt, raw materials or finished asphalt products received, unloaded, stored or otherwise handled at such asphalt facility is in the name of the lessee; (ii) the lessee is responsible for complying with environmental, health, safety, transportation and security laws; (iii) the lessee is required to obtain and maintain necessary permits, licenses, plans, approvals or other such authorizations and is responsible for insuring such asphalt facility; and (iv) most routine maintenance and repairs of such asphalt facility are the responsibility of the lessee.

We do not take title to, or have marketing responsibility for, the liquid asphalt product that we terminal. As a result, our asphalt operations have minimal direct exposure to changes in commodity prices, but the volumes of liquid asphalt we terminal are indirectly affected by commodity prices. 

The following table provides an overview of our asphalt facilities as of March 1, 2019:

Our asphalt assets range in age from one year to over 50 years, and we expect that our storage tanks and related assets will have an average remaining life in excess of 20 years.
Significant Customers. For the year ended December 31, 2018, Ergon accounted for at least 40% but not more than 45% of our total asphalt terminalling services revenue. Associated Asphalt and Delek US Holdings, Inc. each accounted for at least 10% but not more than 15% of asphalt terminalling services revenue in 2018.  The loss of any of those customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, cash flows and results of operations.  No other customer accounted for more than 10% of our asphalt terminalling services revenue during 2018. As of March 1, 2019, we have storage, throughput and handling agreements or operating leases with Ergon for 23 of our asphalt facilities. For more information regarding the Ergon agreements, please see “Item 13-Certain Relationships and Related-Party Transactions, and Director Independence-Agreements with Related Parties and Affiliates.”
Crude Oil Terminalling Services   

With approximately 6.9 million barrels of above-ground crude oil terminalling facilities, we are able to provide our customers with the ability to effectively manage their crude oil inventories and enhance flexibility in their marketing and operating activities. Our crude oil terminalling assets are located throughout our core operating areas, with the majority of our crude oil terminalling assets strategically located at the Cushing Interchange.

Our crude oil terminalling assets receive crude oil products from pipelines or trucks, including those owned by us, and distribute those products to interstate common carrier pipelines and regional independent refiners, among other third parties.  Our crude oil terminals derive most of their revenues from terminalling fees charged to customers.
As of March 11, 2019, we have approximately 5.7 million barrels of crude oil storage under service contracts, including 3.5 million barrels of crude oil storage contracts that expire in 2019. The remaining terms on the service contracts range from 4 months to 34 months. Storage contracts with Vitol represent 2.9 million barrels of crude oil storage capacity under contract, and an additional 0.5 million barrels are under an intercompany contract. We may not be able to extend, renegotiate or replace these contracts when they expire and the terms of any renegotiated contracts may not be as favorable as the contracts they replace.

The table below sets forth the total average barrels stored at and delivered out of our Cushing terminal in each of the periods presented, and the total storage capacity at our Cushing terminal and at our other terminals at the end of such periods:

 | Year ended December 31,
 | 2017 | 2018

Cushing Terminal.  One of our principal assets is our Cushing terminal, which is located within the Cushing Interchange in Cushing, Oklahoma. Currently, we own and operate 34 crude oil storage tanks with approximately 6.6 million barrels of storage capacity at this location. We own approximately 50 additional acres of land within the Cushing Interchange that is available for future expansion. 

7

Our Cushing terminal was constructed over the last 50 years and has an expected remaining life of at least 20 years. Over 90% of our total storage capacity in our Cushing terminal has been built since 2002. We estimate that our storage tanks have a weighted average age of 15 years.

The design and construction specifications of our storage tanks meet or exceed the minimums established by the American Petroleum Institute (“API”). Our storage tanks also undergo regular maintenance inspection programs that are more stringent than established governmental guidelines. We believe that these design specifications and inspection programs will result in lower future maintenance capital costs.

A key attribute of our Cushing terminal is that through our pipeline interface, we have access and connectivity to almost all of the terminals located within the Cushing Interchange. This connectivity is important because it provides us the ability to deliver to virtually any customer within the Cushing Interchange.

Our Cushing terminal can receive crude oil from our Mid-Continent pipeline system as well as other terminals owned by Magellan Midstream Partners, Enterprise Products Partners, Sunoco Logistics Partners, Plains All American Pipeline, L.P., Seaway Crude Pipeline Company, LLC, Enbridge Inc., SemGroup Corporation, Deeprock Energy Resources, LLC as well as truck stations. Our Cushing terminal’s pipeline connections to major markets in the Mid-Continent region provide our customers with marketing flexibility. Our Cushing terminal can deliver crude oil via pipeline and, in the aggregate, is capable of receiving and/or delivering approximately 350,000 Bpd of crude oil. 
Significant Customers.  For the year ended December 31, 2018, Vitol accounted for at least 25% but not more than 30% of our total crude oil terminalling revenue, and Citigroup Energy, Inc. and Sunoco Logistics Partners LP each accounted for at least 20% but not more than 25% of our total crude oil terminalling revenue.  The loss of any of these customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, cash flows and results of operations.  No other customer accounted for more than 10% of our crude oil terminalling revenue during 2018. 
Crude Oil Pipeline Services

We own and operate a crude oil transportation system in the Mid-Continent region of the United States with a total length of approximately 646 miles. In addition, we purchase crude oil at production leases in Oklahoma, and we market those barrels primarily at the Cushing Interchange.

System | Asset Type | ApproximateLength(miles) | AverageThroughput forYear EndedDecember 31, 2017(Bpd) | AverageThroughput forYear EndedDecember 31, 2018(Bpd) | Pipe DiameterRange
Mid-Continent | Gathering and transportation pipelines | 646 | 21,931 | 24,967 | 4” to 20” 


Mid-Continent Pipeline System.  Our Mid-Continent pipeline system provides access to our Cushing terminal and other storage facilities. Our Mid-Continent pipeline system consists of approximately 646 miles of various sized pipeline, and has a capacity of approximately 50,000 Bpd. The majority of the Mid-Continent pipeline system is located in Oklahoma. Crude oil delivered into the Oklahoma portion of our Mid-Continent pipeline system is transported to our Cushing terminal or delivered to local area refiners. The Mid-Continent pipeline system also includes an approximately 35-mile gathering and transportation system in the Texas Panhandle near Dumas, Texas. Crude oil collected through the Texas Panhandle portion of our Mid-Continent system is transported by pipeline to a station where it is then delivered to market via tanker truck.
The Mid-Continent pipeline system was constructed in various stages beginning in the 1940s, and we believe it has a remaining life of at least 20 years. In late April 2016, as a precautionary measure we suspended service on our Mid-Continent pipeline system due to discovery of a pipeline exposure caused by heavy rains and the erosion of a riverbed in southern Oklahoma. There was no damage to the pipe and no loss of product. In the second quarter of 2016, we took action to mitigate the service suspension and worked with customers to divert volumes and, in certain circumstances, transported volumes to a third-party pipeline system via truck. In addition, the term of the throughput and deficiency agreement on our Eagle pipeline system expired on June 30, 2016, and in July 2016 we completed a connection of the southeastern-most portion of our Mid-Continent pipeline system to our Eagle pipeline system and concurrently reversed the Eagle pipeline system. This enabled us to recapture diverted volumes and deliver those barrels to Cushing, Oklahoma. We restored service of the second Oklahoma pipeline system in July 2018, increasing the transportation capacity of our pipeline systems by approximately 20,000 Bpd. The ability to fully utilize the capacity of these systems may be impacted by the market price of crude oil and producers’ decisions to increase or decrease production in the areas we serve.

 East Texas Pipeline System. We previously owned and operated the East Texas pipeline system, which is located in Texas. In April 2017, we sold the East Texas pipeline system. At closing of the sale, we received cash proceeds of approximately $4.8 million and recorded a gain of less than $0.1 million. 

Significant Customers. For the year ended December 31, 2018, BP Products North America, Inc.; Enterprise Crude Pipeline, LLC; Continental Resources, and Vitol each accounted for at least 10% but not more than 25% of crude oil pipeline services revenue.  The loss of any of these customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, cash flows and results of operations.  No other customer accounted for more than 10% of our crude oil pipeline services revenue during 2018.
Crude Oil Trucking Services

On April 24, 2018, we sold the producer field services business. As a result of the sale of the producer field services business, the Partnership changed the name of the crude oil trucking and producer field services operating segment to crude oil trucking services during the second quarter of 2018. See Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information. 

To complement our pipeline gathering, marketing and transportation business, we use our approximately 60 owned or leased tanker trucks, which have an average tank size of approximately 200 barrels, to move crude oil to aggregation points, pipeline injection stations and storage facilities. Our tanker trucks moved an average of 21,000 Bpd and 27,000 Bpd for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2018, respectively, from wellhead locations not served by pipeline gathering systems. The following table outlines the distribution of our trucking assets among our operating areas as of March 11, 2019:

Location | Number of Trucks
Oklahoma | 40 
Kansas | 10 
Texas | 10 
Total | 60 


Significant Customers. For the year ended December 31, 2018, MV Purchasing, LLC accounted for at least 35% but not more than 40% and Devon Gas Services, LP accounted for at least 10% but not more than 15% of crude oil trucking services revenue.  The loss of either of these customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, cash flows and results of operations.  In addition, approximately 25% of crude oil trucking services revenue for the year ended December 31, 2018, were earned by providing services to our crude oil pipeline services segment. No other customer accounted for more than 10% of our crude oil trucking services revenue during 2018.
Competition

We compete with national, regional and local liquid asphalt terminalling companies and crude oil gathering, storage and pipeline companies, including the major integrated oil companies, of widely varying sizes, financial resources and experience.  We are subject to competition from other crude oil gathering, pipeline transportation, terminalling operations and trucking operations that may be able to supply our customers with the same or comparable services on a more competitive basis. 

The asphalt industry is highly fragmented and regional in nature. Participants range in size from major oil companies to small family-owned businesses.  Participants in the asphalt business include refiners such as BP p.l.c., Flint Hills Resources, L.P., CHS, Inc., ExxonMobil Corporation, ConocoPhillips Co., NuStar Energy L.P., Ergon Refining, Inc., Marathon Petroleum Company LLC, Alon USA LP, Suncor Energy Inc. and Valero Energy Corporation; resellers such as Associated Asphalt Partners, LLC, Idaho Asphalt Supply, Inc. and Asphalt Materials, Inc.; and large road construction firms such as Old Castle Materials, Inc. and Colas SA. We compete for asphalt terminalling services with the national, regional and local industry participants as well as with liquid asphalt terminalling companies, including the major integrated oil companies and a variety of others, such as KinderMorgan Inc., International-Matex Tank Terminals and Houston Fuel Oil Terminal Company.

With respect to our crude oil gathering and transportation services, our competitors include Enterprise Products Partners L.P., Plains All American Pipeline, L.P., Magellan Midstream Partners, L.P., Sunoco Logistics Partners L.P. and Rose Rock Midstream Partners, L.P., among others. With respect to our crude oil terminalling services, our competitors include Magellan Midstream Partners, L.P., Enbridge Inc., Enterprise Products Partners L.P., Plains All American Pipeline, L.P. and Rose Rock Midstream Partners, L.P., among others.  Several of our competitors conduct portions of their operations through publicly 
9

traded partnerships with structures similar to ours, including Plains All American Pipeline, L.P., Enterprise Products Partners L.P., Sunoco Logistics Partners L.P., Magellan Midstream Partners, L.P. and Rose Rock Midstream Partners, L.P.  Our ability to compete could be harmed by factors we cannot control, including:

• | the perception that another company can provide better service;


• | the availability of crude oil alternative supply points, or crude oil supply points located closer to the operations of our customers; and/or


• | a decision by our competitors to acquire or construct crude oil midstream assets and provide gathering, transportation or terminalling services in geographic areas, or to customers, served by our assets and services.


If we are unable to compete effectively with services offered by other midstream enterprises, our financial results and ability to make distributions to our unitholders may be adversely affected. Additionally, we also compete with national, regional and local companies for asset acquisitions and expansion opportunities. Some of these competitors are substantially larger than us and have greater financial resources and lower costs of capital than we do.
Pipeline Regulation
We currently do not offer transportation services regulated by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (“FERC”). Our pipeline segments are subject to regulatory enforcement by the U.S. Department of Transportation’s (“DOT”) Pipeline Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (“PHMSA”).

Gathering and Intrastate Pipeline Regulation. All intrastate pipelines in the state of Oklahoma are regulated by the Oklahoma Corporation Commission (the “OCC”). In the states in which we operate, regulation of crude gathering facilities and intrastate crude pipeline facilities generally includes various safety, environmental and, in some circumstances, nondiscriminatory take requirements and complaint-based rate regulation. 

Pipeline Safety. Our pipelines are subject to state and federal laws and regulations governing design, construction, operation and maintenance of the lines; qualifications of pipeline personnel; public awareness; emergency response and other aspects of pipeline safety.  These laws and regulations are subject to change, resulting in potentially more stringent requirements and increased costs. Applicable pipeline safety regulations establish minimum safety requirements and, for pipelines that pose a greater risk to populated areas or environmentally sensitive areas, impose a more rigorous requirement for the implementation of pipeline integrity management programs for our pipelines. The Pipeline Safety, Regulatory Certainty, and Job Creation Act of 2011 (“Pipeline Safety Act”) was enacted in January 2012.  That legislation increased the maximum civil penalties for pipeline safety administrative enforcement actions; required the DOT to study and report on the expansion of integrity management requirements, the sufficiency of existing gathering line regulations to ensure safety and the feasibility of leak detection systems for hazardous liquid pipelines; required pipeline operators to verify their records on maximum allowable operating pressure; and imposed new emergency response and incident notification requirements. In 2016, the Pipeline Safety Act was reauthorized and amended to add additional construction inspection requirements, clarify integrity management rules and update federally incorporated standards. On January 23, 2017, PHMSA published a final rule that became effective on March 24, 2017. This rule amended the Pipeline Safety Act to include, among other provisions, a specific time frame for notifying PHMSA of accidents and incidents, allowance for PHMSA to recover costs associated with design reviews of new projects, renewal of expiring special permits, processes for requesting protection of confidential commercial information, changes to the drug and alcohol testing requirements and incorporating consensus standards by reference for in-line inspection and stress corrosion cracking direct assessment. The states in which we operate pipelines incorporate into their state rules those federal safety standards for hazardous liquids pipelines contained in Title 49, Part 195 of the Federal Code of Regulations. As a result, the issuance of any new pipeline safety regulations, including additional requirements for integrity management, is likely to increase the operating costs of our pipelines subject to such new requirements, and such future costs may be material.

Trucking Regulation.  We operate a fleet of trucks to transport crude oil and oilfield materials as a private, contract and common carrier. We are licensed to perform both intrastate and interstate motor carrier services. As a motor carrier, we are subject to certain safety regulations issued by the DOT. The trucking regulations cover, among other things, driver operations, maintaining log books, truck manifest preparations, the placement of safety placards on the trucks and trailer vehicles, drug and alcohol testing, safety of operation and equipment and many other aspects of truck operations. We are also subject to requirements of the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act, as amended (“OSHA”), with respect to our trucking operations.

Environmental, Health and Safety Risks
General. Our midstream crude oil gathering, transportation and terminalling operations, as well as our asphalt assets, are subject to stringent federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to protection of the environment, health and safety. Various permits or other authorizations are required under these laws for the operation of our terminals, pipelines and related operations, and may be subject to revocation, modification and renewal. These laws and regulations may also require notice to stakeholders of proposed and ongoing operations; require the installation of expensive pollution control equipment; restrict the types, quantities and concentrations of various substances that can be released into the environment in connection with transporting through pipelines; or establish specific safety and health criteria addressing worker protection. As with liquid asphalt and midstream industries generally, compliance with current and anticipated environmental laws and regulations increases our overall cost of business, including our capital costs to construct, maintain and upgrade equipment and facilities. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of significant administrative, civil and/or criminal penalties, the imposition of investigatory and remedial liabilities and issuance of injunctions that may restrict or prohibit some or all of our operations. We believe that our operations are in substantial compliance with applicable laws, regulations and permits. However, environmental laws and regulations are subject to change, along with varying degrees of interpretation and departmental policies, resulting in potentially more stringent requirements. The recent legislative and regulatory trend has been to place increasingly stringent restrictions and limitations on activities that may affect the environment. Federal, state or local administrative decisions, developments in the federal or state court systems or other governmental or judicial actions may influence the interpretation and/or enforcement of environmental laws and regulations and may thereby increase compliance costs. Although we are not currently aware of any material effects that compliance with current and future environmental laws and regulations will have on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows, we cannot provide any assurance that such costs will not result in such material effects in the future. 

Risks of accidental releases into the environment, such as leaks or spills of petroleum products or hazardous materials from our terminals, pipelines and trucks, are inherent in the nature of both our liquid asphalt and midstream operations. A discharge of petroleum products or hazardous materials into the environment could, to the extent such event is not covered by insurance, subject us to substantial expense, including costs related to environmental cleanup or restoration, compliance with applicable laws and regulations and any personal injury, natural resource or property damage claims made by neighboring landowners and other third parties.

The following is a summary of the more significant current environmental, health and safety laws and regulations to which our business operations are subject and for which compliance may require material capital expenditures or have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.

Water. The federal Clean Water Act (“CWA”) and analogous state and local laws impose restrictions, strict controls and permitting requirements on the discharge of pollutants into waters of the United States and state waters. We note that the term “waters of the United States” is already broadly construed and, in 2015, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers adopted a rule to clarify the meaning of the term “waters of the United States.” Many interested parties believe that the rule expands federal jurisdiction under the CWA. In January 2018, the Supreme Court ruled that district courts have jurisdiction over challenges to the rule, and the EPA has instituted rulemakings to both delay the effective date of the rule and to repeal the rule. In August 2018, the U.S. District Court for the District of South Carolina issued a nationwide injunction against EPA’s rule delaying implementation of the WOTUS definition. Pursuant to the court’s order, the 2015 Clean Water Rule is now in effect in a minority of states, the District of Columbia, and the U.S. territories. Litigation surrounding this rule is ongoing. More recently, in December 2018, the EPA and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers released a proposal to revise the 2015 Clean Water Rule so as to narrow the regulatory definition of waters of the U.S. The CWA and analogous laws provide significant penalties for unauthorized discharges and impose substantial potential liabilities for cleaning up releases into water. In addition, the CWA and analogous state laws require individual permits or coverage under general permits for discharges of storm water runoff from certain types of facilities. Some states also maintain groundwater protection programs that require permits for discharges or operations that may impact groundwater conditions. We believe that we are in substantial compliance with any such applicable state requirements.

The federal Oil Pollution Act, as amended (“OPA”), was enacted in 1990 and amended provisions of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act of 1972, the CWA and other statutes as they pertain to prevention and response to oil spills. The OPA and analogous state and local laws subject owners of facilities used for storing, handling or transporting oil, including trucks and pipelines, to strict, joint and potentially unlimited liability for containment and removal costs, natural resource damages and certain other consequences of an oil spill, where such spill is into navigable waters, along shorelines or in the exclusive economic zone of the United States. The OPA and other analogous laws also impose certain spill prevention, control and countermeasure requirements, such as the preparation of detailed oil spill emergency response plans and the construction of 
11

dikes and other containment structures to prevent contamination of navigable or other waters in the event of an oil overflow, rupture or leak. We believe that we are in substantial compliance with applicable OPA and analogous state and local requirements.

Air Emissions. Our operations are subject to the federal Clean Air Act (“CAA”), as amended, as well as to comparable state and local laws. We believe that our operations are in substantial compliance with applicable laws in those areas in which we operate. Amendments to the CAA enacted in 1990 imposed a federal operating permit requirement for major sources of air emissions. Our crude oil terminal located in Cushing, Oklahoma holds such a permit, which is referred to as a “Title V permit.”  The EPA approved final rules under the CAA that established new air emission controls for oil and natural gas production, pipelines and processing operations that took effect on October 15, 2012. To respond to challenges, the EPA revised certain aspects of the rules and has indicated it may reconsider other aspects. The EPA finalized a rule, which took effect August 2, 2016, to set standards for methane and volatile organic compound emissions from new and modified sources in the oil and gas sector, including transmission. The EPA is currently engaged in rulemaking to stay the effective date of the rule. On September 11, 2018, the EPA also proposed targeted improvements to the rule, including amendments to the rule’s fugitive emissions monitoring requirements, and expects to “significantly reduce” the regulatory burden of the rule in doing so. The costs of compliance with any modified or newly issued rules cannot be predicted. The Obama administration also announced in January 2015 that other federal agencies, including the Bureau of Land Management (“BLM”), PHMSA and the Department of Energy, will impose new or more stringent regulations on the oil and gas sector that are said to have the effect of reducing methane emissions. For example, the BLM adopted rules that took effect on January 17, 2017, to reduce venting, flaring and leaks during oil and natural gas production activities on onshore federal and Indian leases. In December 2017, implementation of this rule was delayed until January 2019, and in September 2018 the BLM proposed a revised rule which scaled back the waste-prevention requirements of the 2016 rule. Environmental groups sued in federal district court a day later to challenge the legality of aspects of the revised rule, and the outcome of this litigation is currently uncertain. Compliance with these rules could result in additional compliance costs for us and for others in our industry. In response to these and other regulatory developments, we may be required to incur certain capital expenditures in the next several years for air pollution control equipment and operational changes in connection with obtaining or maintaining permits and approvals and complying with applicable regulations addressing air emission related issues. However, the status of recent and future rules and rulemaking initiatives under the new administration is uncertain. Although we can provide no assurance, we believe future compliance with the CAA, as currently amended, will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

Climate Change. Legislative and regulatory measures to address concerns that emissions of certain gases, commonly referred to as “greenhouse gases” (“GHGs”), may be contributing to warming of the Earth’s atmosphere are in various phases of discussions or implementation at the international, national, regional and state levels. The oil and gas industry is a direct source of certain GHG emissions, namely carbon dioxide and methane, and future restrictions on such emissions could impact our future operations. In the United States, the U.S. Congress, in the past, has considered but not enacted federal legislation requiring GHG controls. The EPA has adopted regulations under existing provisions of the CAA that require Prevention of Significant Deterioration (“PSD”) pre-construction permits, and Title V operating permits for GHG emissions from certain large stationary sources. Furthermore, in 2009, the EPA adopted rules requiring the monitoring and reporting of GHG emissions from specified sources in the United States., including, among others, certain onshore oil and natural gas processing and fractionating facilities. Monitoring obligations began in 2010 and the emissions reporting requirements took effect in 2011. These EPA rulemakings could affect our operations and ability to obtain air permits for new or modified facilities. In addition, efforts have been and continue to be made in the international community toward the adoption of international treaties or protocols. In 2015, the United States participated in the United Nations Conference on Climate Change, which led to the adoption of the Paris Agreement that will require countries to review and “represent a progression” in their intended nationally determined contributions, which set GHG emission reduction goals, every five years beginning in 2020. However, in June 2017, President Trump announced that the United States plans to withdraw from the Paris Agreement and to seek negotiations either to reenter the Paris Agreement on different terms or establish a new framework agreement. The Paris Agreement provides for a four-year exit process beginning in November 2016, which would result in an effective exit date of November 2020. The United States’s adherence to the exit process and/or the terms on which the United States may reenter the Paris Agreement or a separately negotiated agreement are unclear at this time. Due to the uncertainties surrounding the regulation of and other risks associated with GHG emissions, we cannot predict the financial impact of related developments on our operations.

Legislation and regulations relating to control or reporting of GHG emissions are also in various stages of discussions or implementation in many of the states in which we operate. Passage of climate change legislation or other federal or state legislative or regulatory initiatives that regulate or restrict GHG emissions in areas in which we conduct business could adversely affect the demand for our products and services, and depending on the particular program adopted could increase the costs of our operations, including costs to operate and maintain our facilities, install new emission controls on our facilities, acquire allowances to authorize our GHG emissions (e.g., from natural gas fired combustion units), pay any taxes related to our 
12

GHG emissions and/or administer and manage a GHG emissions program.  At this time, it is not possible to accurately estimate how laws or regulations addressing GHG emissions would impact our business.  Although we do not expect we would be impacted to a greater degree than other similarly situated midstream transporters of petroleum products, the greenhouse gas control programs could have an adverse effect on our cost of doing business and could reduce demand for the products we transport.

In addition to potential impacts on our business directly or indirectly resulting from climate change legislation or regulations, our business also could be negatively affected by climate-related physical changes or changes in weather patterns.  Severe weather could result in damages to or loss of our physical assets, impact our ability to conduct operations and/or result in a disruption of our customers’ operations.  These types of physical changes could also affect entities that provide goods and services to us, and indirectly have an adverse effect on our business as a result of increases in costs or availability of goods and services.  Changes of this nature could have a material adverse impact on our business.

Solid Waste Disposal and Environmental Remediation.  The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, as amended (“CERCLA”), also known as Superfund, as well as comparable state and local laws, impose liability without regard to fault or the legality of the original act, on certain classes of persons associated with the release of a “hazardous substance” into the environment. These persons include the owner or operator and certain former owners and operators of the site or sites where the release occurred and companies that disposed of, or arranged for the disposal of, the hazardous substances found at the site. Under CERCLA, such persons may be subject to strict and, under certain circumstances, joint and several liability for cleanup costs, for damages to natural resources, and for the costs of certain health studies. It is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by releases of hazardous substances or other pollutants. We generate materials in the course of our operations that fall within CERCLA’s hazardous substance definition. Beyond the federal statute, many states have enacted environmental response statutes that are analogous to CERCLA.

We generate wastes, including “hazardous wastes,” that are subject to the requirements of the federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, as amended (“RCRA”), as well as to comparable state and local laws. While normal costs of complying with these laws would not be expected to have a material adverse effect on our financial conditions, we could incur substantial expense in the future if the RCRA exemption for certain oil and gas “exploration and production” waste were eliminated. For example, in 2016, the EPA and certain environmental organizations entered into a consent decree which requires the EPA to propose a rulemaking no later than March 15, 2019, for the revision of criteria regulations pertaining to exempted oil and gas wastes or to sign a determination that revision of the regulations is not necessary. Should any oil and gas exploration and production wastes become subject to RCRA, we would also become subject to more rigorous and costly disposal requirements, resulting in additional capital expenditures or operating expenses for us.

We currently own or lease properties where hazardous substances are being handled, transported or stored or have been handled, transported or stored for many years. Although we believe that operating and disposal practices that were standard in the liquid asphalt, midstream and field services industries at the time were utilized at properties leased or owned by us, historical releases of hazardous substances or associated generated wastes may have occurred on or under the properties owned or leased by us, or on or under other locations where these wastes were taken for disposal. In addition, many of these properties have been operated in the past by third parties whose treatment and disposal or release of hazardous substances or associated generated wastes were not under our control. These properties and the materials disposed on them may be subject to CERCLA, RCRA and analogous state laws. Under such laws, we could be required to remove or remediate previously released hazardous materials or associated generated wastes (including wastes disposed of or released by other site occupants or by prior owners or operators), or to clean up contaminated property (including contaminated groundwater).

Contamination resulting from the release of hazardous substances or associated generated wastes is not unusual in the liquid asphalt and midstream industries.  Other assets we have acquired or will acquire in the future may have environmental remediation liabilities for which we are not indemnified. In the future, we may experience releases of hazardous materials, including petroleum products, into the environment from our pipeline terminalling operations, or discover releases that were previously unidentified. Although we maintain a program designed to prevent and, as applicable, to detect and address such releases promptly, damages and liabilities incurred due to environmental releases from our assets may substantially affect our business.
Regulation of Hydraulic Fracturing. A portion of our customers’ production is developed from unconventional sources, such as shales, that require hydraulic fracturing as part of the production process. Hydraulic fracturing involves the injection of water, sand and chemicals under pressure into shale formations to stimulate crude oil and/or natural gas production. The practice of hydraulic fracturing has been subject to public scrutiny in recent years and various efforts to regulate, or in some cases prohibit, hydraulic fracturing have been pursued at the local, state and federal levels of government, and may be pursued 
13

in the future. For example, several states, including states in which we operate, have imposed disclosure requirements on hydraulic fracturing, and several local governments have prohibited or severely restricted hydraulic fracturing within their jurisdictions. Restrictions on hydraulic fracturing could adversely affect our operations by reducing the volumes of crude oil that we transport.
Endangered Species and Migratory Birds. The Endangered Species Act (“ESA”), restricts activities that may affect endangered or threatened species or their habitats. While some of our operations may be located in areas that are designated as habitats for endangered or threatened species, we believe that we are in substantial compliance with the ESA. However, the designation of previously unlisted endangered or threatened species could cause us to incur additional costs or become subject to operating restrictions or bans or limit future development in the affected areas. The Migratory Bird Treaty Act (“MBTA”), implements various treaties and conventions between the United States and certain other nations for the protection of migratory birds. Pursuant to the MBTA, the taking, killing or possessing of migratory birds is unlawful without a permit, thereby potentially requiring the implementation of operating restrictions or a temporary, seasonal, or permanent ban in affected areas. We believe that we are in substantial compliance with the MBTA.

OSHA. We are subject to the requirements of OSHA, as well as to comparable state and local laws that regulate the protection of worker health and safety. In addition, the OSHA hazard communication standard requires that certain information be maintained about hazardous materials used or produced in operations and that this information be provided to employees, state and local government authorities and citizens. We believe that our operations are in substantial compliance with OSHA requirements and industry standards, record keeping requirements and monitoring of occupational exposure to regulated substances.

National Environmental Policy Act. The National Environmental Policy Act (“NEPA”) requires federal agencies, including the EPA and Department of Interior, to evaluate major agency actions having the potential to significantly impact the environment. In the course of such evaluations, an agency will prepare an environmental assessment that assesses the potential direct, indirect and cumulative impacts of a proposed project and, if necessary, will prepare a more detailed environmental impact statement that may be made available for public review and comment. This process has the potential to delay or even halt the development oil and natural gas projects.
Anti-Terrorism Measures. The federal Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act of 2007 (“Appropriations Act”) requires the Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) to issue regulations establishing risk-based performance standards for the security of chemical and industrial facilities, including oil and gas facilities that are deemed to present “high levels of security risk.” The DHS issued an interim final rule in April 2007 known as the Chemical Facility Anti-Terrorism Standards (“CFATS”) regarding risk-based performance standards to be attained pursuant to the Appropriations Act and, on November 20, 2007, issued an Appendix A to CFATS that established chemicals of interest and their respective threshold quantities that trigger compliance with the interim rules. In December 2014, the Protecting and Securing Chemical Facilities from Terrorist Attacks Act of 2014 (“CFATS Act”) was enacted. The CFATS Act reauthorized the CFATS program for four years. The CFATS program utilizes a Chemical Security Assessment Tool (“CSAT”) to identify chemical facilities potentially deemed “high risk.” The first step of CSAT is user registration, followed by the completion of a top-screen evaluation. The top-screen evaluation analyzes whether a facility stores regulated chemicals above specified thresholds. If it does, the facility must complete a Security Vulnerability Assessment, which identifies a facility’s security vulnerabilities, and develop and implement a Site Security Plan, which must include measures that satisfy the identified risk-based performance standards. DHS must review and approve or deny all security vulnerability assessments and site security plans. CFATS also requires regulated facilities to keep detailed security records and allow DHS the right to enter, inspect, and audit the property, equipment, operations and records of such facilities. We believe we are in substantial compliance with the CFATS program at our facilities that handle, store, use or process COI above the applicable threshold.
Operational Hazards and Insurance

Terminals, pipelines and similar facilities may experience damage as a result of an accident or natural disaster. These hazards can cause personal injury and loss of life, severe damage to and destruction of property and equipment, pollution or environmental damage and suspension of operations. We maintain insurance of various types and varying levels of coverage which we consider adequate under the circumstances to cover our operations and properties, including coverage for pollution-related events. However, such insurance does not cover every potential risk associated with operating terminals, pipelines and other facilities. The overall cost of the insurance program has decreased over the last five years due to favorable claims history, improved risk management practices, collaborative relationships with our underwriters and competitive insurance markets. Through the utilization of deductibles and retentions, we self-insure the “working layer” of loss activity to create a more efficient and cost-effective program. The working layer consists of high-frequency/low-severity losses that are best retained 
14

and managed in-house. We continue to monitor our retentions as they relate to the overall cost and scope of our insurance program.
Employees

As of December 31, 2018, we had approximately 285 employees.  None of these employees are represented by labor unions or covered by any collective bargaining agreement.
