Item 1. Business
Sprouts Farmers Market offers a unique grocery experience featuring an open layout with fresh produce at the heart of the store. Sprouts inspires wellness naturally with a carefully curated assortment of better-for-you products paired with purpose-driven people. We continue to bring the latest in wholesome, innovative products made with lifestyle-friendly ingredients such as organic, plant-based and gluten-free. Since our founding in 2002, we have grown rapidly, significantly increasing our sales, store count and profitability. Headquartered in Phoenix with 374 stores in 23 states as of January 2, 2022, we are one of the largest and fastest growing specialty retailers of fresh, natural and organic food in the United States.
Our Heritage
In 2002, we opened the first Sprouts Farmers Market store in Chandler, Arizona. From our founding in 2002 through January 2, 2022, we have grown rapidly, significantly increasing our sales, store count and profitability, including successfully rebranding to the Sprouts banner 43 Henry’s Farmers Market and 39 Sunflower Farmers Market stores added in 2011 and 2012, respectively, through acquisitions. These three businesses all trace their lineage back to Henry’s Farmers Market and were built with similar store formats and operations including a strong emphasis on value, produce and service in smaller, convenient locations.
Our Growth Strategy
 In 2020, we announced the initial steps of our new long-term growth strategy that we believe will transform our company and drive profitable growth. We are executing on this strategy, focusing on the following areas:
•Win with Target Customers. We are focusing attention on our target customers, identified through research as ‘health enthusiasts’ and ‘experience seekers’, where there is ample opportunity to gain share within these customer segments. We believe our business can continue to grow by leveraging existing strengths in a unique assortment of better-for-you, quality products and by providing a full omnichannel offering through delivery or pickup via our website or the Sprouts app.
 •Update Format and Expand in Select Markets. We are beginning to deliver unique smaller stores with expectations of stronger returns, while maintaining the approachable, fresh-focused farmer’s market heritage Sprouts is known for. In 2021, we opened three stores and remodeled one store featuring our new format. Our geographic store expansion and new store placement will intersect where our target customers live, in markets with growth potential and supply chain support, which we believe will provide a long runway of at least 10% annual unit growth beginning in 2023.
 •Create an Advantaged Fresh Supply Chain. We believe our network of fresh distribution centers can drive efficiencies across the chain and support growth plans. To further deliver on our fresh commitment and reputation, as well as to improve financial results, we will aspire to ultimately position fresh distribution centers within a 250-mile radius of stores. With the opening of two fresh distribution centers in 2021, we now have more than 85% of our stores within 250 miles of a distribution center.
 

•Refine Brand and Marketing Approach. We believe we are elevating our national brand recognition and positioning by telling our unique brand story rooted in product innovation and differentiation. We are investing savings from removing our print ad into increasing customer engagement through digital and social connections, driving additional sales growth and loyalty.
 •Deliver on Financial Targets and Box Economics. We are measuring and reporting on the success of this strategy against a number of long-term financial and operational targets. With the implementation of our strategy, we have significantly improved our margin structure above our 2019 baseline.
 

Our Stores and Operations
We believe our stores represent a blend of farmers markets, natural foods stores, and smaller specialty markets, differentiating us from other food retailers, while also providing a broad offering for our customers.
•Store Design and Experience. Our stores are organized in a “flipped” conventional food retail store model, positioning our produce at the center of the store surrounded by a specialty grocery offering. Produce remains the heart of our stores, as we typically dedicate approximately 20% of a store’s selling square footage to produce, which we believe is significantly higher than many of our peers. The stores are designed with open layouts and low displays, intended to provide an easy-to-shop environment that invokes a farmers’ market experience and allows our customers to view the entire store. Our small box format allows for quick in-and-out service, and our curated assortment of responsibly and locally sourced items offer surprise and delightful shopping experiences. The below diagram shows a sample layout of our new smaller format stores: 
 
•Customer Engagement. We are committed to providing, and believe we have, best-in-class customer engagement, which builds trust with our customers and differentiates the Sprouts shopping experience from that of many of our competitors. We design our stores to maximize personal connections with our purpose-driven team members, as we believe this interaction provides an opportunity to educate customers and provides a valued, differentiated customer service model, which enhances customer loyalty and increases visits and purchases over time. In addition, we continue to expand mobile and digital opportunities to further engage with our customers and provide a full omnichannel offering as many customers use both in-store and online for their grocery needs.
 •Store Size. Currently, our stores are generally between 28,000 and 30,000 square feet, which we believe is smaller than many of our peers’ average stores. Under our long-term growth strategy, our new format stores feature a smaller box size, generally between 21,000 and 25,000 square feet, that are less expensive to build, reduce non-selling space, reduce occupancy and operating costs and leverage the strengths of our older, highly productive stores. Our stores are located in a variety of mid-sized and larger shopping centers, lifestyle centers and in certain cases, independent single-unit, stand-alone developments. The size of our stores and our real estate strategy provide us flexibility in site selection, including entering into new developments or existing sites formerly operated by other retailers, including other grocery banners, office supply stores, electronics retailers and other second generation space. 
 

•Team Members. Our stores are typically staffed with 75 to 100 full and part-time team members. We strive to create a strong and unified company culture and develop team members throughout the entire organization, and we assist our store teams with our store support office and regional teams. We have prioritized making investments in training that we believe enhances our team members’ knowledge, particularly with respect to our expanded and evolving product offerings, so our team members can continue to engage and assist our customers. We believe our team members contribute to our consistently high service standards and that this helps us successfully open and operate our stores. 
 Our Product Offering
We are a complete natural and organic food retailer that offers a unique shopping experience for our customers. To offer the right assortment of healthy alternatives and good-for-you options, we curate our product mix to differentiated fresh, natural and organic foods and healthier options throughout all of our departments, with innovative products that feature lifestyle friendly ingredients.
Fresh, Natural and Organic Foods
We focus our product offerings on fresh, natural and organic foods. Foods are generally considered “fresh” if they are minimally processed or in their raw state not subject to any type of preservation or freezing. Natural foods can be broadly defined as foods that are minimally processed and are free of synthetic preservatives, artificial sweeteners, colors, flavors and other additives, growth hormones, antibiotics, hydrogenated oils, stabilizers and emulsifiers. Essentially, natural foods are largely or completely free of non-naturally occurring chemicals and are as near to their whole, natural state as possible.
Organic foods refer to the food itself as well as the method by which it is produced. In general, organic operations must demonstrate that they are protecting natural resources, conserving biodiversity, and using only approved substances and must be certified by a USDA-accredited certifying agency. Further, retailers that handle, store or sell organic products must implement measures to protect their organic character.
Product Categories
 We categorize the varieties of products we sell as perishable and non-perishable. Perishable product categories include produce, meat, seafood, deli, bakery, floral and dairy and dairy alternatives. Non-perishable product categories include grocery, vitamins and supplements, bulk items, frozen foods, beer and wine, and natural health and body care. The following is a breakdown of our perishable and non-perishable sales mix:

 | 2021 | | | 2020 | | 2019
Perishables | | 57.7 | % | | 57.2 | % | 57.7 | %
Non-Perishables | | 42.3 | % | | 42.8 | % | 42.3 | %

Departments
While we focus on providing an abundant and affordable offering of natural and organic produce, our stores also include the following departments that enable customers to have a full grocery shopping experience: packaged groceries, meat and seafood, deli, vitamins and supplements, dairy and dairy alternatives, bulk items, baked goods, frozen foods, natural health and body care, and beer and wine. Our departments reflect our intentional curation of responsibly and locally sourced products. We believe each of our departments provides high-quality, differentiated and value-oriented offerings for our customers which we continuously refine with our customer preferences in mind.
Private Label
We have been expanding the breadth of our Sprouts branded products over the last several years and have a dedicated product development team focused on continuing this growth. These products feature competitively priced specialty and innovative products, with great taste profiles and quality and strict ingredient standards that we believe equal or exceed national brands. Our private label program accounted for approximately 16% of our revenue in fiscal 2021. Our private label brands drive value by offering our customers lower prices while still delivering generally higher margin as compared to branded products, as well as an assortment of differentiated, attribute-driven products that are only available at our stores. We believe our private label products build and enhance the Sprouts brand and allow us to distinguish ourselves from our competitors, promoting customer loyalty and creating a destination shopping experience.
Product Innovation
 Our stores feature a curated selection of differentiated products that resonate with our target customers. Since our founding, Sprouts has carried a wide selection of innovative natural and organic brands that align with our mission to inspire healthy living for everyone. Our centralized buying strategy has always put niche brands first, and we have nurtured and grown many once-shoestring brands that now serve as category leaders. As we continue to grow, we are committed to growing our relationships with niche vendors to bring their unique, quality products to the millions of shoppers who visit our stores every week. Sprouts is on the forefront of food innovation and has paved the way for natural food trends for two decades. We embrace product innovation, and our stores serve as an incubator for growth across the natural foods industry, highlighting new and differentiated items in our innovation center merchandising displays.
 In 2021, we have launched more than 5,700 new and unique branded and private label products, focused purely on innovation and taste. We feature thousands of responsibly sourced products with certifications and attributes that are desired by our target customer base, including organic, paleo, keto, plant-based, non-GMO, fair trade, gluten-free, vegan, grass-fed, raw and humane certified. We will continue to lead in product innovation to bring more new, innovative offerings into every department of our stores.
Sourcing and Distribution
We manage the buying of, and set the standards for, the products we sell, and we source our products from hundreds of vendors and suppliers, both domestically and internationally. We are committed to sourcing products in a manner that respects people, our communities and the environment, and we partner with suppliers and service providers that share this commitment, as included in our Supplier Code of Conduct.
We work closely with our supply chain partners to improve animal welfare standards, sustainable seafood sourcing, support for organic agriculture and the ethical treatment of people. For an overview of our product sourcing policies and programs, please visit: about.sprouts.com/product-sourcing/.
 We believe, based on our industry experience, that our strong relationships in the produce business provide us a competitive advantage and enable us to offer high-quality produce at prices we believe are significantly below those of conventional food retailers and even further below high-end natural and organic food retailers. Our centralized buyers are supported by dedicated regional procurement teams that provide us flexibility to procure produce on local, regional and national levels. Our regional produce buying teams allow us to form meaningful relationships with farmers, and our flexibility allows us to purchase produce in smaller quantities than larger chains to help us bring new and innovative products to our customers before they become commoditized. These products become treasure hunt items found at our stores.
 

Given the importance of produce to our stores, we source, warehouse and self-distribute nearly all produce. This ensures our produce meets our high-quality standards. We have department and product specifications that ensure a consistently high level of quality across product ingredients, production standards and other key measures of freshness, natural and organic standards. These specifications are measured at both entry and exit points to our facilities. We manage every aspect of quality control in our produce distribution centers.
As a pillar of our long-term growth strategy, we expect to create an advantaged supply chain and aspire to locate our distribution centers within 250 miles of the majority of our stores. With the opening of two new distribution centers in 2021, we currently have seven distribution centers, with two located in California and one located in each of Arizona, Texas, Georgia, Colorado and Florida. The increased proximity of our distribution centers to our stores has allowed us to deliver on our fresh commitment to our customers, by sourcing more from products from local farmers and improving efficiencies in our distribution process.
 We believe our scale, together with this decentralized purchasing structure and flexibility generates cost savings, which we then pass on to our customers. Distributors and farmers recognize the volume of goods we sell through our stores and our flexible purchasing and supply chain model allows us to opportunistically acquire produce at great value which we will frequently pass along to our customers.
For all non-produce products, we use third-party distributors and vendors to distribute products directly to our stores following specifications and quality control standards that are set by us.
KeHE Distributors, LLC (“KeHE”), is our primary supplier of dry grocery and frozen food products, accounting for approximately 44%, 42% and 40% of our total purchases in fiscal 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. Another 3% of our total purchases in each of fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019 were made through our secondary supplier, United Natural Foods, Inc. (“UNFI”). Our primary supplier of meat and seafood accounted for approximately 13% of our total purchases in each of fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019. See “Risk Factors—Disruption of significant supplier relationships could negatively affect our business.”
Our Pricing, Marketing and Advertising
Pricing
 As a farmers market style store, we emphasize low prices throughout the entire store, as we are able to pass along the benefits of our scale and purchasing power to our customers. We position our prices with everyday value for our customers with regular promotions that drive traffic and trial.
Marketing and Advertising
 During 2020 as part of our long-term growth strategy to refine our brand and marketing approach, we launched our new branding campaign: Sprouts, Where Goodness Grows. This campaign, which launched on television, social, digital and radio media, is meant to drive home our farmers market experience by highlighting produce, the heart of our stores, and inspire our target customers to engage with our brand by focusing on our differentiation and innovation. In 2021, we executed on this strategy and expanded Sprouts’ marketing reach through digital channels and new partnerships sharing our brand and differentiated selection of innovative products and fresh produce to a growing audience.
 

We believe the launch of our new brand will reach more customers through our story telling on television and digital media than our prior approach of reaching customers by paper flyers, which we largely discontinued in 2020. During 2021, we garnered more than 215 million weekly digital flyer impressions, demonstrating that our leverage of digital media to reach customers and share what is new and unique at Sprouts resonates with the habits of today’s shoppers. We experienced a 76% increase in SMS subscribers and a 26% increase in email subscribers in 2021. Additionally, digital, TV and radio ads reached shoppers with 5.7 billion impressions, and we ended the year with 2.1 million followers across all social platforms. Leveraging digital communications targeted to specific geographic areas also provides us with greater flexibility to offer different promotions and respond to local competitive activity and allows us to make our customers aware of what is new and different in our stores in real time.
 Sprouts continues to educate and reach shoppers through social partnerships, special content and sponsorships. Among our 2021 highlights:
 •We worked with 350 social influencers from coast-to-coast last year who shared what they love about Sprouts in their own words to their unique followers. 
 •In October, we hosted our first-ever virtual wellness panel, and it gained the interest of shoppers with more than 19,000 RSVPs and addressed anxiety, inflammation and immune health with tips and words from experts.
 •Sprouts announced its first ever back-of-jersey sponsorship with the Angel City Football Club, Los Angeles’ first-ever National Women’s Soccer League team. A portion of the partnership funds are being allocated to support local causes that provide fresh food access and further children’s nutrition education throughout Los Angeles. 
 •Sprouts also partnered with MyFitnessPal as the online platform’s first retail sponsor. Through healthy recipes and articles, more than 21 million users interacted with the sponsored content, and over 79,000 users participated in a 30-day healthy eating challenge. 
 •In conjunction with the Arizona State University athletic department, Sprouts developed two unique nutrition centers that support the health of more than 600 student athletes across 26 sports.
 We developed and maintain the Sprouts app on which we include digital coupons and in-store scan features, and our website, www.sprouts.com, on which we display our weekly sales flyers, highlight our product offerings and offer special deals. Our website and app also feature online ordering for delivery and pickup. We offer home deliveries from our stores through partner services in all of our markets nationwide, as well as “click and collect” pickup service at all of our stores. We will continue to explore mobile and digital opportunities to further connect with our customers and leverage data for better customer insights.
 Our Customers
 We have employed deep research to understand our target customer, what occasions drive purchases, what they buy and where they buy it. Our research yielded a better understanding that our target customer is comprised of two specific groups: health enthusiasts and experience seekers, and we are focusing on these groups in our long-term growth strategy.
Our target customer seeks better-for-you grocery options and innovative, quality products to support their healthy lifestyle. We believe they are engaged and connected to what they eat – how it makes them feel, where it comes from and the role it can play in their lives. Our target customer covers a wide range of incomes and age demographics – from Baby Boomers to Generation Z – and seek a variety of healthy and organic options in addition to a great store experience. We believe we only serve a small portion of these target customers at present and have an opportunity to gain a larger proportion of their market share of food-at-home purchases by targeting and identifying those innovative, attribute-driven, quality products and providing the in-store experience and support in living a healthy lifestyle that they are seeking.
Environmental, Social and Governance
 Central to our identity is a genuine commitment to social and environmental responsibility. We care deeply about the health and well-being of our customers, team members, communities and our planet. We work collaboratively with our supply chain partners, community organizations, and industry experts to understand our material impacts and prioritize where we direct our environmental, social and governance ("ESG") efforts to maximize our influence. Through this materiality review with internal and external stakeholders, we intend to focus our efforts on sustainable and responsible sourcing, plastics and packaging reduction and carbon emission reduction.
 Our 2021 ESG highlights included:
•Achieved 24% of total sales from organic products; 
 •Adopted standards aligned with the Better Chicken Commitment to improve broiler chicken welfare meaningfully and measurably; 
 •Sourced all shell and liquid eggs sold in our stores from cage-free, organic, or free-range farms as of December 2021; 
 •Recovered 78% of food waste, and donated the equivalent of 26 million meals; 
 •Recycled more than 500 tons of plastic from customer returned bags and in-store use; 
 •Reduced carbon emissions by 10% per square foot from 2019; and
 •Engaged a third-party consultant to assist with setting a science-based target for greenhouse gas emission reduction.
 Based on our ESG accomplishments, we received a rating of AAA in the 2021 MSCI ESG Ratings assessment. The AAA rating represents the highest on the scale and signifies a company leading its industry in managing the most significant ESG risks and opportunities. For more information on our ESG efforts and reporting, including our most recent ESG reports, please visit about.sprouts.com/sustainability/. The information contained on or accessible through our website and in our ESG reports is not incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
 The Sprouts Healthy Communities Foundation
 In 2015, we formed the Sprouts Healthy Communities Foundation (referred to as our “Foundation”), a registered 501(c)(3) organization focused on promoting nutrition education and increasing access to fresh, nutritious food in communities where Sprouts operates. Since the Foundation’s inception, it has awarded $15 million in donations to more than 380 non-profit organizations and hosted an estimated 200 volunteer service projects. Sprouts fully funds the Foundation’s programs directly. For more information on our Foundation, please visit about.sprouts.com/sprouts-foundation/.
 Human Capital Management
At Sprouts, we are proud of our “People Powered, Purpose Driven” culture focused on improving the health of the communities we serve. Customer engagement is critical to our culture and growth plans, and we place great importance on recruiting candidates and retaining team members that have a love of food, pride themselves on service excellence, and share our purpose driven culture. We build on our targeted recruitment efforts with robust training on customer engagement and product knowledge to ensure there is friendly, knowledgeable staff in every store. As of January 2, 2022, we had approximately 31,000 team members. None of our team members are subject to collective bargaining agreements. We consider our relations with our team members to be good, and we have never experienced a strike or significant work stoppage.


2021 Highlights. Despite the ongoing challenges that occurred during 2021 related to the COVID-19 pandemic, we are proud of the following achievements during the year:
 •We finalized three core values that will intentionally shape our culture and act as a lens to guide the decisions we make. The values will inform our behaviors and actions to create a sense of inclusion and belonging. 
 •As one of the fastest growing specialty retailers of fresh, natural and organic food in the country, we created 1,300 new jobs in 2021 through new store openings.
 •Additionally, we promoted 6,900 team members and filled 79% of store manager positions with internal candidates.
 •Team members saved approximately $17.4 million through store discounts.
 •We awarded 75 scholarships to team members and dependents, equating to more than $1.5 million in scholarships since our scholarship program began.
 Total Rewards. We are proud to offer our team members competitive pay, store discounts, and opportunities for professional growth. We regularly assess prevailing wages in the markets in which we operate and offer competitive wages and benefits as we believe engaged team members contribute to consumer satisfaction. Our total rewards program features the following:
•We have a quarterly bonus plan for which all store team members are eligible.
 •We offer a paid sick time policy for all team members and offer generous leave programs.
 •Beginning in 2021, all hourly team members are eligible for semi-annual reviews and merit increases.
 •We offer team members the opportunity to participate in the Western Association of Food Chains’ Retail Management Certificate Program that provides the core skills and knowledge to move into a management role in the retail industry. During 2021, 129 Sprouts team members enrolled in this program, and 13 team members graduated from the program.
 •We offer The Henry Boney Memorial Scholarship, which is designed to offer team members or their dependents a $2,000 scholarship to achieve their college dreams.
 •All team members over 18 can enroll in our 401(k) plan the first of the month following three months of service, and we offer a contribution matching program. 
 •We offer a variety of medical plans to allow team members the ability to choose the best plan for them and their families.
 •We offer a well-being program dedicated to the mental, physical, emotional and financial well-being of our team members. 
 •All Sprouts team members can save at our stores, with a 15% Work Perk Discount that can increase to 20% with a simple annual wellness check. 
 •We are offering our team members up to two hours of paid time off to receive each dose of the COVID-19 vaccine and enhanced our paid sick time off to support our team members during the pandemic. 
 

Education, Training and Safety. We believe Sprouts is an attractive place to work with significant growth opportunities for our approximately 31,000 team members. To grow the next generation of leaders at Sprouts, we have developed a Leadership Training Model for high-potential internal team members to take their careers to the next level, and to on-board store managers new to Sprouts. In 2021, we had 17 Leadership graduates totaling more than 4,000 hours in training. We have also partnered with an industry-leading virtual reality technology firm to implement cutting-edge virtual reality training in all of our stores in 2021. Our store team members completed over 585,000 hours of in-store training in 2021, and due to the COVID-19 pandemic, certain traditional training programs transitioned to webinars and learning modules.
We are committed to maintaining a safe environment for our team members and customers. Our stores implement various programs to reduce and eliminate hazards, resulting in a safer workplace and improved shopping experience. In 2021, our stores reported a 22% reduction in non-COVID worker compensation claims over the prior year.
 Diversity and Inclusion. We pride ourselves on supporting an inclusive, respectful, and caring culture throughout our organization. In 2021, approximately 51% of our team members were female and approximately 48% of our team members were ethnically diverse, which we believe to be in-line or slightly better than our grocery peers. Further, of our promotions across all store roles, 54% were awarded to female team members and 49% were awarded to ethnically diverse team members. We conduct formal talent review and succession planning to identify top talent and intentionally make hiring and promotional decisions that consider inclusion of team members from underrepresented backgrounds. In 2021, Sprouts launched its first team member resource group "Inspiring Women at Sprouts" to continue to build a culture of inclusion and belonging.
Growing Our Business
 As part of our long-term growth plan, we plan to expand our store base with at least 10% annual unit growth beginning in 2023. Our geographic store expansion and new store placement will intersect where our target customers live, in markets with growth potential and supply chain support, providing a long runway for us to achieve our growth target.
We intend to continue to focus our growth on areas where we have a large concentration of stores, such as California and Texas, while building out our newer markets, such as Florida and the Mid-Atlantic region, to achieve a larger concentration of stores. We have opened 12, 22 and 28 new stores in fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. We expect to continue to expand our store base with approximately 15 to 20 store openings planned for fiscal 2022. Beyond 2022, we expect to begin targeting at least 10% annual unit growth, subject to the impact of supply chain disruptions which delayed a number of our new store openings in 2021.
 


The below diagram shows our store footprint, by state, as of January 2, 2022.
   


New Store Development
We have an extensive process for new store site selection, which includes in-depth analysis of area demographics, competition, growth potential, traffic patterns, grocery spend and other key criteria. We have a dedicated real estate team as well as a real estate committee that includes certain of our executive officers. Multiple members of this committee often conduct an on-site inspection prior to approving any new location.
We have been successful across a variety of urban, suburban and rural locations in diverse geographies, from coast to coast, which we believe supports the portability of the Sprouts brand and store model into a wide range of markets. As we implement our long-term growth strategy, our future stores will feature a smaller box size than our recent vintages, generally between 21,000 and 25,000 square feet. By reducing our store square footage, we expect that our newer stores will have a lower cost to build and decreased occupancy and operating costs, while reducing non-selling space that will result in generally flat sales compared to our larger stores. We expect these cost reductions will allow us to deliver strong returns and continue to accelerate our growth.
See “Item 2. Properties” for additional information with respect to our store locations.
Seasonality
 Our business is subject to modest seasonality. Our average weekly sales per store fluctuate throughout the year and are typically highest in the first half of the fiscal year and lowest during the fourth quarter.
COVID-19 Pandemic
 As COVID-19 has spread throughout the country, the situation has continued to evolve, including, more recently, the surge of variants resulting in record numbers of cases and evolving governmental requirements on vaccination and testing for employers. As we cycled periods of 2020 where our results benefited from the initial onset of the pandemic, we have reported declines in year over year net sales, comparable store sales growth and customer traffic. We have seen varying levels of inflation and experienced obstacles sourcing in certain categories resulting from product supply disruptions complicated by the pandemic. In addition, due to continued difficulties in obtaining necessary equipment from third parties due to supply chain delays complicated by the COVID-19 pandemic, seven of our planned new store-openings in the fourth quarter of 2021 were delayed until 2022. In addition, the possible implementation of governmental vaccine mandates and testing requirements may cause additional costs and disruptions in workforce availability. The ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our results of operations for future periods will depend on the length, severity and potential resurgence of the pandemic, vaccine efficacy, adoption and mandates, the emergence and severity of COVID-19 variants and governmental, team member and consumer actions taken in response, which we cannot predict. These uncertainties make it challenging for our management to estimate our future business performance. See “Risk Factors—The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has disrupted our business and could negatively impact our financial condition.” for additional information.
Our Competition and Industry
 We operate within the competitive and highly fragmented grocery store industry which encompasses a wide array of food retailers, including large conventional independent and chain supermarkets, warehouse clubs, small grocery and convenience stores, and natural and organic, specialty, mass, discount and other food retail and online formats. Based on our industry experience, we believe our new stores capture market share from conventional supermarkets and specialty concepts in the supermarket segment.


Conventional supermarket customers are attracted to unique product offerings, formats and differentiated shopping experiences. Based on our industry experience, we also believe consumers are increasingly focused on health and wellness and are actively seeking healthy foods in order to improve eating habits. This overall demand for healthy products is driven by many factors, including increased awareness about the benefits of eating healthy, a greater focus on preventative health measures, and the rising costs of health care. We believe customers are attracted to retailers with comprehensive health and wellness product offerings. As a result, food retailers are offering an increased assortment of fresh, natural and organic foods as well as vitamins and supplements to meet this demand.
 Our competitors include conventional supermarkets such as Kroger, Albertsons and Safeway, and other food retailers such as Whole Foods, Natural Grocers by Vitamin Cottage and Trader Joe’s, as well as mass or discount retailers, warehouse membership clubs, online retailers such as Amazon, specialty stores, restaurants, and home delivery and meal solution companies. We believe Sprouts offers consumers a compelling value and differentiated products relative to our competitors and will continue to benefit from increasing consumer focus on health, wellness and value, as well as their emphasis on an enhanced shopping experience featuring a broad selection of attribute-driven products along with exceptional customer engagement.
Insurance and Risk Management
We use a combination of insurance and self-insurance to provide for potential liability for workers’ compensation, general liability, product liability, director and officers’ liability, team member healthcare benefits, and other casualty and property risks. Changes in legal trends and interpretations, variability in inflation rates, changes in the nature and method of claims settlement, benefit level changes due to changes in applicable laws, insolvency of insurance carriers, and changes in discount rates could all affect ultimate settlements of claims. We evaluate our insurance requirements on an ongoing basis to ensure we maintain adequate levels of coverage.
Trademarks and Other Intellectual Property
We believe that our intellectual property has substantial value and has contributed to the success of our business. In particular, our trademarks, including our registered SPROUTS FARMERS MARKET® and SPROUTS® trademarks, are valuable assets that we believe reinforce our customers’ favorable perception of our stores. In addition to our trademarks, we believe that our trade dress, which includes the human-scale design, arrangement, color scheme and other physical characteristics of our stores and product displays, is a large part of the farmers market atmosphere we create in our stores and enables customers to distinguish our stores and products from those of our competitors.
From time to time, third parties have used names similar to ours, have applied to register trademarks similar to ours and, we believe, have infringed or misappropriated our intellectual property rights. Third parties have also, from time to time, opposed our trademarks and challenged our intellectual property rights. We respond to these actions on a case-by-case basis. The outcomes of these actions have included both negotiated out-of-court settlements as well as litigation.
Information Technology Systems
We have made significant investments in information technology infrastructure and business systems, including point-of-sale, data warehouse, labor management, purchasing, inventory control, demand forecasting, and financial and reporting systems. Our recent investments have focused on solutions to enhance our operational productivity, optimize our labor, maintain our in-stock positions and forecast our customer demand, while maintaining our high quality and value proposition. All of our stores operate under one integrated information technology platform which allows for our current and future store growth. We will continue making investments in our current information technology infrastructure and invest in systems that scale to support our growth and add efficiencies to our growing operations. In addition, we continue our focused efforts on limiting risk of a cyber-breach by investing in IT security technology tools, resources, penetration assessments, third-party security audits and employee training.
Regulatory Compliance
 Our stores and online retail operations are subject to various local, state and federal laws, regulations and administrative practices affecting our business. We must comply with provisions regulating health, sanitation and food safety standards, food labeling, equal employment, minimum wages, data privacy, environmental protection, licensing for the manufacture, preparation and sale of food and, in many stores, licensing for beer and wine or other alcoholic beverages. Our operations, including the manufacturing, processing, formulating, packaging, labeling and advertising of products by us and our vendors are subject to regulation by various federal agencies, including the Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”), the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”), the U.S. Department of Agriculture (“USDA”), the Consumer Product Safety Commission (“CPSC”) and the Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”).
Food. The FDA has comprehensive authority to regulate the manufacture, labeling, distribution, sale, marketing and safety of food and food ingredients (other than meat, poultry, catfish and certain egg products), as well as dietary supplements under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (“FDCA”). Similarly, the USDA’s Food Safety Inspection Service (“FSIS”) is the public health agency responsible for ensuring that the nation’s commercial supply of meat, poultry, catfish and certain egg products is safe, wholesome and correctly labeled and packaged under the Federal Meat Inspection Act and the Poultry Products Inspection Act.
Congress amended the FDCA in 2011 through passage of the Food Safety Modernization Act (“FSMA”), which greatly expanded FDA’s regulatory obligations over all actors in the supply chain. Industry actors continue to determine the best pathways to implement FSMA’s regulatory mandates and FDA’s promulgating regulations throughout supply chains, as most requirements are now in effect. Such regulations mandate participation in USDA's Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points (“HACCP”) program or FDA's Hazard Analysis and Risk-Based Prevention Controls (“HARPC”) program, as applicable, which require that risk-based preventive controls be observed by the majority of food producers. This authority applies to all domestic food facilities and, by way of imported food supplier verification requirements, to all foreign facilities that supply food products.


The FDA and FSIS also exercise broad jurisdiction over the labeling and promotion of food. Labeling is a broad concept that, under certain circumstances, extends even to product-related claims and representations made on a company’s website or similar printed or graphic medium. All foods, including dietary supplements, must bear labeling that provides consumers with essential information with respect to standards of identity, net quantity, nutrition facts labeling, ingredient statement, and allergen disclosures. The agencies also regulate the use of structure/function claims, health claims and nutrient content claims. Additional in-store labeling requirements, such as disclosure of calories and other nutrient information for frequently sold items are now in effect. In addition, various nutrition initiatives that will impact many actors in our supply chain, such as the elimination of certain partially hydrogenated oils and the adoption of a new nutritional labeling format, began to go into effect in 2020.
USDA’s Agricultural Marketing Service (“AMS”) oversees compliance with the National Organic Standards Program and related labeling activity. In addition, AMS has responsibility for newly enacted requirements surrounding the disclosure of the presence of bioengineered ingredients in food, scheduled to become mandatory in 2022.
AMS also enforces the Perishable Agricultural Commodities Act (PACA) which imposes fair business practices on parties engaged in the sale of perishable fruits, vegetables and some nuts. Entities that buy and sell perishable commodities require a PACA license and disputes about sales of produce are subject to rules and regulations under PACA.
 Dietary Supplements. The FDA has comprehensive authority to regulate the safety of dietary supplements, dietary ingredients, labeling and current good manufacturing practices. Congress amended the FDCA in 1994 through passage of the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act (“DSHEA”), which greatly expanded FDA’s regulatory authority over dietary supplements. Through DSHEA, dietary supplements became a separately defined FDA-regulated product that is also subject to the general food regulations. Dietary supplements are allowed to carry structure/function claims which relate to support of healthy functioning. However, no statement on a dietary supplement may expressly or implicitly represent that it will diagnose, cure, mitigate, treat or prevent a disease.
Cosmetics. The FDA has comprehensive authority to regulate cosmetics under the FDCA and the Fair Packaging and Labeling Act (“FPLA”). No cosmetic product labeling or marketing may advertise any therapeutic use, such as treating or preventing disease, or claim to affect the structure or function of the body.
 

Homeopathic Products. The FDA has the authority to regulate homeopathic products. Under the FDCA, homeopathic products are subject to the same requirements related to approval, adulteration and misbranding as other drug products. There are no FDA-approved products labeled as homeopathic. any product labeled as homeopathic is being marketed in the U.S. without FDA evaluation for safety or effectiveness.
Food, Cosmetics, Homeopathic Product and Dietary Supplement Advertising. The FTC exercises jurisdiction over the advertising of foods, cosmetics, homeopathic products and dietary supplements. The FTC has the power to institute monetary sanctions and the imposition of consent decrees and penalties that can severely limit a company’s business practices. In recent years, the FTC has instituted numerous enforcement actions against companies for failure to have adequate substantiation for claims made in advertising or for the use of false or misleading advertising claims.
Compliance. As is common in our industry, we rely on our suppliers and contract manufacturers to ensure that the products they manufacture and sell to us comply with all applicable regulatory and legislative requirements. In general, we seek certifications of compliance, representations and warranties, indemnification and/or insurance from our suppliers and contract manufacturers. However, even with adequate insurance and indemnification, any claims of non-compliance could significantly damage our reputation and consumer confidence in products we sell. In addition, the failure of such products to comply with applicable regulatory and legislative requirements could prevent us from marketing the products or require us to recall or remove such products from our stores. In order to comply with applicable statutes and regulations, our suppliers and contract manufacturers have from time to time reformulated, eliminated or relabeled certain of their products and we have revised certain provisions of our sales and marketing program.
