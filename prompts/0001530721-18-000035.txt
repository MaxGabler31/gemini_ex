Item 1. Business
Our Company
We are a global fashion luxury group of industry-leading fashion luxury brands led by a world-class management team and renowned designers. The Michael Kors (“MK”) brand was launched over 35 years ago by Mr. Michael Kors, whose vision has taken the MK brand from its beginnings as an American luxury sportswear house to a global accessories, footwear and apparel company with a global distribution network that has presence in over 100 countries through company-operated retail stores and e-commerce sites, leading department stores, specialty stores and select licensing partners. On November 1, 2017, we completed the acquisition of Jimmy Choo Group Limited (formerly known as Jimmy Choo PLC ) and its subsidiaries (collectively, “Jimmy Choo”). The combination of Michael Kors and Jimmy Choo brought together two iconic brands that are industry leaders in style and trend and created a global fashion luxury group with a diversified geographic and product portfolio, which we believe will strengthen the Company’s future revenue growth opportunities.
Prior to third quarter of Fiscal 2018, we operated our Michael Kors business in three segments: Retail, Wholesale and Licensing. With the acquisition of Jimmy Choo, the Company began to operate in four reportable segments, which are as follows:

• | MK Retail — accounted for approximately 57.5% of our total revenue in Fiscal 2018 and includes sales of Michael Kors products from 379 retail stores in the Americas (including concessions) and 450 international retail stores (including concessions) throughout Europe and certain parts of Asia, as well as from Michael Kors e-commerce sites in the United States (“U.S.”), Canada, certain parts of Europe, China, Japan and South Korea as of March 31, 2018.


• | MK Wholesale — accounted for approximately 34.7% of our total revenue in Fiscal 2018 and includes wholesale sales of Michael Kors products through 1,403 department store doors and 875 specialty store doors in the Americas and through 1,048 specialty store doors and 218 department store doors internationally as of March 31, 2018. MK Wholesale also includes revenues from sales of products to Michael Kors geographic licensees.


• | MK Licensing — accounted for approximately 3.1% of our total revenue in Fiscal 2018 and includes royalties and advertising contributions earned on licensed products and use of Michael Kors trademarks, and rights granted to third parties for the right to operate retail stores and/or sell Michael Kors products in certain geographic regions.


• | Jimmy Choo — accounted for approximately 4.7% of our total revenue in Fiscal 2018 (from November 1, 2017 through March 31, 2018) and includes worldwide sales of Jimmy Choo products through 182 retail stores (including concessions) and through Jimmy Choo e-commerce sites in the U.S., certain parts of Europe and Japan, through 629 wholesale doors, as well as through product and geographic licensing arrangements, as of March 31, 2018.

For additional financial information regarding our segments, see Segment Information note in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
Michael Kors offers three primary collections: the Michael Kors Collection luxury line, the MICHAEL Michael Kors accessible luxury line and the Michael Kors Mens line. The Michael Kors Collection establishes the aesthetic authority of the entire brand and is carried in many of our Michael Kors retail stores, our Michael Kors e-commerce sites, as well as in the finest luxury department stores in the world, including Bergdorf Goodman, Saks Fifth Avenue, Neiman Marcus and Harrods, among others. In 2004, we saw an opportunity to capitalize on the brand strength of the Michael Kors collection and address the significant demand opportunity in accessible luxury goods, and we introduced MICHAEL Michael Kors, which has a strong focus on accessories, in addition to offering footwear and apparel. MICHAEL Michael Kors is carried in all of our Michael Kors lifestyle stores, as well as leading department stores throughout the world, including Bloomingdale’s, Macy’s, Harvey Nichols, Galeries Lafayette, Printemps, Lotte, Hyundai, Isetan and Lane Crawford, among others. More recently, we have begun to grow our Michael Kors men’s business in recognition of the significant opportunity afforded by our Michael Kors brand’s established fashion authority and the expanding men’s market. Taken together, our Michael Kors collections target a broad customer base while retaining our premium luxury image.

Since its inception in 1996, Jimmy Choo has offered a distinctive, glamorous and fashion-forward product range, enabling it to develop into a leading global luxury accessories brand, whose core product offering of women’s luxury shoes is complemented by accessories, including handbags, small leather goods, scarves and belts, as well as a growing men’s luxury shoes and accessory business. In addition, certain categories, such as fragrances, sunglasses and eyewear are produced under licensing agreements.
Industry 
We operate in the global luxury goods industry. The personal luxury goods market has recently experienced increased growth, driven by stronger local and tourist purchases, overcoming some of the challenges the industry has faced in the past several years. Accessories has continued to remain the biggest personal luxury goods category, with footwear, jewelry and handbags being the fastest growing product categories. While the wholesale channel has shown slower growth primarily driven by the underperformance of department stores, the retail channel has continued to experience increased growth, largely driven by the rapid growth of the e-commerce channel, as well as increased off-price and travel retail sales, which has continued to have a negative impact on monobrand retail store sales. As the overall environment has become increasingly omni-channel, increased customer engagement and tailoring merchandise to customer shopping and communication preferences have become the key ingredients to winning market share. We believe that our innovative product offerings and customer engagement initiatives make us well positioned to capitalize on the continued growth of the luxury accessories and footwear product categories, as they are among our primary product categories of focus, as well as to grow our sales in other product categories.
Geographic Information
We generate revenue globally through our four reporting segments, as described above. We sell our Michael Kors and Jimmy Choo products through retail and wholesale channels of distribution in three principal geographic markets: the Americas (U.S., Canada and Latin America), EMEA (Europe, Middle East and Africa) and Asia. We also have wholesale arrangements pursuant to which we sell products to our geographic licensees. In addition, we have licensing agreements through which we license to third parties the use of our Michael Kors and Jimmy Choo brand names and trademarks, certain production rights, and sales and/or distribution rights with respect to our brands.

Competitive Strengths
We believe that the following strengths differentiate us from our competitors:
Global Fashion Luxury Group Led by a World-Class Management Team and Renowned Designers. We are a global fashion luxury group of industry-leading fashion luxury brands led by a world-class management team and renowned designers. With the acquisition of Jimmy Choo on November 1, 2017, we brought together two iconic brands that are industry leaders in style and trend.
The Michael Kors brand was launched over 35 years ago by Mr. Michael Kors, a world-renowned designer, who personally leads our experienced design team for the Michael Kors brand. Mr. Kors and his team are responsible for conceptualizing and directing the design of all of our products, and their design leadership is a unique advantage that we possess. Mr. Kors has received a number of awards, which recognize the contribution Mr. Kors and his team have made to the fashion industry and our Company. We believe that the Michael Kors brand name has become synonymous with luxurious fashion that is timeless and elegant, expressed through sophisticated accessories and ready-to-wear collections. Each of our collections exemplifies the jet-set lifestyle and features high quality designs, materials and craftsmanship. Some of the most widely recognized global trendsetters—including celebrities such as Cate Blanchett, Viola Davis, Ashley Graham, Kate Hudson, Scarlett Johansson, Angelina Jolie, Nicole Kidman, Jennifer Lawrence, Blake Lively, Jennifer Lopez, Gwyneth Paltrow, Taylor Swift, and the Duchess of Cambridge wear our Michael Kors collections.
Jimmy Choo’s design team is led by Sandra Choi (niece of Mr. Jimmy Choo, O.B.E.), who has been the Creative Director for the Jimmy Choo brand since its inception in 1996. Jimmy Choo’s design team has a proven track record of developing Ms. Choi’s conceptual visions into sought-after luxury products each year through a structured process encompassing line plans, designs, prototypes, edits and pre-launch samples. Jimmy Choo products are unique, instinctively seductive and chic. The Jimmy Choo brand offers classic and timeless luxury products, as well as innovative products that are intended to set and lead fashion trends. Jimmy Choo’s products have a strong red carpet presence and are often worn by global celebrities, including Jessica Biel, Reese Witherspoon, Laura Dern, Michelle Pfeiffer, Mandy Moore, Emma Roberts, Sandra Bullock, Emily Blunt, Rachel Weisz, and Natalie Dormer.
Our design teams are supported by our senior management team with extensive experience across a broad range of disciplines in the retail industry, including design, sales, marketing, public relations, merchandising, real estate, supply chain and finance. With an average of 22 years of experience in the retail industry, including at a number of public companies, and an average of ten years with the Company, our senior management team has strong creative and operational experience and a successful track record.
Leveraging our Success in the Accessories Product Category. The strength of our Michael Kors luxury collection and our accessible luxury MICHAEL Michael Kors line, have allowed us to expand our brand awareness and position Michael Kors as one of the leading global luxury brands in the accessories product categories. Capitalizing on the success of our accessories product category, we are continuing to grow and diversify our Michael Kors brand through other product categories, such as men’s apparel and accessories, dresses and wearable technology. In addition, we believe that we can leverage this success to further develop and grow the accessories product line of the recently acquired Jimmy Choo business.
Proven Multi-Format Michael Kors Retail Business with Future Growth Opportunity. In Fiscal 2018, our MK Retail segment reported revenue of $2.712 billion, which represented a 5.4% increase from revenue of $2.572 billion in Fiscal 2017. Within our MK Retail segment we have four primary retail store formats: collection stores, lifestyle stores (including concessions), outlet stores and e-commerce sites. Our collection stores are located in some of the world’s most prestigious shopping areas, such as Madison Avenue in New York and Rodeo Drive in California, and are generally 2,900 square feet in size. Our lifestyle stores are located in some of the world’s most frequented metropolitan shopping locations and leading regional shopping centers, and are generally 2,800 square feet in size. We also extend our reach to additional consumer groups through our outlet stores, which are generally 4,100 square feet in size. We also have e-commerce sites in the U.S., Canada, certain parts of Europe, China, Japan and South Korea.
Strong Relationships with Premier Michael Kors Wholesale Customers. We partner with leading wholesale customers for the Michael Kors brand, such as Bergdorf Goodman, Saks Fifth Avenue, Neiman Marcus, Harrods, Bloomingdale’s and Macy’s in North America, as well as Harvey Nichols, Printemps, Selfridges and Galeries Lafayette in Europe. These relationships enable us to access large numbers of our key consumers in a targeted manner. Our Michael Kors “shop-in-shops” have specially trained staff, as well as customized fixtures, wall casings, decorative items, and flooring, and provide department store consumers with a more personalized shopping experience than traditional retail department store configurations. Michael Kors has also engaged with its wholesale customers on various initiatives and has continued to enter into innovative supply chain partnerships with its wholesale customers designed to increase the speed at which Michael Kors products reach the ultimate consumer. During Fiscal 
6

2018, we have continued to strategically decrease promotional activity, which resulted in a reduction in shipments of Michael Kors products within our wholesale channel. While we believe that this is necessary to appropriately position the Michael Kors brand long-term, revenue for our MK Wholesale segment decreased by 7.7% from $1.776 billion in Fiscal 2017 to $1.639 billion in Fiscal 2018.
Innovative Product Offerings from our Michael Kors Licensed Operations. The strength of our global Michael Kors brand has been instrumental in helping us build our licensing business. We collaborate with a select number of product licensees who produce and sell what we believe are products requiring specialized expertise that are enhanced by our Michael Kors brand strength, including Fossil Partners, LP. (“Fossil”) for watches and jewelry, The Estée Lauder Companies Inc. (“Estée Lauder”) for fragrances and beauty and Luxottica Group (“Luxottica”) for eyewear, among others. Total revenue for licensed products decreased slightly from $145.8 million in Fiscal 2017 to $144.9 million in Fiscal 2018, primarily due to lower geographic licensing revenue due to our acquisition of the previously licensed business in the Greater China region, and lower licensing revenues related to fashion watches, jewelry and fragrance sales, largely offset by higher licensing royalties related to Michael Kors ACCESS smartwatches and eyewear. We have continued to introduce new and innovative product offerings in collaboration with our licensees, including additional fragrance and smartwatch offerings. During Fiscal 2019, we plan to introduce a new fine jewelry product line in collaboration with Fossil.
Acquisition and Integration of Jimmy Choo, a Powerful Iconic Brand with Deep Roots in Fashion. For the period from acquisiton on November 1, 2017 through March 31, 2018, Jimmy Choo contributed incremental sales of $222.6 million. Jimmy Choo operated 182 stores as of March 31, 2018, with approximately 63% of stores represented by the brand’s new global retail store format, which has been progressively rolled out around the world during the past several years. Jimmy Choo’s retail stores average approximately 1,280 square feet, including 10 flagship locations averaging 2,600 square feet. In addition, Jimmy Choo operates e-commerce sites in the U.S., certain parts of Europe and Japan and is in the process of rolling out its omni-channel capabilities in the U.S. and Europe. In November 2017, Jimmy Choo assumed direct control of its operations in South Korea from its former geographic license partner upon expiration of the related license agreement. Jimmy Choo partners with luxury wholesale customers, including luxury department stores in the U.S. and specialty and multi-brand stores worldwide. Jimmy Choo’s wholesale customers include Nordstrom, Neiman Marcus, Bergdorf Goodman, Bloomingdales and Saks Fifth Avenue, where we have personalized space in a number of stores and specially trained personnel. In addition, Jimmy Choo generates wholesale revenue through sales of its products to its geographic licensing partners. Jimmy Choo’s growth potential is demonstrated through the success of its product licensed categories, where it has strong partnerships with Interparfums SA for fragrance and Safilo SpA for Sunglasses and Eyewear.

• | utilizing our proprietary platforms to drop ship orders to our wholesale customers;

In Fiscal 2018, we recognized approximately $167.1 million in advertising and marketing expenses globally. We engage in a wide range of integrated marketing programs, across various marketing channels including but not limited to email marketing, print advertising, outdoor advertising, digital marketing, social media, direct print mailings, public relations outreach, visual merchandising and partnership marketing, in an effort to engage our existing and potential customer base and ultimately stimulate sales in a consumer-preferred shopping venue.

Our growing e-commerce businesses provide us with an opportunity to increase the size of our customer database and to communicate with our consumers to increase online and physical store sales, as well as build brand awareness for Michael Kors and Jimmy Choo. We are continuously improving the functionalities and features on our e-commerce sites to create innovative ways to keep our brands at the forefront of consumers’ minds by offering a broad selection of products, including accessories, apparel, and footwear. Since e-commerce growth is critical to our overall growth strategy, we continued to expand our global e-commerce presence by launching new Michael Kors e-commerce sites in 14 additional countries in Europe and South Korea during Fiscal 2018, increasing our total e-commerce site presence to 25 Michael Kors e-commerce sites as of March 31, 2018. In addition, Jimmy Choo operates e-commerce sites in the U.S., certain parts of Europe and Japan as of March 31, 2018.
Manufacturing and Sourcing
We contract for the purchase of finished goods principally with independent third-party manufacturing contractors, whereby the manufacturing contractor is generally responsible for the entire manufacturing process, including the purchase of piece goods and trim.
We allocate product manufacturing for the Michael Kors brand among third-party agents based on their capabilities, the availability of production capacity, pricing and delivery. Michael Kors also has relationships with various agents who source our finished goods with numerous manufacturing contractors on our behalf. Although our relationships with our manufacturing contractors or agents are generally terminable at any time, we believe we have mutually satisfactory relationships with these third parties. This multi-supplier strategy provides specialist skills, scalability, flexibility and speed to market, as well as diversifies risk. In Fiscal 2018 and Fiscal 2017, one third-party agent sourced approximately 23.9% and 21.8% of our Michael Kors finished 
10

goods purchases, respectively, based on unit volume. In Fiscal 2018, Michael Kors’ largest manufacturing contractor, who primarily produces its products in China and who Michael Kors has worked with for over 10 years, accounted for the production of 19.9% of its finished products, based on unit volume. In Fiscal 2018, by dollar volume, approximately 94.7% of our Michael Kors products were produced in Asia and Europe. See “Import Restrictions and Other Government Regulations” and Item 1A. —“Risk Factors” — “We primarily use foreign manufacturing contractors and independent third-party agents to source our finished goods, which poses legal, regulatory, political and economic risks to our business operations.”
Manufacturing contractors and agents for our Michael Kors brand operate under the close supervision of our Michael Kors global manufacturing divisions and buying agents headquartered in North America, Europe and Asia. All products are produced according to our specifications. Production staff monitors manufacturing at supplier facilities in order to correct problems prior to shipment of the final product. Quality assurance is focused on as early as possible in the production process, allowing merchandise to be received at the distribution facilities and shipped to customers with minimal interruption.
Jimmy Choo products are also manufactured by third-party manufacturing contractors. Approximately 92% of Jimmy Choo products are produced by specialists in the Florence and Veneto regions of Italy and the remaining 8% are produced in Spain. For the period covering November 1, 2017 through March 31, 2018, one manufacturer accounted for approximately 16.0% of Jimmy Choo’s finished goods purchases, based on unit volume. Jimmy Choo has a product development facility in Florence and enjoys longstanding and close partnerships with its supplier base. Jimmy Choo has a 33% ownership interest in one factory, which is dedicated to Jimmy Choo production. Jimmy Choo typically only purchases finished goods and does not purchase raw materials, except for development purposes.
Distribution
Our primary Michael Kors distribution facility in the U.S. is the 1,284,420 square foot leased facility in Whittier, California, which we operate directly and services our Michael Kors retail stores, Michael Kors e-commerce site, and our Michael Kors wholesale operations in the U.S. We also engage in omni-channel order fulfillment by filling online orders through our Michael Kors retail stores and through our click-and-collect service offerings. Our primary Michael Kors distribution facility in Europe is our Company-owned and operated 1,108,680 square foot distribution facility in Holland, which supports our European operations for the Michael Kors brand, including our European e-commerce sites. We also have a regional Michael Kors distribution center in Canada, which is leased, as well as regional Michael Kors distribution centers in China, Hong Kong, Japan, South Korea and Taiwan, which are operated by third-parties.
Jimmy Choo uses a shared central warehouse facility in Contone, Switzerland, which acts as a global hub for all Jimmy Choo operations. From there, products are shipped to regional warehouses in the United Kingdom, U.S., China, Hong Kong, South Korea, Japan and United Arab Emirates, largely supporting the Jimmy Choo retail and e-commerce businesses. Shipments to wholesale customers globally are made from Switzerland and the U.S., with some further local fulfillment. All of the distribution facilities utilized by Jimmy Choo are operated by third parties and are shared with other businesses. This flexible method reinforces the speed and efficiency of the supply chain and allows the business to deliver Jimmy Choo product and collections to market rapidly and in line with the industry’s fashion calendar.

We own the Michael Kors, MICHAEL Michael Kors and Jimmy Choo trademarks, as well as other material trademark rights related to the production, marketing and distribution of our products, both in the United States and in other countries in which our products are principally sold. We also have trademark applications pending for a variety of related marks and logos. We expect that our material trademarks will remain in full force and effect for as long as we continue to use and renew them. 
Pursuant to an agreement entered into by Mr. Kors in connection with the acquisition by our former principal shareholder of a majority interest in the Company in 2003, Mr. Kors (i) represented that all intellectual property rights used in connection with the Company’s business at such time were owned exclusively by the Company, (ii) assigned to the Company (to the extent not already assigned to and owned by the Company) exclusive worldwide rights in perpetuity to the “Michael Kors” name and trademark and all derivations thereof, as well as to Mr. Kors’ signature and likeness, and all goodwill associated therewith, (iii) agreed not to take any action against the Company inconsistent with such ownership by the Company (including, without limitation, by asserting any privacy, publicity or moral rights) and (iv) agreed not to use, whether or not he is employed by the Company, any of such intellectual property in connection with any commercial enterprise (provided that he may use the name Michael Kors as his legal name only, and not as service mark or trade name, to identify himself personally and to engage in charitable activities and other activities that do not compete with any businesses of the Company). Similarly, in 2001, Mr. Jimmy Choo O.B.E. assigned all right, title and interest in and to the Jimmy Choo name and related copyrights and design rights (and related registrations and applications) to Jimmy Choo. Mr. Jimmy Choo O.B.E. has no involvement in the Jimmy Choo business.

We aggressively police our trademarks and pursue infringers both domestically and internationally. We also pursue counterfeiters in the United States, Europe, the Middle East, the Far East and elsewhere in the world in both online and offline channels through leads generated internally, as well as through our network of customs authorities, law enforcement, legal representatives and brand specialists around the world.
Employees
At the end of Fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016, we had approximately 14,846, 13,702 and 12,689 total employees, respectively. As of March 31, 2018, we had approximately 8,166 full-time employees and approximately 6,680 part-time employees. Approximately 12,197 of our employees were engaged in retail selling and administrative positions and our remaining employees were engaged in other aspects of our business as of March 31, 2018. None of the employees involved with the Michael Kors brand are currently covered by collective bargaining agreements. Jimmy Choo has collective bargaining agreements that cover its employees in France, Italy and Spain. We consider our relations with both our union and non-union employees to be good.
Competition
We face intense competition in the product lines and markets in which we operate from both, existing and new competitors. Our products compete with other branded products within their product category. In varying degrees, depending on the product category involved, we compete on the basis of style, price, customer service, quality, brand prestige and recognition, among other bases. In our wholesale business, we compete with numerous manufacturers, importers and distributors of accessories, footwear and apparel for the limited space available for product display. Moreover, the general availability of manufacturing contractors allows new entrants easy access to the markets in which we compete, which may increase the number of our competitors and adversely affect our competitive position and our business. We believe, however, that we have significant competitive advantages because of the recognition of our brands and the acceptance of our brands by consumers. See Item 1A. “Risk Factors” — “The markets in which we operate are highly competitive, both within North America and internationally, and increased competition based on a number of factors could cause our profitability to decline.”
Seasonality
We experience certain effects of seasonality with respect to our business. Our MK Retail segment generally experiences greater sales during our third fiscal quarter as a result of holiday season sales. Our MK Wholesale segment generally experiences the lowest sales during our first fiscal quarter. Our Jimmy Choo segment generally experiences greater sales during our third fiscal quarter, primarily driven by the product launch calendar and holiday season sales. In the aggregate, our first fiscal quarter typically experiences less sales volume relative to the other three quarters and our third fiscal quarter generally has higher sales volume relative to the other three quarters.
Import Restrictions and Other Governmental Regulations
Virtually all of our Michael Kors merchandise imported into the U.S., Canada, Europe and Asia is subject to duties. For Jimmy Choo, duties are paid on importation to certain countries, including the U.S., China, Japan and South Korea. No duties are payable in the European Union (the “EU”), as all Jimmy Choo product is manufactured therein.
Most of the countries to which we ship could impose safeguard quotas to protect their local industries from import surges that threaten to create market disruption. The U.S. and other countries may also unilaterally impose additional duties in response to a particular product being imported at unfairly traded prices that, in such increased quantities, cause or threaten injury to the relevant domestic industry (generally known as “anti-dumping” actions). If dumping is suspected in the U.S., the U.S. government may self-initiate a dumping case on behalf of a particular industry. Furthermore, additional duties, generally known as countervailing duties, can also be imposed by the United States government to offset subsidies provided by a foreign government to foreign manufacturers if the importation of such subsidized merchandise injures or threatens to injure a United States industry. We are also subject to other international trade agreements and regulations, such as the North American Free Trade Agreement (“NAFTA”). See Item 1A. “Risk Factors” — “We primarily use foreign manufacturing contractors and independent third-party agents to source our finished goods, which poses legal, regulatory, political and economic risks to our business operations.”
Accessories, footwear and apparel sold by us are also subject to regulation in the U.S. and other countries by governmental agencies, including, in the U.S., the Federal Trade Commission and the Consumer Products Safety Commission. These regulations relate principally to product labeling, licensing requirements, flammability testing and product safety. We are also subject to environmental laws, rules and regulations. Similarly, accessories, footwear and apparel sold by us are also subject to import regulations in the U.S. and other countries concerning the use of wildlife products for commercial and non-commercial trade, including the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (“F&W”). We do not estimate any significant capital expenditures for environmental

control matters in the near future. Our licensed products and licensing partners are also subject to regulation. Our agreements require our licensing partners to operate in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations, and we are not aware of any violations that could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on our business or operating results.
We are also required to comply with the disclosure requirements under the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, relating to the use of conflict minerals in our products. As a result, we have incurred, and expect to continue to incur, additional costs to comply with this rule.
Although we have not suffered any material restriction from doing business in desirable markets in the past, we cannot assure that significant impediments will not arise in the future as we expand product offerings and introduce additional trademarks to new markets.
