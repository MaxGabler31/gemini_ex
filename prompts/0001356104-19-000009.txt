Industry Background
High-Performance Interconnect Market Overview and Trends
Computing and storage systems such as servers, supercomputers and storage arrays in today's data centers face a critical challenge of handling exponentially expanding volumes of transactions and data while delivering improved application performance, high scalability and reliability within economic and power constraints. High-performance interconnect solutions remove bottlenecks in communications between compute and storage resources through fast transfer of data, latency reduction, improved application processing by central processing unit ("CPU") utilization and efficient sharing of resources. The result is higher efficiency and better resource utilization, thereby delivering higher application performance with lower capital expenditures and operating expenses. Leading companies in HPC, cloud, Web 2.0, Big Data, machine learning, storage, telecommunications, financial services, and EDCs utilize these technologies to develop distributed applications and services which are able to scale to serve millions of end customers. 
Demand for computing power and data storage capacity continue to rise, fueled by the increasing reliance by enterprises on information technology ("IT") for everyday operations. Due to greater amounts of information to be processed, stored and retrieved, data centers rely on high-performance computing and high-capacity storage systems to optimize price/performance, minimize total cost of ownership, utilize power efficiently and simplify management. We believe that several IT trends impact the demand for interconnect solutions and the performance required from these solutions. These trends include:

• | Transition to clustered computing and storage using connections among multiple standard components;


• | Transition to multiple and multi-core processors in servers;


• | Use of solid state Flash memory drives for data storage;


• | Increasing deployments of software defined scale out storage;


• | EDC infrastructure consolidation;


• | Increasing deployments of mission critical, latency, or response time sensitive applications;


• | Increasing deployments of converged and hyperconverged infrastructure;


• | Increasing deployment of virtualized computing and virtualized networking resources to improve server utilization;


• | Requirements by cloud providers to perform system provisioning, workload migrations and support multiple users' requests faster and more efficiently;


• | Requirements by Web 2.0 data centers to increase their hardware utilization and to instantly scale up to large capacities;


• | Big Data Analytics requirements for faster data access and processing to analyze increasingly large datasets and to provide real-time analysis; and


• | Increasing deployment of artificial intelligence and machine learning applications that utilize massive amounts of data and compute resources and often require generating real-time results.

A number of semiconductor-based interconnect solutions have been developed to address different application requirements. These solutions include proprietary technologies as well as standard technologies, including Fibre Channel, Ethernet and InfiniBand, which was specifically created for high-performance computing, storage and embedded applications.
Challenges Addressed by High-Performance Interconnect
The trends described above indicate that high-performance interconnect solutions will play an increasingly important role in IT infrastructures and will drive strong growth in unit demand. Performance requirements for interconnect solutions, however, continue to evolve and lead to high demand for solutions that are capable of resolving the following challenges to facilitate broad adoption:

• | Performance limitations. In clustered computing, cloud computing and storage environments, high bandwidth and low latency are key requirements to capture the full performance capabilities of a cluster. With the usage of multiple multi-core processors in server, storage and embedded systems, I/O bandwidth has not been able to keep pace with processor advances, creating performance bottlenecks. Fast data access has become a critical requirement to take advantage of the increased compute power of microprocessors. In addition, interconnect latency has become a limiting factor in a cluster's overall performance.

• | Increasing complexity. The increasing usage of clustered servers and storage systems as a critical IT tool has led to an increase in complexity of interconnect configurations. The number of configurations and connections has also proliferated in EDC, making systems increasingly complicated to manage and expensive to operate. Additionally, managing multiple software applications utilizing disparate interconnect infrastructures has become increasingly complex.


• | Interconnect inefficiency. The deployment of clustered computing and storage has created additional interconnect implementation challenges. As additional computing and storage systems, or nodes, are added to a cluster, the interconnect must be able to scale in order to provide the expected increase in cluster performance. Additionally, increased attention on data center energy efficiency is causing IT managers to look for ways to adopt more energy-efficient implementations.


• | Limited reliability and stability of connections. Most interconnect solutions are not designed to provide reliable connections when utilized in a large clustered environment, causing data transmission interruption. As more applications in EDCs share the same interconnect, advanced traffic management and application partitioning become necessary to maintain stability and reduce system down time. Such capabilities are not offered by most interconnect solutions.


• | Poor price/performance economics. In order to provide the required system bandwidth and efficiency, most high-performance interconnects are implemented with complex, multi-chip semiconductor solutions. These implementations have traditionally been extremely expensive.

In addition to Ethernet and InfiniBand, proprietary and other standards-based interconnect solutions, including Fibre Channel, are currently used in EDC, HPC and embedded markets. Performance and usage requirements, however, continue to evolve and are now challenging the capabilities of these interconnect solutions.

• | Proprietary interconnect solutions have been designed for use in supercomputer applications by supporting low latency and increased reliability. These solutions are only supported by a single vendor for product and software support, and there is no standard organization maintaining and facilitating improvements and changes to the technology. The number of supercomputers that use proprietary interconnect solutions has been declining largely due to the required use of proprietary software solutions, a lack of compatible storage systems and the availability of industry standards-based interconnects that offer superior price/performance.


• | Fibre Channel is an industry standard interconnect solution limited to storage applications. The majority of Fibre Channel deployments support 2, 4, 8 and 16Gb/s. Fibre Channel lacks a standard software interface, does not provide server cluster capabilities and remains more expensive relative to other standards-based interconnects. There have been industry efforts to support the Fibre Channel data transmission protocol over interconnect technologies including Ethernet (Fibre Channel over Ethernet) and InfiniBand (Fibre Channel over InfiniBand). The Fibre Channel market is declining as legacy storage area network moves to more modern Web 2.0 and cloud architectures based on converged, software defined, and scale out storage.


• | Ethernet is an industry-standard interconnect solution that was initially designed to enable basic connectivity between a local area network of computers or over a wide area network, where latency, connection reliability and performance limitations due to communication processing are non-critical. While Ethernet has a broad installed base at 1/10Gb/s and lower data rates, its overall efficiency, scalability and reliability have been less optimal than other interconnect solutions in high-performance computing, storage and communication applications. An increase to 25/40/50/100Gb/s bandwidth, a significant reduction in application latency and more efficient software solutions have improved Ethernet's capabilities to address specific high-performance applications that do not demand the highest performance or scalability.

In the HPC, cloud, Web 2.0 and storage markets the predominant interconnects today are Ethernet and InfiniBand. In the EDC and embedded markets, the predominant interconnects today are Ethernet, Fibre Channel and InfiniBand. Based on our knowledge of the industry, we believe there is significant demand for interconnect products that provide high bandwidth and better overall performance in these markets.
Advantages of InfiniBand
We believe that InfiniBand-based solutions have advantages compared to solutions based on alternative interconnect architectures. InfiniBand addresses the significant challenges within IT infrastructures by providing solutions for more demanding requirements of the high-performance interconnect market. More specifically, we believe that InfiniBand has the following advantages:
6


• | Superior performance. Compared to other interconnect technologies that were architected to have a heavy reliance on communication processing, InfiniBand was designed for implementation in an IC that relieves the CPU of communication processing functions. InfiniBand is able to provide superior bandwidth and latency relative to other existing interconnect technologies and has maintained this advantage with each successive generation of products. For example, our current InfiniBand adapters and switches provide bandwidth up to 100Gb/s, with end-to-end latency lower than a microsecond. In addition, InfiniBand fully leverages the I/O capabilities of PCI Express, a high-speed system bus interface standard.

The following table provides a bandwidth comparison of the various high-performance interconnect solutions:

 | Proprietary | FibreChannel | Ethernet | InfiniBand 
Supported bandwidth of available solutions | 2Gb/s - 100Gb/s | 2Gb/s - 32Gb/s | 1Gb/s - 100Gb/s | 10Gb/s - 200Gb/s

Performance in terms of latency varies depending on system configurations and applications. Typical benchmark testing reports show latency of InfiniBand solutions is less than half that of Ethernet solutions. Fibre Channel, which is used only as a storage interconnect, is typically not benchmarked on latency performance. HPC typically demands low latency interconnect solutions. In addition, there are increasing numbers of latency-sensitive applications in the cloud, Web 2.0, storage, machine learning and embedded markets, and, therefore, there is a trend towards using industry-standard Ethernet and InfiniBand solutions of 10Gb/s and faster, which are able to deliver lower latency than 1Gb/s Ethernet. 

• | Reduced complexity. While other interconnects require use of separate cables to connect servers, storage and communications infrastructure equipment, InfiniBand allows for the consolidation of multiple I/Os on a single cable or backplane interconnect, which is critical for blade servers and embedded systems. InfiniBand also consolidates the transmission of clustering, communications, storage and management data types over a single connection.


• | Highest interconnect efficiency. InfiniBand was developed to provide efficient scalability of multiple systems. InfiniBand provides communication processing functions in hardware, relieving the CPU of this task, and enables the full resource utilization of each node added to the cluster.


• | Reliable and stable connections. InfiniBand is one of the only industry standard high-performance interconnect solutions which provides reliable end-to-end data connections within the silicon hardware. In addition, InfiniBand facilitates the deployment of virtualization solutions, which allow multiple applications to run on the same interconnect with dedicated application partitions. As a result, multiple applications run concurrently over stable connections, thereby minimizing down time.


• | Superior price/performance economics. In addition to providing superior performance and capabilities, standards-based InfiniBand solutions are generally available at a lower cost than other high-performance interconnects.

Technology
We have technological core competencies in the design of high-performance interconnect ICs that enable us to provide a high level of integration, efficiency, flexibility and performance for our adapter and switch ICs. Our products integrate multiple complex components onto a single IC, including high-performance mixed-signal design, specialized communication processing functions and advanced interfaces.
High-performance mixed-signal design
One of the key technology differentiators of our ICs is our mixed-signal data transmission SerDes technology. SerDes I/O directly drives the interconnect interface, which provides signaling and transmission of data over copper cables or fiber optic interfaces for longer distance connections. Additionally, we are able to integrate several of these high-performance SerDes onto 
10

a single, low-power IC, enabling us to provide the highest bandwidth, merchant switch ICs based on an industry-standard specification. We have developed a 25Gb/s SerDes I/O that is used in our ConnectX-4 adapter and Switch-IB and Spectrum switch silicon. Our 25Gb/s SerDes enables our ConnectX adapters to support 100Gb/s bandwidth (four 25Gb/s SerDes operating in parallel) in addition to providing a direct 10Gb/s connection to standard XFP and SFP+ fiber modules to provide long range Ethernet connectivity without the requirement of additional components, which saves power, cost and board space. We have extended our SerDes with PAM-4 technology to operate at 50G/s per lane in our ConnectX-6 adapters, Quantum-2 switches, and Spectrum-2 switches. This enables us to scale these platforms to 200 and 400 Gb/s links.
Specialized communication processing and switching functions
We specialize in high-performance, low-latency design architectures that incorporate significant memory and logic areas requiring proficient synthesis and verification. Our adapter ICs are specifically designed to perform communication processing, effectively offloading this very intensive task from server and storage processors in a cost-effective manner. Our switch ICs are specifically designed to switch cluster interconnect data transmissions from one port to another with high bandwidth and low latency, and we have developed a packet switching engine and non-blocking crossbar switch fabric to address this.
We have developed a custom embedded Reduced Instruction Set Computer processor called InfiniRISC® that specializes in offloading network processing from the host server or storage system and adds flexibility, product differentiation and customization. We integrate a different number of these processors in a device depending on the application and feature targets of the particular product. Integration of these processors also shortens development cycles as additional features can be added by providing new programming packages after the ICs are manufactured, and even after they are deployed in the field.
Advanced interfaces
In addition to Ethernet and InfiniBand interfaces, we also support other industry-standard, high-performance advanced interfaces, such as PCI Express, which also utilize our mixed-signal SerDes I/O technology. PCI Express is a high-speed, chip-to-chip interface which provides a high-performance interface between the adapter and processor in server and storage systems. PCI Express and our high-performance interconnect interfaces are complementary technologies that facilitate optimal bandwidth for data transmissions along the entire connection starting from a processor of one system in the cluster to another processor in a different system.
System hardware technology
In addition to silicon technology, we also provide system hardware technology that enables us to build high-density high-performance network adapters and switch systems. Our technology delivers end-to-end solutions that maximize data throughput through a given media at minimal hardware or power cost at very low Bit Error Rate.
Software technology
In addition to hardware products, we develop and provide software stacks to expose standard I/O interfaces to the consumer applications on the host and to network management applications within the network. We also provide advanced interfaces and capabilities to enable application acceleration, efficient resource management and utilization in data centers, factoring cost, power and performance into the efficiency equation.

In addition, our customer base includes leading embedded systems OEMs that integrate computing, storage and communication functions that use high-performance interconnect solutions contained in a chassis which has been optimized for a particular environment.
Our products have broad adoption with multiple end customers across HPC, Web 2.0, cloud, EDC, financial services and storage markets; however, these markets are mainly served by leading server, storage, communications infrastructure and embedded system OEMs and ODMs. Therefore, we have derived a substantial portion of our revenues from a relatively small number of OEM and ODM customers. In the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, sales to Dell Technologies ("Dell") accounted for 12% and 11%, respectively, of our total revenues. In the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 sales to Hewlett Packard Enterprise ("HPE") accounted for 12%, 13% and 16%, respectively, of our total revenues. 
Backlog
Our sales are primarily made through standard purchase orders for delivery of products. Our manufacturing production is based on estimates and advance non-binding commitments from customers as to future purchases. We follow industry practice 
11

that allows customers to cancel, change or defer orders with limited advance notice prior to shipment. Given this practice, we do not believe that backlog is a reliable indicator of future revenue levels.
Sales and Marketing
We sell our products worldwide through multiple channels, including our direct sales force, our network of domestic and international sales representatives and independent distributors. We have strategically located marketing and sales personnel in the United States, Europe, China, Japan, India, Singapore, Taiwan and Australia. Our sales directors focus their efforts on leading OEMs and target key decision makers. We are also in frequent communication with our customers' and partners' sales organizations to jointly promote our products and partner solutions into end-user markets. We have expanded our sales and business development teams to engage directly with end users promoting the benefits of our products which we believe creates additional demand for our customers' products that incorporate our products.
Our sales support organization is responsible for supporting our sales channels and managing the logistics from order entry to the delivery of products to our customers. In addition, our sales support organization is responsible for customer and revenue forecasts, customer agreements and program management for our large, multi-national customers.
To accelerate design and qualification of our products into our OEM customers' systems, and ultimately the deployment of our technology by our customers to end users, we have a field applications engineering ("FAE") team and a sales engineering team that provide direct technical assistance during the design-in process. In certain situations, our OEM customers will utilize our expertise to support their end-user customers jointly. Our technical support personnel have expertise in hardware and software, and have access to our development team to ensure proper technical expertise is provided to our OEM customers. Our FAE team provides OEM customers with design reviews of their systems in addition to technical training on the technology we have implemented in our products.
Our marketing team is responsible for creating and growing the brand of our company, product strategy and management, competitive analysis, marketing communications and raising the overall visibility of our company. The marketing team works closely with both the sales and research and development organizations to properly align development programs and product launches with market demands.
Our marketing team leads our efforts to promote our interconnect technology and our products to the entire industry by:

• | assuming leadership roles within IBTA, OFA and other industry trade organizations;


• | participating in tradeshows, press and analyst briefings, conference presentations and seminars for end-user education; and


• | building and maintaining active partnerships with industry leaders whose products are important in driving Ethernet and InfiniBand adoption, including vendors of processors, operating systems and software applications.

Research and Development
Our research and development team is composed of experienced semiconductor designers, software developers and system designers. Our semiconductor design team has extensive experience in all phases of complex, high-volume design, including product definition and architecture specification, hardware code development, mixed-signal and analog design and verification. Our software team has extensive experience in development, verification, interoperability testing and performance optimization of software for use in computing and storage applications. Our systems design team has extensive experience in all phases of high-volume adapter card, switch, and interconnect designs including product definition and architectural specification, product design, design verification and transfer to production. Our software is driven by an open-source approach which is fundamental for achieving high quality and performance.
We design our products with careful attention to quality, reliability, cost and performance requirements. We utilize a methodology called Customer Owned Tooling ("COT"), where we control and manage a significant portion of timing, layout design and verification in-house, before sending the semiconductor design to our third-party manufacturer. Although COT requires a significant up-front investment in tools and personnel, it provides us with greater control over the quality and reliability of our IC products, better product cost and superior time to market as opposed to relying on third-party verification services.
We choose first-tier technology vendors for our design tools and continue to maintain long-term relationships with our vendors to ensure timely support and updates. We also select a mainstream silicon manufacturing process only after it has proven its production worthiness. We verify that actual silicon characterization and performance measurements strongly correlate to models that were used to simulate the device while in design, and that our products meet frequency, power and thermal targets with good margins. Furthermore, we insert Design-for-Test circuitry into our IC products which increases 
12

product quality, provides expanded debugging capabilities and ultimately enhances system-level testing and characterization capabilities once the device is integrated into our customers' products.
Frequent interaction between our silicon, software and systems design teams gives us a comprehensive view of the requirements necessary to deliver quality, high-performance products to our OEM customers. 
Manufacturing
We depend on third-party vendors to manufacture, package, assemble and production test our products as we do not own or operate facilities for semiconductor fabrication, packaging or production testing, or for board, cable or system assembly. By outsourcing manufacturing, we are able to avoid the high cost associated with owning and operating our own facilities while managing flexible capacity. This allows us to focus our efforts on the design and marketing of our products.
We own our test infrastructure in ICs, boards and cables. To keep high utilization and flexibility, most of our equipment is common between product families. For fiber cables, we also own some of the machines in the production line. 
Manufacturing and Testing. We use Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company ("TSMC") for our CMOS process ICs and STMicroelectronics for our BiCMOS process ICs. We use Advanced Semiconductor Engineering ("ASE") and Amkor Technology Korea Inc. (“Amkor”) to assemble, package and production test our IC products. We use Flextronics International Ltd. ("Flextronics") and Universal Scientific Industrial Co., Ltd. ("USI") to manufacture our standard and custom adapter card products and switch systems. In addition, we also use Comtel Electronics to manufacture some of our switch systems. We use several sub-contractors to manufacture our cables. We maintain close relationships with our suppliers, which improves the efficiency of our supply chain. We focus on mainstream processes, materials, packaging and testing platforms, and have a continuous technology assessment program in place to choose the appropriate technologies to use for future products. We provide all of our suppliers a 6-month rolling forecast, and generally receive their confirmation that they are able to accommodate our needs on a monthly basis. We have access to online production reports that provide up-to-date status information of our products as they flow through the manufacturing process. On a quarterly basis, we generally review lead-time, yield enhancements and pricing with all of our suppliers to obtain the optimal cost for our products.
Quality Assurance. We maintain an ongoing review of product manufacturing and testing processes. Our IC products are subjected to extensive testing to assess whether their performance exceeds the design specifications. We own Teradyne IC in-house testers providing immediate test data and the ability to generate characterization reports that are made available to our customers. Our adapter cards, switch system and cable products are subject to similar levels of testing and characterization, and are additionally tested for regulatory agency certifications such as Safety and EMC (radiation test) which are made available to our customers. We only use components on these products that are qualified to be on our approved vendor list.
Employees
As of December 31, 2018, we had 2,330 full-time employees and 116 part-time employees, including 1,608 full-time employees in research and development, 460 in sales and marketing, 275 in general and administrative and 103 in operations. 1,717 of our full-time employees and 109 of the part-time employees are located in Israel.
Certain provisions of the collective bargaining agreements between the Histadrut (General Federation of Labor in Israel) and the Coordination Bureau of Economic Organizations (including the Industrialists' Associations) are applicable to our employees in Israel by order of the Israeli Ministry of Economy and Industry, which extends such collective bargaining agreements to Israeli employers. These provisions primarily concern the length of the workweek, travel expended, and pension fund benefits for all employees. We generally provide our employees with benefits and working conditions above the required minimums.
We have never experienced any employment-related work stoppages and believe our relationship with our employees is good.
Intellectual Property
One of the key values and drivers for future growth of our high-performance interconnect IC, system hardware and software products is the IP we develop and use to improve them. We believe that the main value proposition of our high-performance interconnect products and success of our future growth will depend on our ability to protect our IP. We rely on a combination of trade secret, patent, trademark, design, copyright and other IP laws, both in the United States and internationally, as well as confidentiality, non-disclosure and inventions assignment agreements with our employees, customers, partners, suppliers and consultants to protect and otherwise seek to control access to, and distribution of, our proprietary information and processes. In addition, we have developed technical knowledge, which, although not patented, we consider to be significant in enabling us to compete. The proprietary nature of such knowledge, however, may be difficult to protect and we may be exposed to competitors who independently develop the same or similar technology or gain access to our knowledge.
13

The semiconductor industry is characterized by frequent claims of infringement and litigation regarding patent and other IP rights. We, like other companies in the semiconductor industry, believe it is important to aggressively protect and pursue our IP rights. Accordingly, to protect our rights, we may file suit against parties whom we believe are infringing or misappropriating our IP rights. In addition, we may engage in litigation with parties that claim that we infringed their patents or misappropriated or misused their trade secrets. Such litigations could result in substantial cost and may divert management's attention away from day-to-day operations. We may not prevail in these lawsuits. If any party infringes or misappropriates our IP rights, this infringement or misappropriation could materially adversely affect our business and competitive position.
As of December 31, 2018, we had 472 issued patents and six registered designs in the United States, five issued patents in Israel, and 83 issued patents and four registered designs in other countries. We had 214 patent applications pending in the United States, one patent application pending in Israel, and 63 patent applications pending in other countries, which cover aspects of the technology in our products. The term of any issued patent in the United States and Israel is 20 years from its priority date and if our applications are pending for a long time period, we may have a correspondingly shorter term for any patent that may be issued. In addition, the lives of acquired patents may also have a shorter term depending upon their acquisition date and the issue date of respective patent. Our present and future patents may provide only limited protection for our technology and may not be sufficient to provide competitive advantages to us. Furthermore, we cannot assure you that any patents will be issued to us as a result of our patent applications. 
The risks associated with patents and intellectual property are more fully discussed under the section entitled "Risk Factors" under Part I, Item 1A of this report.
Competition
The markets in which we compete are highly competitive and are characterized by rapid technological change, evolving industry standards and new demands on features and performance of interconnect solutions. We compete primarily on the basis of:

• | price/performance;


• | time to market;


• | features and capabilities;


• | wide availability of complementary software solutions;


• | reliability;


• | power consumption and latency;


• | customer and application support;


• | product roadmap;


• | intellectual property; and


• | reputation.

We believe that we compete favorably with respect to each of these criteria. Many of our current and potential competitors, however, have longer operating histories, significantly greater resources, greater economies of scale, stronger name recognition and a larger base of customers than we do. This may allow them to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies or changes in customer requirements. Many of our competitors also have significant influence in the semiconductor industry. They may be able to introduce new technologies or devote greater resources to the development, marketing and sales of their products than we can. Furthermore, in the event of a manufacturing capacity shortage, these competitors may be able to manufacture products when we are unable to do so.
We compete with other providers of semiconductor-based high-performance interconnect products based on InfiniBand, Ethernet, Fibre Channel and proprietary technologies. With respect to InfiniBand products, we compete with Intel Corporation's proprietary Omni-Path interconnect, Cray’s SlingShot interconnect, as well as high performance Ethernet interconnects offered by many competitors. The leading Fibre Channel vendors of adapters are Broadcom Limited ("Broadcom"), and Marvell Technology Group (“Marvell”). The leading Fibre Channel switch suppliers are Broadcom and Cisco Systems, Inc (“Cisco”). The leading vendors of Ethernet adapters include Intel Corporation (“Intel”), Broadcom, Cisco, Marvell, Chelsio, and SolarFlare. In the SmartNIC and programmable SOC and NIC market segment we compete with Intel, Broadcom, Xilinx, Netronome, and others. Our primary Ethernet switch silicon competitor is Broadcom, and Barefoot Networks and Innovium as private companies. The leading Ethernet switch system vendors include Cisco Systems, Inc., Juniper Networks, Inc. Arista Networks, Inc, and others. In the module and cable interconnect segment, we compete with Finisar, AOI, Innolight, Lumentum, 
14

and others. Across all of these market segments as well as in embedded markets, we often compete with interconnect technologies that are developed in-house by system vendors and hyperscale service providers that are tailored for their specific applications.
