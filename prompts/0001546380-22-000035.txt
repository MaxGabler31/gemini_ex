ITEM 1.    BUSINESS
Company Description and Development of the Business
The discussion below describes the business conducted by The Scotts Miracle-Gro Company, an Ohio corporation (“Scotts Miracle-Gro” and, together with its subsidiaries, the “Company,” “we” or “us”), including general developments in our business during fiscal 2022. Each reference in this Annual Report on Form 10-K (“Form 10-K”) to a “fiscal” year is to our fiscal year ended or ending, as applicable, on September 30 of the referenced year. For additional information on recent business developments, see “ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS” of this Form 10-K.
Through our U.S. Consumer and Other segments, we are the leading manufacturer and marketer of branded consumer lawn and garden products in North America. Our products are marketed under some of the most recognized brand names in the industry. Our key consumer lawn and garden brands include Scotts® and Turf Builder® lawn fertilizer and Scotts® grass seed products; Miracle-Gro® soil, plant food and gardening products; Ortho® herbicide and pesticide products; and Tomcat® rodent control and animal repellent products. We also have a presence in similar branded consumer products in China. We are the exclusive agent of the Monsanto Company, a subsidiary of Bayer AG (“Monsanto”), for the marketing and distribution of certain of Monsanto’s consumer Roundup®1 branded products within the United States and certain other specified countries. In addition, we have an equity interest in Bonnie Plants, LLC, a joint venture with Alabama Farmers Cooperative, Inc. (“AFC”), focused on planting, growing, developing, distributing, marketing, and selling live plants. 
Through our Hawthorne segment, we are a leading manufacturer, marketer and distributor of lighting, nutrients, growing media, growing environments and hardware products for indoor and hydroponic gardening in North America. Our key brands include General Hydroponics®, Gavita®, Botanicare®, Agrolux®, Can-Filters®, Gro Pro®, Mother Earth®, Hurricane®, Grower’s Edge®, HydroLogicTM and Cyco®.
Scotts Miracle-Gro traces its heritage to a company founded by O.M. Scott in Marysville, Ohio in 1868. In the mid-1900s, we became widely known for the development of quality lawn fertilizers and grass seeds that led to the creation of a new industry – consumer lawn care. In the 1990s, we significantly expanded our product offering with three leading brands in the U.S. home lawn and garden industry. In fiscal 1995, through a merger with Stern’s Miracle-Gro Products, Inc., which was founded by Horace Hagedorn and Otto Stern in Long Island, New York in 1951, we acquired the Miracle-Gro® brand, the industry leader in water-soluble garden plant foods. In fiscal 1999, we acquired the Ortho® brand in the United States and obtained exclusive rights to market Monsanto’s consumer Roundup® brand within the United States and other contractually specified countries, thereby adding industry-leading weed, pest and disease control products to our portfolio. Today, the Scotts®, Turf Builder®, Miracle-Gro®, Ortho® and Roundup® brands make us the most widely recognized company in the consumer lawn and garden industry in the United States. 
Business Segments
We divide our business into the following reportable segments:
•U.S. Consumer
•Hawthorne
•Other
U.S. Consumer consists of our consumer lawn and garden business in the United States. Hawthorne consists of our indoor and hydroponic gardening business. Other primarily consists of our consumer lawn and garden business outside the United States. This division of reportable segments is consistent with how the segments report to and are managed by our Chief Executive Officer (the chief operating decision maker of the Company). In addition, Corporate consists of general and administrative expenses and certain other income and expense items not allocated to the business segments. Financial information about these segments for each of the three fiscal years ended September 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020 is presented in “NOTE 21. SEGMENT INFORMATION” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10-K.

Marketing Agreement: We are Monsanto’s exclusive agent for the marketing and distribution of certain of Monsanto’s consumer Roundup® branded products in the United States and certain other specified countries. On May 15, 2015, we entered into an amendment (the “Marketing Agreement Amendment”) to the Amended and Restated Exclusive Agency and Marketing Agreement (as amended, the “Original Marketing Agreement”) with Monsanto and also entered into a lawn and garden brand extension agreement (the “Brand Extension Agreement”) and a commercialization and technology agreement (the “Commercialization and Technology Agreement”) with Monsanto. On August 31, 2017, in connection with the sale of our consumer lawn and garden businesses located in Australia, Austria, Belgium, Luxembourg, Czech Republic, France, Germany, Poland and the United Kingdom (the “International Business”), we entered into the Second Amended and Restated Agency and Marketing Agreement (the “Restated Marketing Agreement”) and the Amended and Restated Lawn and Garden Brand Extension Agreement – Americas (the “Restated Brand Extension Agreement”) to reflect the Company’s transfer and assignment to Exponent Private Equity LLP (“Exponent”) of the Company’s rights and responsibilities under the Original Marketing Agreement, as amended, and the Brand Extension Agreement relating to those countries and territories subject to the sale. 
Effective August 1, 2019, we entered into (i) the Third Amended and Restated Exclusive Agency and Marketing Agreement (the “Third Restated Agreement”) which amends and restates the Restated Marketing Agreement, (ii) a Brand Extension Agreement Asset Purchase Agreement (the “BEA Purchase Agreement”) under which we sold certain assets to Monsanto related to the development, manufacture, production, advertising, marketing, promotion, distribution, importation, exportation, offer for sale and sale of specified Roundup® branded products sold outside the non-selective weedkiller category within the residential lawn and garden market and (iii) agreements terminating both the Restated Brand Extension Agreement and the Commercialization and Technology Agreement.
Table of Contents

Under the terms of the Third Restated Agreement, we provide certain consumer and trade marketing program services, sales, merchandising, warehousing and other selling and marketing support for certain of Monsanto’s consumer Roundup® branded products. Among other things, the Third Restated Agreement amends the provisions of the Restated Marketing Agreement relating to commissions, contributions, noncompetition, and termination. The Company also performs other services on behalf of Monsanto, including manufacturing conversion services, pursuant to ancillary agreements. For additional details regarding the Third Restated Agreement, see “ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS — Risks Related to Our Business — In the event the Third Restated Agreement for Monsanto’s consumer Roundup® products terminates or Monsanto’s consumer Roundup® business materially declines, we would lose a substantial source of future earnings and overhead expense absorption” of this Form 10-K and “NOTE 7. MARKETING AGREEMENT” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10-K.
Acquisitions and Divestitures
On April 28, 2022, our Hawthorne segment completed the acquisition of substantially all of the assets of S.J. Enterprises PTY LTD, d.b.a. Cyco (“Cyco”), an Australia-based provider of premium nutrients, additives and growing media products for indoor growing sold mostly in the United States, for a purchase price of $37.3 million. 
On April 22, 2022, pursuant to our follow-on investment rights, we made an additional investment in Toronto-based RIV Capital Inc. (“RIV Capital”) (CSE: RIV) (OTC: CNPOF), a cannabis investment and acquisition firm listed on the Canadian Securities Exchange, in the form of a $25.0 million convertible note which matures on August 24, 2027. 
On December 30, 2021, our Hawthorne segment completed the acquisition of substantially all of the assets of Luxx Lighting, Inc., a provider of lighting products for indoor growing. The purchase price was $213.2 million, a portion of which was paid through the issuance of 0.1 million common shares of Scotts Miracle-Gro (“Common Shares”) with a fair value of $21.0 million based on the share price at the time of payment. 
On December 23, 2021, our Hawthorne segment completed the acquisition of substantially all of the assets of True Liberty Bags, a leading provider of liners and storage solutions to dry and cure plant products, for $10.1 million. 
Refer to “NOTE 8. ACQUISITIONS AND INVESTMENTS” of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10-K for more information regarding these acquisitions and investments.
Principal Markets and Methods of Distribution
We sell our products through our direct sales force, e-commerce website and our network of brokers and distributors primarily to home centers, mass merchandisers, warehouse clubs, large hardware chains, independent hardware stores, nurseries, garden centers, e-commerce platforms, food and drug stores, indoor gardening and hydroponic product distributors, retailers and growers. 
The majority of our shipments to customers are made via common carriers, our own private fleet or through distributors in the United States. We primarily utilize third parties to manage the key distribution centers for our consumer lawn and garden business, which are strategically located across the United States and Canada. For our Hawthorne business, we primarily self-manage distribution centers across the United States and Canada. Growing media products are generally shipped direct-to-store without passing through a distribution center. 
Raw Materials
We purchase raw materials for our products from various sources. We are subject to market risk as a result of the fluctuating prices of raw materials, including urea and other fertilizer inputs, resins, diesel, gasoline, natural gas, sphagnum peat, bark and grass seed. Our objectives surrounding the procurement of these materials are to ensure continuous supply, minimize costs and improve predictability. We seek to achieve these objectives through negotiation of contracts with favorable terms directly with vendors. When appropriate, we commit to purchase a certain percentage of our needs in advance of the lawn and garden season to secure pre-determined prices. We also hedge certain commodities, particularly diesel and urea, to improve cost predictability and control. Sufficient raw materials were available during fiscal 2022.
Trademarks, Patents, Trade Secrets and Licenses
We believe that our trademarks, patents, trade secrets and licenses provide us with significant competitive advantages. We pursue a vigorous trademark protection strategy consisting of registration, renewal and maintenance of key trademarks and proactive monitoring and enforcement activities to protect against infringement. The Scotts®, Miracle-Gro®, Ortho®, Tomcat®, Hyponex®, Earthgro®, General Hydroponics®, Gavita®, Botanicare®, Agrolux®, Mother Earth® and Can-Filters® brand names and logos, as well as a number of product trademarks, including Turf Builder®, EZ Seed®, Organic Choice®, Home Defense Max®, Nature Scapes®, and Weed B Gon Max® are registered in the United States and/or internationally and are considered material to our business. 
Table of Contents

In addition, we actively develop and maintain an extensive portfolio of utility and design patents covering a variety of subject matters and technologies relevant to the business such as fertilizer, weed killer, chemical and growing media compositions and processes; grass seed varieties; mechanical dispensing devices such as applicators, spreaders and sprayers; lighting applications; and hydroponic growing systems. Our utility patents provide protection generally extending to 20 years from the date of filing, and many of our patents will continue well into the next decade. We also hold exclusive and non-exclusive patent licenses and supply arrangements, permitting the use and sale of additional patented fertilizers, pesticides, electrical and mechanical devices. Although our portfolio of trade secrets, patents and patent licenses is important to our success, no single trade secret, patent or group of related patents, alone, is considered critical to the operation of any of our business segments or the business as a whole.
Seasonality and Backlog
Our North America consumer lawn and garden business is highly seasonal, with approximately 75% of our annual net sales occurring in our second and third fiscal quarters combined. Our annual sales for this business are further concentrated in our second and third fiscal quarters by retailers who rely on our ability to deliver products closer to when consumers buy our products, thereby reducing retailers’ pre-season inventories. We anticipate significant orders for our North America consumer lawn and garden business for the upcoming spring season will start to be received late in the winter and continue through the spring season. Historically, substantially all orders have been received and shipped within the same fiscal year with minimal carryover of open orders at the end of the fiscal year.
For our Hawthorne segment, sales are also impacted by seasonal patterns for certain product categories due to the timing of outdoor growing in North America during our second and third fiscal quarters, and the timing of certain controlled agricultural lighting project sales during our third and fourth fiscal quarters.
Significant Customers
Home Depot and Lowe’s are our two largest customers and are the only customers that individually represent more than 10% of reported consolidated net sales during any of the three most recent fiscal years. For additional details regarding significant customers, see “ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS — Risks Related to Our Business — Because of the concentration of our sales to a small number of retail customers, the loss of one or more of, or a significant reduction in orders from, our top customers, or a material reduction in the inventory of our products that they carry, could adversely affect our financial results” of this Form 10-K and “NOTE 21. SEGMENT INFORMATION” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10-K.
Competitive Marketplace
The markets in which we sell our products are highly competitive. We compete primarily on the basis of brand strength, product innovation, product quality, product performance, advertising, value, supply chain competency, field sales support, in-store sales support and the strength of our relationships with major retailers and distributors. 
In the lawn and garden, pest control and indoor gardening and hydroponic markets, our products compete against private-label as well as branded products. Primary competitors include Spectrum Brands Holdings, Inc., Central Garden & Pet Company, Enforcer Products, Inc., Kellogg Garden Products, Oldcastle Retail, Inc., Lebanon Seaboard Corporation, Reckitt Benckiser Group plc, FoxFarm Soil & Fertilizer Company, Nanolux Technology, Inc., Sun Gro Horticulture, Inc., Advanced Nutrients, Ltd. and Hydrofarm Holdings Group, Inc. In addition, we face competition from smaller regional competitors that operate in many of the areas where we compete.
In Canada, we face competition in the lawn and garden market from Premier Tech Ltd. and a variety of local companies including private label brands.
Research and Development
We continually invest in research and development, both in the laboratory and at the consumer level, to improve our products, manufacturing processes, packaging and delivery systems. Spending on research and development was $45.3 million, $45.4 million and $39.7 million in fiscal 2022, fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020, respectively, including product registration costs of $13.0 million, $12.3 million and $11.0 million, respectively. In addition to our own research and development activities, we actively seek ways to leverage the research and development activities of our suppliers and other business partners.
Regulatory Considerations
Laws and regulations in the United States and other countries affect the manufacture, sale, distribution, use and/or application of our products in several ways. For example, in the United States, all pesticide products must comply with the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (“FIFRA”), and most pesticide products require registration with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (the “U.S. EPA”) and similar state agencies before they can be sold or distributed. The use of certain pesticide products is also regulated by the U.S. EPA in addition to various local, state and federal environmental and/
Table of Contents

or public health agencies. These regulations may, for example, include requirements that only certified or professional users apply the product, that certain products be used only on certain types of locations (such as “not for use on sod farms or golf courses”), that users post notices on properties to which products have been or will be applied, or that may require notification to individuals in the vicinity that products will be applied in the future, or may ban the use of certain ingredients or categories of products altogether. Analogous regulatory regimes apply to certain pesticides that we sell or distribute in other countries.
Fertilizer and growing media products are also subject to various laws and regulations, some of which require registration, mandate labeling requirements, and/or govern the sale and distribution of the products. Our grass seed products are regulated in the U.S. by the Federal Seed Act and various state regulations. In addition, governmental agencies regulate the disposal, transport, handling and storage of waste, the remediation of contaminated sites, air and water discharges from our facilities, and workplace health and safety.
Governmental authorities generally require operating facilities to obtain permits (sometimes on an annual basis) relating to site-specific conditions and/or activities. For example, permits must be obtained in order to harvest peat and to discharge storm water run-off or water pumped from peat deposits. The permits typically specify the condition in which the property must be left after the peat is fully harvested, with the residual use typically being natural wetland habitats combined with open water areas. We are generally required by these permits to limit our harvesting and to restore the property consistent with the intended residual use. In some locations, these facilities have been required to create water retention ponds to control the sediment content of discharged water.
In addition, on October 18, 2021, the Biden Administration announced a multi-agency plan to address per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (“PFAS”) contamination nationwide. Agencies, including the U.S. EPA, the Department of Defense, the Food and Drug Administration, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the Department of Homeland Security, and the Department of Health and Human Services, will take actions to prevent the release of PFAS into the air, drinking systems, and food supply and to expand cleanup efforts to remediate the impacts of PFAS pollution. As part of this announcement, the U.S. EPA released its PFAS Strategic Roadmap: EPA’s Commitments to Action 2021-2024, which sets timelines by which the U.S. EPA plans to take specific actions during the first term of the Biden Administration. It is possible that some of these actions may have an impact – direct or indirect – on our business.
The growth and expansion of our business has expanded the regulatory oversight to which we are subject. If we enter new product categories and/or new jurisdictions, we may become subject to additional applicable legal and regulatory requirements. 
For more information regarding how compliance with local, state, federal and foreign laws and regulations may affect us, see “ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS — Risks Related to Regulation of Our Company — Compliance with environmental and other public health regulations or changes in such regulations or regulatory enforcement priorities could increase our costs of doing business or limit our ability to market all of our products” of this Form 10-K.
Regulatory Matters
We are subject to various environmental proceedings, the majority of which are for site remediation. At September 30, 2022, $2.4 million was accrued for such environmental matters. During fiscal 2022, fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020, we expensed $0.2 million, $0.5 million and $0.5 million, respectively, for such environmental matters. We had no material capital expenditures during the last three fiscal years related to environmental or regulatory matters.
Human Capital
We believe our culture and commitment to our associates provides unique value to us and our shareholders. Every associate, and every job, is important to our success and helping us achieve our purpose. We seek to create an environment that values the health, safety and wellness of our teams, and we work to equip them with the knowledge and skills to serve our business and develop in their careers.
This discussion includes information regarding human capital matters that we believe may be of interest to shareholders generally. We recognize that certain other stakeholders (such as customers, employees and non-governmental organizations), as well as certain of our shareholders, may be interested in more detailed information on these topics. We encourage you to review the “Supporting Our People” section of our 2022 Corporate Responsibility Report, located on our website at https://scottsmiraclegro.com/responsibility/environmental-social-and-governance, for more detailed information regarding our human capital programs and initiatives. The contents of our corporate website are not incorporated by reference in this Form 10-K or in any other report or document we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”).

Associates
As of September 30, 2022, we employed approximately 6,100 employees. During peak sales and production periods in fiscal 2022, our workforce totaled 8,620, which was comprised of approximately 7,660 employees including seasonal associates and approximately 960 in temporary labor. Included within these numbers, during fiscal 2022, we employed a total of approximately 2,430 full-time and seasonal in-store associates within the United States to help our retail partners merchandise our products in their lawn and garden departments directly to consumers. During fiscal 2022, we undertook a strategic reduction in our workforce as part of a series of organizational changes and initiatives intended to create operational and management-level efficiencies. 
Engagement
Our business is directly impacted by the level of engagement created through our associate experience. To advance engagement, we have taken a purposeful approach to focus on the employee experience. This year we focused on creating a positive workplace and strong leadership as our business has experienced a great deal of change. We prioritized change management and providing support to our associates through business transitions. We continue to gather the voices of our associates formally and informally throughout the year through, among other initiatives, executive town halls, pulse surveys and leadership skip level meetings. This feedback is shared and leveraged as human capital initiatives are defined. 
Diversity 
We value our associates’ diversity and encourage them to leverage their varied life experiences at our Company. This includes diversity in terms of gender, sexuality, race, thoughts, interests, languages, beliefs and more. We continue to hold ourselves accountable to fostering a positive workplace, one that creates a sense of belonging and community. This comes to life in the programs and support we provide our associates.
We received a score of 100% on the Human Rights Campaign Corporate Equality Index (HRC CEI) and the designation of being one of the “Best Places to Work for LGBTQ Equality” for calendar year 2021. The HRC CEI is a benchmarking survey and report measuring corporate policies and practices related to LGBTQ+ workplace equality. 
Our Employee Resource Groups (“ERGs”) are voluntary, associate-led groups usually formed by people with a common affinity such as gender, race, national origin, sexual orientation, military status or other attributes. Each ERG establishes a mission to positively impact the business by cultivating relationships through networking and developing talent through experiences, programs and mentoring. Our ERGs drive continuous improvement of our inclusive work environment and are open to all associates, regardless of the business department, location or management level. Our ERGs consist of the Scotts Women’s Network, the Scotts Black Employees Network, the Scotts Veterans Network, the Scotts Young Professionals, Scotts GroPride, Scotts Associates for a Greener Earth and Scotts Family TREE.
Professional Development
We view development and retention of our associates as valuable components of our business operations and to creating a culture of leadership throughout our Company. We partner with industry experts to ensure our professional development curriculum offers both live and on-demand learning content that accelerates the development of practical skills and competencies. Content is selected by associates and updated frequently to align to the development needs of our associates and address trending topics. All associates have the opportunity to learn new skills through exposure and involvement in business challenges. Our managers support associates as development happens on the job through cross-functional team assignments, expanded roles and rotational assignments. We provide a variety of best-in-class learning tools and experiences to our associates to help them embrace a growth mindset that leads to higher levels of achievement and personal satisfaction. Our ongoing development processes are designed to grow knowledge, improve skills and capabilities, and achieve competence in specific behaviors to meet performance expectations and prepare for potential future roles within our Company.
Compensation and Benefits
Our passion extends far beyond gardening and growing to include the well-being of our associates. We are a company that has been rooted in family since our founding in 1868, and one major way we continue to bring this to life is in our commitment to enhancing our associates and their family’s health, financial security, and support for everyday challenges through our LiveTotalHealth program – our holistic and comprehensive approach to wellness. Our commitment to LiveTotalHealth can be seen in the enhancements we made in 2022 and announced for 2023. Some of the highlights include a new partnership with Quantum Health – an innovative leader in health care navigation and care coordination, a new wellness reimbursement program to support our associates’ physical, mental and financial well-being, and a decrease to most associates’ medical plan premiums. We were able to provide pay increases for most of our associates in the first quarter of fiscal 2023, with an opportunity for another pay increase during fiscal 2023.

Health and Safety
We maintain several health and safety programs to protect our team members, including our comprehensive Environmental Health and Safety (“EHS”) management system. All associates and business partners, including contractors, are covered by our EHS management system. Across our operational sites and sales teams, our associates participate in safety committees to spur associate engagement with safety on a local and national level. To further mitigate health and safety risks, we develop compliance calendars that highlight dates for health and safety inspections and deadlines to meet voluntary and regulatory requirements. To evaluate our health and safety performance, we use an EHS scorecard composed of leading and lagging indicators, such as progress measurements for safety training, behavioral-based safety observations, near-miss reporting, total recordable incident rate and lost time accident rate.
Information Systems
We understand the critical nature of real-time, measurable data and insights from a human capital perspective. Our cloud-based human capital management solution unifies our wide range of human relations functionality onto one single platform. This structure enables us to support the entire enterprise with qualitative and quantitative analytics specific to associate transactions, processes and programs, and connection to other organizational data creating a culture where data and analytics are the norm. The organization has embraced this transformation and the scalable flexibility of the platform, and in doing so, has implemented other modules that integrate cohesively. 
Environmental, Social and Governance
All of our stakeholders are essential to our business – shareholders, customers, suppliers, associates, communities as well as the environment and society. We are working to make our workforce more inclusive, our business more sustainable, and our communities more engaged by maintaining strong environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) practices.
In fiscal 2022, we published our 11th Corporate Responsibility Report, prepared in accordance with the Global Reporting Initiative (“GRI”) Standards: Core option and with consideration for the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board’s (SASB’s) Chemicals industry standard. This report provides detailed information regarding our ESG strategy, focus areas and governance structure. The Company’s ESG focus areas are Product Stewardship and Safety, Operations and Supply Chain, Associate Engagement and Wellness, Community Engagement and Governance and Transparency. The Company continues to benchmark, set goals and seek continuous improvement around these focus areas.
We publish our Corporate Responsibility Report and several ESG-related policies and statements on the ESG section of our corporate website, which is located at https://scottsmiraclegro.com/responsibility/environmental-social-and-governance. These policies and statements address environmental, health and safety and human rights concerns. We also published a Supplier Code of Conduct in fiscal 2022 that establishes the minimum standards that suppliers must satisfy to sell goods or do business with the Company. Further ESG initiatives in fiscal 2022 included responding to the Carbon Disclosure Project’s climate questionnaire and completing the S&P Corporate Sustainability Assessment.
