General 
 
Bassett is a leading retailer, manufacturer and marketer of branded home furnishings. Our products are sold primarily through a network of Company-owned and licensee-owned branded stores under the Bassett Home Furnishings (“BHF”) name, with additional distribution through other wholesale channels including multi-line furniture stores, many of which feature Bassett galleries or design centers. We were founded in 1902 and incorporated under the laws of Virginia in 1930. Our rich 115-year history has instilled the principles of quality, value, and integrity in everything we do, while simultaneously providing us with the expertise to respond to ever-changing consumer tastes and meet the demands of a global economy.
With 90 BHF stores at November 25, 2017, we have leveraged our strong brand name in furniture into a network of Company-owned and licensed stores that focus on providing consumers with a friendly environment for buying furniture and accessories.  We created our store program in 1997 to provide a single source home furnishings retail store that provides a unique combination of stylish, quality furniture and accessories with a high level of customer service.  In order to reach markets that cannot be effectively served by our retail store network, we also distribute our products through other wholesale channels including multi-line furniture stores, many of which feature Bassett galleries or design centers. We use a network of over 25 independent sales representatives who have stated geographical territories. These sales representatives are compensated based on a standard commission rate. We believe this blended strategy provides us the greatest ability to effectively distribute our products throughout the United States and ultimately gain market share.  
 
The BHF stores feature custom order furniture, free in-home design visits (“home makeovers”), and coordinated decorating accessories.  Our philosophy is based on building strong long-term relationships with each customer.  Sales people are referred to as “Design Consultants” and are each trained to evaluate customer needs and provide comprehensive solutions for their home decor.  Until a rigorous training and design certification program is completed, Design Consultants are not authorized to perform in-home design services for our customers.  
 
For several years we owned 49% of Zenith Freight Lines, LLC (“Zenith”). During that time the strategic significance of our partnership with Zenith had risen to include the over-the-road transportation of furniture, the operation of regional freight terminals, warehouse and distribution facilities, and the management of various home delivery facilities that service Bassett Home Furnishings stores and other clients in local markets around the United States. On February 2, 2015, we acquired the remaining 51% of Zenith, which has since operated as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Bassett. Our acquisition of Zenith brought to our Company the ability to deliver best-of-class shipping and logistical support services that are uniquely tailored to the needs of the furniture industry, as well as the ability to provide the expedited delivery service which is increasingly demanded by our industry. Zenith now operates seven regional freight hubs and 14 home delivery centers in 13 states. We believe that our ownership of Zenith will not only enhance our own wholesale and retail distribution capabilities, but will provide additional growth opportunities as Zenith continues to expand its service to other customers.
 
In September of 2011, we announced the formation of a strategic partnership with HGTV (Home and Garden Television), a division of Scripps Networks, LLC, which combines our heritage in the furniture industry with the penetration of 91 million households in the United States that HGTV enjoys today.  As part of this alliance, the in-store design centers have been co-branded with HGTV to more forcefully market the concept of a “home makeover”, an important point of differentiation for our stores that also mirrors much of the programming content on the HGTV network. We believe the co-branded design centers coupled with the targeted national advertising on HGTV have played a key role in driving sales at our stores. In October of 2015, we announced the extension of our partnership with HGTV through 2019. In addition to featuring HGTV branded custom upholstery products in our HGTV HOME Design Studios in BHF stores, we have also expanded the concept to select independent dealers. We believe this will provide additional growth outside our BHF store network.

Operating Segments 
 
We have strategically aligned our business into three reportable segments: Wholesale, Retail – Company-owned stores, and Logistical Services. 
 
The wholesale home furnishings segment is involved principally in the design, manufacture, sourcing, sale and distribution of furniture products to a network of BHF stores (licensee-owned stores and Company-owned retail stores) and independent furniture retailers. Our retail segment consists of 60 Company-owned and operated stores. The following table shows the number of Company-owned stores by state as of November 25, 2017:

 | Number of | | | | Number of
--------------+-----------+---+-------+----------------+----------
State | Stores | | State | | Stores 
Alabama | | 1 | | Mississippi | | 1 
Arizona | | 1 | | Missouri | | 1 
Arkansas | | 1 | | New Jersey | | 1 
California | | 5 | | New York | | 5 
Connecticut | | 3 | | North Carolina | | 5 
Delaware | | 1 | | Ohio | | 1 
Florida | | 3 | | Pennsylvania | | 2 
Georgia | | 3 | | South Carolina | | 1 
Kansas | | 1 | | Tennessee | | 1 
Kentucky | | 1 | | Texas | | 11
Maryland | | 3 | | Virginia | | 5 
Massachusetts | | 3 | | Total | | 60

 
With our acquisition of Zenith on February 2, 2015, we created the logistical services operating segment which reflects the operations of Zenith. In addition to providing shipping, delivery and warehousing services for the Company, Zenith also provides similar services to other customers, primarily in the furniture industry.
 

Wholesale Segment Overview
 
The wholesale furniture industry is very competitive and there are a large number of manufacturers both within and outside the United States who compete in the market on the basis of product quality, price, style, delivery and service. Additionally, many retailers source imported product directly, thus bypassing domestic furniture manufacturers and wholesale importers. We believe that we can be successful in the current competitive environment because our products represent excellent value combining attractive prices, quality and styling, prompt delivery, and superior service. 
Wholesale shipments by category for the last three fiscal years are summarized below:
 

 | 2017 | | 2016 | | 2015
-----------+------+---------+------+-------+-----
Wood | $ | 86,667 | | 34.8 | % | $ | 88,763 | 36.9 | % | $ | 93,073 | 36.9 | %
Upholstery | | 158,894 | | 63.8 | % | | 149,027 | 62.0 | % | | 156,768 | 62.2 | %
Other | | 3,632 | | 1.5 | % | | 2,556 | 1.1 | % | | 2,339 | 0.9 | %
Total | $ | 249,193 | | 100.0 | % | $ | 240,346 | 100.0 | % | $ | 252,180 | 100.0 | %

Approximately 27% of our 2017 wholesale sales were of imported product compared to 31% and 37% in 2016 and 2015, respectively. We define imported product as fully finished product that is sourced. Our domestic product includes certain products that contain components which were also sourced. We continue to believe that a blended strategy including domestically produced products primarily of a custom-order nature combined with sourcing of major collections provides the best value and quality of products to our customers. The decline in imported goods share of our wholesale sales over the last three years has been driven primarily by increasing sales of our domestic custom wood and upholstery product offerings.

The dollar value of our wholesale backlog, representing orders received but not yet shipped to the BHF store network or independent dealers, was $22,239 at November 25, 2017 and $22,130 at November 26, 2016. We expect that the November 25, 2017 backlog will be filled within fiscal 2018, with the majority of the backlog being filled during the first quarter. 
 
We use lumber, fabric, leather, foam and other materials in the production of wood and upholstered furniture. These components are purchased from a variety of domestic and international suppliers and are widely available. The price and availability of foam, which is highly dependent on the cost of oil and available capacity of oil refineries, can be subject to significant volatility from time to time. We currently assemble and finish these components in our four plants in the United States.
 
Other Investments and Real Estate
 
Our balance sheet at November 25, 2017 and November 26, 2016 included short-term investments in certificates of deposit and certain retail real estate related to former licensee-owned stores. The impact upon earnings arising from these assets is included in other loss, net, in our consolidated statements of income. Our investment balances at each of the last three fiscal year-ends are as follows: 

 | November 27, | | November 26, | | | November 28,
---------------------------------------+--------------+--------+--------------+---+--------+-------------
 | 2017 | | 2016 | | | 2015 
Investments in certificates of deposit | $ | 23,125 | | $ | 23,125 | | $ | 23,125
Certain retail real estate | | 1,758 | | | 2,969 | | | 3,120 

 
Our short-term investments at November 25, 2017 consist of certificates of deposit (“CDs”) with original terms generally ranging from six to twelve months, bearing interest at rates ranging from 0.10% to 1.50% with a weighted average yield of approximately 1.18%. At November 25, 2017, the weighted average remaining time to maturity of the CDs was approximately five months. Each CD is placed with a federally insured financial institution and all deposits are within Federal deposit insurance limits.
 
We hold investments in retail store properties that we had previously leased to licensees. These holdings, which also include closed store real estate currently leased to non-licensees, are included in other long-term assets in our consolidated balance sheets. These real estate holdings are typically in urban, high-traffic retail locations. See Item 2, Properties, for additional information about our retail real estate holdings.
 

Retail Segment Overview – Company-Owned Retail Stores
 
The retail furniture industry remains very competitive and includes local furniture stores, regional furniture retailers, national department and chain stores and single-vendor branded retailers. As a whole, our store network with 60 Company-owned stores and 30 licensee-owned stores, ranks in the top 30 in retail furniture sales in the United States. We plan to continue opening new stores, primarily in underpenetrated markets where we currently have stores.  In this regard we are currently considering several locations for new store expansion over the next three years, with at least eight of these planned to open in fiscal 2018. 
Net sales for our Company-owned retail stores for the last three fiscal years are summarized below:
 

 | 2017 | | 2016 | | | 2015
----------+------+---------+------+---+---------+-----
Net sales | $ | 268,264 | | $ | 254,667 | | $ | 249,379

 
Maintaining and enhancing our brand is critical to our ability to expand our base of customers and drive increased traffic at both Company-owned and licensee-owned stores. Our advertising and marketing campaign utilizes local and national television, direct mail, catalogs, newspapers, magazines, radio and the internet in an effort to maintain and enhance our existing brand equity.
 
Our stores incorporate a stylish, residential feel while highlighting our unmatched custom manufacturing capabilities.  We leverage our customization capabilities by dedicating space in the stores to design solutions for dining, upholstery, home entertainment and storage.

Tractors | | 165 | | 92 | | 257
Trailers | | 239 | | 272 | | 511

We own a central warehousing and national distribution hub located in Conover, North Carolina, and we lease nineteen facilities in fourteen states across the continental United States from which we operate regional freight terminals and provide warehouse and distribution services.
 

Trademarks 
 
Our trademarks, including “Bassett” and the names of some of our marketing divisions, products and collections, are significant to the conduct of our business. This is important due to consumer recognition of the names and identification with our broad range of products. Certain of our trademarks are licensed to independent retailers for use in full store and store gallery presentations of our products. We also own copyrights that are important in the conduct of our business. 
Research and Development 
 
The furniture industry is considered to be a “fashion” industry subject to constant fluctuations to meet changing consumer preferences. As such, we are continuously involved in the development of new designs and products. Due to the nature of these efforts and the close relationship to the manufacturing operations, these costs are considered normal operating costs and are not segregated. We are not otherwise involved in “traditional” research and development activities nor do we sponsor the research and development activities of any of our customers. 
 
Government Regulations 
 
We believe that we have materially complied with all federal, state and local standards regarding safety, health and pollution and environmental controls. 
 
Our logistical services segment is also subject to regulation by several federal governmental agencies, including the Department of Transportation (“DOT”). Specifically the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration and the Surface Transportation Board, which are agencies within the DOT. We are also subject to rules and regulations of various state agencies. These regulatory authorities have broad powers, generally governing matters such as authority to engage in motor carrier operations, motor carrier registration, driver hours of service, safety and fitness of transportation equipment and drivers and other matters.

We may also be affected by laws and regulations of countries from which we source goods. Labor, environmental and other laws and regulations change over time, especially in the developing countries from which we source. Changes in these areas of regulation could negatively impact the cost and availability of sourced goods. The timing and extent to which these regulations could have an adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations is difficult to predict. Based on the present facts, we do not believe that they will have a material adverse effect on our financial position or future results of operations.
 
People 
 
We employed 2,618 people as of November 25, 2017, of which 853 were employed in our retail segment, 966 were employed in our wholesale segment and 799 were employed in our logistical services segment, which also utilized another 136 temporary workers provided through staffing agencies. None of our employees are subject to collective bargaining arrangements and we have not experienced any recent work stoppages. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good. 
Foreign and Domestic Operations and Export Sales 
 
We have no foreign manufacturing or retail operations. We define export sales as sales to any country or territory other than the United States or its territories or possessions. Our export sales were approximately $2,288, $3,607, and $4,516 in 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. At November 25, 2017 and November 26, 2016, we had $1,677 and $3,018, respectively of our finished goods inventory physically warehoused in Vietnam.
Major Customers
 
Our risk exposure related to our customers, consisting primarily of trade accounts receivable along with certain guarantees, net of recognized reserves, totaled approximately $22,357 and $20,223 at November 25, 2017 and November 26, 2016, respectively. At November 25, 2017, approximately 29% of the aggregate risk exposure, net of reserves, was attributable to five customers. At November 26, 2016, approximately 30% of the aggregate risk exposure, net of reserves, was attributable to four customers. In fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, no customer accounted for more than 10% of total consolidated net sales. However, one customer accounted for approximately 33%, 36% and 26% of our consolidated revenue from logistical services during 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
