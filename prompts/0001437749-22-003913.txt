Business Development
 
The Company is the successor to The Williams Manufacturing Company, founded in 1922, an Ohio-based manufacturer and retailer of women’s and children’s footwear, and to the Indian Archery and Toy Corp., founded in 1927, an Evansville, Indiana-based manufacturer of archery equipment, badminton sets, and darts. In the 1960’s, Indian Archery entered the table tennis manufacturing business and changed its name to Indian Industries, Inc. Williams Manufacturing and Indian Industries operated independently of each other until a series of transactions in the early 1970’s. In 1972, Williams Manufacturing acquired Martin-Yale Industries, Inc., an Illinois-based manufacturer of office and graphic arts products, and crafts and toys. In 1973, Williams Manufacturing acquired both Indian Industries and Harvard Table Tennis, Inc., a Massachusetts-based manufacturer of table tennis accessories. The resulting enterprise, renamed as Escalade, Incorporated, became a diversified manufacturer of sporting goods, recreational products, office products, graphic arts products, hobby and craft items, toys, and footwear.
 
In the following decades, Escalade continued to diversify its product lines through acquisitions and organic growth, including increasing its manufacturing capabilities for table tennis tables, pool tables, basketball backboards, goals, and poles, and related accessories. In order to focus on areas of potential growth, Escalade also has divested certain product lines and businesses over the years. Most notably, Escalade exited the footwear and toy businesses in the 1970’s and ultimately completed its exit from the office products and graphic arts businesses in 2014. Such divestitures have resulted in Escalade now focusing 100% on its Sporting Goods business segment. Escalade’s Sporting Goods segment competes in a variety of product categories including basketball goals, archery, billiards, indoor and outdoor games, recreational, fitness, and related products.
 
Core components of Escalade’s business development and growth strategy have been, and continue to be, investing in product innovation, developing strong brand names, and making strategic acquisitions. Escalade’s strategic acquisitions include, among others, its acquisitions of: the table tennis and pool table assets of the Ideal Toy Company in 1977 and of Harvard Sports, Inc. in 1980; the home exercise equipment business of Marcy Fitness Products, Inc. in 1989; the high quality basketball system assets of Zue Corporation, including the Goalrilla™ brand in 1999; the table tennis assets of Lifetime Products, Inc. in 2000; the darting assets of Accudart in 2001; the filled vinyl weight assets and manufacturing business of U.S. Weights, Inc. in 2001; the assets of North American Archery Group, including the Bear® Archery brand in 2003; the residential playground systems businesses of ChildLife, Inc. in 2005 and of Woodplay in 2006; and the archery assets of Carolina Archery Products in 2006, of Trophy Ridge, LLC in 2007, and of Cajun Archery in 2012. Escalade entered the pickleball product category through acquisitions of Pickleball Now and Onix Sports in 2014 and 2015, expanded its billiard accessory business with the acquisition of Cue&Case Sales, Inc. in 2014, and expanded its basketball distribution and domestic sourcing by acquiring Goalsetter Systems, Inc. in 2015. More recently, in 2016, Escalade acquired the assets of Triumph Sports USA, a leader in the indoor and outdoor games categories, in 2017 acquired the assets of Lifeline Fitness, Inc., a leader in the fitness industry, in 2018 acquired Victory Tailgate, a manufacturer of premium licensed and custom tailgating games, in 2020 acquired the billiard table, game room and recreational product lines of American Heritage Billiards, and in 2020 acquired the assets of RAVE Sports, providing entry into the water recreational products category. On December 30, 2021, Escalade entered into an asset purchase agreement to acquire the assets of the Brunswick Billiards® business from Life Fitness, LLC. Escalade completed this acquisition on January 21, 2022, complementing its existing portfolio of billiards brands and other offerings in the Company’s indoor recreation market.

Marketing and Product Development
 
The Company makes a substantial investment in product development and brand marketing to differentiate its product line from its competition. We conduct market research and development efforts to design products which satisfy existing and emerging consumer needs. The Company markets directly to the consumer or end-user as well as through its retail partners in the form of advertising and other promotional allowances.
Competition
 
Escalade is subject to competition with various manufacturers in each product line. The Company is not aware of any other single company that is engaged in the same product lines as Escalade or that produces the same range of products as Escalade. Nonetheless, competition exists for many Escalade products. Some competitors are larger and have substantially greater resources than the Company. Escalade believes that its long-term success depends on its ability to strengthen its relationship with existing customers, attract new customers, to be a reliable source of products to timely supply customers with their needs, and to develop new products that satisfy the quality and price requirements of sporting goods customers.
Licenses, Trademarks and Brand Names
 
The Company has an agreement and contract with STIGA Sports AB for the exclusive right and license to distribute and produce table tennis equipment under the brand name STIGA® for North America. The Company also owns several registered trademarks and brand names including but not limited to Goalrilla™, Goalsetter®, Bear Archery®, Ping-Pong®, The Step®, Lifeline® and Woodplay®.
Backlog and Seasonality
 
Sales are based primarily on standard purchase orders and in most cases, orders are shipped within the same month received. Unshipped orders at the end of the fiscal year (backlog) were not material and therefore are not an indicator of future results. Due to diversity in product categories, revenues have not been seasonal and are not expected to be so in the future.
Employees
 
The number of employees at December 25, 2021 and December 26, 2020 were as follows:
 

 | 2021 | | 2020
---------------+------+-----+-----
Sporting Goods | | | | 
USA | | 546 | | 523
Mexico | | 103 | | 160
Asia | | 27 | | 21 
Total | | 676 | | 704

 
Of Escalade’s 676 employees at December 25, 2021, 670 were full time employees and 6 were part time employees.
 
The I.U.E./C.W.A. (United Electrical Communication Workers of America, AFL-CIO) represents hourly rated employees at the Escalade Sports’ Evansville, Indiana distribution center. There were approximately 28 covered employees at December 25, 2021. A labor contract was negotiated and renewed in May 2021 and expires on January 31, 2025.

Sources of Supplies
 
Raw materials for Escalade's various product lines consist of, but are not limited to, wood, steel, aluminum, plastics, fiberglass and packaging. Escalade relies upon suppliers in various countries and upon various third party Asian manufacturers for many of its products. The Company believes that these sources will continue to provide adequate supplies as needed and that all other materials needed for the Company’s various operations are available in adequate quantities from a variety of domestic and foreign sources. From time to time, Escalade may experience disruptions in its supply chain due to circumstances beyond its control, such as the outbreak of the coronavirus or other public health crises and limited availability of shipping containers and other third party logistics, which disruptions could adversely impact Escalade currently and in the future. To alleviate these concerns, Escalade continues to accelerate its timing for placing orders with its suppliers and continues its efforts to develop other potential sources of products and raw materials. In recent years, Escalade has increased its sourcing of some products and raw materials from Brazil and Vietnam. Escalade’s acquisition of the Brunswick Billiards® business may open additional sourcing opportunities.
