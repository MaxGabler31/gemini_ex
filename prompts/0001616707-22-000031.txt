Item 1. Business 
Overview
Wayfair is one of the world's largest online destinations for the home. Its co-founders are lifetime tech innovators who have worked together in the commercial Internet sector since 1995. As engineers themselves, they have created a company culture deeply rooted in technology and data, and their significant equity ownership in Wayfair has informed their leadership and allowed them to take a long-term view when building the company. Unless the context indicates otherwise, "Wayfair," "the company," "we," "us," "our" and similar terms refer to Wayfair Inc. and its subsidiaries.
Through our e-commerce platform, we offer customers visually inspired browsing, compelling merchandising, easy product discovery and attractive prices for over thirty-three million products from over 23,000 suppliers. We are focused on bringing our customers an experience that is at the forefront of shopping for the home online. Wayfair customers span a wide range of demographics, with annual household income ranging from $25,000 to $250,000, and also include business professionals. Because each of our customers has a different taste, style, purchasing goal and budget when shopping for her home, we have built one of the largest online selections of furniture, décor, housewares and home improvement products. We are able to offer this vast selection of products because we hold minimal inventory. We specialize in the home category and this has enabled us to build a shopping experience and logistics infrastructure that is tailored to the unique characteristics of our market.
The delivery experience and overall customer service we offer our shoppers are central to our business. The majority of our products are shipped to customers directly from our suppliers with an increasing proportion flowing through our own logistics network. We have invested considerably in our logistics network and leverage these capabilities to improve the experience for both customers and suppliers. This network consists of CastleGate and the Wayfair Delivery Network (“WDN”). We also offer inbound services via CastleGate Forwarding (“CGF”). Our CastleGate facilities enable suppliers to forward-position their inventory in our warehouses, allowing us to offer faster delivery. Through WDN, we can directly manage large parcel deliveries via consolidation centers, cross docks and last mile delivery facilities, which, alongside CastleGate, enables us to speed up deliveries, decrease our reliance on third parties and undertake efforts to reduce damage. Our CGF services allow our suppliers to unlock efficiencies on inbound logistics, including through Asia-based product consolidation and port-to-door freight forwarding solutions. We believe these investments in logistics capabilities result in an enhanced experience for our customers and suppliers. In addition to logistics, we offer a range of supplemental media and merchandising services in support of a seamless selling experience for suppliers. We also believe providing superior customer service is key to delighting our customers. Our customer service locations are staffed with over 4,900 highly-trained sales and service employees located in the United States (“U.S.”) and Europe.
Segments 
Our operating and reportable segments are the U.S. and International, which includes our businesses in Canada, the United Kingdom and Germany. See Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements, Segment and Geographic Information, included in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Net revenue of the U.S. segment represented 82% of consolidated net revenue for the year ended December 31, 2021.
Our Industry
The home goods market is large and characterized by specific consumer trends, structural challenges and market dynamics that are shaping the future of our industry.
Addressable Market Size and Growth
We estimate today the annual U.S. market for home goods is approximately $460 billion, of which approximately 20% is sold online by our estimates. According to data released by the U.S. Census Bureau, there are approximately 98 million households in the U.S. with annual incomes between $25,000 and $250,000. Moreover, we believe there are nearly 200 million individuals between the ages of 20 and 64 in the U.S., many of whom are accustomed to purchasing goods online. As younger generations age, start new families and move into new homes, we expect online sales of home goods to increase. In addition, we believe the online home goods market will further grow as older generations of consumers become increasingly comfortable purchasing online. Including our presence in Canada and Western Europe, we believe our total addressable market is more than $800 billion.

Why Home is Different
Home is shopped differently than other retail verticals. Homes are personal expressions of self and identity, which is why many consumers seek uniqueness, crave originality and enjoy the feeling created by home design, furniture and décor. Consumers shopping for home goods often cannot articulate exactly what they are looking for and they rarely know the names of the manufacturer brands they like, as the category is largely unbranded. We believe search-based websites have difficulty serving customers shopping for home products in this more emotional, visual and inspirational manner.
When shopping for the home, consumers desire uniqueness, which requires vast selection. In the market for home goods, consumers with different tastes, styles, purchasing goals and budgets require a broad selection of products and choices. Traditional brick and mortar home goods retailers must balance scale of selection with the challenges of high inventory carrying costs and limited showroom and storage space - as a result, to browse a vast selection of products, consumers must shop multiple stores. Other e-commerce retailers that sell home goods typically focus their shopping experiences around keyword search, instead of a browse-oriented journey that encourages discovery. We believe the lack of an easy-to-browse, one-stop shopping experience with massive selection has led to dissatisfaction with home goods shopping both online and off. 
Logistics, fulfillment and customer service for home goods products are challenging given the variety of categories and price points and the mix of heavy and bulky items. Home goods often have a low dollar value to weight ratio compared to other categories of retail, therefore requiring a logistics network that is optimized for items with those characteristics. Many consumers also seek first-rate customer service so they are not burdened with managing delivery, shipping and return logistics on their own. However, we believe big box retailers that serve the mass market for home goods are often unable or unwilling to provide this level of service. 
Our Solution - Key Benefits for Our Customers
We offer broad selection and choice. We have one of the largest online selections of furniture, décor, housewares and home improvement products, with over thirty-three million products from over 23,000 suppliers. We have built a portfolio of over 120 house brands, which offer a curated brand experience, making it easier for customers to discover styles, products and price points that appeal to them.
Convenience and value are central to our offering. We are a one-stop shop for consumers in the home goods category, with competitive pricing reflecting the many supplier participants on our platform and a differentiated and robust merchandising experience. For items shipped from our CastleGate warehouses, we are able to deliver many products to a majority of the U.S. population in two days or less.
We give customers inspirational content and an engaging shopping journey. To inspire customers, we produce beautiful imagery and highly-tailored editorial content both in house and through third parties. We use personalization to create a more engaging consumer experience and we allow customers to create looks they love with tools such as our Room Ideas. More than half of the traffic coming to Wayfair.com is from mobile devices and our investment in mobile allows us to deliver value, convenience and inspiration to consumers anytime and anywhere. Our mobile app also offers customers a powerful way to shop for their home from their home using our "View in Room 3D" augmented reality tool. 
We support our customers' shopping journey from start to finish through everything from financing solutions to customer support. Our private label and co-branded credit cards build loyalty and encourage repeat shopping with cash back rewards. Superior customer service is a core part of the experience we offer shoppers. Our customer service organization has over 4,900 employees who help consumers navigate our sites, answer questions and complete orders, as well as specialists focused on specific product classes. This team helps us build trust with consumers, build our brand awareness, enhance our reputation and drive sales.
Our Solution - Key Benefits for Our Suppliers
We give suppliers cost-effective access to our large customer base. We sell products from over 23,000 suppliers, many of which are small, family-run operations without well-known product brands and without easy retail access to a large customer base. We provide our suppliers with access to our large customer base, with 27.3 million active customers over the last twelve months, enabling them to increase their sales and access the growing e-commerce market.
Suppliers can leverage our technological expertise to enhance their success on our platform. Our technology platform is designed to allow suppliers to easily provide us with their full product selection and to highlight selected products for customers on our sites. We offer our suppliers a view of our demand and inventory needs via powerful data and analytics. Suppliers are also able to enhance their media and merchandising by using additional services provided by Wayfair, including through sponsored

content and 3D image creation. We believe many of our suppliers have increased their sales through our technology platform, which has strengthened their loyalty to us. 
Our logistics infrastructure allows us to ship directly to our customers from our suppliers or from our CastleGate warehouses. This fulfillment network is a key component of our custom-built and seamlessly integrated technology and operational platform.
Sites and Brands 
Each of our customers has a different taste, style, purchasing goal and budget when shopping for her home. To help her find the right products for her home, we offer a family of sites, each with a unique brand identity that offers a tailored shopping experience and rich product selection to a different target audience.
Wayfair - Everything home — for a space that's all you. 
Joss & Main - The ultimate style edit for home.
AllModern - All of modern, made simple.
Birch Lane - A fresh take on the classics. 
Perigold - An undiscovered world of luxury design.
Wayfair represents a significant majority of our net revenue and is currently the only one of our sites that also operates internationally, operating as Wayfair.ca in Canada, Wayfair.co.uk in the United Kingdom and Wayfair.de in Germany.
On our sites, we also feature certain products under our house brands, such as Three Posts® and Mercury Row®. Through these house brands, which feature curated selections refined by style and price point, we help our customers navigate our vast product assortment to find items that uniquely match their needs. 
"Direct Retail" sales include net revenue from customers generated through the family of sites and stores described above.
Technology
We have custom-built our proprietary technology and operational platform to deliver the best experience for both our customers and suppliers. Our success has been built on a culture of data-driven decision-making, operational discipline and an unwavering focus on the customer. We believe that control of our technology systems, which gives us the ability to update them often, is a competitive advantage. 
Our team of over 3,000 engineers and data scientists has built a full set of technology solutions specific to the home goods market. Our storefront consists of a large set of tools and systems with which our customers directly interact, that are specifically tuned for shopping the home goods category by mixing lifestyle imagery with easy-to-use navigation tools and personalization features designed to increase customer conversion. We have designed operations software to deliver the reliable and consistent experience consumers desire, with proprietary software enhancing our performance in areas such as integration with our suppliers, our warehouse and logistics network and our customer service operation. Much of our advertising technology was internally developed, including campaign management and bidding algorithms for online advertising. This allows us to leverage our internal data and target customers efficiently across various channels. We also partner selectively with marketing partners where we find solutions that meet our marketing objectives and deliver a strong return on investment. 
Much of the underlying infrastructure for storefront, operations and advertising technology is common across all of our sites and countries. While we continue to rely on a hybrid data infrastructure, we have transitioned most of our data storage and processing systems from our physical data centers to a cloud-based solution. Our physical data centers are highly secure, with wide geographic distribution and engineering resources to support high availability. These systems are monitored 24x7 by our network operations center for performance and security.
Marketing
Our marketing efforts bring new and repeat customers to our sites. Our paid advertising efforts consist primarily of online channels, including search engine marketing, display advertising and paid social media, and to a lesser extent direct mail and television advertisements. Our non-paid advertising efforts include search engine optimization, non-paid social media, mobile "push" notifications and email. Upon acquiring a customer or a potential customer's email address, we seek to increase their engagement with our sites and drive repeat purchases. This effort to increase engagement and repeat purchasing is driven by all of

our marketing tools, including personalized email marketing efforts and customer retargeting. We rigorously manage our paid marketing efforts towards the goal that each new spending initiative is cost-effective with a measurable return on investment within a designated period of time.
Logistics
Our logistics network was built specifically for the home category, where items can be bulky, heavy and prone to damage. Historically, our primary method of fulfillment was a drop-ship network where integration into our suppliers' back-end technology infrastructure allowed us to process an order and send the information directly to a supplier's warehouse. We would then arrange for shipment from the loading dock of the supplier's warehouse to the customer's home. Depending on the size of the package, the delivery would be made either through carriers such as FedEx, UPS, DHL, the U.S. Postal Service or third-party line haul trucking companies and third-party last mile home delivery agents. Today, many of our customer orders are being shipped from our CastleGate warehouses. This is facilitated by our CGF services, offering inbound freight, drayage and ocean services for suppliers sending products from Asia with direct delivery to CastleGate locations. The majority of large parcel items are delivered to the customer through our WDN, which includes consolidation centers, cross docks and last mile delivery facilities. For smaller items, we partner with carriers to handle the delivery to the customer. We believe that our proprietary logistics network will help drive incremental sales by delighting our customers with faster delivery times and a better home delivery experience. Over time we believe this network will also lower our costs per order by reducing damage rates and leveraging economies of scale in transportation.
Customer Service
Our customer service team consists of over 4,900 highly-trained sales and service employees located across the U.S. and Europe who are available to help our customers with sales and service via phone, email or online chat. Because we view superior customer service as one of our key values, our sales and service employees receive extensive training as well as competitive compensation and benefit packages. The team consists of generalists as well as specialists who have deeper expertise and training in select areas of our catalog, such as lighting, flooring and upholstery.
Our Growth Strategy
Our goal is to further increase our leadership in the home goods market by pursuing the following key strategies:
•continue building our brands by delighting our customers; 
•increase repeat purchases from existing customers and acquire new customers;
•invest in technology to further improve our customer and supplier experiences;
•grow certain categories where we under-index the broader home goods market today;
•increase delivery speed and improve the delivery experience for our customers through the continued build-out of our proprietary logistics network;
•continue to expand internationally; 
•continue to execute our omni-channel strategy with the launch of physical retail stores across our family of brands; and
•opportunistically pursue strategic acquisitions.
Competition
The market for online home goods and furniture is highly competitive, fragmented and rapidly changing. While we are primarily focused on the mass market, we compete across all segments of the home goods market. Our competition includes furniture stores, big box retailers, department stores, specialty retailers and online retailers and marketplaces in the U.S., Canada, the United Kingdom and Germany, including:
•Furniture Stores: American Freight, Ashley Furniture, Bob's Discount Furniture, Havertys, Raymour & Flanigan and Rooms To Go;
•Big Box Retailers: Bed Bath & Beyond, Home Depot, IKEA, Lowe's, Target and Walmart;
Table of Contents

•Department Stores: JCPenney, Macy's and Neiman Marcus;
•Specialty Retailers: Arhaus, At Home, Container Store, Crate and Barrel, Design Within Reach, Ethan Allen, Floor & Decor, LL Flooring, Mitchell Gold + Bob Williams, Restoration Hardware, Room & Board, Serena & Lily, TJX Companies and Williams Sonoma;
•Online Retailers and Marketplaces: Amazon, Build.com, Houzz, eBay, Etsy and Overstock;
•International: Argos, Canadian Tire, Home24, John Lewis, Leon's, Made, Otto, Westwing, and XXXLutz, in addition to several of the companies listed above who also compete with us internationally.
We believe that the primary competitive factors in the mass market are vast selection, visually inspiring browsing, compelling merchandising, ease of product discovery, price, convenience, reliability, speed of fulfillment and customer service. We believe our technological and operational expertise allows us to provide our customers with a vast selection of goods, attractive price points, reliable and timely fulfillment, plus superior customer service and that the combination of these capabilities is what provides us with a sustainable competitive advantage.
Human Capital
At Wayfair, we believe strongly in our people and want to ensure each and every employee is empowered and positioned to bring their authentic self to work every day.
Wayfair has a dedicated Diversity, Equity and Inclusion ("DEI") team that serves as our internal compass in promoting a global community, ensuring an inclusive culture and growing market penetration through innovation that only a sense of belonging across a diverse workforce can provide.
Through cross-functional partnerships, the DEI team creates the strategy and identifies initiatives to embed a lens of inclusivity into all aspects of the business with a keen focus on increasing diverse representation internally and externally. We have worked to include DEI best practices into parts of the employee lifecycle, including hiring, performance management and career and leadership development. In addition to threading DEI through the employee lifecycle, we have partnered with groups across the business to leverage DEI principles in support of our broader company goals –– not only for our people, but for our customers, our suppliers and our partners.
We believe we have a good relationship with our employees, which include 16,681 full-time equivalent employees as of December 31, 2021. Additionally, we rely on independent contractors and temporary personnel to supplement our workforce, primarily in our logistics network. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement.
COVID-19 Pandemic
In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 outbreak to be a global pandemic. While progress has been made to contain the COVID-19 pandemic, it has, and continues to, negatively impact the global economy. Our focus has been and remains on promoting the health, safety and financial security of our employees and serving our customers. 
 While it is difficult to predict all of the impacts the COVID-19 pandemic will have on our business, we believe the long-term opportunity that we see for shopping for the home online remains unchanged.
Additional information regarding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business is set forth within this Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors and Part II, Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Seasonality 
Our business is affected by seasonality, which historically has resulted in higher sales volume during our fourth quarter, which ends December 31. However, a variety of factors can alter seasonal patterns, including the COVID-19 pandemic. Beginning in mid-March 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic and the related responses disrupted our usual seasonal patterns, resulting in higher sales volumes during the second and third fiscal quarters of 2020. As economies across the U.S. and the globe began to reopen with rising vaccination rates during the spring of 2021, spending patterns shifted as consumers moved back to experiential categories in a broad fashion. The combination of these changes in consumer spending patterns and the global supply chain 
Table of Contents

challenges, which also arose due to the COVID-19 pandemic, led to lower sales in the second half of fiscal year 2021 as compared to the first.
Intellectual Property
We believe our intellectual property, including any trademarks, service marks, copyrights, domain names, patents, trade dress, trade secrets and proprietary technologies, is an important part of our business. We seek to protect our intellectual property by relying on federal, state and common law rights in the United States and other countries, as well as contractual restrictions. We generally enter into confidentiality and assignment of invention assignment agreements with employees and certain contractors and confidentiality agreements with other third parties, such as suppliers, in order to limit access to, and disclosure and use of, our confidential information and proprietary technology. In addition to these contractual arrangements, we also rely on a combination of trademarks, trade dress, domain names, copyrights, trade secrets and patents to help protect our other intellectual property.
Company Information
We began operating as Smart Tech Toys, Inc., a Massachusetts corporation, in May 2002 and changed our name to CSN Stores, Inc. in February 2003. From 2002 through 2011, the company was bootstrapped by our co-founders and operated as hundreds of niche websites, such as bedroomfurniture.com and allbarstools.com. In March 2008, we formed, and contributed all of the assets and liabilities of CSN Stores, Inc. to a subsidiary, CSN Stores LLC, and we continued operating our business through this Delaware limited liability company. In late 2011, we made the strategic decision to close and permanently redirect over 240 of our niche websites into Wayfair.com. As part of that shift, we changed the name of CSN Stores, Inc. to SK Retail, Inc. and changed our name from CSN Stores LLC to Wayfair LLC. In connection with our initial public offering, we completed a corporate reorganization, as a result of which Wayfair Inc. was formed to be a holding company with no material assets other than 100% of the equity interests in Wayfair LLC and SK Retail, Inc.
