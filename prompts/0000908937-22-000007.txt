Our Businesses
We operate two complementary audio entertainment businesses - our Sirius XM business and our Pandora business. We continue to expand the range of choices for our listeners – both in terms of compelling content and the array of ways in which it can be consumed. There are approximately 144 million vehicles in operation with Sirius XM radios, and the proliferation of smart speakers and other connected devices has increased the range of options consumers have for engaging with and consuming our content. 
We also are focused on rapidly growing content categories, such as podcasting. In 2021, an estimated 116 million Americans listened to a podcast at least monthly.
Sirius XM
Our Sirius XM business features music, sports, entertainment, comedy, talk, news, traffic and weather channels and other content, as well as podcasts and infotainment services, in the United States on a subscription fee basis. Sirius XM’s premier content bundles include live, curated and certain exclusive and on demand programming. The Sirius XM service is distributed through our two proprietary satellite radio systems and streamed via applications for mobile devices, home devices and other consumer electronic equipment.  Satellite radios are primarily distributed through automakers, retailers and our website. Our Sirius XM service is also available through our user interface, which we call “360L,” that combines our satellite and streaming services into a single, cohesive in-vehicle entertainment experience.
The primary source of revenue from our Sirius XM business is subscription fees, with most of our customers subscribing to monthly, quarterly, semi-annual or annual plans.  We also derive revenue from advertising on select non-music channels, direct sales of our satellite radios and accessories, and other ancillary services.  As of December 31, 2021, our Sirius XM business had approximately 34.0 million subscribers.
In addition to our audio entertainment businesses, we provide connected vehicle services to several automakers. These services are designed to enhance the safety, security and driving experience of consumers. We also offer a suite of data services that includes graphical weather, fuel prices, sports schedules and scores and movie listings, a traffic information service that includes information as to road closings, traffic flow and incident data to consumers with compatible in-vehicle navigation systems, and real-time weather services in vehicles, boats and planes.
Sirius XM also holds a 70% equity interest and 33% voting interest in Sirius XM Canada Holdings Inc. (“Sirius XM Canada”).
Pandora
Our Pandora business operates a music, comedy and podcast streaming platform, offering a personalized experience for each listener wherever and whenever they want to listen, whether through mobile devices, car speakers or connected devices. Pandora enables listeners to create personalized stations and playlists, discover new content, hear artist- and expert-curated playlists, podcasts and select Sirius XM content as well as search and play songs and albums on-demand. Pandora is available as (1) an ad-supported radio service, (2) a radio subscription service (Pandora Plus) and (3) an on-demand subscription service (Pandora Premium). As of December 31, 2021, Pandora had approximately 6.4 million subscribers. 
The majority of revenue from our Pandora business is generated from advertising on our Pandora ad-supported radio service. We also derive subscription revenue from our Pandora Plus and Pandora Premium subscribers.
Our Pandora business also sells advertising on audio platforms and in podcasts unaffiliated with us. Pandora has an arrangement with SoundCloud Holdings, LLC ("SoundCloud") to be its exclusive US ad sales representative. Through this arrangement, Pandora is able to offer advertisers the ability to execute campaigns in the US across the Pandora and SoundCloud listening platforms.

Our Sirius XM Business
Programming
We offer a dynamic programming lineup of commercial-free music plus sports, entertainment, comedy, talk, and news, including:
•an extensive selection of music genres, ranging from rock, pop and hip-hop to country, dance, jazz, Latin and classical;
•live play-by-play sports from major leagues and colleges;
•a multitude of talk, entertainment and comedy channels for a variety of audiences;
•a wide range of national, international and financial news; and
•exclusive limited run channels.
We believe that our broad and diverse programming, including our lineup of exclusive content, is a significant differentiator from terrestrial radio and other audio entertainment providers.  We make changes to our programming lineup from time to time as we strive to attract new subscribers and offer content which appeals to a broad range of audiences and to our existing subscribers.  The channel lineups for our services are available at siriusxm.com.
Our Sirius XM business aims to be a platform for diverse perspectives and to facilitate dialogue on a broad set of issues. This is reflected across the content provided to listeners, which includes channels dedicated to diverse and historically underrepresented groups, as well as broader programming celebrating such events as Black History Month, Latinx and Hispanic Heritage Month, LGBTQIA+ Pride Month, and Women’s History Month. We continue to expand our offerings, including through programming that represents diverse viewpoints, historically underserved audiences and original content of a type not typically available to consumers. 
Streaming Service
Our streaming service includes a variety of music and non-music channels, including channels and content that are not available on our satellite radio service, and podcasts. We offer applications to allow consumers to access our streaming service on smartphones, tablets, computers, home devices and other consumer electronic equipment.
Our streaming product currently features: the broad range of music, sports, talk, news and entertainment channels available on satellite radio; access to over 200 additional music channels, which we refer to as Xtra Music Channels; and video content, including video from The Howard Stern Show and performances and interviews from Sirius XM’s archives, including in-studio performances and behind-the-scenes moments with artists, personalities and newsmakers.
Our Sirius XM service also includes a library of podcasts, some of which are exclusive to our service, and other on demand content. Our streaming service offers subscribers the ability to choose their favorite podcast episodes from a catalog of content as well as select material from a library of podcasts we are assembling.
Our streaming service is included as part of the vast majority of Sirius XM’s packages, including the Music and Entertainment and Platinum plans. Our Personalized Stations Powered by Pandora feature, which allows subscribers to create their own customized commercial-free music stations within the SXM App, is offered to consumers as part of the price of Sirius XM’s Platinum and Platinum VIP plans. We also offer our streaming service in several standalone packages, which do not include a satellite radio subscription. These packages, which include the Streaming Platinum Plan and the Streaming Music and Entertainment Plan, are available to consumers at various prices and include a variety of content.
We have entered into agreements with third parties designed to increase the distribution and ease of use of our streaming service, including through connected devices. We also have arrangements with various services and consumer electronics manufacturers to include the Sirius XM streaming functionality with their service and devices.
360L
Our next generation automotive platform, which we call “360L,” combines our satellite and streaming services into a single, cohesive in-vehicle entertainment experience. We have agreements with many automakers to deploy our 360L interface in a variety of vehicles. We believe that 360L will be included in a majority of vehicles that include Sirius XM functionality in the future. 
360L allows us to take advantage of advanced in-dash infotainment systems.  360L is intended to leverage the ubiquitous signal coverage and low delivery costs of our satellite infrastructure with the two-way communication capability of a wireless streaming service to provide consumers seamless access to our content, including our live channels, on demand service, podcasts and even more personalized music services.  The wireless streaming connection included in 360L enables enhanced search and recommendations functions, making discovery of our content in the vehicle easier.  In certain cases, 360L also allows consumers to manage aspects of their subscriptions directly through their vehicles’ equipment and provides us data on how our subscribers use our service.
Distribution of Radios
New Vehicles
We distribute satellite radios through the sale and lease of new vehicles.  We have agreements with major automakers to offer satellite radios in their vehicles.  Satellite radios are available as a factory-installed feature in substantially all vehicle makes sold in the United States.
Most automakers include a subscription to our service in the sale or lease of their new vehicles.  In certain cases, we receive subscription payments from automakers in advance of the activation of our service.  We share with certain automakers a portion of the revenues we derive from subscribers using vehicles equipped to receive our service.  We also reimburse various automakers for certain costs associated with the satellite radios installed in new vehicles, including in certain cases hardware costs, engineering expenses and promotional and advertising expenses.
Previously Owned Vehicles
We acquire subscribers through the sale and lease of previously owned vehicles with factory-installed satellite radios.  We have entered into agreements with many automakers to include a subscription to our service in the sale or lease of vehicles which include satellite radios sold through their certified pre-owned programs.  We also work directly with franchise and independent dealers on programs for non-certified used vehicles.
We have developed systems and methods to identify purchasers and lessees of previously owned vehicles which include satellite radios and have established marketing plans to promote our services to these potential subscribers.
Retail
We sell satellite radios directly to consumers through our website.  Satellite radios are also marketed and distributed through national, regional and online retailers, such as Amazon.com.
Our Satellite Radio Systems
Our satellite radio systems are designed to provide clear reception in most areas of the continental United States despite variations in terrain, buildings and other obstructions.  We continually monitor our infrastructure and regularly evaluate improvements in technology.
Our satellite radio systems have three principal components:
•satellites, terrestrial repeaters and other satellite facilities;
•studios; and
•radios.
Satellites, Terrestrial Repeaters and Other Satellite Facilities
Satellites. We provide our service through a fleet of orbiting geostationary satellites. Two of these satellites, FM-5 and FM-6, transmit our service on frequencies originally licensed by the Federal Communications Commission (the “FCC”) to Sirius, and two of these satellites, XM-4 and SXM-8, transmit our service on frequencies originally licensed by the FCC to XM. Our XM-3 and XM-5 satellites serve as spares for the XM system.
Our SXM-8 satellite was successfully launched into a geostationary orbit on June 6, 2021 and was placed into service on September 8, 2021 following the completion of in-orbit testing. The SXM-8 satellite replaced our XM-3 satellite, which remains available as an in-orbit spare along with XM-5.
On December 13, 2020, our SXM-7 satellite was successfully launched and in-orbit testing of SXM-7 began on January 4, 2021. During in-orbit testing of SXM-7, events occurred which caused failures of certain SXM-7 payload units. The evaluation of SXM-7 concluded that the satellite will not function as intended. SXM-7 remains in-orbit at its assigned orbital location, but is not being used to provide satellite radio service.
We have entered into agreements for the design, construction and launch of two additional satellites, SXM-9 and SXM-10. Construction of our SXM-9 and SXM-10 satellites is underway and those satellites are expected to be launched into geostationary orbits in 2024 and 2025, respectively.
Satellite Insurance.  We have procured insurance for SXM-8 to cover the risks associated with the satellite's first year of in-orbit operation. In 2021, we collected an aggregate of $225 million under the insurance policies we purchased with respect to SXM-7. We do not have insurance policies covering our other in-orbit satellites as we consider the premium costs to be uneconomical relative to the risk of satellite failure.
Terrestrial Repeaters.  In some areas with high concentrations of tall buildings, such as urban centers, signals from our satellites may be blocked and reception of satellite signals can be adversely affected.  In other areas with a high density of next generation wireless systems our service may experience interference. In many of these areas, we have deployed terrestrial repeaters to supplement and enhance our signal coverage and, in other areas, we may deploy additional repeaters to mitigate interference.  We operate over 1,000 terrestrial repeaters across the United States as part of our systems.
Other Satellite Facilities.  We control and communicate with our satellites from facilities in North America. Our satellites are monitored, tracked and controlled by a third party satellite operator.
Studios
Our programming originates from studios in New York City, Los Angeles and Washington D.C. and, to a lesser extent, from smaller studios in Nashville and a variety of venues across the country.  Our corporate headquarters is in New York City. We provide equipment to artists and hosts to enable remote creation and transmission of programming.
Radios
We do not manufacture radios.  We have authorized manufacturers and distributors to produce and distribute radios, and have licensed our technology to various electronics manufacturers to develop, manufacture and distribute radios under certain brands.  We do manage various aspects of the production of satellite radios.  To facilitate the sale of radios, we may subsidize a portion of the radio manufacturing costs to reduce the hardware price to consumers.
Connected Vehicle Services
We provide connected vehicle services to several automakers. Our connected vehicle services are designed to enhance the safety, security and driving experience for vehicle operators while providing marketing and operational benefits to automakers and their dealers.  We offer a portfolio of location-based services through two-way wireless connectivity, including safety, security, convenience, maintenance and data services, remote vehicle diagnostics, and stolen or parked vehicle locator services. Subscribers to our connected vehicle services are not included in our subscriber count or subscriber-based operating metrics.
Other Services
Commercial Accounts.  Our programming is available for commercial establishments.  Commercial subscription accounts are available through providers of in-store entertainment solutions and directly from us.
Satellite Television Service.  Certain of our music channels are offered as part of select programming packages on the DISH Network satellite television service.
Travel Link.  We offer Travel Link, a suite of data services that includes graphical weather, fuel prices, sports schedules and scores and movie listings.
Real-Time Traffic Services.  We offer services that provide graphic information as to road closings, traffic flow and incident data to consumers with compatible in-vehicle navigation systems.
Real-Time Weather Services.  We offer real-time weather services in vehicles, boats and planes.
Commercial subscribers are included in our subscriber count. Subscribers to the DISH Network satellite television service are not included in our subscriber count and subscribers to our Travel Link, real-time traffic services and real-time weather services are not included in our subscriber count, unless the applicable service is purchased by the subscriber separately and not as part of a radio subscription to our service.

Our Pandora Business
Pandora Media, LLC, which owns and operates our Pandora business, is a wholly owned subsidiary of Sirius XM. 
Streaming Radio and On-Demand Music Services
Our Pandora business offers a personalized audio entertainment platform for each listener. Users are able to create personalized stations and playlists and search and play songs and albums on-demand. The Pandora service utilizes content 
programming algorithms, data collected from listeners, and attributes of the music to predict user music preferences, play content suited to the tastes of each listener, and introduce each listener to music consistent with the consumer's preferences. 
The Pandora service is available on iOS and Android mobile devices, web browsers, and other internet connected devices. The Pandora application is free to download and use.

Certain automakers now provide embedded streaming connectivity that supports and makes available the Pandora service in vehicles without the need for smartphone connectivity. In addition, our Pandora service is integrated into consumer electronic, voice-based devices and smart speakers.
The Pandora service is available as an ad-supported radio service, a radio subscription service (Pandora Plus), or an on-demand subscription service (Pandora Premium). Local and national advertisers deliver targeted messages to our Pandora listeners on the ad-supported service. 
Ad-Supported Radio Service
Our Pandora business offers an ad-supported radio service which allows listeners to access our catalog of music, comedy, live streams and podcasts through personalized stations. This service is free across all platforms and generates stations specific to each listener. Each listener can personalize their stations by adding variety to the content. 
Listeners of the ad-supported service are provided with the option to temporarily access on-demand listening, including certain features of the Pandora Premium service. We refer to this temporary access as “Premium Access”. 
Subscription Radio Service (Pandora Plus)
Our Pandora business offers Pandora Plus - an ad-free, subscription version of the radio service that includes options for replaying songs, skipping songs, offline listening, and higher quality audio on supported devices. Content provided to each listener of Pandora Plus is more tailored when the listener interacts more with the platform. Premium Access is also available to Pandora Plus listeners. 
On-Demand Subscription Service (Pandora Premium)
Our Pandora business offers Pandora Premium - an on-demand subscription service that combines the radio features of Pandora Plus with an on-demand experience. The on-demand experience provides listeners with the ability to search, play and collect songs and albums, download content for offline listening, build playlists, listen to curated playlists and share playlists on social networks. Listeners can also create partial playlists that Pandora can complete based on the listener’s activity. Listeners through mobile devices have access to customized profiles which identify information specific to each listener such as recent favorites, playlists and thumbs. 
Pandora Premium incorporates social networking features including a centralized stream where listeners can view the music that their social connections are experiencing and provide and receive recommendations for songs, albums and playlists. Pandora Premium also includes a “share” feature where consumers can share their stations, songs, albums, podcasts or playlists through social media, messaging applications and email.
Advertising Revenue
Pandora’s primary source of revenue is the sale of audio, display and video advertising for connected device platforms, including computers and mobile devices. Our Pandora business maintains a portfolio of proprietary advertising technologies which include order management, advertising serving and timing, native advertising formats, targeting and reporting. Pandora provides advertisers with the ability to target and connect with listeners based on various criteria including age, gender, geographic location and content preferences. Our Pandora business also has agreements to sell the available advertising inventory in the United States for SoundCloud, one of the world’s largest open audio platforms, and other third parties.

Stitcher licenses from creators original podcasts and operates content networks. Stitcher also provides podcast advertising services that generate revenue from approximately 400 shows and offers a mobile app listening platform where consumers can stream the latest in news, sports, talk, and entertainment on demand. 
Stitcher earns revenue by distributing advertising on certain owned and operated podcasts as well as those created by third parties, including placement based on an advertiser’s desired target audience, and from the sale of advertising on its licensed podcasts and podcasts offered within the Stitcher app. Stitcher creates and distributes original podcasts licensed from third parties through platforms such as its Stitcher app and the iPhone podcast app.
Stitcher also earns subscription revenue from its Stitcher Premium subscription service. Users pay a monthly or annual fee for access on Stitcher Premium to premium content and ad-free archived podcast episodes.

Simplecast
Pandora, through its Simplecast business, also offers a podcast management and analytics platform. Simplecast complements AdsWizz’s advertising technology platform, allowing the company to offer podcasters a solution for management, hosting, analytics and advertising sales.
Competition
We face significant competition for listeners and advertisers in our Sirius XM business and our Pandora business, including from providers of radio and other audio services.
Competition for Subscribers and Listeners
Traditional AM/FM Radio
Our Sirius XM services and Pandora services compete with traditional AM/FM radio.  Traditional AM/FM radio has a well-established demand for its services and offers free broadcasts paid for by commercial advertising rather than by subscription fees.  Many radio stations offer information programming of a local nature, such as local news and sports.  The availability of traditional free AM/FM radio may reduce the likelihood that customers would be willing to pay for our subscription services. Several traditional radio companies own large numbers of radio stations and other media properties, such as podcast networks.
Streaming and On-Demand Competitors
Streaming and on-demand services, including Amazon Prime, Apple Music, Spotify and YouTube, compete with our Sirius XM and Pandora services.  Major online providers make high fidelity digital streams available at no cost or, in some cases, for less than the cost of a satellite radio subscription.  Certain of these services include advanced functionality, such as personalization and customization and allow the user to access large libraries of content.  These services, in some instances, are also offered through devices sold by the service providers including Apple, Google and Amazon. For some consumers, these services compete with our services, at home, in vehicles, and wherever audio entertainment is consumed. 
Advanced In-Dash Infotainment Systems
Nearly all automakers have deployed integrated multimedia systems in dashboards, including Apple CarPlay and Android Auto.  These systems combine control of audio entertainment from a variety of sources, including AM/FM/HD radio broadcasts, satellite radio, streaming radio, smartphone applications and stored audio, with navigation and other advanced applications.  Streaming radio and other data are typically connected to the system through an Internet-enabled smartphone or wireless modem installed in the vehicle, and the entire system may be controlled by touchscreen or voice recognition.  These systems enhance the attractiveness of Internet-based competitors by making such applications more prominent, easier to access, and safer to use in vehicles.
Direct Broadcast Satellite and Cable Audio
A number of providers offer specialized audio services through either direct broadcast satellite or cable audio systems.  These services are targeted to fixed locations, mostly in-home, but also include mobile entertainment.  The radio service offered by direct broadcast satellite and cable audio is often included as part of a package of digital services with video service, and video customers generally do not pay an additional monthly charge for the audio service. In addition, other services offered by these providers, such as cable television, on-demand video streaming, and interactive video games compete with our services to the extent they utilize existing or potential users' and listeners' time that could otherwise be allocated to the use of our Sirius XM or Pandora services.
Other Digital Media Services
The audio entertainment marketplace continues to evolve rapidly, with a steady emergence of new media platforms that compete with both our Sirius XM and Pandora services now or that could compete with those services in the future.
Traffic Services
For our Sirius XM business, a number of providers compete with our traffic services, particularly by smartphones offering GPS mapping with sophisticated data-based turn navigation.
Connected Vehicle Services
Our Sirius XM connected vehicle services business operates in a highly competitive environment and competes with several providers as well as with products being developed for vehicles by automakers and other third parties.  OnStar, a division of General Motors, also offers connected vehicle services in GM vehicles.  Wireless devices, such as mobile phones, are also competitors. We compete against other connected vehicle service providers for automaker arrangements on the basis of innovation, service quality and reliability, technical capabilities and system customization, scope of service, industry experience, past performance and price.
Competition for Advertisers
Our competition for advertisers includes large scale online advertising platforms such as Amazon, Facebook and Google; traditional media companies such as television broadcasters and national print outlets; broadcast radio providers; podcast distributors and networks; and companies in the broadcast radio market. We compete against these providers for advertisers on the basis of several factors, including advertisers’ overall budgets, perceived return on investment, effectiveness and relevance of our advertising platforms, price, delivery of large volumes or precise types of advertisements to targeted demographics, transactional capabilities and reporting capabilities. 
The online advertising marketplace continues to evolve rapidly, particularly with the introduction of new digital advertising technologies and expanding capabilities of larger internet companies.
Government Regulation
General
We are subject to a number of foreign and domestic laws and regulations relating to consumer protection, information security and data protection. There are several States that require specific information security controls to protect certain types of information and specific notifications to consumers in the event of a security breach that compromises certain categories of personal information. Certain of our services are also subject to laws in the United States and abroad pertaining to privacy of user data and other information, including the California Consumer Protection Act and the European General Data Protection Regulation. Our Privacy Policies and customer agreements describe our practices pertaining to the foregoing. 
We believe we comply with all of our obligations under all applicable laws and regulations. 
Our Sirius XM Business
As operators of a privately-owned satellite system, we are regulated by the FCC under the Communications Act of 1934, principally with respect to:
•the licensing of our satellite systems;
•preventing interference with or to other users of radio frequencies; and
•compliance with FCC rules established specifically for U.S. satellites and satellite radio services.
Any assignment or transfer of control of our FCC licenses must be approved by the FCC.  The FCC's order approving our merger with XM Satellite Radio Holdings Inc. in July 2008 requires us to comply with certain voluntary commitments we made as part of the FCC merger proceeding.  We believe we comply with those commitments.
In 1997, we were the winning bidders for FCC licenses to operate a satellite digital audio radio service and provide other ancillary services.  Our FCC licenses for our Sirius satellites expire in 2022 and 2025.  Our FCC licenses for our XM satellites expire in 2022 and 2026.  We anticipate that, absent significant misconduct on our part, the FCC will renew our licenses to permit operation of our satellites for their useful lives, and grant licenses for any replacement satellites.
In some areas, we have installed terrestrial repeaters to supplement our satellite signal coverage.  The FCC has established rules governing terrestrial repeaters and has granted us a license through 2027 to operate our repeater network.
In certain cases, we obtain FCC certifications for satellite radios, including satellite radios that include FM modulators.  We believe our radios that are in production comply with all applicable FCC rules.
We are required to obtain export licenses or other approvals from the United States government to export certain equipment, services and technical data related to our satellites and their operations.  The transfer of such equipment, services and technical data outside the United States or to foreign persons is subject to strict export control and prior approval requirements from the United States government (including prohibitions on the sharing of certain satellite-related goods and services with China).
Changes in law or regulations relating to communications policy or to matters affecting our services could adversely affect our ability to retain our FCC licenses or the manner in which we operate.
Copyrights to Programming
In connection with our businesses, we must enter into royalty arrangements with two sets of rights holders:  holders of musical compositions copyrights (that is, the music and lyrics) and holders of sound recordings copyrights (that is, the actual recording of a work). Our Sirius XM business and our Pandora business use both statutory and direct music licenses as part of their businesses. We license varying rights - such as performance and mechanical rights - for use in our Sirius XM and Pandora businesses based on the various radio and interactive services they offer. Set forth below is a brief overview of the music composition and sound recording licenses employed by our Sirius XM and Pandora businesses. These music licensing arrangements are complex and the description below is only a summary of these complicated licensing schemes.
Musical Compositions: Performance Rights and Mechanical Rights
The holders of performance rights in musical compositions, generally songwriters and music publishers, are represented by performing rights organizations such as the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers (“ASCAP”), Broadcast Music, Inc. (“BMI”), SESAC, Inc. (“SESAC”) and Global Music Rights LLC (“GMR”). These organizations negotiate fees with copyright users, collect royalties and distribute them to the rights holders.
The holders of the mechanical rights in musical compositions, generally songwriters and music publishers, have traditionally licensed these rights through the statutory license set forth in Section 115 of the United States Copyright Act; however, mechanical rights can also be licensed directly. 
The changing market for musical compositions may have an adverse effect on our Sirius XM business and our Pandora business, including increasing our costs and limiting the musical works available to us.
Sirius XM Business. We have arrangements with ASCAP, BMI, SESAC, and GMR to license the musical compositions we perform on our satellite radio and streaming services. Our Sirius XM business does not require a mechanical license. 
Pandora Business. We have arrangements with ASCAP, BMI, SESAC, GMR and a variety of other copyright owners to license the musical compositions performance rights we use on our Pandora services. For our Pandora ad-supported radio service, certain copyright holders receive as a performance royalty their usage-based and ownership-based share of a royalty pool equal to 21.5% of the content acquisition costs that we pay for sound recordings on our ad-supported service and others receive a fixed fee. 
Pandora must also license reproduction rights, which are also referred to as mechanical rights, to offer the interactive features of the Pandora services. For our Pandora subscription services, copyright holders receive payments for these rights at the rates determined in accordance with the statutory license set forth in Section 115 of the United States Copyright Act. In January 2018, the Copyright Royalty Board (the “CRB”) set a rate structure for the five-year period commencing January 1, 2018 and ending on December 31, 2022. The rate was 14.2% of revenues or 25.2% of record label payments in 2021. The rate was scheduled to increase over the five-year period to 15.1% of revenues or 26.2% of record label payments by 2022.
In August 2021, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit concluded that the CRB failed to provide adequate notice of the rate structure it adopted, failed to explain its rejection of a past settlement agreement as a benchmark for going forward, and never identified the source of its asserted authority to substantively redefine a material term of its initial determination. For these reasons, the Court of Appeals overturned the CRB’s adopted rate structure and percentage rates and remanded the proceeding to the CRB for further proceedings. The CRB has implemented proceedings to consider and address the Court of Appeals’ decision.
Sound Recordings
Operators of a non-interactive satellite radio or streaming service are entitled to license sound recordings under the statutory license contained in Section 114 of the United States Copyright Act (the “statutory license”). Under the statutory license, we may negotiate royalty arrangements with the owners of sound recordings or, if negotiation is unsuccessful, the royalty rate is established by the CRB. Sound recording rights holders, typically large record companies, are primarily represented by SoundExchange, Inc. (“SoundExchange”), an organization which negotiates licenses, and collects and distributes royalties on behalf of record companies and performing artists.
Interactive streaming services, such as Pandora Plus and Pandora Premium, do not qualify for the statutory license and the services must negotiate direct license arrangements with the owners of copyrights in sound recordings.
Sirius XM Business. For the ten-year period commencing January 1, 2018 and ending on December 31, 2027, the CRB set the royalty rate payable by us under the statutory license covering the performance of sound recordings over our Sirius XM satellite radio service, and the making of ephemeral (server) copies in support of such performances, to be 15.5% of gross revenues, subject to exclusions and adjustments. The revenue subject to royalty includes subscription revenue from our U.S. satellite digital audio radio subscribers, and advertising revenue from channels other than those channels that make only incidental performances of sound recordings. The rates and terms permit us to reduce the payment due each month for those sound recordings directly licensed from copyright owners and exclude from our revenue certain other items, such as royalties paid to us for intellectual property, sales and use taxes, bad debt expense and generally revenue attributable to areas of our business that do not involve the use of copyrighted sound recordings.
In 2021, as a result of the CRB ruling discussed below we paid a per performance rate for the streaming of certain sound recordings of $0.0026 on our Sirius XM streaming service which increased from $0.0024 in 2020.
Pandora Business. For our Pandora business, we have entered into direct license agreements with major and independent music labels and distributors for a significant majority of the sound recordings that stream on the Pandora ad-supported service, Pandora Plus and Pandora Premium.
For sound recordings that we stream and for which we have not entered into a direct license agreement with the sound recording rights holders, the sound recordings are streamed pursuant to the statutory license, and applicable rates thereunder, set by the CRB. Sound recordings subject to the statutory license can only be played through our radio services and not through services that are offered on-demand or offline or through any replay or additional skip features.
In June 2021, the CRB issued its initial determination regarding the royalty rates payable by us under the statutory license by which webcasters perform sound recordings via digital transmission over the internet and make ephemeral (server) copies of those recordings during the five-year period starting January 1, 2021 and ending on December 31, 2025. Because the proceeding focuses on setting statutory rates for non-interactive online music streaming (commonly identified as “webcasting”), the proceeding set the rates that our Pandora business pays for statutorily licensed music streaming on its free, ad-supported service (and for the non-interactive music streaming that occur on its subscription tiers), and that our Sirius XM business pays for music streaming on its subscription internet radio service.
The proceeding did not set the rates that we pay for our other music offerings (such as our satellite radio or business establishment services) and does not affect the rates we pay music publishers for our services, which are covered under different licenses. The statutory rates set in this proceeding will, however, affect the amount we pay for streaming on Pandora 
under certain of its direct licenses with sound recording copyright owners (i.e., record companies). The royalty rates under many of those direct licenses, which cover a large majority of the sound recordings that we perform on Pandora, are indexed to the statutory rates established in this proceeding.
Under the terms of the CRB’s decision, the statutory royalty rate in 2021 was $0.0021 per performance for non-subscription transmissions (such as offered by the Pandora ad-supported business) and $0.0026 per performance for subscription transmissions (such as offered by the Sirius XM internet radio service). These rates for 2021 were an approximate 17% increase in the rates for non-subscription transmissions and an approximate 8% increase in the rates for subscription transmissions, in each case over the rates in effect during 2020. Rates for the remainder of the five-year period are subject to adjustment each year by the CRB to reflect any changes occurring in the cost of living as determined by the most recent Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers.
Prior to the enactment of the Orrin G. Hatch-Bob Goodlatte Music Modernization Act in October 2018, our rights to perform certain sound recordings that were fixed before February 15, 1972 were governed by state law. We still face a class action lawsuit brought by plaintiffs who allege that Pandora violated their alleged exclusive copyright ownership rights to the reproduction and public performance of sound recordings created prior to February 15, 1972. See “Item 3. Legal Proceedings” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for information on this action.

Human Capital Resources
General
As of December 31, 2021, we had 5,590 full-time and part-time employees, the overwhelming majority of which were full-time employees. During 2021, our workforce decreased by approximately 2.4% compared to the prior year, and our core voluntary full-time employee turnover rate was approximately 12.6%.
Our business relies on our ability to attract and retain talented employees. To attract and retain talent, we strive to create a diverse, inclusive and supportive workplace, with opportunities for our employees to grow and develop in their careers, supported by competitive compensation, benefits and health and wellness programs, and by programs that build connections between our employees and their communities.
Corporate Culture
We are focused on creating a corporate culture of integrity and respect, with the goal of working together to drive our business to be creative, innovative and competitive. To achieve these objectives, we have adopted and regularly communicate to our employees the following core values, which we call “AMPLIFY”:
•Applaud and encourage new thinking
•Move forward and be purposeful in our desire to win
•Prioritize honesty, integrity and respectful communication
•Lean on each other and learn from one another
•Invest in our actions and commit to the follow through
•Find ways to give back by focusing on community and feeding your individuality
•You Matter. We embrace our differences, empower each other and include everyone
We operate a performance-based environment where results matter and financial discipline is enforced. We have tried to create a highly collaborative culture in which employees feel a sense of pride that their input is sought after and valued. At the same time, we believe in holding individuals accountable and have tried to create a culture in which employees “do what they say they are going to do.” We believe that our culture is a long-term competitive advantage for us, fuels our ability to execute and is a critical underpinning of our employee talent strategy. The Nominating, Environmental, Social and Governance Committee of our Board of Directors oversees our management continuity planning process, and reviews and evaluates succession plans relating to our Chief Executive Officer and other executive officers.
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion
We believe that a diverse workforce is critical to our success. We cultivate an inclusive environment where human differences are valued, respected, supported and amplified. We have taken actions to recruit, retain, develop and advance a diverse and talented workforce. Our diversity, equity and inclusion efforts are led by our Senior Vice President, Head of Diversity, Equity & Inclusion. This position regularly reports to our Chief Executive Officer, works with our executive officers and provides updates to our Board of Directors. The charter for the Nominating, Environmental, Social and Governance Committee of our Board of Directors requires such committee to review and make recommendations, as the committee deems appropriate, regarding the composition and size of the Board of Directors in order to ensure the Board of Directors has the requisite expertise and its membership consists of persons with sufficiently diverse and independent backgrounds.
We are focused on increasing women and minority representation at all levels of our organization. We recruit talent in diverse communities, including by engaging as a sponsor of professional conferences focused on diverse talent. We have created a program, called Pathways, that provides recent graduates of Historically Black Colleges and Universities with entry-level full-time opportunities. We also have agreements with third parties designed to offer leadership development for Black, Latinx, Native American and Asian employees. Additionally, we provide a mentoring program to help underrepresented employees benefit from coaching, guidance, and feedback. We have five employee resource groups, including groups supporting Women, People of Color (African Americans, Latinx, Asian and Hispanic), Veterans, the LGBTQIA+ community and employees with disabilities.
We have implemented a broad set of anti-harassment and discrimination policies designed to protect against discrimination based upon sex, gender, race, color, religion/religious creed, national origin, ancestry, physical or mental disability, genetic information, age, marital status, pregnancy, sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, sex stereotype, transgender, immigration status, military and protected veteran status, medical condition, or any basis prohibited under federal, state or local law. We also provide regular training and guidance to our workforce regarding diversity, equity and inclusion. In 2021, we launched “Can We Talk?” an initiative aimed at increasing cultural awareness and promoting dialogue and “Conscious Inclusion” a facilitator-led training required for all of our full-time U.S. based employees. Conscious Inclusion enables employees to explore bias and its impact, learn how it translates to reactions and behaviors towards differences, and is designed to promote inclusive behaviors in our workplace.
We also periodically request our employees to voluntarily self-identify personal information related to gender, race, ethnicity, veteran and disability status. This information about the demographics of our employee population allows us to assess and evaluate our diversity, equity and inclusion efforts. We also comply with the FCC’s Equal Employment Opportunity (“EEO”) rules, including making our EEO reports publicly available.
Health, Safety and Wellness
We are committed to the health, safety and wellness of our employees. We provide our employees and their families with access to a variety of health and wellness programs, including benefits that support their physical and mental health. 
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented changes that we consider to be in the best interest of our employees, as well as the communities in which we operate, and which comply with government regulations. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, the vast majority of our employees worked from home in 2021. We have implemented additional safety 
measures for employees continuing on-site work. We believe we have been able to preserve our business continuity without sacrificing our commitment to keeping our employees safe during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Compensation and Benefits
We operate in a highly competitive and technologically challenging environment. We provide competitive compensation and benefits programs for our employees. In addition to salaries, these programs (which vary by employee level and by the country where the employees are located) include, among other items, bonuses, equity-based compensation awards, a 401(k) plan and a non-qualified deferred compensation plan, healthcare and insurance benefits, health savings and flexible spending accounts, paid time off, paid parental leave, advocacy resources, flexible work schedules and employee assistance programs.
Talent Development
We provide numerous training opportunities for our employees, with a focus on continuous learning and development and methodologies to manage performance, provide feedback and develop talent. We also have an internal digital workplace which provides employees with quick access to learning resources that cover a variety of topics.
Our talent development programs attempt to provide employees resources to achieve career goals and build management and leadership skills. We offer mentoring programs, management training and leadership sessions to support the professional growth of our employees.
Building Connections — With Each Other and our Communities
Building connections between our employees, their families and our communities can, in our view, create a more meaningful, fulfilling and enjoyable workplace. Through our engagement programs, employees can pursue their interests and hobbies, and connect to each other and to volunteering and giving opportunities. 
Our corporate giving and volunteering programs encourage employees to give to the causes most meaningful to them. We have a charitable matching program which offers employees a dollar for dollar match on their charitable contributions up to a specific cap. In addition, full-time employees are eligible to receive five days of paid time off to volunteer with charitable organizations of their choice. During 2021, over 370 employees volunteered almost 5,000 hours, while over 700 employees utilized our charitable matching program, benefiting almost 1,300 charitable organizations. 
In 2020, we contributed $25 million to a donor advised fund to support our charitable contributions, an effort we call SiriusXM Cares. In 2021, SiriusXM Cares contributed to a variety of organizations which promote social equality, education, hiring, or combat racial injustice, including The Apollo Theater, Save The Music, Huston-Tillotson University, Asian Americans Advancing Justice, South Asian Americans Leading Together, the Alliance for Women in Media, the Human Rights Campaign, TASH (an international advocacy association of people with disabilities, their family members, other advocates, and people who work in the disability field), the League of United Latin American Citizens, the Native American Rights Fund, The Warrior Alliance, the AutoNation Foundation and the St. Thomas Aquinas College Social Justice Center.
