General Overview
 The Company was incorporated in the State of Nevada on April 21, 2009, under the name Mokita Exploration, Ltd. The Company originally intended to develop its business as a mineral exploration company, however, due to the low supply of potentially profitable mining properties, our company abandoned its original plan and restructured its business strategy. We then focused our efforts on developing a business as a provider of credit card payment services for Canadian customers. To reflect the Company’s new focus, on February 5, 2010, we filed a Certificate of Amendment to the Articles of Incorporation changing our name to Mokita, Inc. 
 
We decided to enter the oil and gas industry because we were seeking out viable options to create value for our shareholders. On July 20, 2011, we filed a Certificate of Amendment to the Articles of Incorporation changing our name to Mokita Ventures, Inc., to reflect our company’s new business plan. The name change to Mokita Ventures, Inc. was subsequently rejected by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (“FINRA”) and accordingly, on May 30, 2013, we filed a Certificate of Amendment to the Articles of Incorporation to restore our name to Mokita, Inc.

On February 27, 2014, there was a change of control of the Company. On February 28, 2014, our board of directors and a majority of holders of the Company’s voting securities approved a change of name of the Company to MediJane Holdings Inc. A Certificate of Amendment to effect the change of name was filed and became effective with the Nevada Secretary of State on March 4, 2014. A Certificate of Correction was subsequently filed with the Nevada Secretary of State on March 6, 2014 to correct a spelling error in the Company’s new name. These amendments have been reviewed by FINRA and were approved for filing with an effective date of March 10, 2014. The name change became effective with the Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board at the opening of trading on March 10, 2014 under our new ticker symbol “MJMD”.
 
Our Business
 After the change of control on February 27, 2014, the Company became a medical delivery systems company with a pharmaceutical approach to cannabinoid treatment of various illnesses with medical marijuana, currently being launched in Colorado and California. As of July 8, 2015, we have changed our business to only focus on Cannabidiol (CBD) products. CBD is a non-psychotropic cannabinoid that is not restricted as part of the U.S. Controlled Substance Act (CSA). CBD is defined under the 2014 U.S. Farming Bill to be derivatives of the Industrial Hemp plant that contain less than 0.3% tetra-hydro-cannabinol (THC). We will contract out the manufacturing of the products. Phoenix Bio Pharmaceuticals Corporation and other groups may manufacture our products under our license agreement.
 
License Agreement. On July 8, 2015, the Company agreed to enter into a new licensing agreement with Phoenix Bio Pharmaceuticals Corporation. This new agreement shall replace the previous licensing agreements. The new licensing agreement shall be a non-exclusive, CBD only licensing agreement with Phoenix Bio Pharmaceuticals Corporation. This license agreement operates for a twenty (20) year period. Phoenix Bio Pharm has granted to the Company a license for the territory of North America, Australia and New Zealand to exploit all presently owned and after-acquired intellectual property rights and know-how of Phoenix Bio Pharm related to CBD based cannabinoid products and delivery systems for the treatment and management of illnesses. Products falling under the license will include the following CBD products: transdermal patches, orally administered extracts, concentrated extracts for vaporizers and inhalers, sublingual and buccal dispensing products and extraction technology, suppository delivery systems, salves, creams, gels, lotions, and liquid extracts, and any products or active ingredients sourced through Phoenix Bio Pharm affiliates or third party suppliers or licensors. The Company will also have the right to sublicense the rights acquired pursuant to the license agreement and to use and develop copyrighted materials of Phoenix Bio Pharm for marketing and distribution purposes. 
 
In addition to the new license agreement, on July 8, 2015 the Company has entered into an exchange agreement with Phoenix Bio Pharm where all existing common shares held by Phoenix Bio Pharm (276,000,000) are exchanged for 2,000,000 Series B Preferred Shares, par value $0.0001. These preferred shares are entitled to 100 votes for each share held, and are convertible into 100 common shares at any time at the discretion of the holder. 
 
Products
 The Company is currently working with physicians, scientists, engineers and other professional in the United States and internationally to formulate a wide range of product delivery systems to assure our products are a precise and safe alternative as a potential treatment for chronic illness. These statements have not been evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration. These products are not intended to diagnose, treat, cure or prevent disease.

During the year ended February 28, 2015, the Company had launched the following products for medicinal use in the State of California:
 
MediJane Transdermal Patches. Developed out of the commitment for accurate dosing and the application of pharmaceutical grade delivery methods within the cannabis industry. Six (6) formulations of patches are in development with ongoing research for many more to come. The patches retail for approximately $8-$12.50 per patch.
 
Medi-Strip Relaxation: Medi-Strips are a thin-film strip designed for relaxation and relief of pain and inflammation. The strips retail for approximately $7.50 per patch.
 
Following the changes to the licensing agreement, the Company has agreed to sell the subsidiary companies that had previously sold the aforementioned products to Phoenix Bio Pharmaceuticals Corporation.
 
Further, with the change of products to focus only on those containing CBD, the Company seeks to distribute its products nationally it plans to distribute and sell future products, including but not limited to:
 
Transdermal Patches
 
Thin Film Tongue Strips

CannaVest Corp.
 On December 23, 2014, the Company entered into an agreement to purchase $1,200,000 worth of raw material inventory to be obtained from CannaVest Corp. to use in the Company’s cannabidiol product formulations, and a convertible promissory note for $1,200,000 with CannaVest Corp. The note accrues simple interest at a rate of 10% per annum and is due and payable in six months from the date of issue. The note cannot be prepaid. At any time, the outstanding principal amount of this note and all accrued but unpaid interest under this note can be converted into common shares at a price equal to the lesser of $0.02 per common share, the closing sale price, or the average of the lowest closing sale prices of the Company’s common shares during the five trading day period immediately preceding the date of such determination. Should the Company default on this convertible promissory note, all outstanding obligations payable by the Company are immediately due and payable. In addition, CannaVest Corp. may exercise any other right, power or remedy permitted by law. Further, upon even of default, all unpaid obligations under this note shall bear interest at the rate of 12% per annum.

In connection with the convertible promissory note dated December 23, 2014, the Company subsequently issued warrants to purchase 20,000,000 common shares at an exercise price of $0.02 per common share to Kisha Spendthrift Trust, an affiliate of CannaVest Corp. These warrants were issued on January 6, 2015. In exchange for these warrants, the Company shall have access to the technical and management staff of CannaVest Corp. for the development of products to be manufactured from cannabidiol sourced from CannaVest Corp. The Company has valued these warrants using the black scholes option pricing model at $197,663 and will record the expense related to the warrants in its fourth fiscal quarter.
 
On July 8, 2015, the Company authorized an exchange offer to CannaVest in which the Company offers to exchange its convertible promissory note in the original principal amount of $1,200,000 for 1,200,000 Series D preferred shares. These shares are not entitled to any voting rights, and can be converted into common shares at a rate of $1.00 per common share. Series D preferred shares are senior to common shares and Series B preferred shares, and holders of Series D preferred shares are entitled to receive a preferred return equal to 10% of the gross cash sales income received in the ordinary course of business. Upon issue of the dividend, the value of such Series D preferred shares shall be deemed to be retired. As of the date of filing, CannaVest has not yet agreed to this exchange offer.
 
Strategic Alliances
Phoenix Bio Pharm is a biopharmaceutical company focused on the acquisition, development and manufacturing of key intellectual property relating to cannabinoid treatment methodologies and of medical delivery systems for the treatment and management of a wide variety of illness and conditions.

Industry Analysis
 The health, wellness and cannabinoid industries in the United States have been growing due to a substantial growth in the numbers of states approving the use of medical and adult-use marijuana and cannabinoid products. Additionally, in recent years, several internationally recognized medical journals and medical professionals including CNN’s chief medical correspondent, Dr. Sanjay Gupta, have published results relating to the use of cannabinoids in the treatment of cancer, childhood seizures, Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s disease, Multiple Sclerosis and pain management. This swell of interest in alternative health and wellness related to the use of cannabinoids is resulting in the establishment of new opportunities across many industries. Individual states have passed legislation for the regulation of medical and recreational use, but the lack of federal mandates has created some uncertainty in the industry.
Competitive Analysis
 The health, wellness and cannabinoid industries, specifically in states that have passed medicinal marijuana laws, are rapidly evolving and intensely competitive, and we expect that the competition will intensify in the future. Barriers to entry are minimal. We believe while we currently may have advantages in this market, the growth of this market is able to allow us to take a market share if we can raise sufficient funds to commence full-scale operations. We will compete on the basis of quality and value, whilst leveraging established brands and operators, and through customer preference. Our competitors may be well established, substantially larger and have substantially greater market recognition, greater resources and broader capabilities than we have. There can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors, and competitive pressures faced by the Company may have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.
