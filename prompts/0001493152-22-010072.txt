The Company
 
Overview
 
We are a mining company that was formed in Nevada on July 2, 2007. As a mining company, we are engaged in the production of precious metals. Our activities are not limited to production and they also include production, acquisition, exploration, and development of mineral properties, primarily for gold, from an owned mining property in Honduras. Until February 2020, Inception Mining had two projects, the UP and Burlington mine and the Clavo Rico mine, as further described below but since February 2020 all operations have been focused on the Clavo Rico mine. Our target properties are those that have been the subject of historical exploration. We have generated revenue and are generating revenue from mining operations.

Clavo Rico Mine
 
On October 2, 2015, the Company consummated a merger with Clavo Rico Ltd. (“Clavo Rico”). Clavo Rico is a privately held Turks and Caicos company with principal operations in Honduras, Central America. Clavo Rico operates the Clavo Rico mining concession through its subsidiaries Compañía Minera Cerros del Sur, S.A de C.V. and Compañía Minera Clavo Rico, S.A. de C.V. and holds other mining concessions. Its workings include several historical underground mining operations dating back to the early Mayan and Spanish occupation.
 
The Company’s primary mine is located on the 200-hectare Clavo Rico Concession, located in southern Honduras. This mine was originally explored and exploited in the 16th century by the Spanish, and more recently has been operated by Compañía Minera Cerros del Sur, S. de R.L. as a small family business. In 2003, Clavo Rico’s predecessor purchased a 20% interest and later increased its ownership to 99.9%. This company has since invested over five million dollars in the expansion and development of the mine and surrounding properties. Today, the Company operates this mine through exploration of surface-level material.
 
Mining operations begin by crushing extracted material to approximately 3/8-inch size pebbles, which is then mixed with additional material and loaded on the recovery pad for processing. The pebble material is sprinkled with a solution that leaches the gold from the rock, and the solution is collected and processed on-site at Clavo Rico’s own ADR plant. The doré bars that result from this process are shipped to the USA for refining.
 
During the COVID-19 pandemic, the mine had only been processing approximately less than 500 tons of extracted material per day. The current recovery operation has been sized to handle from 500 to 1000 tons of extracted material per day on a recovery bed that has the capacity to receive up to 750,000 tons of material. The Company commenced full operations on January 1, 2012 and believes that sufficiently high gold content ore bodies have been located and blocked out to load the leach pad to capacity by the end of December 31, 2022.
 
The Company has engaged in preliminary drilling of this area and the resulting assays of samples indicate that the material should have grades in the range of 0-5 grams of gold per ton.
 
COVID-19 - The challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic on the global economy increased significantly as the first quarter of 2020 progressed. COVID-19 has spread across the globe during 2020 and 2021 and is impacting economic activity worldwide. In response to COVID-19, national and local governments around the world have instituted certain measures, including travel bans, prohibitions on group events and gatherings, shutdowns of certain businesses, curfews, shelter-in-place orders and recommendations to practice social distancing. Based on management’s assessment as of December 31, 2021, the ultimate impact of COVID-19 on the Company’s business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows is dependent on future developments, including the duration of the pandemic and the related length of its impact on the global economy, which are uncertain and cannot be predicted at this time.
 
The Government of Honduras has suspended the national curfew as of October 1, 2021. Individuals remaining out of their homes after 10 PM are required to carry their COVID-19 vaccination cards documenting proof of vaccination. Bars, nightclubs, gyms, sports complexes, convention centers, theaters, and educational centers are prohibited from operation.
 
Competition and Mineral Prices
 
We compete with many companies in the mining business, including larger, more established mining companies with substantial capabilities, personnel and financial resources. There is a limited supply of desirable mineral lands available for claim-staking, lease or acquisition in the United States and other areas where we may conduct exploration activities. Because we compete with individuals and companies that have greater financial resources and larger technical staffs, we may be at a competitive disadvantage in acquiring desirable mineral properties. From time to time, specific properties or areas that would otherwise be attractive to us for exploration or acquisition are unavailable due to their previous acquisition by other companies or our lack of financial resources. Competition in the mining industry is not limited to the acquisition of mineral properties but also extends to the technical expertise to find, advance, and operate such properties; the labor to operate the properties; and the capital needed to fund the acquisition and operation of such properties. Competition may result in our company being unable not only to acquire desired properties, but to recruit or retain qualified employees, to obtain equipment and personnel to assist in our exploration activities or to acquire the capital necessary to fund our operation and advance our properties. Our inability to compete with other companies for these resources would have a material adverse effect on our results of operation and business. The mineral exploration industry is highly fragmented, and we are a very small participant in this sector. Many of our competitors explore for a variety of minerals and control many different properties around the world. Many of them have been in business longer than we have and have established strategic partnerships and relationships and have greater financial resources than we do.

There is significant competition for properties suitable for gold exploration. As a result, we may be unable to continue to acquire interests in attractive properties on terms that we consider acceptable. We will be subject to competition and unforeseen limited sources of supplies in the industry in the event spot shortages arise for supplies such as dynamite, and certain equipment such as drill rigs, bulldozers and excavators that we will need to conduct exploration. If we are unsuccessful in securing the products, equipment and services we need we may have to suspend our exploration plans until we are able to secure them.
 
Market for Gold
 
Wholesale purchasers for the gold we mine are readily available, as many purchasers of precious metals exist in the United States and abroad. Among the largest are Handy & Harman, Engelhard Industries and Johnson Matthey, Ltd. Historically, these markets are liquid and volatile. Wholesale purchase prices for precious metals can be affected by a number of factors, all of which are beyond our control, including but not limited to:

● | fluctuation in the supply of, demand, and market price for gold; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | mining activities of our competitors; 
● | sale or purchase of gold by central banks and for investment purposes by individuals and financial institutions; 
● | interest rates; 
● | currency exchange rates; 
● | inflation or deflation; 
● | fluctuation in the value of the United States dollar and other currencies; and 
● | political and economic conditions of major gold or other mineral-producing countries. 

 
If we find gold that is deemed of economic grade and in sufficient quantities to justify removal, we may seek additional capital through equity or debt financing to build a mine and processing facility, or enter into joint venture or other arrangements with large and more experienced companies better able to fund ongoing exploration and development work, or find some other entity to mine our property on our behalf, or sell or lease our rights to mine the gold. Upon mining, the ore would be processed through a series of steps that produces a rough concentrate. This rough concentrate is then sold to refiners and smelters for the value of the minerals that it contains, less the cost of further concentrating, refining, and smelting. Refiners and smelters then sell the gold on the open market through brokers who work for wholesalers including the major wholesalers listed above.
 
Compliance with Government Regulation
 
Mining Operations
 
CLAVO RICO (Honduras, Central America)
 
The mining operations in Honduras are governed by the national entities Honduran Institute of Geology and Mines (INHGEOMIN) and Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment (SERNA). The Clavo Rico mine has operated under a grandfathered concession granted many years ago and has now complied with all regulatory requirements of the above agencies and the recently adopted Honduran Mining laws (The General Mining Law was approved by Legislative Decree No. 238-2012, dated January 23, 2013), including employee health and safety regulations, Environmental requirements, water discharge requirements, and potential reclamation requirements. As the above ministries have only limited operational experience and the new mining law has only recently been adopted, the interpretation, adoption and enforcement of many regulations are evolving. Other local ordinances (municipality of El Corpus) minor and most regulatory efforts are as a result of interaction between the mine and the local populace, (examples include use of the mine haul road for local traffic, restricting mine operations to daylight hours for noise considerations, watering for dust control, etc.) where no regulation or law exists, we have attempted to duplicate best practices as required in other business climates.

These laws and regulations are continually changing and, as a general matter, are becoming more restrictive. Mining regulations in Honduras may be changed by the Honduran government and may be impacted by political or social changes. For instance, the recent 2022 election of a new president has resulted in increased regulation and scrutiny on the mining industry and especially on open pit mines such as the Clavo Rico mine. On March 3, 2022, the Company received a notice from the Secretary of Energy that declared exploitation permits cancelled and a moratorium on open-pit mining. The declaration has since been suspended by the Honduran government, and no restrictions on the Clavo Rico mine are currently in place, but changes to regulations could impact the Company’s operations negatively or even shut down operations altogether.
 
The Company’s policy is to conduct our business in a manner that safeguards public health and mitigates the environmental effects of our business activities. To comply with these laws and regulations, we have made, and in the future may be required to make, capital and operating expenditures.
 
Capital Equipment and Research & Development Expenditures
 
During the year ended December 31, 2021, we did not incur any expense related to research and development. Additionally, we are not currently conducting any research and development activities other than those relating to the possible acquisition of new gold and/or silver properties or projects of which there is no guarantee. As we proceed with our exploration programs, we may need to engage additional contractors and consider the possibility of adding additional permanent employees, as well as the possible purchase or lease of equipment.
Employees
 
As of the date of this filing, we currently employ one hundred and three (103) full-time employees and no temporary employees in the United States and Honduras. We have contracts with various independent contractors and consultants to fulfill additional needs, including investor relations, exploration, development, permitting, and other administrative functions, and may staff further with employees as we expand activities and bring new projects on line.
Patents, Trademarks, Licenses, Franchises, Concessions, Royalty Agreements or Labor Contracts
 
We do not currently own any patents or trademarks. Also, we are not a party to any license or franchise agreements, concessions, or labor contracts arising from any patents or trademarks, or any royalty agreements.
