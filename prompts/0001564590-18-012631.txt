Our Growth Strategy
 

We intend to grow our core business and expand into new markets and geographic regions. Our business resides at the nexus of several large market opportunities including the connected vehicle ecosystem, enterprise asset tracking, and fleet management product and services markets. We believe these market opportunities constitute a total available market (“TAM”) of approximately $30 billion. In order to capitalize on this TAM, we have devised the following key elements to our growth strategy:   
 Drive SaaS Applications Across Market Verticals. We are relentlessly pursuing our goal to grow our software and subscription services business. To accomplish this goal, we are focused on continued product innovation coupled with providing value-added cloud-based, service enablement solutions. We believe that our existing brand presence and customer base in market verticals such as transportation, construction, government and automotive aftermarket presents a significant growth opportunity for us to drive growth in our SaaS applications.   
 Create Innovative Solutions in the Emerging Connected Vehicle Market. With the acquisition of LoJack, we now have a highly recognizable, consumer-facing brand as well as strong and unique relationships with U.S. law enforcement agencies, auto dealerships, heavy equipment providers and global licensees. We plan to develop telematics applications for the connected vehicle market similar to our recently introduced solutions of LoJack SureDrive targeting the consumer telematics segment and LoJack LotSmart for automotive dealer inventory management solution. We plan to increase our investment in research and development to expand and enhance the features and capabilities of our products in the connected vehicle market. 
 Expand Presence in Industrial IoT. We believe that our current distribution footprint covers a significant portion of the global industrial telematics market due to our strong relationships with large enterprises such as Caterpillar. We believe there is an opportunity for us to leverage our core competencies of working with these global enterprises and expand our presence with other industrial Original Equipment Manufacturers (“OEMs”). 
 Continue Expansion into International Markets. We believe that we can leverage our existing customer relationships and access to the network of LoJack international licensees to further expand into global markets including Latin America, Europe and Asia Pacific. Our global expansion strategy is focused on countries with anticipated demand for our core telematics products coupled with our software and other services. 
 Create Opportunities to Monetize our Installed Base. We believe that our strong and growing install-base of over 7 million telematics devices using our cloud-based device management platform provides us with an opportunity to create additional revenue streams by delivering high value data sources and micro services to enterprises in large market verticals such as the connected vehicle ecosystem and automotive insurance industry.

Manufacturing and Operations
 
While the vast majority of our products are designed in the United States, we currently outsource a substantial portion of our manufacturing to certain contract manufacturers, which are located primarily in Hong Kong, mainland China, Malaysia and other Pacific Rim countries. Our electronic devices, components and made-to-order assemblies used in our products can be obtained from these manufacturers, although certain components are obtained from sole source suppliers. Although we do not have any long-term purchase contracts, we have executed product supply agreements with these manufacturers which provide for certain product quality requirements. We are not vertically integrated, which provides us with flexibility and an ability to adapt to changes in the market, product supply and pricing while keeping our fixed costs low. Our relationships with our manufacturers are critical to new product introduction and the success of our business. We have strong relationships with our manufacturers, helping us meet our supply and support requirements.
 
We focus on driving alignment of our product roadmaps with our manufacturers and determining what we can do collectively to reduce costs across the supply chain. Our operations team based in the United States coordinates with our manufacturers’ engineers and quality control personnel to develop the requisite manufacturing processes, quality checks and testing as well as general oversight of the manufacturing activities. We believe this model has allowed us to effectively deliver high quality and innovative products while enabling us to minimize costs, manage inventory risk and maintain flexibility. 
 
We are certified to the ISO (International Organization for Standardization) 9001: 2008 Quality management systems standard.
 Research and Development
 We compete in markets characterized by rapid technological change, evolving industry standards and new product features. We believe that our future success depends upon our ability to continue to develop innovative new products as well as enhancements to our existing products with advanced functionality and ease of use to drive customer demand and to further enhance our global brand. We will continue to focus our research and development resources primarily on developing telematics products and software solutions for fleet management, heavy equipment, stolen vehicle recovery, consumer aftermarket telematics, trailer & asset tracking, transportation & logistics, and industrial monitoring & controls applications. We have developed technology platforms that can be leveraged across many of our vertical markets, applications and geographic regions. These include cloud-based telematics application enablement platforms and end-user software applications, cellular and satellite communications network-based asset tracking units, as well as 3G and 4G LTE broadband router products for fixed and mobile applications. In addition, our development resources have been allocated to broadening existing product lines, reducing product costs, and improving performance through product redesign efforts.
 Research and development expenses in fiscal years ended February 28, 2018, 2017 and 2016 were $25.8 million, $22.0 million and $19.8 million, respectively. During this three-year period, our research and development expenses have ranged between 6% and 7% of annual consolidated revenues.
 Sales and Marketing
 
We market and sell our products and services through our global direct sales organization, an international network of licensees and sales representatives as well as our websites and digital presence.  Our global direct sales organization is comprised of teams of field sales people, key account managers and business development managers, who work closely with product and applications specialists and other internal sales support personnel based primarily at our U.S. locations.  We have organized our field sales personnel, together with internal sales support personnel, into teams within each business group based on their specialized knowledge and expertise relating to specific product and service areas, geographies and customer groups.  These sales teams are closely aligned with their respective product management, engineering and operations organizations.

We sell our products and services to large global enterprises, small to mid-size companies, channel accounts and distributors as well as industrial OEM customers.  These categories of customers require very different selling approaches and support requirements, and we have organized our sales teams to address these different requirements.  Additionally, certain customers often have unique technical requirements and manufacturing processes, and may request specific product configurations, feature sets and designs.  Sales to large enterprise customers often involve complex program management and long sales cycles, and require close cooperation between sales, operations and engineering personnel. As such, we have developed teams of key account managers and business development managers to serve the unique requirements of these customers.
 
We also actively sell our products in certain markets through our network of international licensees, independent sales representatives and distributors.  We have entered into agreements with substantially all of our licensees and distributors.  In some cases, we have granted representatives and distributors exclusive authorization to sell certain products in a specific geographic area.  These agreements generall
y have terms of one year which automatically renew on an annual basis, and are generally terminable by either party for convenience following a specified notice period.  
 We expect that our reputation for providing innovative and high-quality products will continue to play a significant role in our growth and success, and that the high customer satisfaction will continue to fuel referrals of our brand to new customers. Through our trademarked name – CalAmp – we have built a highly recognizable brand in the global enterprise asset tracking and fleet management market verticals. Also, in connection with the acquisition of LoJack, we acquired a highly recognizable consumer-facing brand in the global connected vehicle market. 
 In fiscal 2018, we embarked on an extensive brand refresh of the CalAmp and LoJack tradenames, which included a repositioning of both brands as well as a comprehensive communication and media outreach campaign. We expect this investment will enhance our brand awareness, continue to build brand equity and drive market demand for our products. We also redesigned our websites and digital presence by launching a new corporate and investor relations website for CalAmp and a consumer-facing website for LoJack in order to drive consumer traffic and engagement with our new products and services.  
 We will continue our investment in sales and marketing programs that further build brand awareness, drive deeper customer engagement and foster long-term relationships with our customers. Our marketing programs are now focused on supporting multi-channel product launches in new geographic markets including launching our LoJack Beyond campaign into the dealer channels nationwide. The LoJack Beyond campaign was launched in March 2018 in an effort to modernize the dealer-consumer engagement platform beyond legacy SVR-only products and to digitize the LoJack sales experience – both of which are expected to increase and track customer engagement and return on investment. 
 Additionally, we are focused on maximizing our efficiency and reach of our marketing spend by investing in social media and digital marketing programs. These programs are developed to educate our potential customers and fuel active engagement with our products and services. Our activities around social media and digital marketing will be aligned with our customary product launches, media campaigns and presence at tradeshows and high exposure venues such as Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, Spain and Mobile World Congress Americas in Los Angeles. 
 Our revenues derived from customers in the United States represented 72.6%, 74.0% and 83.0% of consolidated revenues in fiscal years ended February 28, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
 Competition
 Our markets are highly competitive. We face competition from small to large competitors some of which have greater financial, distribution, marketing and other resources as well as greater economies of scale than we do. We believe the principal competitive factors impacting the market for our products and services are global scale, innovation, reputation, customer service, product quality, functionality and reliability, time-to-market, responsiveness and price. We believe that we compete favorably in all of these areas. Our continued success in our vertical markets will depend in part upon our ability to continue to innovate, design quality products and deploy solutions at competitive prices and with superior support services to our customers.

Some of the more established competitors for telematics systems and related connected products include Danlaw, Guidepoint Systems, Mobile Devices, Orbcomm, Quake Global, Queclink, Sierra Wireless, Spireon, Teltonika, Xirgo. Additionally, the market for Software and Subscription Services is also highly competitive and include well-established companies such as Geotab, Octo Telematics, Omnitracs, OnStar, Trimble, Verizon Connect, Zonar Systems and ZTE as well as numerous small players.
 BACKLOG 
 Total backlog for our hardware products as of February 28, 2018 and 2017 was $38.4 million and $48.7 million, respectively. Substantially all of the backlog at February 28, 2018 is expected to be shipped in fiscal 2019.
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
 Intellectual property is an important aspect of our business, and we seek protection for our intellectual property as appropriate. We rely upon a combination of patent, trade secret, and trademark laws and contractual restrictions, such as confidentiality agreements and licenses, to establish and protect our proprietary rights. In addition, we often rely on inward licenses of intellectual property for use in our business. One approach to our risk management of patent infringement claims was to become a client of RPX Corporation (“RPX”). RPX helps companies reduce patent-related risks and expenses through its defensive patent aggregation, under which RPX acquires patents and licenses to patents that are being, or may be, asserted against its clients. The licenses for these patent assets are made available to RPX’s clients to protect them from potential patent infringement assertions.
 We own and utilize the tradenames “CalAmp” and “LoJack” as well as the related logos and trademarks on all of our products. We believe that having distinctive marks that are registered and readily identifiable is an important factor in identifying our brand. We own 198 active trademark applications and registrations throughout the world, with 12 pending and registered trademarks in the United States. 
 In addition to the foregoing protections, we generally control access to and the use of our proprietary and other confidential information through the use of internal and external controls, including contractual protections with employees, manufacturers, and others. We will continue to file and prosecute patent applications when appropriate to attempt to protect our rights in our proprietary technologies.  
 At February 28, 2018, we had 67 U.S. patents and 225 foreign patents. In addition to our awarded patents, we have 44 patent applications in process.
 EMPLOYEES
 At February 28, 2018, we had approximately 840 employees and approximately 60 contracted workers. None of our employees or contract workers are represented by a labor union. The contracted production workers are engaged through independent temporary labor agencies.
