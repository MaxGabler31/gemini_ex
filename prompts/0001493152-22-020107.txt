ITEM 1. BUSINESS
CORPORATE HISTORY
 
Earth Science Tech, Inc. (“ETST” or the “Company”) was incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on April 23, 2010 under the name Ultimate Novelty Sports Inc. The Company provided consulting services to the athletic facilities industry and offered a full range of consulting services, including start-up strategy development, membership pricing and management, operational analysis, marketing and public relations and staff training.
 
On May 6, 2010, the Company formed a wholly owned subsidiary, Ultimate Novelty Sports Inc., an Ontario, Canada Corporation (“UNSI Canada”). On October 30, 2013, pursuant to a sale of subsidiary agreement (the “Sale of Subsidiary Agreement”) the Company sold all of the capital stock of UNSI Canada to Optimal, Inc., a Nevada corporation.
 
On January 29, 2014, the Company entered into a consulting agreement with Pure Health, Inc. (“Pure”), a Puerto Rican corporation (the “Pure Consulting Agreement”). The purpose of the Pure Consulting Agreement was to retain Pure to consult the Company with regard to the development of health and wellness products as well as nutritional supplements, including idea generation, performing and designing formulations for products to be used in the health and nutrition market.
 
On March 6, 2014, the Company changed its name from Ultimate Novelty Sports, Inc. to Earth Science Tech, Inc. (the “Name Change”).
 
On May 28, 2014 the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (“FINRA”) approved the Name Change and a change of trading symbol from UNOV to ETST.
 
On June 6, 2014, the Company filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Nevada Articles of Amendment to the Articles of Incorporation and a Certificate of Designation creating a Preferred A class of stock with 10,000,000 preferred A shares (the “Preferred A Shares”) having a par value of $0.001 per share.
 
On March 6, 2015, the Company entered into a License and Distribution Agreement (the “I Vape License and Distribution Agreement”) with I Vape Vapor, Inc. a Minnesota corporation (“I Vape”). Pursuant to the I Vape License and Distribution Agreement the Company licensed to I Vape the rights to use the Company’s Ultra-High Grade CBD Rich Hemp Oil in I Vape’s E-Cigarettes within the U.S. As part of the I Vape License and Distribution Agreement, the Company formed Earth Science Tech Vapor One, Inc., a wholly owned Florida corporation subsidiary.
 
Today, ETST is a biotechnology company focused on unique nutraceuticals and bioceuticals designed to excel in industries such as health, wellness, nutrition, supplements, cosmetics and alternative medicine to improve the quality of life for consumers worldwide.

On January 11, 2019, the Company entered into an agreement with Aaron Decker, and Derrick West, individuals, pursuant to which the Company will transfer, set over and assign to Mr. Decker and Mr. West 95% of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock of Kannabidioid, Inc. This transfer of KBD and its business places Mr. Decker and Mr. West or their corporate nominee in full control of KBD for all purposes, subject to their undertaking aggressively and assiduously to pursue the growth of Kannabidioid, Inc.’s business and to maximize its customer base, product line, and profitability. ETST entered into this agreement because management determined that the opportunities for the growth of its other product lines will require that it deploy its resources on these other product lines such that it’s better to allow another management team to build the KBD business. In allowing another management team to build the KBD business, it is expected that ETST will not only continue to benefit from the sales, but it may also be in a position to benefit from its growth without the necessity of deploying additional resources to realize that growth.
 
On January 9, 2019, the Company received notice that Strongbow Advisors, Inc. (“Strongbow”), and Robert Stevens (“Stevens”) (Stevens and Strongbow, each or collectively, the “Receiver”) had been appointed by the Nevada District Court, as Receiver for the Registrant in Case No. A-18-784952-C.
 
The Board of Directors of the Company along with certain other creditors and a majority of the shareholders sought the appointment of the Receiver after finding the Company in imminent danger of losing all of its assets by levy and garnishment to Cromogen Biotechnology Corporation (“Cromogen”), following the issuance by an arbitration panel of an award (the “Award”) in the sum of $3,994,522.50 in favor of Cromogen and the subsequent judicial confirmation of that award, in the matter entitled Cromogen Biotechnology Corporation vs. Earth Science Tech, Inc. (the “Cromogen Litigation”).
 
The Award consisted of a sum for breach of contract against the Company in the amount of $120,265.00, a sum for costs and fees against the Company in the amount of $111,057.00 and a sum for the claim of tortuous interference and conversion against the Company in the amount of $3,763,200.00. The District Court in Florida had confirmed the Award granted by the arbitration panel, denying however, the award of fees that the arbitration panel had granted Cromogen.
 
The Cromogen Litigation was appealed and the Company was optimistic about its prospects on appeal because of blatant mathematical errors present in the panel’s damage calculations along with its arbitrary and unsupportable basis for determining “lost profits” when all of the evidence that Cromogen provided failed to show that Cromogen had ever been profitable. Further, the relevant precedent case law suggested that “tort claims” would be outside of the purview of the agreement the Company had with Cromogen. Nevertheless, faced with such a large judgment and the imminent danger of insolvency, the Company determined that it was in the best interest of its shareholders and creditors to seek protection under receivership and the appointment of a receiver and on January 9, 2019 Robert L. Stevens and Strongbow Advisors, Inc. (“Stevens” and “Strongbow,” respectively )was/were appointed by the Nevada District Court as Receiver.
 
As part of the impact of the receivership, the Court issued a Writ of Injunction or “Blanket Stay” covering the Company and its assets during the time that the Company is in receivership. As a result of the “Blanket Stay” the Company’s estate is protected from creditors and interference with its administration is prevented while the Company’s financial issues are being fully analyzed and resolved. As part of this process, creditors were notified and required to provide claims in writing under oath on or before the deadline stated in the notice provided by the Receiver and any claimant that did not provide their claims in writing have been barred from collecting under NRS §78.675. The Blanket Stay will remain in place unless otherwise waived by the Receiver, or it is vacated by the Court or alternatively, lifted by the Court, upon a “motion to lift stay” duly made and approved by the Nevada District Court.
 
The appointment of the Receiver was approved unanimously by the Board of Directors and by a majority of the Company’s shareholders. Strongbow and Stevens were selected because of the representations Stevens made regarding his history and philosophy of helping (i) companies restructure and (ii) to execute on their business plans, albeit under a debt and capital structure that allows them to succeed. Stevens and Strongbow represented to the Company’s Board of Directors, management, certain secured creditors and major shareholders that they assist companies by helping them raise the capital needed not only to pay debts, but build and grow their businesses. The Receiver, however, is an agent of the court, and required to act in a manner that is independent and neutral in managing the Company’s operations and in trying to preserve the Company’s value for the creditors and shareholders.

There are a number of possible outcomes to the receivership, including settlement and payment to creditors, reorganization, or liquidation. The intent of the Receiver is to reorganize the Company, pay or settle the Company’s debts and emerge from receivership. If the Receiver is not successful in mitigating the Company’s liabilities, the Company’s results could be materially adversely impacted and the Company may be forced to liquidate its business.
 
On February 28, 2019, the Company entered into an Equity Financing Agreement (the “GHS Equity Financing Agreement”) and Registration Rights Agreement (the “GHS Registration Rights Agreement”) with GHS Investments LLC, a Nevada limited liability company (“GHS”). Under the terms of the Equity Financing Agreement, GHS agreed to provide the Company with up to $5,000,000 upon effectiveness of a registration statement on Form S-1 (the “Registration Statement”) filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “Commission”).
 
Following effectiveness of the Registration Statement, the Company had the discretion to deliver puts to GHS and GHS was obligated to purchase shares of the Company’s common stock, par value $0.001 per share based on the investment amount specified in each put notice. Additionally, in accordance with the Equity Financing Agreement, the Company issued GHS a promissory note in the principal amount of $30,000 to offset transaction costs (the “Note”).
 
On November 8, 2019, the Receiver for the Company filed a motion for preliminary injunction against Majorca Group Ltd. in the 8th Judicial District in Clark County, Nevada on November 7, 2019. The filing requested a show cause hearing whereby the Company was requesting the Court grant it motion to cancel certain shares and class of stock and to nullify certain amendments of the Articles of Incorporation. Specifically, the Company asked that Majorca Group Ltd. be restricted from selling, transferring, converting, encumbering, hypothecating, obtaining loans against or in any fashion or in any way transferring their shares of common and preferred stock in the Company. Additionally, the motion sought a Freezing Injunction over any broker, bank, any financial institution, attorney, or agent holding shares of the Company as well as any proceeds from shares of the Company.
 
On January 27, 2020 Earth Science Tech, Inc., a Nevada corporation (the “Company”) reached a confidential settlement with Majorca Group, Ltd (“Majorca”). The Receiver was to withdraw its motion for injunction over the Majorca common and preferred shares. Under the terms of the Settlement Agreement, Majorca Group, Ltd. returned 18,000,000 common shares and 5,200,000 Series A Preferred Stock held by Majorca for cancellation. The Receiver represented to management that he intended to reissue the Series A Preferred Stock to Mr. Tabraue, the Company’s President, however in subsequent filings with the Commission he stated that the Series A Preferred Stock class would be cancelled completely and, as discussed herein, with the recent discharge and removal of Stevens and Strongbow and their replacement by the Nevada District Court with William Leonard, this issue remains unresolved at this time. The remaining 6,520,000 common shares held by Majorca is subject to lockup agreement and thereafter, sales are made pursuant to a 10b5 plan on file with a broker dealer.
 
On January 19, 2021, one of the Company’s largest shareholders served and filed a notice of motion and motion to intervene against Robert L. Stevens and Strongbow Advisors, Inc. (individually or collectively referred to as “Receiver”) that was later joined by additional shareholders representing approximately 33% of the issued and outstanding shares of the Company at that time. This motion to intervene, at its heart, was based upon and resulted from, what the interveners saw as, a lack of transparency by the Receiver. What was filed was initially based upon concerns over Mr. Stevens’ lack of transparency. However, as the matter progressed in court, additional concerns have arisen and on August 27, 2021, Stevens and Strongbow were discharged and removed and William Leonard was appointed to replace them as Receiver, by the Nevada District Court.

The matter arose after management had identified an attractive acquisition candidate for which a share exchange was being proposed that would have resulted in it becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. The target company understandably did not wish to enter into a transaction of this nature while the Company remained in receivership and needed to know what legacy issues were left to be addressed. In order to proceed and delineate a path out of receivership for the acquisition target to consider a transaction with the Company, it was first necessary to know what the outstanding administrative and other liabilities were, and then to develop a plan to address them, whether it be by raising capital to pay them off, issuing shares in exchange or by mutual agreement with the creditors’ to reduce the amount that they were due or a combination of all three. After continually requesting this information without success, the Company’s President engaged counsel personally to help him. This was marginally successful and in November of 2020, the Receiver provided invoices through February, 2020. However, this left nine months of potentially billable time that remained unaccounted for in any definitive way. What was requested were the amounts that were included in the Company’s books and records (that portion of the liabilities attributable to the administration of the receivership estate) through the last quarterly filing and the period of time since that filing to the current date. Management, understanding that it would be necessary to address all potential liabilities in order to be able to begin negotiating terms of a stock-based acquisition also recognized that the same was true in order to emerge from receivership. It was clear that the Company could not hope to exit receivership unless and until these potential liabilities were addressed and that it was an absolute necessity to have this information in order to structure a transaction with an acquisition target.
 
The Company has executed a joint letter of intent with three entities involved in the durable medical equipment, retail sales and compounding pharmacy businesses with the objective of negotiating the final terms of a transaction that will result in the Company’s acquisition of these entities.
 
On or about November 3, 2021 the Company entered into an agreement for the purchase of RxCompoundStore.com, LLC and Peaks Curative, LLC through the purchase of 100% of the outstanding equity securities both entities. Under the terms of the transaction, the Seller agreed to exchange one Hundred (100) RxCompound Units and One Hundred (100) Peaks Units in exchange for 3,000,000 shares of the Company’s common stock together with $300,000 in cash. The transaction is structured in a way that allows the Buyer to raise the $300,000 cash component of the purchase price over time as it seeks and received additional funding. The cash component is managed separately, and under the terms of the Agreement, $0.50 of every $1.00 raised by the Company shall be held in escrow until the full $300,000 can be paid in full (unless the Seller waives and postpones the right to immediate payment as the Company is raising capital) at which time the parties will officially close the acquisition. The Company has until 12/31/2022 to raise the funds required to close the transaction. In addition to the Buyer’s payment of $300,000 as a condition to Closing, the Seller has its own deliverables that are conditions to Closing. For example, the Seller is required to deliver an audit that will allow the Company to prepare and file a current report on Form 8-K, there is also an Small Business Administration (“SBA”) loan that the Seller personally guaranteed that is secured by the assets of RXC, prior to Closing on the acquisition of RXC and PCL, the Seller will either be required to pay the loan off or the Company will need to consent if the change in ownership of RXC and PCL following Closing and if the SBA does not approve a change of control or if the terms, as they exist, will be detrimental to the Company existing loan agreements or collateral or if SBA requires changes to the loan agreement that has a negative impact on the Company, then the Seller would need to pay off and retire the SBA loan prior to Closing if the Company does not agree to proceed to Closing because of the negative impact the loan would have on the Company.
 
BUSINESS BACKGROUND AND OVERVIEW
 
Prior to and while the Company was initially in receivership it has held the position as offering some of the highest-grade full spectrum cannabinoid oil on the market. There are positive results in studies on breast cancer and immune cells conducted through the University of Central Oklahoma, in addition to studies through DV Biologics that prove the Company’s CBD oil formulation lowers cortisol and functions as a neuro-protectant, with positive results in case studies through key health organizations. ETST was successful in the CBD market as it formulated, marketed and distributed the CBD oil used for its studies to the public, offering what it believed to be the most effective quality CBD on the market.
 
When the Company entered into receivership, it was with the understanding that management would be allowed to continue with its operations as they had been conducted (operations that had led to continually increasing sales prior to receivership), however what transpired in practice was different and led to a divergence between what management believed was in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders and what the Receiver was willing to allow.

The Receiver entered into a financing agreement with GHS Investments, LLC that involved the filing of a Registration Statement on Form S-1 for the Company. Management understood that the Receiver was filing the S-1 so that it could increase its sales / earnings so that it would be in a position to pay any claims and costs of the receivership out of a larger base of earnings rather than simply using proceeds from the S-1 to cover the administrative costs of receivership. The filing of this S-1 meant that the Company was in a “quiet period” from the time of filing until the U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission (“SEC” or “Commission”) declared it “effective.” During the quiet period the Company needed to be extremely careful in any of its press releases to keep strictly to facts in order to avoid potential claims by the SEC that the Company was “conditioning the market.” Initially, the Receiver was unwilling to allow management to raise the additional funds needed while the Company remained in the quiet period. However, the quiet period itself, also made it very difficult for the Company to raise the capital needed, particularly given the length of time it took for the S-1 to be declared effective. This was capital that was needed to not only meet its litigation costs for the Cromogen matter but also to cover the added expenses of receivership, which were substantial. This, in turn, left less and less capital available for advertising, sales personnel and new inventory; and as a result, sales began a steady decline. The Form S-1 was filed in March of 2019 and after 6 months it was still not effective so the Receiver asked the attorney that had originally worked with the Company to take over and it was declared effective approximately 6 weeks later. However, by that time, the Company’s sales were also declining because there were not funds available to pay for additional inventory and by this time both the price of the Company’s common stock and its trading volume had also diminished significantly. This compounded the issue because of the way that the financing was structured, the financing agreement had the amount of funds available in tranches based upon the recent price and volume levels and as a result of both declining through the quiet period and the length of the quiet period, the Company didn’t have the amounts available to it in tranches that it would have had when the S-1 was first filed. Nevertheless, even with a modest amount available from the first tranche, management presented the Receiver with a “use of funds” that involved spending on advertising, marketing, developing wider brand recognition and much needed inventory. It was designed to, and management believed would, not only help increase sales but also be well received in the market, which in turn, would have increased the funds available to the Company under subsequent tranches of financing. The Receiver was not willing to allow management to execute on its planned use of funds, instead giving instructions to sell more of certain items that were still in inventory, and refusing to order other items.
 
The Company was in need of additional financing however and without knowing what the total administrative liabilities were, management recognized that it would be unable to move forward, either out of receivership or in pursuing an acquisition or both. Further without a clear plan to exit receivership, investors were too apprehensive to consider investing in the Company. However, assuming that financing was not an issue facing the Company, after emerging from receivership, the process of rebuilding its CBD sales would be a time-consuming process that would require the additional capital to cover overhead costs while Sales were rebuilt. This prompted management to begin looking for alternatives to build shareholder value at a rate that avoids lengthy periods of losses while rebuilding critical mass in its CBD sales. After evaluating certain alternatives, management determined that the best course of action to avoid the negative impact that a period of losses would have would be best accomplished through strategic acquisitions. That is, acquisitions that would bring in substantial revenue and earnings.
 
Ultimately in mid-2020, an acquisition candidate that was in a related business was identified that had worldwide brand recognition however, it was still not going to be possible to structure an acquisition until all of the administrative liabilities of the receivership had been determined / verified, accepted/approved and any plan necessary to manage them had been adopted.. The target company understandably did not wish to enter into a transaction of this nature while the Company remained in receivership and needed to know what legacy issues were left to be addressed. In order to proceed and delineate a path out of receivership for the acquisition target to consider a transaction with the Company, it was first necessary to know what the outstanding administrative and other liabilities were, and then to develop a plan to address them, whether it be by raising capital to pay them off, issuing shares in exchange or by mutual agreement with the creditors’ to reduce the amount that they were due or a combination of all three.
 
After months of requesting the total amount of outstanding administrative and other liabilities from the Receiver and finally with the assistance of independent legal counsel, the Company’s President still had only been able to gather information through February 2020. This was insufficient and not only meant that the Receiver did not have a reorganization plan and path for the Company to emerge from receivership, but it also meant that the Company was not going to be able to benefit from a particularly promising acquisition opportunity that had been presented. Further, without a plan to emerge from receivership or any indication how much of any funds that might be secured for the Company, would be used to advance revenue producing activities or to pay old liabilities, management was unwilling to ask investors to make additional investments in the Company. Then when discussing the need for funding to ensure that the Company could continue trading on OTC Markets as a fully reporting company under the Exchange Act, on January 19, 2021 one of the Company’s largest shareholders decided to intervene and commence the litigation against the Receiver by way of a notice of motion and motion to intervene.

On January 19, 2021, one of the Company’s largest shareholders served and filed a notice of motion and motion to intervene against Robert L. Stevens and Strongbow Advisors, Inc. (individually or collectively referred to as “Receiver”) this action was later joined by additional shareholders representing approximately 33% of the issued and outstanding shares of the Company at that time. This motion to intervene, at its heart, was based upon and resulted from, what the interveners saw as, a lack of transparency by the Receiver. What was filed was initially based upon concerns of Mr. Stevens’ lack of transparency. However, as the matter progressed in court, additional concerns have arisen and on August 27, 2021, Stevens and Strongbow were discharged and removed and William Leonard was appointed to replace them as Receiver, by the Nevada District Court. Mr. Leonard is currently reviewing various matters, including past invoices presented by Stevens, as well as his conduct during the time he acted as Receiver for the Company as well as others that the prior Receiver had a prior relationship with that have derived benefits from working with the prior Receiver. The outcome of this review is uncertain at this time and a wide number of outcomes is possible.
 
The Company is now optimistic that it will be able to emerge from receivership under the new receiver, in a reorganized position that will allow it to proceed with the acquisitions of the three entities. Combined, these entities present a larger opportunity to realize the synergies that they have among themselves and in so doing, the Company believes it will be possible for shareholder value to increase at a faster rate than would otherwise be possible with only its CBD business and licensing of its medical device, Hygee, The Company has executed a joint letter of intent with three entities involved in the durable medical equipment, retail sales and compounding pharmacy businesses with the objective of negotiating the final terms of a transaction that will result in the Company’s acquisition of these entities.
 
On or about November 3, 2021 the Company entered into an agreement for the purchase of RxCompoundStore.com, LLC and Peaks Curative, LLC through the purchase of 100% of the outstanding equity securities both entities.

(“RXC”) is a compounding pharmacy licensed in the States of New York and Florida and registered with the Drug Enforcement Agency (“DEA”) to sell Schedules II and III controlled medications. RXC has focused on men’s health, specifically medical products directed at treating erectile dysfunction (“ED”) such as Tadalafil, and Sildenafil Citrate (generic names for Cialis and Viagra, respectively) and others, compounded into capsules, tablets. Its flagship product(s) are based on a proprietary formulation for men’s ED medications in the form of gummies. Currently RXC is not certified for and does not have sterile facilities that would allow it to offer medications that can be injected such as testosterone, HCG, TriMix or peptides. However, it had already planned on becoming a sterile compounding pharmacy and was working toward it when the Company entered into the definitive agreement to acquire RXC and PCL. The timing was ideal because management believes the Company was able to acquire RXC for significantly less than it would have been valued at if it already had a sterile certified facility built and in operation. However, RXC is close to that point and having the plan and path established and ready to implement, the time required to build and have the sterile facility certified will be substantially shorter than it would have been when RXC first began exploring the various requirements. RXC will work with Peaks Curative, LLC. to fill prescriptions for the customers that Peaks refers. RXC will be able to expand by seeking licenses as a pharmacy in additional states and plans to work with Peaks in determining which states represent the opportunities and in order of priority.
 
Peaks Curative, LLC. (“PCL”) was established as a marketing company initially to market men’s ED products directly to potential patients, however the Company plans to expand the products offered to include those that RXC can prepare and sell. PCL is what is known as a “telemedicine referral site” facilitating asynchronous consultations for branded compound medications prepared at RXC. For Example, men that respond to ads for ED gummies are referred to licensed medical professionals who determine eligibility by questionnaires completed by the prospective patient. By the answers provided, the doctor determines if the prospective patient can safely take the medication and meet that he meets the requirements. Having determined that he meets the requirements and can safely use the medication, the doctor will then send in a prescription to RXC, who, in turn will fill and send the gummies or other medication to the customer/patient. Since RXC is only licensed in Florida and New York, PCL will not target its marketing efforts in other states unless it establishes a referring relationship with pharmacies in other states where RXC does not intend to seek licensure as a compounding pharmacy. As RXC expands the products it wants to focus on, PCL will develop campaigns to drive sales for those products.
 
Shortly after entering into the purchase agreement with RxCompoundstore.com and Peaks Curative, the Company shifted from formulating and selling CBD products to formulating pharmaceutical products and topicals for sale through its accounts and the telemedicine platform of Peaks Curative. The Company anticipates launching Peaks Curative by the period ending June 30, 2022. The Company will design and produce enhanced pharmaceutical compounded products through RxCompoundStore.com, LLC to distribute through its physician ordered accounts, along with generic erectile dysfunction and other sexual health prescription items through Peaks Curative. The Company intends to create and provide high quality prescription products for its physician accounts, while offering unique ED and sexual enhancement products through its telemedicine platform.
 
The Company plans to offer a wide selection of health and nutrition products online and through clinics and pharmacies. In particular, the Company intends to continue with its plans to move its compounding pharmacy to a larger facility thereby positioning itself to maximize efficiencies once the telemedicine platform is launched. In addition to the larger facility, the Company plans to build a sterile facility so that injectable products may be compounded and sold. Our current product selection includes many high-quality ingredients to formulate and fulfill prescriptions when ordered, and includes its proprietary Tadalafil Gummies.
 
Earth Science Foundation (“ESF”) is a favored entity of ETST, effectively being a non-profit organization on February 11, 2019 and is structured to accept grants and donations to those in need.

Current Operations
 
CORPORATE STRATEGY
 
ETST has changed its immediate focus from researching and developing innovative hemp extracts and making them accessible worldwide; with plans to be a supplier of high-quality hemp oil enriched with high-grade CBD. Its primary goal had been to advance different high quality hemp extracts with a broad profile of cannabinoids and additional natural molecules found in industrial hemp and to identify their distinct properties. Initially our missions were to educate the public on the many and varied nutritional and health benefits of CBD-rich hemp oil, to optimize purity in formulation, and to find new product delivery systems. With the decline in CBD sales due to the factors described above, we determined that the most efficient means to increase shareholder value would be the acquisition of a complimentary business that would bring revenues sufficient to support its own operations but that would allow the business to expand and for the Company to rebuild its CBD business. The Company determined that the most efficient means to increase shareholder value was the acquisition of a complimentary business that would bring revenues sufficient to support its own operations, which would also allow the business to expand and for the Company to rebuild its CBD business. The opportunity that the Company is currently pursuing is the acquisition of JCR Medical Equipment, Inc. together with RxCompoundStore.com, LLC. and Peaks Curative, LLC. The acquisition of all three businesses would give the Company the ability to cross-sell among the businesses, as well as our current customers. There are also some opportunities that the Company identified with these companies that have reached an inflection point with revenue that allocating minimal incremental expenses in certain product offerings should result in more significant increases in revenue and earnings. The corporate strategy currently is to develop the acquisition plan, structure and terms while the Company’s receivership is wound down so that when it emerges from receivership, it is in a position to execute on the planned acquisitions. As the Company assimilates the new businesses into its operations, it plans to work to raise additional capital necessary to expand on the existing operations and to capitalize on their synergistic opportunities that provide the greatest immediate return on investment (i.e., “picking the low hanging fruit”), then to continue capitalizing on the opportunities among the companies. Finally, it plans to license its Hygee product to a third party, if it is able to negotiate terms that are acceptable.
 
To offer a wide selection of health and nutrition products through online, clinics, pharmacies, and in-store retail. Through the pending acquisitions to become wholly owned subsidiaries, the Company plans to continue expanding retail sales of pharmaceutical, nutritional supplements through online, clinics, and in-store sales. With the acquisition of the compounding pharmacy, the Company will focus on men’s health as well as other areas. In particular, the Company plans to continue with plans to build a sterile facility so that injectable products may be compounded and sold. Our current product selection includes prescription-based products including both sildenafil and tadalafil in capsule form, tadalafil in gummy form, and any non-sterile prescription through RxCompoundStore.com, LLC.
 
CONSUMER PRODUCTS
 
We seek to take advantage of an emerging worldwide trend to re-energize the production of hemp and to foster its many uses for consumers. Historically cultivated for industrial and practical purposes, hemp is used today for textiles, paper, auto parts, biofuel, cosmetics, animal feed, nutritional supplements, and much more. The market for hemp-based products is expected to increase substantially over the next five years.
 
Hemp-based CBD is one of at least 80 cannabinoids found in hemp, and is non-psychoactive. Our U.S. based operations oversee our raw material supply chain, raw material processing, product development and manufacturing, and sales and marketing. We will continue to scale-up our processing capability to accommodate new products in our pipeline.
 
We expect to realize revenue to fund our working capital needs through the sale of finished products and raw materials to third parties. However, in order to fund our drug development efforts, we will need to raise additional capital either through the issuance of equity and/or the issuance of debt. In the event we are unable to raise sufficient additional capital to fund our drug development efforts, we may need to curtail or delay such activity.
 
Consumer product extraction and quality - CBD
 
We believe our high-grade CBD-rich hemp oil contains the high-quality natural CBD because it’s formulated using a wide array of cutting-edge technologies, including super critical extraction process (CO 2), isolation, and micron filtration. Super critical extraction is a gentle approach and the key method in the extraction of our CBD. The method exploits the fact that CO 2 at low temperature and under high pressure becomes liquid and thereby draws the cannabinoids and terpenes from the plant material. Using state-of-the-art equipment, carbon dioxide (CO 2) is compressed to upwards of 10,000 psi. At these extremes CO 2 becomes ‘super critical’ where it retains the properties of both a liquid and a gas at the same time. The cold temperature does not damage any heat-sensitive nutrients like vitamins or enzymes. When the super critical fluid is added to the nutrient-rich hemp it releases the phytonutrients. The CO 2 is then free and recycled, leaving a concentrated and pure extract that we believe is more easily digested. These low temperatures thru the extraction process preserve a broad spectrum of valuable and beneficial molecules that are often lost using other extraction methods. This gentle method permits the production of a purer form of CBD-rich hemp oil while conserving other valuable and beneficial molecules that are originally contained in the hemp plant. We believe that there are over 400 phytonutrients that exist in hemp plants.
 
Our CBD-rich hemp oil does not contain any synthetic cannabinoids and is not an isolate. It contains everything that is naturally occurring in the original industrial hemp plant. With our high-quality CBD-rich hemp oil you benefit from the natural interaction of phytonutrients in their balanced wide-ranging form that may offer the most benefit for overall wellness. Our commercialized CBD based product line, High Grade Full Spectrum Cannabinoids, offers 7 distinct cannabinoids maximizing all the therapeutic benefits the industrial hemp plant has to offer.

Other competitors and companies may use certain methods for extracting hemp including toxic solvents and/or high heat which we believe are unsustainable, dangerous and don’t extract the full balance of nutrients from the industrial hemp plant. One of the most popular processes used to extract hemp oils is alcohol extraction, due to its simplicity and low costs. This may lead to a product that still contains trace amounts of alcohol, as it can be difficult to separate out after extraction. The alcohol extraction used by other companies and our competitors requires the hemp and alcohol mixture to be boiled for long periods of time, potentially damaging sensitive nutrients and important components of the oil. Most companies that claim to be full spectrum only contain 2-5 cannabinoids compared to the 7 we offer in our commercialized batches.
 
Our CBD-rich hemp oil is sourced from the high-quality industrial hemp plants grown by generational family farmers. In order to produce consistent and nutritious CBD-rich oils, these hemp plants are grown domestically currently in Oregon and Kentucky.
 
We lab test our hemp oil multiple times during the manufacturing process, from seed to shelf. This includes being tested for cannabinoid panel content, terpenoids, pesticides, residual solvents, mycotoxins, and micros.
 
SUBSIDIARIES
 
The Company’s’ subsidiaries include Earth Science Tech Inc. and Earth Science Foundation, Inc. (all intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated on consolidation). Provided that we are currently in escrow stages to acquire RxCompoundStore.com, LLC. and Peaks Curative, LLC., once closed, both entrees will be wholly owned under the Company, (See Note 4, Related Party and Transaction). On September 24, 2021 Nutrition Empire, LLC. Cannabis Therapeutics, Inc., Earth Science Pharmaceutical, Inc., and Kannabidioid, Inc. were dissolved and inactive to focus on the Company’s new direction, (See Part I, Corporate Strategy).
PRODUCT REGULATION
 
We are subject to local and federal laws in our operating jurisdictions. We hold required licenses for product production and distribution and monitor changes in laws, regulations, treaties and agreements.
 
The Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018 known as the “2018 Farm Bill” is United States federal legislation signed into law on December 20, 2018 which provides much of the legal framework for the hemp-based CBD product category. The 2018 Farm Bill permanently removed “hemp” from the purview of the Controlled Substances Act, and accordingly, the Drug Enforcement Administration (the “DEA”) no longer has any claim to interfere with the interstate commerce of hemp products. Some of the immediate impact from this legislation includes the ability for farmers to access crop insurance and U.S. Department of Agriculture programs for certification and competitive grants. While the DEA is now officially not involved in hemp regulation, the FDA retains its authority to regulate ingestible and topical products, including those that contain hemp and hemp extracts such as CBD.
 
A range of federal regulations govern our product development, manufacturing, distribution, sales and marketing, including the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994 (the “DSHEA”). Under DSHEA, supplements are effectively regulated by the FDA for Good Manufacturing Practices under 21 CFR Part 111. DSHEA defines a “dietary supplement” as a product intended to supplement the diet that contains one or more of the following: (a) a vitamin; (b) a mineral; (c) an herb or other botanical; (d) an amino acid; (e) a dietary substance for use by man to supplement the diet by increasing the total dietary intake; or (f) a concentrate, metabolite, constituent, extract, or combination of any ingredient described in clause (a) through (e). Thus, the law permits a wide range of dietary ingredients in dietary supplements, including CBD which is an extract of a botanical ( Cannabis sativa L. plant). CBD also falls under clause (e) as it is a dietary substance for use by man to supplement the diet by increasing the total dietary intake.
 
MARKETS
 
The user market for CBD products and other nutraceuticals is generally an individual who has a specific health issue where a health advisor or distributor has provided or directed that user to our product. The market for nutraceuticals is subject to many influential factors, but the main issues affecting the market are consumer spending and government regulation.

COMPETITION
 
The nutraceutical industry is subject to significant competition and pricing pressures. We may experience significant competitive pricing pressures as well as competitive products. Several significant competitors may offer products with prices that may match or are lower than ours. We believe that the products we offer are generally competitive with those offered by other supplement and nutraceutical companies; however, we believe that our products are unique and will set themselves apart from competing products. It is possible that one or more of our competitors could develop a significant research advantage over us that allows them to provide superior products or pricing, which could put us at a competitive disadvantage. Continued pricing pressure or improvements in research and shifts in customer preferences away from natural supplements could adversely impact our customer base or pricing structure and have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
 
Research and development costs are expensed as incurred. The Company’s research and development expenses relate to its engineering activities, which consist of the design and development of new products for specific customers, as well as the design and engineering of new or redesigned products for the industry in general.
