RESOURCES OF THE BUSINESS
Human Capital Management
Our people are one of our greatest assets. Our skilled and dedicated employees around the globe are committed to the highest performance standards and achieving consistent, sustainable profitable growth. At December 31, 2021, the Company had approximately 5,100 employees worldwide. Approximately 20% were in the Asia-Pacific region, 40% in the Europe, Middle East and Africa region and 40% in the Americas region. 
The Company maintains a global Health, Safety and Environmental Affairs ("HSE") program which focuses on employee safety throughout the enterprise. Our HSE program maintains a set of HSE standards, consistent with our commitment to worker health and safety and to environmental protection, as well as with prevailing regulatory frameworks in place around the globe. All locations are required to meet local laws and regulations, or the HSE Standards, whichever are more stringent. We measure and monitor results using standard protocols, which are communicated to the senior leadership team and Board of Directors on a regular basis.
With the safety of our employees as our priority, we continuously focus on proactive risk identification and mitigation with emphasis on “practicing safety.” Employee health and safety remained center stage in 2021 as we continued to implement preventive measures and controls with the goal of protecting our employees and keeping our operations running safely. 
The Company’s long history is grounded in its core values and principles which have guided our ongoing transformation and growth. Our Company Values promote a culture of collaboration, empowerment, diversity and inclusion, and an environment providing opportunity, dignity and respect for all of our employees. Grounded in these values and as an integral part of BES, we manage human capital through our Talent Management System ("TMS"). TMS integrates our key human resource processes and tools to facilitate talent management decisions and enables the Company to have the right people with the right skills in the right roles at the right time. TMS enhances our ability to attract and hire talented employees, as well as supports their growth, development and engagement - empowering them to perform at their very best, every day. Aligned with our vision, TMS helps accelerate the ongoing transformation of our Company, to drive business performance, and support the successful execution of the Company’s growth strategy.
The TMS framework focuses on five key areas (pillars) - Attract, Perform, Develop, Engage and Recognize – all supported by tools and processes that our employees, managers and leaders can use to support their own professional growth and development, as well as leverage to make better talent management decisions that promote and cultivate an agile and high performance organization.
Attract – encompasses the processes and tools available to employees and management that support and facilitates the planning and effective recruiting, hiring and on-boarding of our employees. 
Perform – highlights the processes and tools that help our employees fully leverage and utilize their skills and capabilities to perform at their best and contribute meaningfully to achieving the goals and objectives of the business. 
Develop – comprises the Human Resource processes and tools that support the growth and development of our employees through on-going training, skill-building, assessment, career planning and development and enrichment opportunities.
Engage – contains Human Resource programs and tools that support employee engagement and involvement across the Company and in the communities in which our employees work and live.
Recognize – aligned with our “pay-for-performance” philosophy, highlights Human Resource processes and programs used to recognize and reward our employees and facilitate their on-going engagement. Furthermore, our compensation programs are designed to align the compensation of our employees with the company’s performance provide the proper incentives to attract, retain and motivate employees to achieve superior results for both short-term and long-term performance. 

In managing our global businesses, and as part of TMS, we focus on several human capital measures and objectives including those related to the hiring, performance, succession planning and retention of our employees. We accomplish this through the effective utilization of our robust TMS tools, and the ongoing commitment and engagement of the senior leadership team – all with a view of identifying and developing the next generation workforce, the future leaders of the Company and promoting a high-performance organization.
Intellectual Property
Patents and other proprietary rights, including trade secrets, unpatented know-how such as know-how related to manufacturing processes, and continuing technological innovations, are important to our business. We own a large portfolio of patents, trademarks and trade names and are a party to certain intellectual property licenses that enhance our competitive position. While we consider them to be valuable assets, we do not believe that any of these patents, trademarks or other intellectual property rights is individually significant to the Company or either of our segments. We maintain procedures to protect our intellectual property. For a discussion of certain risks related to the Company's intellectual property, see "Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors - Risks Related to Intellectual Property". 
Regulatory Capital Expenditures
The Company’s efforts to comply with numerous federal, state and local laws and regulations applicable to its business and products often results in capital expenditures. The Company makes capital expenditures to design and upgrade its aerospace and industrial products to comply with or exceed standards applicable to the industries we serve. The Company’s ongoing HSE compliance program also results in capital expenditures. Regulatory and HSE considerations are a part of significant capital expenditure decisions; however, expenditures during 2021 related solely to regulatory compliance were not material. 
Raw Materials
The principal raw materials used to manufacture our products are various grades and forms of steel, from rolled steel bars, plates and sheets, to high-grade valve steel wires and sheets, various grades and forms (bars, sheets, forgings, castings and powders) of stainless steels, aluminum alloys, titanium alloys, copper alloys, graphite, and iron-based, nickel-based (Inconels) and cobalt-based (Hastelloys) superalloys for complex aerospace applications. Prices for steel, titanium, Inconel, Hastelloys, as well as other specialty materials, have periodically increased due to higher demand and, in some cases, reduction of the availability of materials. During portions of fiscal year 2021, for example, the Company experienced increased commodity and component prices and, in some instances, shortages due to supply chain disruptions, labor shortages, increased demand and other factors associated with COVID-19. The Company expects continued volatility in the availability and prices for commodities and raw materials that we use in our products and in our supply chain in fiscal year 2022.
SEASONALITY
No material portion of our business is considered to be seasonal.
