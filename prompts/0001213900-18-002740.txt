Item 1. Business
Introduction
 
FlexShopper, Inc. (“we,” “us,” “our,” “FlexShopper” or the “Company”) is a corporation organized under the laws of the State of Delaware in 2006 with its common stock trading on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol “FPAY.” On October 16, 2013, we changed our corporate name from Anchor Funding Services, Inc. to FlexShopper, Inc. FlexShopper owns 100% of FlexShopper, LLC, a limited liability company organized under the laws of North Carolina in 2013. Since the sale of the assets of Anchor Funding Services LLC, which sale was completed in a series of transactions between April and June 2014, FlexShopper is a holding corporation with no operations except for those conducted by FlexShopper, LLC. FlexShopper, LLC wholly owns, directly or indirectly, two Delaware subsidiaries, FlexShopper 1, LLC and FlexShopper 2, LLC. All references to our business operations refer to FlexShopper, LLC and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, unless the context indicates otherwise.
 
Since December 2013, we have developed a business that focuses on improving the quality of life of our customers by providing them the opportunity to obtain ownership of high-quality durable products, such as consumer electronics, home appliances, computers (including tablets), smartphones and furniture (including accessories), under affordable payment lease-to-own (“LTO”) purchase agreements with no long-term obligation, including through an extensive online experience. Our customers can acquire well-known brands such as Samsung, Frigidaire, Hewlett-Packard, LG, Whirlpool, Simmons, Philips, Ashley, Apple and more. We believe that the introduction of FlexShopper’s LTO programs support broad untapped expansion opportunities within the U.S. consumer e-commerce and retail marketplaces. We have successfully developed and are currently processing LTO transactions using our “LTO Engine,” FlexShopper’s proprietary technology that automates the process of consumers receiving spending limits and entering into leases for durable goods to within seconds. The LTO Engine is the basis for FlexShopper’s primary sales channels, which include business to consumer (“B2C”) and business to business (“B2B”) channels, as described in further detail below. Concurrently, e-tailers and retailers that work with FlexShopper may increase their sales by utilizing FlexShopper’s online channels to connect with consumers that want to acquire products on an LTO basis. FlexShopper’s sales channels include (1) selling directly to consumers via the online FlexShopper.com LTO Marketplace featuring thousands of durable goods, (2) utilizing FlexShopper’s LTO payment method at check out on e-commerce sites and through in-store terminals and (3) facilitating LTO transactions with retailers that have not yet become part of the FlexShopper.com LTO marketplace.
 
INDUSTRY OVERVIEW
 
The LTO industry offers consumers an alternative to traditional methods of obtaining electronics, computers, home furnishings, appliances and other durable goods. FlexShopper’s customers typically do not have sufficient cash or credit to obtain these goods, so they find the short-term nature and affordable payments of LTO attractive. In a typical LTO transaction, the customer has the option to acquire merchandise over a fixed term, usually 12 to 24 months, normally by making weekly lease payments. The customers may cancel the agreement as prescribed in the lease agreement by returning the merchandise, generally with no further lease obligation if their account is current. If customers lease the item to the full term, they obtain ownership of the item, though they can choose to buy it at any time prior to expiration of the term. FlexShopper’s current fixed term to acquire ownership is fifty-two weeks.
 
Non-prime consumers represent the largest segment of the credit market.    Today, approximately 30% of Americans have low credit scores according to Experian, and approximately 8% of Americans are credit invisible, or have no credit history, according to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. This segment of consumers represents a significant and underserved market.
 
Banks do not adequately serve the non-prime.    Following the last decade’s financial crisis, most banks tightened their underwriting standards and increased their minimum FICO score requirements for borrowers, leaving non-prime borrowers with severely reduced access to traditional credit. Despite the improving economy, banks continue to underserve the non-prime consumer. According to research based on securitization data for the five major credit card issuers, it is estimated that the revolving credit available to non-prime U.S. borrowers was reduced by approximately $142 billion from 2008 to 2016. This reduction has had a profound impact on non-prime consumers in the U.S. who typically have little to no savings. FlexShopper believes that there is a growing need for a flexible LTO product that offers the convenience of a digital in-store, online, or mobile experience.

Direct Potential Addressable Market Size Totaling $20 Billion - $25 Billion:
 

According to KeyBanc Capital Markets’ research, the current addressable market size for non-prime consumers is between $20 and $25 billion, with consumer electronics constituting 43% of such amount. To date, we have been successful underwriting consumer electronics online and believe this is one of our competitive advantages.
GROWTH OPPORTUNITIES AND STRATEGIES
 
Like many industries, the internet and other technology is transforming the LTO industry. FlexShopper has positioned itself to take advantage of this transformation by focusing on the expansion of the LTO industry online and into mainstream retail and e-tail. The brick-and-mortar LTO industry currently serves approximately 3.4 million consumers annually, generating approximately $6.1 billion in sales primarily through approximately 6,700 LTO brick and mortar stores. Through its strategic sales channels FlexShopper believes it can expand the LTO industry, also known as the rent-to-own or RTO industry. FlexShopper has successfully developed and is currently processing LTO transactions using its “LTO Engine,” FlexShopper’s proprietary technology that automates the process of consumers receiving spending limits and entering into leases for durable goods to within seconds. The LTO Engine is the basis for FlexShopper’s primary sales channels, which include B2C and B2B channels, illustrated in the diagram below:

We believe we have created a unique platform whereby our B2B and B2C sales channels beneficially advance each other. For our B2C channels, we directly market to our consumers LTO opportunities at FlexShopper.com, where they can choose from over 150,000 of the latest products shipped directly to them by certain of the nation’s largest retailers. This generates sales for our retail partners, which encourages them to incorporate our B2B solutions into their online and in-store sales channels. The lease originations by our retail partners using our B2B channels, which have no customer acquisition cost to us, subsidize our B2C customer acquisition costs. Meanwhile, our B2C marketing promotes FlexShopper.com, which provides incremental sales for our retail partners as well as benefitting our FlexShopper.com business.
 
To achieve our goal of being the preeminent “pure play” virtual LTO leader, we intend to execute the following strategies:
 
Continue to grow FlexShopper into a dominant LTO brand.   Given strong consumer demand and organic growth potential for our LTO solutions, we believe that significant opportunities exist to expand our presence within current markets via existing marketing channels. As non-prime consumers become increasingly familiar and comfortable with our retail kiosk partnerships, online marketplace and mobile solutions, we plan to capture the new business generated as they migrate away from less convenient legacy brick-and-mortar LTO stores.
 
Expand the range of customers served.  We continue to evaluate new product and market opportunities that fit into our overall strategic objective of delivering next-generation retail, online and mobile LTO terms that span the non-prime/near-prime credit spectrum. For example, we are evaluating products with lower fees that would be more focused on the needs of more creditworthy subprime consumers that prefer a less expensive LTO option. In addition, we are continually focused on improving our analytics to effectively underwrite and serve consumers within those segments of the non-prime credit spectrum that we do not currently reach, including profitable deeper penetration of the sub-prime spectrum. We believe the current generation of our underwriting model is performing well and will continue to improve over time as its data set expands.
  Pursue additional strategic retail partnerships.     We intend to continue targeting regional and national retailers to expand our B2B sales channels. As illustrated in the diagram above, we believe we have the best omnichannel solution for retailers to “save the sale” with LTO options. In retail, the phrase “save the sale” means offering consumers other finance options when they don’t qualify for traditional credit. We expect these partnerships to provide us with access to a broad range of potential new customers, with low customer acquisition costs.

Expand our relationships with existing customers and retail partners.    Customer acquisition costs represent one of the most significant expenses for us due to our high percentage of online customers. In comparison, no acquisition cost is incurred for customers acquired through our retail partnerships. We will seek to expand our strong relationships with existing customers by providing qualified customers with increased spending limits or offering other products and services to them, as well as seek to grow our retail partnerships to reduce our overall acquisition cost. 
 
Continue to optimize marketing across all channels. Since we began marketing our services to consumers in 2014, we have made significant progress in targeting our customers and lowering our customer acquisition costs. This is across different media including direct response television and digital channels such as social media, email, and search engines. 
 
COMPETITION AND OUR COMPETITIVE STRENGTHS
 
The LTO industry is highly competitive. Our operation competes with other national, regional and local LTO businesses, as well as with rental stores that do not offer their customers a purchase option. Some of these companies have, or may develop, systems that enable consumers to obtain through online facilities spending limits and payment terms and to enter into leases nearly instantaneously, in a manner similar to that provided by FlexShopper’s proprietary technology. We believe the following competitive strengths differentiate us:
Underwriting and Risk Management
 
Industry-leading technology and proprietary risk analytics optimized for the non-prime credit market. We have made substantial investments in our underwriting technology and analytics platforms to support rapid scaling, innovation and regulatory compliance. Our team of data scientists and risk analysts uses our risk infrastructure to build and test strategies across the entire underwriting process, using alternative credit data, device authentication, identity verification, and many more data elements. We believe our real-time proprietary technology and risk analytics platform is better than our competitors’ in underwriting online consumers and consumer electronics; most of our peers focus on in-store consumers that acquire furniture, which we believe are easier to underwrite. In addition, all our applications are processed instantly with approvals and spending limits provided within seconds of submission. 
 
Better LTO Products for Consumers and Retailers
 
Largest online LTO marketplace. We have made substantial investments in our custom e-commerce platform to provide consumers the greatest selection of popular brands delivered by certain of the nation’s largest retailers, including Best Buy, Amazon, Walmart, Overstock, Serta and many more. Our platform is custom-built for online LTO transactions, which include underwriting our consumers, serving them compliant state leases, syncing and communicating with our retail partners to fulfill orders and all front- and back-end customer relationship management functions, including collections and billing. The result is a comprehensive technology platform that manages all facets of our business and enables us to scale with hundreds of thousands of visitors and products.
 
A better omnichannel “save the sale” product for retailers. We believe that we have the best omnichannel solution for retailers to “save the sale” with LTO options. To our knowledge, no competitor has an LTO marketplace that provides retailers incremental sales with no acquisition cost. In addition, compared to our peers, our product for consumers requires no money down and typically fewer application fields. We believe this leads to more in-store and online sales. We also believe that we have the best LTO payment technology at checkout for e-tailers, whereby consumers can seamlessly checkout out on a third party’s e-commerce site with our LTO payment plugin.
 
We provide LTO consumers an “endless aisle” of products for lease-to-own. As illustrated by our B2C channels in the above diagram, we offer consumers three ways to acquire products on an LTO basis. At FlexShopper.com our customers can choose from over 150,000 of the latest products shipped by certain of the nation’s largest retailers. If customers want products that are not available on our marketplace, they may use our “personal shopper” service and simply complete a form with a link to the webpage of the desired durable good. We also offer consumers the ability to acquire durable goods with our FlexShopper Wallet smartphone application available on Apple and Android devices. With FlexShopper Wallet, consumers may apply for a spending limit and take a picture of a qualifying item in any major retail store and we will fill the order for them. With our B2C channels we believe we are providing LTO consumers with a superior LTO experience and fulfilling our mission to help improve their quality of life by shopping for what they want where they want.

A Lean and Scalable Model
 
Compared to the brick-and-mortar LTO industry, which is suffering from the same headwinds as traditional retail stores and declining sales, we have been successful in addressing the LTO consumer through online channels as illustrated in the chart below.
 


We believe our model is more efficient and scalable for the following reasons:
 
We have no inventory risk and are completely drop-ship. We do not have any of the costs associated with buying, storing and shipping inventory. Instead, our suppliers ship goods directly to consumers.
 
We serve LTO consumers across the United States without brick-and-mortar stores. We do not have any of the costs associated with physical stores and the personnel needed to operate them.
 
As our sales grow we achieve more operating leverage.  Our model is primarily driven by a technology platform that does not require significant increases in operating overhead to support sales growth.
 
The Rental Purchase Transaction
 
A rental purchase transaction is a flexible alternative for consumers to obtain and enjoy brand name merchandise with no long-term obligation. Key features of rental purchase transactions include:
 
Brand name merchandise. FlexShopper offers well-known brands such as LG, Samsung, Sony and Vizio home electronics; Frigidaire, General Electric, LG, Samsung and Whirlpool appliances; Acer, Apple, Asus, Samsung and Toshiba computers and/or tablets; Samsung and Apple smartphones; and Ashley, Powell and Standard furniture among other brands.
 
Convenient payment options. Our customers make payments on a weekly, bi-weekly or monthly basis. Payments are automatically deducted from the customer’s authorized checking account or debit card. Additionally, customers may make additional payments or exercise early payment options, which enable them to save money.

No long-term commitment. A customer may terminate a rental purchase agreement at any time with no long-term obligation by paying amounts due under the rental purchase agreement and returning the item to FlexShopper.
 
Applying has no impact on credit or FICO score. We do not use FICO scores to determine customers’ spending limits so our underwriting does not impact consumers’ credit with the three main credit bureaus
 
Flexible options to obtain ownership. Ownership of the merchandise generally transfers to the customer if the customer makes all payments during the lease term, which is one year, or exercises early payment options, which typically save the customer money.
 
SALES AND MARKETING
 
B2C Channels
 
We use a multi-channel, analytics-powered approach to marketing our products and services, with both broad-reach and highly-targeted channels, including television, digital, telemarketing and marketing affiliates. The goal of our marketing is to promote our brand and primarily to directly acquire new customers at a targeted acquisition cost. Our marketing strategies include the following:
 
Direct response television advertising. We use television advertising supported by our internal analytics and media buys from a key agency to drive and optimize website traffic and lease originations.
 
Digital acquisition. Our online marketing efforts include pay-per-click, keyword advertising, search engine optimization, marketing affiliate partnerships, social media programs and mobile advertising integrated with our operating systems and technology from vendors that allow us to optimize customer acquisition tactics within the daily operations cycle. In 2017 we created and launched our automated digital pay-per-click advertising platform, FLEX-AADS, which enabled us to scale up our pay-per-click marketing by utilizing better segmentation techniques and statistical models that can optimize our bidding adjustments.
 
User experience and conversion. We measure and monitor website visitor usage metrics and regularly test website design strategies to improve customer experience and conversion rates.
 
B2B Channels
 
We use internal business development personnel and outside consultants that focus on engaging retailers and e-tailers to use our services. This includes promoting FlexShopper at key trade shows and conferences.
MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEMS
 
FlexShopper uses computer-based management information systems to facilitate its entire business model, including underwriting, processing transactions through its sales channels, managing collections and monitoring leased inventory. Through the use of our proprietary software developed in-house, each of our retail partners uses our online merchant portal that automates the process of consumers receiving spending limits and entering into leases for durable goods generally to within seconds. The management information system generates reports which enable us to meet our financial reporting requirements.
GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS
 
The LTO industry is regulated by and subject to the requirements of various federal, state and local laws and regulations, many of which are in place for consumer protection. In general, such laws regulate, among other items, applications for leases, late fees, finance rates, disclosure statements, the substance and sequence of required disclosures, the content of advertising materials and certain collection procedures. Violations of certain provisions of these laws and regulations may result in penalties ranging from nominal amounts up to and including forfeiture of fees and other amounts due on leases. We are unable to predict the nature or effect on our operations or earnings of unknown future legislation, regulations and judicial decisions or future interpretations of existing and future legislation or regulations relating to our operations, and there can be no assurance that future laws, decisions or interpretations will not have a material adverse effect on our operations and earnings. In 2016, the Company enhanced its compliance department by hiring a Chief Compliance Counsel. See the section of this report captioned “Risk Factors” below for more information with respect to governmental laws and regulations and their effect on our business.

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
 
FlexShopper has provisional patent applications pending in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (“USPTO”) for systems that enable consumers to obtain products on an LTO basis using mobile devices and tablets and for an LTO method of payment at check-out on e-commerce sites. We can provide no assurances that FlexShopper will be granted any patents by the USPTO. We regard our pending patents, trademarks, service marks, copyrights, trade dress, trade secrets, proprietary technology, and similar intellectual property as critical to our success. In particular, we believe certain proprietary information, including but not limited to our underwriting model, and patent pending systems are central to our business model and we believe give us a key competitive advantage. We also rely on trademark and copyright law, trade secret protection, and confidentiality, license and work product agreements with our employees, customers, and others to protect our proprietary rights. See the section captioned “Risk Factors” below for more information on and risk associated with respect to our intellectual property.
 
Operations and Employees of FlexShopper
 
Brad Bernstein, our Chief Executive Officer, manages our day-to-day operations and internal growth and oversees our growth strategy. FlexShopper’s management also includes a Chief Financial Officer and a Chief Risk Officer. In addition, FlexShopper has a customer service and collections call center. As of December 31, 2017, FlexShopper had 154 employees, all of whom were full time.
