We have never been involved in any reclassification, merger, consolidation, purchase or sale of a significant amount of assets, nor have we ever declared bankruptcy, been in receivership, or been involved in any legal action or proceedings.

Products/Services
 
Description of Product or Services
 
SOLTREST INC. provides special tools to computer users to reduce the risks of accessing public networks/internet.  There is a range of software applications that we already developed and will continue to develop when additional financing will be available.  These applications are not a substitute for exiting antivirus products on a market but an additional protection layer of security while accessing public networks.  These applications could be used as stand along network defenders or in conjunction with other cybersecurity applications.
 
Target Market and Clients/potential Clients
 
Our target market is any individuals and organizations that want to increase cybersecurity of their devices that includes practically all computing devices that run OS and have access to Internet or other public networks.
 During Phase 1 (initial stage) our main target clients are any individual users that browse internet on a daily basis i.e. who is susceptible to the high degree of hacker attack risks due to long Internet exposure.
 In Phase 2 of our business development, we plan to provide services and product to small size companies.
 If we are successful in the small company sector and have a good risk avoidance tracking record we could offer our products to medium sized corporations as part of Phase 3 business development.
 
Source of revenue
 
We have identified three main marketing client groups associated with the various streams of revenue:
 
Source #1 – Individual PC users
 
In Phase 1 and Phase 2 our main source of revenue are individual PC users.
 
We are planning to generate up to 85-90% of our total revenue from individual PC users.
 
Source #2 – Small companies.
 
Small family owned shops and stores will also be our target clientele.
 
We would expect appx 10 – 15% of our total revenue to come from small business segment.

Source #3 – Medium size companies 
After completing Phase 3 of our development we will introduce our products to medium-size companies and if successful we will shift our sources of revenue as following:

a. | Individual users – 80%
---+-----------------------


b. | Small businesses – 10%
---+-----------------------


c. | Medium size companies 10%
---+--------------------------



The main target customer group will be individual PC users.  Today several billion people use personal computers or other internet enabled devices.  Capturing a small sector of this user population could allow us to sell our products at a very attractive and affordable price.
 
Marketing Strategy
 
Our marketing strategy is to use inexpensive and widely available advertising vehicles such as
 
  
1. | The company website
---+--------------------


2. | YouTube
---+--------


3. | Social Networks (Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter etc.)
---+---------------------------------------------------



If we can obtain more financial resources, we can include Google advertising offers.
 
To increase customer interest in our products we can provide a free product trial for a fixed period of time.
 
Another option is to provide light version of our application for free and to offer more security and functionality in a full edition version.
 
The pricing of our products will be inexpensive allowing to penetration of a wider customer base.
 
We are planning to prepare YouTube demo to explain the benefits and advantages of using our applications and tools.
 
Competition and Competitive Strategy
 
The cybersecurity requires a very wide area of expertise so very few large companies can address all the security threats.
 
Our goal is to fulfill only a certain niche of the market and specialize on limiting customer’s internet exposure by simple and inexpensive applications. We are not marketing our company as Antivirus developers we will simply be providing an extra layer of security that will reduce the risk of external hacker attacks.  Our software could be integrated in more advance firewalls and antivirus products.
 
Currently, our competitive position within the industry is negligible in light of the fact that we have just recently started our operations.
 
Out competitive advantages are:
 
  
• | Expertise
--+----------


• | Performance
--+------------


• | Flexibility
--+------------


• | Price
