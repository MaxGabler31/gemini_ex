Business Development
 
Giggles N’ Hugs, Inc. was formed as a Nevada corporation on September 17, 2004. On August 2010, Giggles changed its name from Teacher’s Pet, Inc. to Giggles N’ Hugs, Inc. Effective December 30, 2011, Giggles completed the acquisition of GNH, Inc. (“GNH”) through the acquisition of 100% of the issued and outstanding common stock of GNH.
 
Giggles currently owns and operates kid-friendly restaurants named Giggles N’ Hugs in the Westfield Topanga Shopping Center located in Woodland Hills, California, and the Glendale Galleria located in Glendale, California, and owns the intellectual property rights for Giggles N’ Hugs facilities.
 
Business Overview
 
Giggles N’ Hugs is the pioneer restaurant that brings together high-end, organic food with the play elements and entertainment for children. Giggles N’ Hugs offers an upscale, family-friendly atmosphere with a play area dedicated to children ages 10 and younger. The restaurant has a high-quality menu made from fresh, organic foods that are enjoyed by both children and adults. With nightly entertainment, such as magic shows, concerts, puppet shows, face painting and arts and crafts, Giggles N’ Hugs has become a premier destination for families seeking healthy food in a casual and fun atmosphere.
 
In addition to its family-friendly vibe, Giggles N’ Hugs is also known for its own creation called “Mom’s Tricky Treat Sauce,” which hides pureed vegetables in kids’ favorite meals such as pizza, pastas and macaroni and cheese.
 
The founders, Joey Parsi and his wife, Dorsa, conceived the idea when they tried dining out with their own children, but spent the entire evening attending to quieting their kids and avoiding disapproving stares. From this frustrating experience, they discovered that there was a significant need for high-quality restaurants where play time, healthy food, and happy parents could converge. This idea led to the creation of Giggles N’ Hugs. Since its grand opening in February of 2008, it has become a destination for parents and kids to play and have fun while enjoying a gourmet meal.
 
Our restaurant offers a combination of high quality food and beverage with attentive service to ensure a memorable experience. Our play areas are supervised by staff members who promote positive interaction, fun, and activities in such a way that their presence often overshadows the presence of the vast number of toys and daily entertainment we offer. Our restaurant features kid-size castles, giant climbers, a pirate ship, and a walk-on dragon, as well as tricycles, swings, bouncies, and an abundant selection of toys in each location. The Giggles N’ Hugs team is a group of individuals that have been hired and trained to reflect our core beliefs of creating an environment for families to bond and interact with one another. We encourage our staff members to be more than just employees, but instead to become friends with our guests. The family-friendly feel of the restaurant and play space reflects its image and individuality in the marketplace.

Giggles N’ Hugs was rated among the best family and kid-friendly restaurants by City Search, a division of Interactive Corp., which is a website where restaurant goers can blog about their experiences and rate restaurants on a scale of one to five, and by Nickelodeon, a division of Viacom. We have been featured in numerous television news programs and publications, including TV Guide Channel, Fox Channel 11, Extra TV, Access Hollywood, Entertainment Tonight, Businessweek, People Magazine, The Los Angeles Times, Los Angeles Family, West-Side Today, US Magazine, OK Magazine, Life and Style Magazine, and the LA Business Journal. Our concept has appealed to numerous celebrities. Many high-profile actors and entertainers have enjoyed the Giggles N’ Hugs experience.
 
Restaurant Concept:
 
Our operating restaurants are located in the Westfield Topanga Mall, in Woodland Hills, California and in Glendale Galleria in Glendale, California. Our restaurants have about 6,000 square feet of space, of which 2,000 square feet are allocated for the play area, 2,500 square feet for the dining area, and 1,500 square feet for the kitchen.
Dining Area:
 
Giggles N’ Hugs has arranged its spacious dining area so that every table has a view of the play area. Parents have the convenience of watching their children from a distance without having to leave their seats. Parents can sit down and enjoy their meals comfortably while their kids play. Sleek and modern white chairs and colorful utensils are used to appeal to the kids. All utensils are unbreakable and kid-friendly.
Menu:
 
We pride ourselves in our upscale entrée selections that are both nutritious and appetizing. For children, we offer macaroni and cheese, turkey dogs, and turkey burgers. We incorporate nutritious vegetables into typical children favorites, such as pureed butternut squash in the macaroni and cheese, pureed spinach in our pizza and spaghetti sauce, and whole wheat bread buns for our sandwiches. We also offer delicious salads, such as “Goat Cheese and Beet Salad,” “Chinese Chicken Salad,” and “Honey Peanut and Apple Salad.” Some of our gourmet entrees include grilled salmon, “Chicken Milanese,” and fresh panini. For guests who have specific dietary restrictions, we offer a variety of alternative menu items including non-dairy milk, gluten free pasta, and whole grain breads.
Play Area:
 
The uniqueness of a child’s imagination can run wild in our exceptionally designed play space. In the center of our restaurant is our exclusive padded 2,000 square foot children’s play area. The magical play space includes a life-size pirate ship for boys and girls to climb into and slide off of, a fairytale play castle for the princes and princesses to let their imaginations run wild, and a green dragon for the smaller kids to climb. Along with the signature pieces, the play area also highlights kids’ favorite toys, play kitchens, and cars. Safety is the number one priority when it comes to our guests. Our highly skilled and inspirational staff understands the importance of each child’s safety and genuine joy while at Giggles N’ Hugs. They make balloon animals, paint faces, and give temporary tattoos to the kids. They also sing songs, read books, and play games to keep the fun times rolling. The overall design of the restaurant exudes a magical, whimsical feeling, while maintaining an aura of sophistication and detail, particularly in the dining area, to appeal to parents. With a small admission fee, children can play all day and enjoy activities and entertainment in the Giggles N’ Hugs play area.
Activities and Entertainment:
 
Entertainment is a fundamental part of our restaurant. Story-telling, singing, and game sessions conducted by the staff members are just a few of our options. For a more calm and relaxing experience, we offer movie nights. For those guests looking for a more upbeat experience, we have “Disco Night” and “Kids Karaoke.” Giggles N’ Hugs also offers magic shows, puppet shows, arts and crafts, Play-Doh, and contests such as talent shows and “Simon Says,” as well as other impromptu games that allow our staff and parents to bond with their children.

Birthday parties and other special events:
 
Each Giggles N’ Hugs location has the capacity to host up to 500 guests for birthday parties and special events for 2 hours or more. Packages include food, cake, facility use, party favors, and activities. Giggles N’ Hugs goes to great lengths to make birthday parties worry-free for parents. This includes sending out invitations, arranging entertainment, providing catering, and staffing. Giggles N’ Hugs is great for all special events including holiday parties, fundraisers, family get-togethers, and other celebrations.
 
History
 
The original Giggles N’ Hugs opened its doors in February of 2008 and was located in the posh Brentwood district of Los Angeles. The unique design and 1,500 square-foot play area was a huge success and solidified our proof of concept. However, due to the limited size of the location, our ability to offer “drop-off” services, one of our most popular features, was hindered. Drop-off services allow parents to drop their children off in our play area and go shopping while their children play in a supervised environment. In addition, other factors such as lack of available parking, the location’s strip mall characteristics, and isolated location became problematic. As a result, we decided it was in our best interest to close the restaurant and secure a larger venue elsewhere.
 
With the successful launch and proof of concept that was realized at our Brentwood location, the Company decided to expand to the Westfield Shopping Mall in Century City in December of 2010. This ideal location highlights a play space two times the size of the original location and includes additional sources of revenue including beer and wine sales, drop off service, private party rentals, and in-store merchandise. In June 2016, the Century City mall began a $700 million remodeling of the Westfield Shopping Mall, which closed 90% of the retailers, including the Giggles N’ Hugs store.
 
Expansion
 
Our intent is to expand and open new stores either through the Company-owned approach or using the franchise model, or through both of these methods, but such expansion will be limited to our ability to raise sufficient capital to meet new store start-up requirements. In September 2018, we formed GNH Restaurant 3, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company wholly owned by us, for the purpose opening our third Company-owned restaurant. We initiated a Regulation CF equity crowdfunding campaign on the Wefunder portal to raise capital for this new location, but we cannot assure you that we will be successful in this fundraising effort or that we will raise sufficient funds to open our third location through Wefunder or otherwise.
 
Additionally, Giggles N’ Hugs intends to introduce a new line of frozen foods, specifically designed for children, and organic baby foods, both of which we hope will be available at grocery stores. We are in discussions to license our brand for merchandising, publishing, children’s apparel, entertainment, and more. With sufficient financing, Giggles N’ Hugs plans to expand to other parts of the country in the future.
 
Company-owned stores. We estimate that we would have to expend $700,000 - $900,000 (net of any – landlord-tenant improvement allowances) to construct, staff, and open each new restaurant, excluding rent. Our build- out cost of new restaurants will vary depending on a number of factors, including the size of the location, whether we are converting an existing restaurant space as we did with our Brentwood location, or moving into a “build to suit” location constructed from a building shell, typically with a monetary contribution (also typically referred to as a tenant improvement allowance) from the landlord. While the latter development model generally involves greater costs (depending on the level of landlord contribution) and time to open (because the permitting process is typically significantly longer), we believe that positioning our restaurants in popular, “marquee” locations (which typically operate on the “build to suit” model) will greatly increase public awareness and recognition of the Giggles brand, which we believe is critical to our continued growth.

Marketing and Advertising
 
To date, our marketing and advertising has been extremely limited as we have conserved working capital for operational purposes. Our primary marketing has been through word-of-mouth from existing customers and some limited print-based advertising.
 
Once we have sufficient financing, we plan to market our products and services through a multi-pronged campaign. To this end, Giggles N’ Hugs will directly engage local preschools, kindergartens, and elementary schools. We believe our cause and community marketing would better root our presence in the minds of area locals. With additional marketing capital, Giggles N’ Hugs plans to advertise on television channels such as Disney and Nickelodeon, as well as in additional print publications, radio, and satellite radio. Our first store has been frequented by numerous celebrities, which provides free and invaluable publicity. We believe a large scale marketing campaign that increases exposure to Giggles N’ Hugs could result in a significant increase in our revenue.
 
We intend to design an aggressive and creative promotional strategy aimed to maximize our exposure to the target audience. We believe the following direct and indirect advertising methods could increase exposure and visibility of the “Giggles N’ Hugs” brand in our community:
 

● | Viral Marketing: Word-of-mouth advertising in conjunction with other secondary advertising methods functions to spread our already-popular name. Celebrity patronage is especially useful in this regard. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Internet Advertising: We would allot portions of our marketing budget for strategic Internet marketing, including search engine optimization. This tactic involves organically improving the quality and volume of traffic to a website through search engine searches. Search engine optimization can also target different kinds of searches, including image, local, and industry- specific vertical search engines. 
● | Television advertising: We recognize that television advertising is an effective means of reaching a large target population. For this reason we plan to advertise on local cable channels, such as The Disney Channel and Nickelodeon. 
● | Special events/sponsorships: We may sponsor local events and organizations in an effort to contribute to surrounding neighborhoods and the overall community, which concurrently builds community awareness of our stores. 
● | Print media-magazines: Print advertisements will continue to be placed in select magazines and newspapers for weekly and/or monthly distribution. These advertisements include a brief description of the Company, comprehensive explanatory images and/or text detailing products, and also offer limited time discounts. 

 
We have also received free publicity through celebrity-interest magazines, such as People Magazine, mentioning our restaurant in their articles. We have also attracted coverage from the local print media such as the Los Angeles Times and LA Business Journal about our concept of a kid-oriented restaurant.

Competition
 
Giggles N’ Hugs faces competition from other family-oriented establishments, especially businesses that operate under the national franchise model. This is primarily populated by the industry giant Chuck E. Cheese, which caters to older children and only serves pizza and related foods. Most play areas have minimal food preparation areas, if any, consisting only of a microwave oven or toaster.
 
Giggles N’ Hugs has already begun cementing its reputation in the local marketplace having seen establishments that reflect direct competition to us suffer a lack of business and/or shut down. We are aware that the quality of the Giggles N’ Hugs brand and model has influenced and increased the expectations of parents and that our presence has significantly affected the business of other local establishments.
 
The major competitors in the Company’s immediate area are Child’s Play and Under the Sea Indoor Playground. These businesses operate under the play area model and are mostly used as birthday party venues or weekend playgrounds, as opposed to a food and entertainment destination like Giggles N’ Hugs. To our knowledge, these businesses are so popular among children that they are booked for months in advance in most cases for birthday parties and other celebrations. These businesses provide an excellent insight into the demand for our business model, which improves upon the competition by providing healthy food choices in a true restaurant environment.
 
We enjoy numerous advantages in our target market that other companies fail to deliver. The following list describes each advantage:
 

● | Delicious, but also nutritious, food. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Sundry, novel, child-oriented toys and overall environment. 
● | Quality offerings for adults while waiting. 
● | Theme nights such as “Disco Night”. 
● | Entertainment such as puppet shows, magic shows and music shows. 
● | “Aides” to assist in the kids’ enjoyment while parents relax. 

 
We are aware that many of our competitors and potential competitors have greater financial and other resources, have been in business longer, have greater name recognition and are better established in the markets where our first restaurant is located and where our future restaurants will be located. Although we believe that our restaurant concept offers features and advantages not currently available elsewhere, and we have taken reasonable steps to adequately protect our proprietary concepts and other intellectual property, we cannot assure you that these companies will not seek to copy aspects of our restaurant concept, or develop similar or competing features, in the future.
 
Government Regulation
 
Our restaurant operations will be subject to licensing and regulation by state and local departments and health, sanitation, zoning and fire, and to periodic review by the state and municipal authorities for areas in which the restaurants are located. In addition, we will be subject to local land use, zoning, building, planning and traffic ordinances and regulations in the selection and acquisition of suitable sites for developing new restaurants. Delays in obtaining, or denials of, or revocation or temporary suspension of, necessary licenses or approvals could have a material adverse impact on our development of restaurants.

In addition, our restaurant operations will be subject to the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990. The ADA may require us to make certain installations in our planned restaurants to meet federally and state mandated requirements.
