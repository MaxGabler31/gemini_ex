ITEM 1.Business
General
CNX Resources Corporation (“CNX,” the “Company,” or “we,” “us,” or “our”) is a premier independent natural gas and midstream company engaged in the exploration, development, production and acquisition of natural gas properties in the Appalachian Basin. The majority of our operations are centered on unconventional shale formations, primarily the Marcellus Shale and Utica Shale, in Pennsylvania, Ohio and West Virginia. Additionally, we operate and develop Coal Bed Methane (CBM) properties in Virginia. We believe that our extensive held-by-production acreage position and development inventory combined with our regional operating expertise, extensive data set from development and non-op participation wells, midstream infrastructure ownership, low-cost operations and legacy surface acreage position provide us with significant competitive advantages that position us for long-term value creation. 
CNX's Strategy and Corporate Values
CNX's strategy is to increase shareholder value through the development and growth of our existing natural gas assets and the selective acquisition of natural gas acreage leases within our operating footprint. Our mission is to empower our team to embrace and drive innovative change that creates long-term per share value for our investors, enhances our communities and delivers energy solutions for today and tomorrow. 
CNX defines itself through its corporate values that serve as our road map and guide every aspect of our business as we strive to achieve our corporate mission: 
•Responsibility: Be a safe and compliant operator; be a trusted community partner and respected corporate citizen; act with pride and integrity;
•Ownership: Be accountable for our actions and learn from our outcomes, both positive and negative; be calculated risk-takers and seek creative ways to solve problems; and
•Excellence: Be prudent capital allocators; be a lean, efficient, nimble organization; be a disciplined, reliable, performance-driven company.
These values are the foundation of CNX's identity and are the basis for how management defines continued success. With the benefit of a more than 155-year legacy and a substantial asset base amassed over many generations, the Company deploys a strategy focused on responsibly developing its resources to create long-term per share value for its shareholders, employees, and the communities where it operates. 
CNX believes that natural gas is central to a low-cost, reliable, secure, lower-carbon energy future that benefits American consumers, workers and the environment. 
2021 Operational Highlights and Outlook
•Over the past ten years, CNX's natural gas production has grown by approximately 285% to a total of 590.2 net Bcfe in 2021. 
•Total average production of 1,617,118 Mcfe per day; 
•94% Natural Gas, 6% Liquids; and
•92% Shale, 8% coalbed methane.
 At December 31, 2021, our proved natural gas, NGL, condensate and oil reserves (collectively, “natural gas reserves”) had the following characteristics:
•9.6 Tcfe of proved reserves;
•93.4% natural gas;
•61.4% proved developed;
•98.5% operated; and
In 2022, CNX expects capital expenditures of approximately $470 million to $500 million. The Company continuously evaluates multiple factors to determine activity throughout the year, and as such, may update guidance accordingly. 
DETAIL OF OPERATIONS 
Our operations include the following plays:
Shale 
Our Shale properties represent our primary operating and growth area in terms of reserves, production, and capital investment. We have rights to extract natural gas from Shale formations in Pennsylvania, West Virginia, and Ohio from approximately 526,000 net Marcellus Shale acres and approximately 610,000 net Utica Shale acres at December 31, 2021. Approximately 348,000 Utica Shale acres coincide with Marcellus Shale acreage in Pennsylvania, West Virginia, and Ohio. 
The Upper Devonian Shale formation, which includes both the Burkett Shale and Rhinestreet Shale, lies above the Marcellus Shale formation in southwestern Pennsylvania and northern West Virginia. The Company holds approximately 52,000 acres of incremental Upper Devonian acres; however, these acres have historically not been disclosed separately as they generally coincide with our Marcellus acreage and we have no current drilling program targeting this formation.
Coalbed Methane (CBM)
We have rights to extract CBM in Virginia from approximately 282,000 net CBM acres in Central Appalachia. We produce CBM natural gas primarily from the Pocahontas #3 seam and still have a nominal drilling program. The CBM natural gas we extract would otherwise be vented into the atmosphere during normal mining operations. 
We also have rights to extract CBM from approximately 1,733,000 net CBM acres in other states including West Virginia, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Illinois, Indiana, and New Mexico with no current plans to drill CBM wells in these areas.
Other Gas 
We have rights to extract natural gas from other shale and shallow oil and gas positions primarily in Illinois, Indiana, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and West Virginia from approximately 1,006,000 net acres at December 31, 2021. The majority of our shallow oil and gas leasehold position is held by third-party production and all of it is extensively overlain by existing third-party natural gas gathering and transmission infrastructure.
Summary of Properties as of December 31, 2021 

 | Shale | | CBM | | Other Gas | 
 | Segment | | Segment | | Segment | Total 
Estimated Net Proved Reserves (MMcfe) | 8,532,076 | | | 1,087,172 | | 6,482 | | 9,625,730 | 
Percent Developed (1) | 60 | % | | 71 | % | 100 | % | 61 | %

Net Acreage Position: | | | | | | 
Net Proved Developed Acres | 96,474 | | | 242,285 | | 38,091 | | 376,850 | 
Net Proved Undeveloped Acres (2) | 41,605 | | | — | | — | | 41,605 | 
Net Unproved Acres(3) | 701,682 | | | 1,772,422 | | 968,055 | | 3,442,159 | 
Total Net Acres(4) | 839,761 | | | 2,014,707 | | 1,006,146 | | 3,860,614 | 

_________
(1)    Percent developed is calculated as net proved developed reserves divided by net proved reserves, measured in MMcfe.
(2)    Net proved undeveloped acres represent undrilled locations and can only be classified as having proved undeveloped reserves if a development plan has been adopted indicating that they are scheduled to be drilled within five years, unless the specific circumstances justify a longer time (See glossary of oil and gas terms for additional information)
(3)    Net acres include acreage attributable to our working interests in the properties. Additional adjustments (either increases or decreases) may be required as we further develop title to and further confirm our rights with respect to our various properties in anticipation of development. We believe that our assumptions and methodology in this regard are reasonable.
(4)    Acreage amounts are only included under the target strata CNX expects to produce with the exception of certain CBM acres governed by separate leases.
Producing Wells and Acreage 
Most of our development wells and proved acreage are located in Virginia, West Virginia, Ohio and Pennsylvania. Some leases are beyond their primary term, but these leases are extended in accordance with their terms as long as certain drilling commitments or other term commitments are satisfied. 
The following table sets forth, at December 31, 2021, the number of producing wells, developed acreage and undeveloped acreage: 

 | Gross(1) | Net(2)
Producing Gas Wells (including gob wells) - Working Interest | 4,716 | | 4,432 
Producing Gas Wells - Royalty Interest | 2,031 | | — 
Producing Oil Wells - Royalty Interest | 150 | | — 
Net Acreage Position: | | 
Proved Developed Acreage | 376,850 | | 376,850 
Proved Undeveloped Acreage | 41,605 | | 41,605 
Unproved Acreage | 4,756,680 | | 3,442,159
Total Acreage | 5,175,135 | | 3,860,614

_________
(1)    All of our acreage identified as proved developed and undeveloped is controlled fully by CNX through ownership of a 100% working interest.
(2)    Net acres include acreage attributable to our working interests in the properties. Additional adjustments (either increases or decreases) may be required as we further develop title to and further confirm our rights with respect to our various properties in anticipation of development. We believe that our assumptions and methodology in this regard are reasonable. 
The following table represents the terms under which we hold these acres:    

 | Gross Unproved Acres | Net Unproved Acres | | Gross Proved Undeveloped Acres | Net Proved Undeveloped Acres
Held by Production/Fee | 4,660,401 | | 3,391,644 | | 28,749 | 28,749
Expiration Within 2 Years | 53,242 | | 24,788 | | 5,581 | 5,581 
Expiration Beyond 2 Years | 43,037 | | 25,727 | | 7,275 | 7,275 
Total Acreage | 4,756,680 | | 3,442,159 | | 41,605 | 41,605

The leases reflected above as Gross and Net Unproved Acres with expiration dates are included in our current drill plan or active land program. Leases with expiration dates within two years represent approximately 1% of our total net unproved acres and leases with expiration dates beyond two years represent approximately 1% of our total net unproved acres. In each case, we deemed this acreage to not be material to our overall acreage position. Additionally, based on our current drill plans and lease management we do not anticipate any material impact to our consolidated financial statements from the expiration of such leases.
Development Wells (Net) 
During the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, we drilled 33.0, 29.0 and 75.7 net development wells, respectively. Gob wells and wells drilled by operators other than our primary joint venture partners at that time are excluded from net development wells and represents less than 0.5 net wells for each year. As of December 31, 2021, there were 13.0 net development wells and no exploratory wells drilled but uncompleted. The Company includes drilled and uncompleted net development wells in proved undeveloped reserves and the Company intends to complete and turn-in-line the wells within five years of the initial disclosure. There were no net dry development wells in 2021 or 2020 and 1.0 net dry development well in 2019. As of December 31, 2021, there were no gross completed developmental wells ready to be turned in-line.
The following table illustrates the net wells drilled by well classification type: 

 | For the Year 
 | Ended December 31,
 | 2021 | 2020 | | 2019

CBM Segment | — | | 4.0 | | 11.0
Other Gas Segment | — | | — | | — 
Total Development Wells (Net) | 33.0 | | 29.0 | | 75.7

Exploratory Wells (Net) 
There were no net exploratory wells drilled during the year ended December 31, 2021. There were 2.0 and 5.0 net exploratory wells drilled during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. As of December 31, 2021, there are no net exploratory wells in process. The following table illustrates the exploratory wells drilled by well classification type: 

 | For the Year Ended December 31,

_________
* Still evaluating in 2020 included two wells that were drilled, completed, and were in process of being connected to production facilities at the end of the year and were turned in-line in early 2021. 
**Still evaluating in 2019 included one well that was partially constructed and the Company was trying to determine the most economic approach to access the natural gas reserves. During the year-ended December 31, 2021, the Company determined it would be more economical to access the underlying reserves from a different location and the costs associated with this well were recorded to Exploration and Production Related Other Costs in the Consolidated Statements of Income.
Reserves 
The following table shows our estimated proved developed and proved undeveloped reserves. Reserve information is net of royalty interest. Proved developed and proved undeveloped reserves are reserves that could be commercially recovered under current economic conditions, operating methods and government regulations. Proved developed and proved undeveloped reserves are defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). 

Net Reserves (Millions of Cubic Feet Equivalent) | As of December 31,
 | 2021 | 2020 | | 2019
Proved Developed Reserves | 5,905,611 | | 5,199,748 | | 4,838,858
Proved Undeveloped Reserves | 3,720,119 | | 4,350,010 | | 3,586,809
Total Proved Developed and Undeveloped Reserves (1) | 9,625,730 | | 9,549,758 | | 8,425,667

Discounted Future Net Cash Flows 
The following table shows our estimated future net cash flows and total standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows at 10%: 

 | As of December 31, 
 | 2021 | | 2020 | 2019
 | (Dollars in millions)
Future Net Cash Flows | $ | 16,017 | | $ | 6,313 | $ | 7,744

Total Standardized Measure of After-Tax Discounted Future Net Cash Flows | $ | 5,882 | | $ | 2,636 | $ | 3,070

____________
(1)    We calculate our present value at 10% (PV-10) in accordance with the following table. Management believes that the presentation of the non-Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) financial measure of PV-10 provides useful information to investors because it is widely used by professional analysts and sophisticated investors in evaluating oil and gas companies. Because many factors that are unique to each individual company impact the amount of future income taxes estimated to be paid, the use of a pre-tax measure is valuable when comparing companies based on reserves. PV-10 is not a measure of the financial or operating performance under GAAP. PV-10 should not be considered as an alternative to the standardized measure as defined under GAAP. We have included a reconciliation of the most directly comparable GAAP measure-after-tax discounted future net cash flows.
Reconciliation of PV-10 to Standardized Measure

___________
(1)    Based on the average, first day-of-the-month price. 
(2)    Future Development costs for 2021 include $406 million of plugging and abandonment costs and $185 million of Midstream capital on an undiscounted pre-tax basis. On a PV-10 pre-tax discounted basis, these amounts equate to $7 million and $154 million, respectively. Future development costs for 2020 include $402 million of plugging and abandonment costs and $287 million of Midstream capital on an undiscounted pre-tax basis. On a PV-10 pre-tax discounted basis, these amounts equate to $18 million and $232 million, respectively. The increase from 2019 was primarily due to the addition of Midstream capital as a result of the Merger that occurred on September 28, 2020 (See Note 4 - Acquisitions and Dispositions in the Notes to the Audited Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K).

*Oil, NGLs, and Condensate are converted to Mcfe at the rate of one barrel equals six Mcf based upon the approximate relative energy content of oil and natural gas. 
**See Part II. Item 7. “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in this Form 10-K for a breakdown of sales volume variances. 
CNX expects 2022 annual natural gas production volumes to be approximately 575-605 Bcfe.
Average Sales Price and Average Lifting Cost 
The following table sets forth the total average sales price and the total average lifting cost for all of our natural gas and NGL production for the periods indicated. Total lifting cost is the cost of raising gas to the gathering system and does not include depreciation, depletion or amortization. See Part II. Item 7. “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in this Form 10-K for a breakdown by segment. 

 | For the Year 
 | Ended December 31,
 | 2021 | | 2020 | 2019
Average Sales Price - Gas (Mcf) | $ | 3.55 | | $ | 1.71 | $ | 2.48

Average Sales Price - NGLs (Bbl) | $ | 33.90 | | $ | 13.74 | $ | 19.20
Average Sales Price - Oil/Condensate (Bbl) | $ | 56.34 | | $ | 35.88 | $ | 45.00

*Excludes the effect of hedge monetizations. 
**Oil, NGLs, and Condensate are converted to Mcfe at the rate of one barrel equals six Mcf based upon the approximate relative energy content of oil and natural gas.
Sales of NGLs, condensates and oil enhance our reported natural gas equivalent sales price. Across all volumes, when excluding the impact of hedging, sales of liquids added $0.15 per Mcfe, $0.04 per Mcfe, and $0.05 per Mcfe for 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively, to average gas sales prices. CNX expects to continue to realize a liquids uplift benefit as additional wells are turned-in-line, primarily in the liquid-rich areas of the Marcellus Shale. We continue to sell the majority of our NGLs through the large midstream companies that process our natural gas. This approach allows us to take advantage of the processors’ transportation efficiencies and diversified markets. Certain of CNX’s processing contracts provide for the ability to take our NGLs “in-kind” and market them directly if desired. The processed purity products are ultimately sold to industrial, commercial and petrochemical markets. 
In order to manage the market risk exposure of volatile natural gas prices in the future, CNX enters into various physical natural gas supply transactions with both gas marketers and end users for terms varying in length. Reserves and production estimates are believed to be sufficient to satisfy these obligations. In the past, we have delivered quantities required under these contracts. CNX also enters into various financial natural gas swap transactions to manage the market risk exposure to in-basin and out-of-basin pricing. These transactions exist parallel to the underlying physical transactions and represented approximately 470.0 Bcf of our produced gas sales volumes for the year ended December 31, 2021 at an average price of $2.51 per Mcf. The notional volumes associated with these gas swaps represented approximately 461.1 Bcf of our produced natural gas sales volumes for the year ended December 31, 2020 at an average price of $2.57 per Mcf. As of January 6, 2022, these physical and swap transactions represent approximately 470.8 Bcf of our estimated 2022 production at an average price of $2.45 per Mcf, 392.3 Bcf of our estimated 2023 production at an average price of $2.36 per Mcf, 344.6 Bcf of our estimated 2024 production at an average price of $2.25 per Mcf, approximately 273.4 Bcf of our estimated 2025 production at an average price of $2.23 per Mcf, and approximately 220.9 Bcf of our estimated 2026 production at an average price of $2.45 per Mcf.

CNX's hedging strategy and information regarding derivative instruments used are outlined in Part II. Item 7A. “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk” and in Note 19 - Derivative Instruments in the Notes to the Audited Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.
Midstream Gas Services 
CNX designs, builds and operates natural gas gathering systems to move gas from the wellhead to interstate pipelines or other local sales points. In addition, over time CNX has acquired extensive gathering assets through acquisitions. CNX owns or operates approximately 2,600 miles of natural gas gathering pipelines as well as a number of natural gas processing facilities. 
As a result of the Merger that occurred on September 28, 2020 (See Note 4 - Acquisitions and Dispositions in the Notes to the Audited Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K), CNX owns substantially all of its Shale gathering systems in Pennsylvania and West Virginia. With respect to CNX's Shale wells in Ohio, CNX primarily contracts with third-party gathering services. CNX also provides natural gas gathering services to third-parties.
CNX has developed a diversified portfolio of firm transportation capacity options to support its production. CNX plans to 
selectively acquire firm capacity on an as-needed basis, while minimizing transportation costs and long-term financial obligations. Optimization of our firm transportation portfolio may also include, from time to time and as appropriate, releasing firm transportation to others. CNX also benefits from the strategic location of our primary production areas in southwestern Pennsylvania, northern West Virginia and eastern Ohio. These areas are currently served by a large concentration of major pipelines that provide us with access to major gas markets without the necessity of transporting our natural gas out of the region. In addition to firm transportation capacity, CNX has developed a processing portfolio to support produced volumes from its wet gas production areas and has the operational and contractual flexibility to potentially convert a portion of currently processed wet gas volumes to be marketed as dry gas volumes, or vice-versa, as economically appropriate.

CNX has the advantage of having natural gas production from lower Btu wells in close proximity to higher Btu wells. Separately, the low Btu natural gas and the high Btu natural gas may need processing in order to meet downstream pipeline specifications. The geographic proximity and interconnected gathering system servicing these wells, allow CNX to blend this gas together and in some cases eliminate the need for the costly processing of natural gas that does not meet pipeline specification. This allow us more flexibility in bringing wells online at qualities that meet interstate pipeline specifications.
CNX also supplies turn-key solutions for water sourcing, delivery and disposal for our natural gas operations and supplies solutions for water sourcing as well as delivery and disposal for third parties. In coordination with our midstream operations, CNX works to develop solutions that coincide with our midstream operations to offer gas natural gathering and water delivery solutions in one package to third parties. 
Marketing
Substantially all of our natural gas is sold at market prices primarily under short-term sales contracts and is subject to seasonal and general market price swings. The principal markets for our natural gas are in the Appalachian Basin where we sell natural gas to gas marketers, industrial customers, local distribution companies, and power generation facilities. Our extensive hedge position mitigates unpredictability in pricing on hedged volumes.
We also incur gathering, compression, processing, and transportation expenses to move our natural gas production from the wellhead to our principal markets in the United States. Although we own midstream facilities, we also gather, process, and transport our natural gas to market by utilizing pipelines and facilities owned by others where we have long-term contractual capacity arrangements or use purchaser-owned capacity under both long-term and short-term sales contracts.
To date, we have not experienced significant difficulty in transporting or marketing our natural gas production as it becomes available; however, there is no assurance that we will always be able to transport and market all of our production.
CNX expects natural gas to continue to be a significant contributor to the domestic electric generation mix in the long term, as well as to fuel industrial growth in the U.S. economy. Continued demand for CNX's natural gas and the prices that CNX obtains are affected by natural gas use in the production of electricity, pipeline capacity, weather, U.S. manufacturing and the overall strength of the economy, environmental and government regulation, technological developments, the availability and price of competing alternative fuel supplies, and national and regional supply and demand dynamics.
Natural Gas Competition
CNX gas operations are primarily located in the eastern United States, specifically the Appalachian Basin, which is highly fragmented and not dominated by any single producer. We believe that competition among producers is based primarily on acreage position, drilling and operating costs as well as pipeline transportation availability to the various markets. CNX competes with other large producers, as well as a myriad of smaller producers and marketers. CNX also competes for pipeline capacity and other services to deliver its products to customers. 
Non-Core Mineral Assets and Surface Properties
CNX owns significant natural gas assets that are not in our short-term or medium-term development plans. We continually explore the monetization of these non-core assets by means of sale, lease, contribution to joint ventures or a combination of the foregoing in order to bring the value of these assets forward for the benefit of our shareholders. We also control a significant amount of surface acreage. This surface acreage is valuable to us in the development of the gathering system for our Shale production. We also derive value from this surface control by granting rights of way or development rights to third-parties when we are able to derive appropriate value for our shareholders.
Human Capital Management 
As of December 31, 2021, CNX had 441 employees, none of whom are subject to collective bargaining agreements. CNX recognizes that our future success depends on the expertise and services of our key employees. CNX is firmly committed to the health and safety of not only our employees and service providers, but also the communities in which CNX operates. 
Training and Education. CNX has a variety of initiatives dedicated to ensuring our employee and contractor workforce are appropriately trained and aligned on expectations regarding safety and environmental performance. These programs utilize behavior-based techniques which embrace a collaboration between management, employees, and the service provider workforce to continually focus attention and actions on appropriate daily safety behaviors. This is accomplished through an evergreen approach with constant evaluation and adaptation for workforce, safety, and business objectives. Fundamentally, daily on-site safety meetings, job safety analyses (JSA) and the universal expectation for any employee or contractor to stop work if a risk is identified help foster a cultural focus on Health, Safety, and Environmental (HSE) awareness, also known as Operational Excellence. Accountability is an expectation at all levels of the Company—from individual contributors and service providers to management and executive leadership. In addition to continual analysis and assessment, CNX empowers its employees and contractors to take corrective action or stop work immediately if adverse safety or environmental conditions are identified. CNX expects all of its employees and service providers to meet the training requirements outlined by OSHA, and all other appropriate regulatory entities, and to always conduct our daily business consistent with our core values of Responsibility, Ownership and Excellence. CNX also provides the opportunity for all employees to obtain certification in First Aid, CPR, and AED administration. The Company’s safety training content is published on its corporate website to afford service providers ready access to CNX’s expectation  of individual empowerment and accountability.
Diversity and Inclusion. CNX values diversity throughout the organization. The Company knows that a diverse, talented team working together in an inclusive culture is key to achieving long-term goals. In addition to prioritizing diversity within recruiting and hiring practices, CNX also believes in cultivating a culture sensitive to the importance of diversity in the workplace. In 2021, the Company provided Diversity and Inclusion training which was completed by 100% of its employee population. This course combined scenarios, personal interviews, discussion and exploration questions, exercises, and instruction content. Employees were exposed to potential cultural experiences of individuals with identities that may be different from their own, and had the opportunity to learn how others may experience the same workplace in very disparate ways. CNX intends to continue and expand Diversity and Inclusion training in 2022. Finally, a Diversity & Inclusion Advisory Council and cross-training rotational program for diverse employees were established to help support and augment the Company’s broader talent management and diversity goals. 
Employee Attraction and Retention. CNX recognizes the importance of attracting and retaining top talent to help drive the Company’s strategy forward. The Company is committed to attracting, developing, engaging, retaining, and rewarding a diverse team of highly skilled individuals dedicated to accountability, fairness, and respect. The continued success of CNX is not only contingent upon seeking out the best possible candidates, but, more importantly, retaining and developing the Company’s existing talent. CNX is proud to offer opportunities for employees to improve their skills and help achieve individual career goals, including continuing education assistance and professional development for employees pursuing advanced education, certifications, or skill building. Goal attainment and outstanding achievements contribute to the year-end discretionary incentive pay awarded to employees that perform above expectations.
Quality Management Systems. CNX is committed to fostering a culture of accountability and continuous improvement through the utilization of a Quality Management System (QMS), which strengthens accountability across the enterprise, and reinforces our core values of Responsibility, Ownership, and Excellence. QMS provides all employees, visitors, contractors and subcontractors who operate on our behalf with a practical, easily accessible system that defines clear expectations, responsibilities and standards that provide the basis of accountability for quality and excellence in all aspects of our business. QMS allows for continual identification, development of documentation control, and standardization of all processes and procedures throughout the organization. The elements of health, safety, environmental and quality control are housed in a unified system that allows for widespread utilization and measurement. CNX has formalized our approach in these areas to deliver results that are consistently safe, predictable and environmentally responsible. CNX will conduct regular internal and external audits to ensure compliance, adherence to best-in-class processes and continuous improvement, as we relentlessly strive to be the most responsible and efficient operator in the industry. CNX’s management expectation is that QMS will serve as the platform through which the senior leadership manages and measures excellence in all operational aspects.
Health and Safety. No job or activity is considered a success if CNX compromises the safety of its employees and contractors. Everyone working at CNX locations is empowered to stop work if they feel their safety or that of a coworker is at 
risk. CNX’s approach to employee stop work empowerment, while reactive when necessary, includes proactive measures such as procedural enhancements and communication. CNX promotes empowerment through new employee on-boarding, CNX Hazard Training compliance, and verification of contractor training and short service employee (SSE) program. Our safety professionals provide support throughout all phases of operation with education, training, policy development, audits and emergency preparedness and response. The evaluation of our health and safety performance is an ongoing, daily discussion. Key performance indicators are constantly monitored and analyzed for trends across operations. As trends are identified, CNX utilizes the information to amend policies, training and company-wide communication. The safety department, referred to as Operational Excellence, falls under the direction of the Chief Excellence Officer. The team takes a hybrid approach where a traditional safety group has been merged with an operation field compliance team to form the Operational Excellence department. The Vice President Operational Excellence briefs the Chief Excellence Officer on safety related issues, policy updates and performance trends regularly. Additionally, Operations executive management is kept up to date on safety-related items during weekly scheduled meetings. The Environmental, Safety and Corporate Responsibility (ESCR) Committee of the Board of Directors is kept apprised of safety related matters as needed and with monthly updates and quarterly meetings. CNX employs safety and health professionals with a variety of safety certifications such as an Occupational Health Nurse, Emergency Medical Technicians and Emergency Medical Responders. 
Emergency Preparedness and Response. Emergency response plans are developed for all CNX locations and operations. The plans are reviewed for effectiveness biannually and are communicated to affected employees through safety meetings and training. Drills and emergency exercises are conducted to ensure all employees understand their roles and responsibilities during an actual event. These exercises range from tabletop exercises to internal drills, up to and including events involving external resources. CNX actively engages with local municipalities and emergency responders to ensure they are aware of our planned activities. This helps to familiarize emergency response resources with CNX personnel, facilities and operations. This proactive approach gives emergency responders the opportunity to ask questions and understand CNX protocols so they are prepared in the case of an emergency.

Financial information concerning industry segments, as defined by GAAP, for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 is included in Note 21 - Segment Information in the Notes to the Audited Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K and is incorporated herein by reference.
Laws and Regulations
General
Our operations are subject to various federal, state and local (including county and municipal level) laws and regulations, with a heavy emphasis placed on compliance with environmental laws and regulations as a result of the nature of our business. These laws and regulations cover virtually every aspect of our operations including, among other things: transportation and use of public roads; construction of well pads, impoundments, tanks and roads; pooling and unitizations; water withdrawal and procurement for well stimulation purposes; well drilling, casing and hydraulic fracturing; stormwater management; well production; well plugging; venting or flaring of natural gas; pipeline construction and the compression and transmission of natural gas and liquids; reclamation and restoration of properties after natural gas operations are completed; handling, storage, transportation, treatment and disposal of materials used or generated by natural gas operations; the calculation, reporting and payment of taxes on gas production; and gathering of natural gas production. In addition to a variety of laws and regulations governing our natural gas operations, CNX is also subject to laws and regulations with respect to our employees, including health and safety regulations, and various financial and regulatory laws and regulations relating to our status as a public company, and our participation in derivative markets. 

Additionally, the electric power generation industry, which consumes significant quantities of natural gas, remains subject to extensive regulation regarding the environmental impact of its power generation activities, which could impact demand for our natural gas. 
In 2010, Congress adopted comprehensive financial reform legislation that established federal oversight and regulation of the OTC derivative market and entities, such as the Company, that participate in that market. The legislation, known as the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Dodd-Frank Act), required the CFTC, the SEC and other regulatory agencies to promulgate rules and regulations implementing this legislation. The CFTC has adopted and implemented final rules that impose regulatory obligations on all market participants, including the Company, such as recordkeeping, certain reporting obligations and other regulations relevant to natural gas hedging activities. However, it is still not possible at this time 
to predict the full extent of the impact of the regulations on the Company's hedging program or regulatory compliance obligations. 
CNX endeavors to conduct our natural gas and midstream operations in compliance with all applicable federal, state and local laws and regulations. However, because of extensive and comprehensive regulatory requirements against a backdrop of variable geologic and seasonal conditions, exceedances and violations of permits and other regulatory requirements during operations can and do occur. Such exceedances and violations generally result in fines or penalties but could also make it more difficult for us to obtain necessary permits in the future. The possibility exists that new legislation or regulations may be adopted which would have a significant impact on our operations or on our customers' ability to use our natural gas and may require us or our customers to change our or their operations significantly or incur substantial costs. See “Risk Factors -- Existing and future governmental laws, regulations and other legal requirements and judicial decisions that govern our business may increase our costs of doing business and may restrict our operations” for additional discussion regarding additional laws and regulations affecting our business, operations and industry.
The Company anticipates that compliance with existing laws and regulations governing the Company and its current operations will not have a material adverse effect upon its capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position. Additional proposals that affect the oil and natural gas industry are regularly considered by Congress, the states, regulatory agencies and the courts. The Company cannot predict when or whether any such proposals may become effective or the effect that such proposals may have on the Company.
Environmental Laws
Many of the laws and regulations referred to above are state-level environmental laws and regulations, which vary according to the state where CNX is operating. Our natural gas and midstream operations are also subject to numerous federal environmental laws and regulations.
In addition to routine reviews and inspections by regulators to confirm compliance with applicable regulatory requirements, CNX has established protocols for ongoing assessments to identify potential environmental exposures. These assessments take into account industry and internal best management practices and evaluate compliance with laws and regulations and include reviews of our third-party service providers, including, for instance, waste management transporters and related facilities.
Hydraulic Fracturing Activities. Hydraulic fracturing is typically regulated by state oil and natural gas commissions and similar agencies, but the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has asserted certain regulatory authority over hydraulic fracturing and has moved forward with various regulatory actions, including the issuance of regulations requiring green completions for hydraulically fractured wells, and has disclosed its intent to develop regulations to require companies to disclose information regarding the chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing. Some states, including states in which CNX operates, have adopted regulations that could impose more stringent disclosure and/or well construction requirements on hydraulic fracturing operations, or otherwise seek to ban some or all of these activities. Additionally, these and other federal requirements and proposals may be subject to further review and revision by the EPA.

Scrutiny of hydraulic fracturing activities also continues in other ways at the federal and local levels. For example, in June 2015, the EPA issued its draft report on the potential impacts of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water and groundwater. The draft report found no systemic negative impacts from hydraulic fracturing. In December 2016, the EPA released its final report on the impacts of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water. While the language was changed and included the possibility of negative impacts from hydraulic fracturing, it also included the guidance to industry and regulators on how the process can be performed. CNX cannot predict whether any other legislation or regulations will be enacted and, if so, what its provisions will be. 
Clean Air Act. The federal Clean Air Act and corresponding state laws and regulations regulate air emissions primarily through permitting and/or emissions control requirements. This affects natural gas production and processing operations. Various activities in our operations are subject to air quality regulation, including pipeline compression, venting and flaring of natural gas and hydraulic fracturing and completion processes, as well as fugitive emissions from operations. CNX obtains permits, typically from state or local authorities, to conduct these activities. Additionally, CNX is required to obtain pre-approval for construction or modification of certain facilities, to meet stringent air permit requirements, or to use specific equipment, technologies or best management practices to control emissions. Further, some states and the federal government have proposed that emissions from certain proximate and related sources should be aggregated to provide for regulation and permitting of a single, major source. Federal and state governmental agencies continue to investigate the potential for emissions from oil and natural gas activities and further regulation could increase our cost or temporarily restrict our ability to produce. 
For example, the EPA sets National Ambient Air Quality Standards for certain pollutants and changes to such standards could cause us to make additional capital expenditures or alter our business operations in some manner. See “Risk Factors - Climate change risk, legislation, litigation and regulation of greenhouse gas emissions at the federal or state level may increase our operating costs and reduce the value of our natural gas assets and such regulation, as well as uncertainty concerning such regulation and public policy pressures that may arise, could adversely impact the market for natural gas, as well as for our securities” for additional discussion regarding certain laws and regulations related to air emissions and related matters.
Clean Water Act. The federal Clean Water Act (CWA) and corresponding state laws affect our natural gas operations by regulating storm water or other regulated substance discharges, including pollutants, sediment and spills and releases of oil, brine and other substances, into surface waters (and under some state statutory schemes groundwater) and in certain instances imposing requirements to dispose of produced wastes and other oil and natural gas wastes at approved disposal facilities. The discharge of pollutants into jurisdictional waters is prohibited, except in accordance with the terms of a permit issued by the EPA, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, or a delegated state agency. These permits require regular monitoring and compliance with effluent limitations and reporting requirements and govern the discharge of pollutants into regulated waters. Federal and state regulatory agencies can impose administrative, civil and/or criminal penalties for non-compliance with discharge permits or other requirements of the CWA and analogous state laws and regulations. See “Risk Factors -Environmental regulations can increase costs and introduce uncertainty that could adversely impact the market for natural gas with potential short and long-term liabilities” for additional discussion regarding certain laws and regulations related to clean water, the disposal or use of water and related matters.
Endangered Species Act. The Endangered Species Act and related state laws and regulation protect plant and animal species that are threatened or endangered. Some of our operations are located in areas that are or may be designated as protected habitats for endangered or threatened species, including the Northern Long-Eared and Indiana bats, which has a seasonal impact on our construction activities and operations. New or additional species that may be identified as requiring protection or consideration may lead to delays in permits and/or other restrictions on construction and development.
Safety of Gas Transmission and Gathering Pipelines. Natural gas pipelines serving our operations are subject to regulation by the U.S. Department of Transportation’s Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) pursuant to the Natural Gas Pipeline Safety Act of 1968, (NGPSA), as amended by the Pipeline Safety Act of 1992, the Accountable Pipeline Safety and Partnership Act of 1996, the Pipeline Safety Improvement Act of 2002 (PSIA), the Pipeline Inspection, Protection, Enforcement and Safety Act of 2006 and the Pipeline Safety, Regulatory Certainty, and Job Creation Act of 2011. The NGPSA regulates safety requirements in the design, construction, operation and maintenance of natural gas pipeline facilities, while the PSIA establishes mandatory inspections for all U.S. oil and natural gas transmission pipelines in high-consequence areas. Additionally, certain states, such as West Virginia, also maintain jurisdiction over intrastate natural gas lines. These statutes and related regulations may be revised or amended which may lead to additional safety requirements. See “Risk Factors -- CNX may incur significant costs and liabilities as a result of pipeline operations and/or increases in the regulation of natural gas gathering pipelines” for additional discussion regarding gas transmission and gathering pipelines.
Resource Conservation and Recovery Act. The federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) and corresponding state laws and regulations affect natural gas operations by imposing requirements for the management, treatment, storage and disposal of hazardous and non-hazardous wastes, including wastes generated by natural gas operations. Facilities at which hazardous wastes have been treated, stored or disposed of are subject to corrective action orders issued by the EPA that could adversely affect our financial results, financial condition and cash flows. On December 28, 2016 the EPA entered into a consent order to resolve outstanding litigation brought by environmental and citizen groups regarding the applicability of RCRA to wastes from oil and gas development activities. In April 2019, the EPA issued a report pursuant to the consent order concluding that revisions to the federal regulations for the management of exploration and production wastes under RCRA were not necessary at the time the report was issued. CNX cannot predict whether the EPA may change its conclusion at some point, or whether any other legislation or regulations will be enacted and if so, what its provisions will be.
Federal Regulation of the Sale and Transportation of Natural Gas
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. Regulations and orders issued by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) impact our natural gas business to a certain degree. Although the FERC does not currently directly regulate our natural gas production activities, the FERC has stated that it intends for certain of its orders to foster increased competition within all phases of the natural gas industry. Additionally, the FERC has jurisdiction over the transportation of natural gas in interstate commerce, and regulates the terms, conditions of service and rates for the interstate transportation of our natural gas production. The FERC possesses regulatory oversight over natural gas markets, including anti-market manipulation regulation. The FERC has the ability to assess civil penalties, order disgorgement of profits and recommend criminal penalties for violations of the Natural Gas Act or the FERC’s regulations and policies thereunder.
Section 1(b) of the Natural Gas Act exempts natural gas gathering facilities from regulation by the FERC. However, the distinction between federally unregulated gathering facilities and FERC-regulated transmission facilities is a fact-based determination, and the classification of such facilities may be the subject of dispute and, potentially, litigation. CNX owns certain natural gas pipeline facilities that CNX believes meet the traditional tests which the FERC has used to establish a pipeline's status as a gatherer not subject to the FERC jurisdiction.
Natural gas prices are currently unregulated, but Congress historically has been active in the area of natural gas regulation. CNX cannot predict whether new legislation to regulate natural gas sales might be enacted in the future or what effect, if any, any such legislation might have on our operations. 
Health and Safety Laws
Occupational Safety and Health Act. Our natural gas operations are subject to regulation under the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSHA) and comparable state laws in some states, all of which regulate health and safety of employees at our natural gas operations. Additionally, OSHA's hazardous communication standard, the EPA community right-to-know regulations under Title III of the federal Superfund Amendment and Reauthorization Act and comparable state laws and regulations require that information be maintained about hazardous materials used or produced by our natural gas operations and that this information be provided to employees, state and local governments and the public.
Climate Change Laws and Regulations
Climate change continues to be an area of legislative and regulatory focus. There are a number of proposed and final laws and regulations intended to limit greenhouse gas emissions, and regulations that restrict emissions could increase our costs should the requirements necessitate the installation new equipment or the purchase of emission credits or allowances. These laws and regulations could also impact our customers, including the electric generation industry, making alternative sources of energy more competitive. Additional regulation could also lead to permitting delays and additional monitoring and administrative requirements, as well as to impacts on electricity generating operations. See “Risk Factors - Climate change risk, legislation, litigation and regulation of greenhouse gas emissions at the federal or state level may increase our operating costs and reduce the value of our natural gas assets and such regulation, as well as uncertainty concerning such regulation and public policy pressures that may arise, could adversely impact the market for natural gas, as well as for our securities” for additional discussion regarding certain laws and regulations related to climate change, greenhouse gas and related matters.
Title to Properties
CNX acquires ownership or leasehold rights to oil and natural gas properties prior to conducting operations on those properties. The legal requirements of such ownership or leasehold rights generally are established by state statutory or common law. As is customary in the natural gas industry, CNX has generally conducted only a summary review of the title to oil and gas rights that are not yet in our development plans, but which CNX believes it controls. This summary review is conducted at the time of acquisition or as part of a review of our land records. Prior to the commencement of development operations on natural gas and CBM properties, CNX conducts a thorough title examination and perform curative work with respect to significant title defects. Our discovering title defects which CNX is unable to cure may adversely impact our ability to develop those properties and CNX may have to reduce our estimated gas reserves including our proved undeveloped reserves. In accordance with the foregoing, CNX has completed title work on substantially all of our natural gas and CBM properties that are currently producing and believe that CNX has satisfactory title to our producing properties in accordance with standards generally accepted in the industry. See “Risk Factors - CNX may incur losses as a result of title defects in the properties in which CNX invests or the loss of certain leasehold or other rights related to our midstream activities.”
