ITEM 1. | BUSINESS
--------+---------

Overview 
 
Enterprise Diversified, Inc. (formerly White Dove Systems, Inc., Interfoods Consolidated, Inc., and then Sitestar Corporation, Inc.) was incorporated in Nevada on December 17, 1992. On June 1, 2018, the Company amended its Articles of Incorporation to change the name of the Company to “Enterprise Diversified, Inc.” The name change became effective on July 23, 2018, upon FINRA’s declaration. The Company elected to retain its historical trading symbol of “SYTE.” Unless the context otherwise requires, and when used in this Report, the “Company,” “ENDI,” “we,” “our,” or “us” refers to Enterprise Diversified, Inc. and its subsidiaries.
 
The Company operates through five reportable segments: Asset Management Operations, Real Estate Operations, Internet Operations, Home Services Operations, and Other Operations. Other Operations include corporate, legacy real estate, and investment activity that is not considered to be one of our primary lines of business. The management of the Company also continually reviews various investment opportunities, including those in other lines of business.
 
In previous periods, the Company reported under the following six business segments: Asset Management, Mt Melrose, HVAC, Internet, Real Estate, and Corporate. In an effort to highlight the direction of the Company and increase segment transparency, these historical segments were reorganized during the quarter ended June 30, 2018. The “Mt Melrose” segment is now referred to as “Real Estate” and the “HVAC” segment is now referred to as “Home Services.” Legacy “Real Estate”, “Corporate”, and other additional investments now are combined under “Other Operations”. The “Asset Management” and “Internet” segments remain unchanged.
 
The asset management segment includes revenues and expenses derived from various investment opportunities and partnerships. The real estate segment includes revenue and expenses related to the property management and real estate rental activities of the Mt Melrose portfolio of rental properties located in Lexington, Kentucky. The internet segment includes revenue and expenses related to the sale of internet access, hosting, storage, and other ancillary services. The home services segment includes revenue and expenses derived from the acquisition and management of HVAC and plumbing companies in Arizona. The other segment includes revenue and expenses related to the management of legacy properties held for investment and held for resale through EDI Real Estate. The other segment also includes revenue and expenses from nonrecurring investment opportunities such as Huckleberry Real Estate Fund II, LLC. Lastly, the other segment includes any revenue or expenses derived from corporate office operations, as well as expenses related to public company reporting, the oversight of subsidiaries, and other items that affect the overall Company.
 
Asset Management Operations
 
ENDI created a wholly owned asset management subsidiary on October 10, 2016, named Willow Oak Asset Management, LLC (“Willow Oak”). The asset management segment has been a growth area for the Company since its inception. Capital reallocations continue to be made to the subsidiary with long-term investment strategies being the primary focus. Willow Oak is an asset management platform oriented to the value-investing community. Value investing and knowledge of the global value-investing community are core competencies of the Company. Willow Oak intends to apply its core competencies to be a hub for the value-investing community with various forms of affiliations with respected value investment managers. Such affiliations to date include fund seeding and reinvestments, fund launching, portfolio management, and fund management. The Company intends to actively expand its Willow Oak platform with additional affiliations and services that enhance the value of the Willow Oak platform to all affiliated funds. Willow Oak currently operates one internal fund, Willow Oak Select Fund, LP, and has contractual affiliations with seven other respected value-oriented funds and managers. 
 
As previously reported in our Current Reports on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on September 19, 2016 and December 30, 2016, respectively, the Company agreed to make a seed investment totaling $10 million through Willow Oak in Alluvial Fund, LP, a private partnership that was launched on January 1, 2017. Willow Oak signed a fee share agreement on June 13, 2017, with Coolidge Capital Management, LLC (“Coolidge”), whose sole member is Keith D. Smith, who is also an ENDI director. Under the Agreement, Willow Oak Asset Management and Coolidge are the sole members of Bonhoeffer Capital Management LLC, the general partner to Bonhoeffer Fund, LP, a private investment partnership. Under their agreement, Willow Oak pays all start-up and operating expenses that are not partnership expenses under the limited partnership agreement. Willow Oak receives 50% of all performance and management fees earned by the general partner. On August 1, 2018, Willow Oak, through a newly organized, wholly owned subsidiary, Willow Oak Capital Management, LLC (“Willow Oak Capital Management”), launched a newly organized private investment partnership, Willow Oak Select Fund, LP (“Select Fund”). Select Fund focuses on investing in securities worldwide based upon “best ideas” submitted by various third-party fund managers comprising the Willow Oak fund manager alliance, some of whom may be affiliated with Willow Oak and/or the Company.
 
Willow Oak launched its fund management services (“FMS”) offering to external funds on November 1, 2018, when it signed a consulting services agreement with Arquitos Capital, a domestic and an offshore private investment fund controlled by Steven Kiel, a Company director. Willow Oak also provides FMS to the Bonhoeffer Fund and Willow Oak Select Fund. FMS consists of services not typically provided by traditional third-party providers to the hedge fund industry, including: access to the Willow Oak network, investor relations and marketing, administration and compliance, interface to traditional service providers, standard tools and best practices repository, and access to Willow-Oak-vetted third-party providers. Willow Oak offers FMS in consideration for a combination of fixed fees and a fee share. We believe we are uniquely situated to provide FMS to private hedge funds with a value-investing framework because our management and board of directors have extensive experience launching and managing value-orientated hedge funds. This experience enables us to focus on providing services that typically only the fund manager or in-house staff have the expertise to provide. FMS frees up managers to focus more time on the management of their investment portfolio. Joining the Willow Oak network also provides FMS customers with access to investment ideas from other Willow Oak network managers.
 
Real Estate Operations
 
The Company operates its real estate operations through Mt Melrose, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary that currently owns and operates a portfolio of residential and other income-producing real estate in Lexington, Kentucky, that was acquired pursuant to a certain Master Real Estate Asset Purchase Agreement entered into on December 10, 2017, with a like-named seller, Mt Melrose, LLC, a Kentucky limited liability company (“Old Mt. Melrose”). On January 10, 2018, Mt Melrose, LLC (“New Mt Melrose”) completed its first acquisition of 44 real properties under the agreement, and on June 29, 2018, Mt Melrose, LLC completed its second acquisition of 69 additional real properties under the agreement. However, during the quarterly period then ended December 31, 2018, the parties mutually agreed to terminate the Master Real Estate Asset Purchase Agreement—and no further acquisitions were consummated. A third-party property manager has been engaged as of November 1, 2018, to manage certain of the real properties previously acquired. Management has determined that it is necessary to right-size New Mt Melrose operations to reduce its level of high-interest debt. Accordingly, New Mt Melrose has begun to sell various properties with an emphasis on selling properties that have high-interest-rate loans and do not produce income. As of December 31, 2018, approximately $1.8 million of debt is secured by properties intended for sale. Upon completion of its right-sizing efforts, management expects New Mt Melrose to continue to own a sizable portfolio of income-producing properties in Lexington, Kentucky. 
Internet Operations
 
The Company operates its internet operations through Sitestar.net, a wholly owned subsidiary that offers consumer and business-grade internet access, wholesale managed modem services, web hosting, and various ancillary services. Sitestar.net provides services and support to customers in the United States and Canada.

Home Services Operations
 
The Company operates its home services operations through HVAC Value Fund, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary focused on the acquisition and management of HVAC and plumbing companies in Arizona. As of December 31, 2017, HVAC Value Fund had closed on six acquisitions for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $2.02 million, which included earn-outs of approximately $325,000. For all six acquisitions, all asset allocations made by management are final and all earn-outs have been paid in full as of December 31, 2018.
 
Other Operations
 
Other operations include legacy real estate, investment activity, and corporate activity that is not considered to be one of the Company’s primary lines of business.

Legacy real estate operations include activity from a real estate investment portfolio held through EDI Real Estate, LLC. The portfolio, primarily located in the Roanoke and Lynchburg areas of Virginia, includes residential properties and vacant land. The portfolio includes single-family homes that are currently rented and managed through a third-party property manager, as well as vacant properties being prepared or currently listed for sale.
 
Investment activity includes activity from various nonrecurring investment opportunities, such as the Company’s investment in Huckleberry Real Estate Fund II, LLC and its financing arrangement with Triad Guaranty, Inc. 
 
Corporate operations include any revenue or expenses derived from corporate office operations, as well as expenses related to public company reporting, the oversight of subsidiaries, and other items that affect the overall Company. ENDI may also invest in marketable securities through the corporate segment.

Asset Management Operations
 
The Company operates its asset management business through a wholly owned subsidiary, Willow Oak Asset Management, LLC. This subsidiary was formed on October 10, 2016. Asset management is a core competency of the Company with many members of management and the board having asset-management backgrounds. The asset management segment has been a growth area for the Company since its inception. Capital reallocations continue to be made to the subsidiary as we believe asset management funds and services present the highest potential for future revenue and income growth.
 
As of the year ended December 31, 2018, Willow Oak holds a direct investment in the Alluvial Fund. In accordance with GAAP, for financial reporting purposes, these investment gains and losses are reported as revenue on the accompanying consolidated statement of income. This treatment can result in reporting negative revenue numbers. Willow Oak also continues to earn revenue through fee share arrangements through both Alluvial Fund and Bonhoeffer Capital Management LLC, the general partner to Bonhoeffer Fund.
 
On August 1, 2018, Willow Oak, through a newly organized, wholly owned subsidiary, Willow Oak Capital Management, LLC (“Willow Oak Capital Management”), launched a newly organized private investment partnership, Willow Oak Select Fund, LP (“Select Fund”). Willow Oak Capital Management serves as the general partner of Select Fund. Select Fund focuses on investing in securities worldwide based upon “best ideas” submitted by various third-party fund managers comprising the Willow Oak fund manager alliance, some of whom may be affiliated with Willow Oak and/or the Company. Fund managers who have signed a fee share agreement with Willow Oak Capital Management and who have had their investment ideas selected by Select Fund’s investment manager for inclusion in the Select Fund portfolio share in a pool of, and receive allocations of, any performance fees Willow Oak Capital Management receives from limited partners in Select Fund (as determined after the end of each fiscal year of Select Fund), with such allocations being awarded to a fund manager in the form of equity interest in Select Fund (unless the parties mutually agree to a cash payment in lieu thereof), all in accordance with the terms and conditions of the respective fee share agreements. As of December 31, 2018, Willow Oak Capital Management has entered into fee share agreements with seven funds and managers.
 
Real Estate Operations
 
As previously reported in our Current Reports on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on December 11, 2017, January 17, 2018, March 2, 2018, March 28, 2018, and July 12, 2018, respectively, ENDI created a wholly owned subsidiary named Mt Melrose, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“New Mt Melrose”), on January 10, 2018, which has acquired a portfolio of residential and other income-producing real estate in Lexington, Kentucky, pursuant to a certain Master Real Estate Asset Purchase Agreement entered into on December 10, 2017, with a like-named seller, Mt. Melrose, LLC (“Old Mt. Melrose”), a Kentucky limited liability company owned by Jeff Moore, a former ENDI director. As set forth in our Form 8-K filed on January 17, 2018, on January 10, 2018, New Mt Melrose, consistent with the terms of the purchase agreement, completed a first acquisition from Old Mt. Melrose of 44 residential and other income-producing real properties located in Lexington, Kentucky. As further set forth in our Form 8-K filed on July 12, 2018, on June 29, 2018, New Mt Melrose, consistent with the terms of the purchase agreement, completed a second acquisition from Old Mt. Melrose of an additional 69 residential and other income-producing real properties located in Lexington, Kentucky.
 
As previously reported in our Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on November 5, 2018, pursuant to that certain Termination of Master Real Estate Asset Purchase Agreement entered into effective November 1, 2018, between the Company and Old Mt. Melrose, the parties mutually agreed to terminate the Master Real Estate Asset Purchase Agreement as of November 1, 2018. Accordingly, neither the Company nor New Mt Melrose have any further rights or obligations concerning additional acquisitions of real properties from Old Mt. Melrose under the Master Real Estate Asset Purchase Agreement. A third-party property manager has been engaged as of November 1, 2018, to manage certain of the real properties previously acquired. Management has determined that it is necessary to right-size New Mt Melrose operations to reduce its level of high-interest debt. Accordingly, New Mt Melrose has begun to sell various properties with an emphasis on selling properties that have high-interest-rate loans and do not produce income. As of December 31, 2018, approximately $1.8 million of debt is secured by properties intended for sale. Upon completion of its right-sizing efforts, management expects New Mt Melrose to continue to own a sizable portfolio of income producing properties in Lexington, Kentucky. 
 
Through New Mt Melrose, as of December 31, 2018, the Company owns a total of 159 units consisting of 97 units held for investment and 62 units held for sale. Units held for investment consist of single-family and multi-family residential rental units. Of the 97 units held for investment, 87 of the units are occupied or available to rent, and 10 of the units are vacant units being prepared to market to tenants. The leases in effect as of the year ended December 31, 2018, are based on either annual or multi-year time periods. Month-to-month leases are reserved for special circumstances. Units held for sale consist of single-family units, multi-family units, commercial properties, and undeveloped lots of land. As of December 31, 2018, New Mt Melrose holds 62 units as held for sale, ten of these units being undeveloped lots.

Internet Operations
 
Sitestar.net is an Internet Service Provider (ISP) that offers consumer and business-grade internet access, wholesale managed modem services for downstream ISPs, web hosting, and various ancillary services. We provide services to customers in the United States and Canada. This segment markets and sells narrow-band (dial-up and ISDN) and broadband services (DSL, fiber-optic, and wireless). Additionally, we market and sell web hosting and related services to consumers and businesses. We also offer broadband services within our regional and national footprint.
 
Our primary competitors include regional and national cable and telecommunications companies that have substantially greater market presence, brand-name recognition, and financial resources compared to Sitestar.net. Secondary competitors include local and regional ISPs.
 
The residential broadband internet access market is dominated by cable and telecommunications companies. These companies offer internet connectivity through the use of cable modems, Digital Subscriber Line (DSL) programs, and fiber. These competitors have extensive scale and significantly more resources than Sitestar.net. Competitors often offer incentives for customers to purchase internet access by offering discounts for bundled service offerings (i.e., phone, television, Internet). While we are a reseller of broadband services including DSL and fiber services, our profit margin is heavily influenced by these competitive forces.
 
There are currently laws and regulations directly applicable to access or commerce on the internet, covering issues such as user privacy, freedom of expression, pricing, characteristics and quality of products and services, taxation, advertising, intellectual property rights, information security, and the convergence of traditional telecommunications services with Internet communications. We may be positively or negatively affected by the repeal, modification, or adoption of various laws and regulations. These changes may occur at the international, federal, state, and local levels, and may cover a wide range of issues.
 
As of December 31, 2018, the focus of our internet segment is to generate cash flow, work to make our costs variable, and reinvest in our operations when an acceptable return is available. We did not make significant reinvestments into the internet segment during 2018; however, subsequent to December 31, 2018, management has begun working with outside consultants to establish a new business plan for the segment. The business plan is expected to include a formal marketing strategy with new products and services offerings in geographic areas that were previously unavailable to the segment. Management’s intent with this new business plan is to stop the decline of internet revenue by the end of 2019.
 
Management is currently identifying the market value for domain names owned by the Company in order to assess potential income opportunities. Management evaluates these domain names for third-party sales potential, as well as for other marketing opportunities that could generate new revenue from current customers who utilize the domains.
 
Home Services Operations
 
The Company operates its home services operations through HVAC Value Fund, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary focused on the acquisition and management of HVAC and plumbing companies in Arizona. After gaining experience with HVAC acquisitions, management noted the complementary nature of plumbing providers and completed two acquisitions where a significant amount of their revenue originated from plumbing services. As previously reported in our Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on June 14, 2016, we, along with JNJ Investments, LLC, an unaffiliated third-party and former member of HVAC Value Fund, LLC, organized and launched this subsidiary on June 13, 2016. On May 18, 2018, the Company terminated its operating agreement with JNJ Investments, LLC, dated June 13, 2016. ENDI has a 100% voting interest in HVAC Value Fund. Although the operating agreement provided JNJ Investments with the opportunity to earn non voting profit interests, the Company does not believe JNJ Investments earned any non voting profit interests during the term of the operating agreement because HVAC Value Fund did not exceed the profit thresholds under the operating agreement necessary for JNJ Investments to earn non voting profit interests.
 
HVAC Value Fund closed on five acquisitions totaling $1,455,000 during the year ended December 31, 2016, and one acquisition during the year ended December 31, 2017, totaling $560,000. As previously reported in our Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on June 14, 2016, and discussed further herein, the initial purpose of HVAC Value Fund was to acquire HVAC and plumbing businesses. Accordingly, all of our acquisitions were made in the ordinary course of business and consistent with the customs and practices (including with respect to nature, scope, magnitude, quantity, frequency, and contemplated purpose) of HVAC Value Fund, and, in turn, the Company. Our customer base consists of apartment communities, single family homes, condos, and property management companies, with a small portion of our work falling into the commercial category.
 
The Company does not currently anticipate making additional home services acquisitions because results to date in the segment have not met management’s expectations, and the home services industry is not a core competency of the Company. Management believes allocating capital to higher potential segments that are a core competency of the Company, such as Asset Management Operations, is a better capital allocation strategy.

Other Operations
 
EDI Real Estate Operations
 
ENDI created a wholly owned real estate subsidiary on July 10, 2017, named EDI Real Estate, LLC to hold ENDI’s legacy portfolio of real estate. As of December 31, 2018, we owned nine residential properties and interests in several undeveloped lots. This compares to December 31, 2017, when we owned ten residential properties, one commercial property, and interests in several undeveloped lots. In 2008, the Company had implemented a program to redirect cash generated from the internet operations into the purchase and renovation of real estate. This program was terminated with the change in management on December 14, 2015. As of December 14, 2015, several real estate agents and investors were engaged to determine the marketability of our properties. Repair work ceased until a more thorough review for each property could be completed to determine the most profitable course forward. Prior to year-end 2015, a list of properties was assigned to a real estate agent. Additionally, during 2016 and 2017, we entered into negotiations with several investors to sell various properties. Many of these properties were held for resale by prior management, but prior marketing activity was poor. As of December 31, 2018, nearly all of these properties have been successfully sold. 
 
Through EDI Real Estate, we own nine rental properties managed by a third-party property management company. As of December 31, 2018, we had six properties available for rent, with five properties being occupied. The unoccupied unit is in the process of being turned over for new tenants. Three additional properties are undergoing renovations with the intention to have them ready for rent during 2019. The leases in effect as of the year ended December 31, 2018, are based on either annual or multi-year time periods and include month-to-month provisions after the completion of the initial term. The property management company has introduced updated and renewed leases for existing rental properties.
 
State and municipal laws and regulations govern the real estate industry and do not vary significantly from one community to another. State laws, including the Virginia Residential Landlord and Tenant Act, in addition to local ordinances, govern rental properties and also do not vary significantly throughout our real estate holding areas.
 
Corporate Operations
 
Corporate operations include any revenue or expenses derived from corporate office operations, as well as expenses related to public company reporting, oversight of the subsidiaries, and other items that affect the overall Company. ENDI may also invest in marketable securities or enter into investment partnerships through the corporate segment..
Employees
 
As of March 28, 2018, we employed seven full-time individuals through the asset management, real estate, internet, and other segments, and 12 full-time employees and one part-time employee through the home services segment. We also utilize outside contractors as necessary to assist with financial reporting, technical support, and customer service. Our employees are not unionized, and we consider relations with employees to be favorable.
