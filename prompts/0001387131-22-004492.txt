Cautionary Note Regarding Forward Looking Statements
 
This Annual Report on Form 10-K contains certain statements that are “forward-looking” within the meaning of the federal securities laws. These forward- looking statements and other information are based on our beliefs as well as assumptions made by us using information currently available.
 
The words “anticipate,” “believe,” “estimate,” “expect,” “intend,” “will,” “should” and similar expressions, as they relate to us, are intended to identify forward- looking statements. Such statements reflect our current views with respect to future events and are subject to certain risks, uncertainties, and assumptions, and are not guaranties of future performance. Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may vary materially from those described herein as anticipated, believed, estimated, expected, intended, or using other similar expressions.
 
We are making investors aware that such forward-looking statements, because they relate to future events, are by their very nature subject to many important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by the forward-looking statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ from our predictions include those discussed under “Risk Factors,” “Management’s Discussion and Analysis” and “Business.” Although we have sought to identify the most significant risks to our business, we cannot predict whether, or to what extent, any of such risks may be realized, nor can there be any assurance that we have identified all possible issues which we might face. In addition, assumptions relating to budgeting, marketing, product development and other management decisions are subjective in many respects and thus susceptible to interpretations and periodic revisions based on actual experience and business developments, the impact of which may cause us to alter our marketing, capital expenditure or other budgets, which may in turn affect our financial position and results of operations. For all these reasons, the reader is cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements contained herein, which speak only as of the date hereof. We assume no responsibility to update any forward-looking statements because of new information, future events, or otherwise except as required by law. We urge readers to carefully review the risk factors described in this Annual Report and in the other documents that we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

COVID-19 
 
The Company has considered the effects of COVID-19 in the preparation of the financial statements as of and for the period ended December 31, 2021. We have been able to continue providing services to our current customer base and have not yet experienced a slowdown in collections.
 
On March 27, 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act (the “Act”) was enacted. The CARES Act is an approximately $2 trillion emergency economic stimulus package in response to the coronavirus outbreak, which among other things contains numerous income tax provisions. Some of these tax provisions were retroactively effective for years ending before the date of enactment.
 
Current Products and Services
 
CareView Patient Safety System
 
Our CareView Patient Safety System provides innovative ways to increase patient protection, provides advanced solutions that lower operational costs, and helps hospitals foster a culture of safety among patients, staff, and hospital leadership. We understand the importance of providing high quality patient care in a safe environment and believe in partnering with hospitals to improve the quality of patient care and safety by providing a system that monitors continuously. We are committed to providing an affordable video monitoring tool to improve the practice of nursing, create a better work environment and make the patient’s hospital stay more satisfying. Our suite of products and services can simplify and streamline the task of preventing and managing patients’ falls, enhance patient safety, improve quality of care, and reduce costs. Our products and services can be used in all types of hospitals, nursing homes, adult living centers, and selected outpatient care facilities domestically and internationally.
 
The CareView Patient Safety System includes CareView’s SitterView®, providing a clear picture of up to 40 patients at once, allowing staff to intervene and document patient risks more quickly. SitterView features intuitive decision support pathway, guiding staff alarm response and pan- tilt-zoom functionality, allowing staff to home in on areas of interest. CareView’s new Analytics Dashboard provides real-time metrics on utilization, compliance, and outcome data by day, week, month, and quarter. Outcomes are automatically compared to organizational goals to evaluate real-time ROI.
 
CareView’s next generation of in-room camera; the CareView Controller features an HD camera, high- fidelity 2-way audio, and an LCD display, harnessing increased performance to deliver the ultimate in capability, flexibility, and affordability for all types of hospitals. Building on top of CareView’s patented Virtual Bed Rails and Virtual Chair Rails predictive technology, the CareView Controller uses machine learning to differentiate between normal patient movements and behaviors of a patient at risk. This technology results in less false alarms, faster staff intervention, and a significant reduction in patient falls.

The CareView Controller is available in multiple configurations for permanent or temporary situations, the CareView Mobile, Portable, and Fixed Controller. For situations that demand that the camera come to the patient, the CareView Mobile Controller on wheels comes with an uninterrupted external power supply for situations where power may not be readily available and can operate on the facility’s wireless network. For monitoring patients within a general care unit, the CareView Portable Controller can be easily removed from mounts and moved where the workflow dictates, making this application perfect for general use. For high-risk patient rooms where behavior and self-harm may be a factor, or where a patient must be continuously monitored, the CareView fixed Controller can be installed seamlessly in the ceiling tiles leaving no exposed wiring making it ligature resistant.
 
The CareView Patient Safety System can be easily configured to meet the individual privacy and security requirements of any hospital or nursing facility. CareView is (“HIPAA”) compliant and HITRUST certified. Additional HIPAA-compliant features allow privacy options to be enabled at any time by the patient, nurse, or physician.
 
CareView Patient Safety System Products and Services Agreement with Healthcare Facilities
 
CareView’s subscription-based model is offered to healthcare facilities through a Products and Services Agreement (the “P&S Agreement(s)”). During the term of the P&S Agreement, we provide continuous monitoring of the CareView Patient Safety System products and services deployed to a healthcare facility, and maintain and service all equipment installed by us. Under the subscription-based model, terms of each P&S Agreement require the healthcare facility to pay us a monthly fee based on the number of selected, installed, and activated services. None of the services provided through the Primary Package are paid or reimbursed by any third-party provider including insurance companies, Medicare, or Medicaid. We also enter into corporate-wide agreements with healthcare companies (the “Master Agreement(s)”), wherein the healthcare companies enter into individual facility level agreements that are substantially like our P&S Agreements.
 
Master Agreements and P&S Agreements are currently negotiated for a period of five years with a minimum of two or three years; however, older P&S Agreements were negotiated for a five-year period with a provision for automatic renewal. P&S Agreements specific to pilot programs (“P&S Pilot Agreements”) contain pricing terms substantially like P&S Agreements, are generally three or six-months in length and can be extended on a month-to-month basis as required. Regarding the subscription-based model, we own all rights, title, and interest in and to the equipment we install at each location and agree to maintain and repair it; although, we may charge for repairs or replacements due to damage or misuse. We are not responsible for maintaining data arising from use of the CareView Patient Safety System or for transmission errors, corruption or compromise of data carried over local or interchange telecommunication carriers. We grant each healthcare facility a limited, revocable, non-transferable, and nonexclusive license to use the software, network facilities, content, and documentation on and in the CareView Patient Safety System to the extent, and only to the extent, necessary to access, explore and otherwise use the CareView Patient Safety System in real time. Such non-exclusive license expires upon termination of the P&S Agreement.
 
We use specific terminology to better define and track the staging and billing of the individual components of the CareView Patient Safety System. The CareView Patient Safety System includes three components which are separately billed; the CareView Controller (previously known as RCP), the CareView SitterView Monitor, and the CareView Application Server (each component referred to as a “unit”). The term “bed” refers to each healthcare facility bed as part of the overall potential volume that a healthcare facility represents. For example, if a healthcare facility has 200 beds, the aggregate of those beds is the overall potential volume of that healthcare facility. The term “bed” is often used interchangeably with “CareView Controller” as this component of the CareView Patient Safety System consistently resides within each room where the “bed” is located. On average, there are six SitterView Monitors for each 100 beds. The term “deployed” means that the units have been delivered to the healthcare facility but have not yet been installed at their respective locations within the facility. The term “installed” means that the units have been mounted and are operational. The term “billable” refers to the aggregate of all units on which we charge fees. Units become billable once they are installed and the required personnel have been trained in their use. Units are only deployed upon the execution of a P&S Agreement or P&S Pilot Agreement.

CareView Patent Safety System Sales-Based Model
 
CareView’s sales-based model has commenced with the introduction of our updated technology. CareView has also aligned its contracting model to meet the preferred acquisition model in the hospital industry. CareView now sells its proprietary equipment to facilities in lieu of lending the equipment as defined above, under the subscription-based model. In doing so, the facility is billed for the hardware on acceptance of the contract. After CareView’s equipment is delivered to the facility, CareView begins the process of installing and securely integrating the equipment and software. Upon completion of installation, training, and “go-live”; referring to all systems in full operation, CareView bills the facility for the installation, training, and an annual software license fee. CareView will continue to bill the facility an annual software license fee until end of the contract. The shift in our new contracting model has an immediate impact on the company’s operations resulting in greater cash flow within 30 days of contract signing.
 
CareView continues its dedication to provide service and support on a 24x7x365 basis for every customer under the prior and updated revenue models.
 
CareView Connect®
 
Our mission is to be the leading provider of resident monitoring products and services for the long-term care industry. We took what we learned in our medical facility business and applied it to developing a product to serve the long-term care market. With CareView Connect Quality of Life System (“CareView Connect”), CareView has again positioned itself as a technology leader with its innovative suite of products specifically designed for all aspects of the long-term care market, including Nursing Care, Home Care, Assisted Living and Independent Living.
 
With this mission in mind, in the second quarter of 2018, the Company introduced a new sensor product that has application in both the assisted living center market and the home health market. CareView Connect leverages both passive and active sensors to track the activities of daily life. CareView Connect provides peace of mind by using data from the resident’s activity, existing conditions, and environment to notify a caregiver of potential emergencies and identify the need for dignified support. CareView Connect consists of a small emergency assist button, two motion sensors, one sleep sensor, and one event sensor. Resident activity levels, medication administration, sleep patterns, and requests for assistance can all be monitored depending on which options are selected.
 
The skilled nursing home market consists of approximately 2,000,000 beds, which is double the size of the current hospital/healthcare facility bed market. The assisted living center market is even larger at approximately 3,000,000 beds. Our products flow naturally into the nursing home space as it is substantially the same setting as hospital rooms.
 
CareView Connect is a platform consisting of several products and applications targeted at improving level of care and efficiency. CareView is building a cohesive and tightly integrated solution that solves several problems that long-term care facilities face. We offer an array of wearable and stationary buttons that allow a resident to summon help either for an emergency or assistance, which can be anything from toileting help to assistance putting on their shoes. We offer a mobile app capable of delivering an alert to the caregiver and allows them document information around that alert. This allows for workflows and reports around the alerts, i.e. how long before the alert was handled, what was the cause of the alert, and if it was not acknowledged in a timely manner then the alert is escalated to another individual or group. This ensures that every alert is responded to timely and is verifiable. In addition, the caregiver usually is carrying out a litany of daily activities directed at each facility resident.
 
Alert Management and Monitoring System
 
CareView Connect provides a suite of hardware and software that facilitate a data-driven solution for alert management and monitoring. CareView Connect’s solution provides additional context, including location of the resident, which improves response time by the staff. The alert system includes a documentation platform that allows the facility’s staff to classify reason for alerts and provides metrics around response time. CareView Connect’s solution involves several passive sensors that monitor the resident.
 
6


Caregiver Platform
 
The caregiver platform includes a “Leave of Absence” component, which allows the facility to document when the resident is outside of their room for a duration of time. This information is incorporated with known data from the workflows and sensors to improve awareness. The Caregiver Connect mobile application provides a convenient and intuitive interface to the CareView Connect platform. The caregiver can use the mobile app to capture important information and interface with critical workflows, such as acknowledging and documenting alert presses by the resident. CareView Connect also provides a product focused on capturing and measuring the mental state and pain experienced by the resident. “How are you feeling today?” provides a convenient way to capture information about the mental state of the resident using emojis. Similarly, “What is your pain today?” allows the staff to categorize and document pain. Connect Resident is a tablet application intended for the resident’s direct use. This product currently supports video conferencing with a remote caregiver, becoming a communications conduit for telehealth. Connect Resident also supports “How are you feeling today?”, which allows the resident to submit this information directly.
Quality of Life Metrics
 
CareView is developing its own algorithm for measuring quality of life based on “best of breed” research and leveraging the data collected by the platform. CareView Connect’s Quality of Life Metrics focuses on several categories, including Physical Activity, Bodily Pain, General Health, Vitality, Social Interaction, Mental Health, and Sleep Quality. Leveraging this data, the facility and their staff have improved visibility into the health and well-being of their residents. By applying machine learning and predictive analytics, subtle patterns and trends that may not otherwise be visible become actionable. The facility can use this information to present a more compassionate and capable level of care, differentiating the facility from their competition. The Quality of Life Metrics information can be made available to the family and loved ones, opening a new channel of remote awareness and care. Because the information is collected automatically, the family gains awareness on issues of which their loved ones may normally be unaware. The Connect Family mobile application allows family members to monitor their loved one and receive alerts and notifications based on their preferences.
Pricing Structure and Revenue Streams
 
The CareView Connect suite of products and services offers multiple pricing models. We work with each facility on pricing to offer an affordable package based on the demographics of the residents of the facility. The pricing structure with each facility is negotiated separately. Typically, we offer the CareView Connect basic package at a price per monitored room with varying price structures based on number of sensors and number of residents in each facility.
Purchasing Agreement with Decisive Point Consulting Group, LLC
 
On February 2, 2021, we partnered with Decisive Point Consulting Group, a Department of Veterans Affairs Contractor Verification Enterprise (CVE) and a Verified Service-Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business (SDVOSB), to expand our reach within the VA hospitals and Community Living Centers space. Our partnership reflects our desire to collaborate with companies that share our vision of patient safety.

General Service Administration Multiple Award Schedule
 
Pursuant to the terms of the Company’s General Service Administration (“GSA”) Multiple Award Schedule contract (“MAS”), the MAS allows us to sell the CareView Patient Safety System at a negotiated rate to the approximate 169 United States Department of Veterans Affairs (“VA”) facilities with over 39,000 licensed beds and the approximate 42 DOD hospitals with over 2,600 licensed beds. The updated contracting model was added to the MAS, which allows us to sell the proprietary hardware and license the software on an annualized basis. The MAS is one of the most widely accepted government contract vehicles available to agency procurement officers. GSA’s application process requires potential vendors to be recognized as highly credible and well established. CareView is a sole source provider. Our products and services represent an enormous opportunity to improve the health and safety of our Nation’s veterans.
Group Purchasing Agreement with HealthTrust Purchasing Group, LP
 
On December 14, 2016, the Company entered a Group Purchasing Agreement with HealthTrust Purchasing Group, L.P. (“HealthTrust”) (the “HealthTrust GPO Agreement”), the nation’s only committed-model Group Purchasing Organization (“GPO”) headquartered in Nashville, Tennessee. HealthTrust serves approximately 1,600 acute care facilities and members in more than 26,000 other locations, including ambulatory surgery centers, physician practices, long-term care, and alternate care sites. The agreement was effective on January 1, 2017 and all CareView Patient Safety System components and modules are available for purchase by HealthTrust’s exclusive membership. HealthTrust members may order CareView’s products and services included in the agreement directly from CareView.
 
On October 1, 2018, the Company added CareView Connect to the HealthTrust GPO Agreement.
 
On November 1, 2020, the updated contracting model has been added to the HealthTrust GPO Agreement which allows us to sell the proprietary hardware and license the software on an annualized basis.
 
Summary of Product and Service Contracts
 
Our contracts typically include multiple combinations of our products, software solutions, and related services with multiple payment options. Customers can continue to lease our equipment under our subscription model or can purchase our equipment upfront under our recently implemented sales-based contract model with an auto-renewal at the end of each contract period. The new sales-based contract offers our customers the flexibility of capitalizing on their investment, which in turn, replenishes our cash reserves. For the years ended December 31, 2021, and 2020, the Company executed sales-based contracts with an aggregated contract sales price of $5,600,000 and $1,800,000.
Availability of Suppliers
 
We are not dependent on, nor do we expect to become dependent on, any one or a limited number of suppliers. We purchase parts and components to assemble our equipment and products. We do not manufacture or fabricate our own products or systems but rely on sub-suppliers and third-party vendors to procure and/or fabricate components based on our designs, engineering, and specifications. Along with our employee installers, we enter subcontracts for field installation of our products which we supervise. We manage all technical, physical, and commercial aspects of the performance of our contracts with sub-suppliers and third-party vendors. To date, we have experienced no difficulties in obtaining fabricated components, materials, and parts or in identifying qualified subcontractors for installation work.

Sales, Marketing and Customer Service
 
We do not consider our business to be seasonal; however, the availability of hospital staff is typically less available in December which impacts our ability to sell/install our CareView Patient Safety System. We generate sales leads through a variety of means including direct one-to-one marketing, email and web campaigns, customer and industry referrals, strategic partnerships, and trade shows and events. Our sales team consists of highly trained professionals with many years of experience in the healthcare market.
 
Our initial focus has been to pursue large for-profit hospital management companies that own multiple facilities and large not-for-profit integrated delivery networks in major metropolitan areas. Our sales staff approaches decision makers for hospitals, integrated delivery networks, and major owners and operators of hospitals to demonstrate the CareView product line. Our sales process includes an inside sales team and we have expanded our capabilities of providing web-based demonstrations and presentations. We also have begun to rely more heavily on arranging reference calls and site visits between our current customers and our prospects. These efforts have provided a higher volume of qualified sales leads and have resulted in more substantive conversations with a larger number of prospects.
 
We ensure high levels of customer service through our account representatives and our technical support processes. We attempt to position our account representatives geographically close to our customer hospitals to allow them to make regular visits to proactively train staff and address any issues. We offer 24/7 monitoring and phone support through our technical support team which allows us to quickly identify and resolve any technical issues. From time to time, we are called upon to service the installed hardware at customer facilities. To facilitate expedient service, our account representatives typically maintain a small supply of CareView Controllers should they need repair or replacement. Historically, our CareView Controllers and Nursing Station units have required little, if any, servicing. We believe that we handle requests quickly and efficiently, and that overall, our customers are satisfied with our level of service.
 
Intellectual Property
 
Our success depends, in part, on our ability to obtain patents, maintain trade secret protection and operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others. Our intellectual property portfolio is one of the means by which we attempt to protect our competitive position. We rely primarily on a combination of know- how, trade secrets, patents, trademarks, and contractual restrictions to protect our products and to maintain our competitive position. We are constantly seeking ways to protect our intellectual property through registrations in relevant jurisdictions.
 
We have received patents from the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and have numerous patents pending. We intend to file additional patent applications when appropriate; however, we may not file any such applications or, if filed, the patents may not be issued. We also have numerous registered trademarks.
 
We intend to aggressively prosecute, enforce, and defend our patents, trademarks, and proprietary technology. The loss, by expiration or otherwise, of anyone patents may have a material effect on our business. Defense and enforcement of our intellectual property rights can be expensive and time consuming, even if the outcome is favorable to us. It is possible that the patents issued to or licensed to us will be successfully challenged, that a court may find that we are infringing validly issued patents of third parties, or that we may have to alter or discontinue the development of our products or pay licensing fees to consider patent rights of third parties.
 
Agreement with Rockwell Holdings I, LLC
 
On November 16, 2009, we entered into a Master Investment Agreement (the “Rockwell Agreement”) with Rockwell Holdings I, LLC, a Wisconsin limited liability (“Rockwell”). Under the terms of the Rockwell Agreement, we used funds from Rockwell to fully implement the CareView Patient Safety System™ in Hillcrest Medical Center in Tulsa, Oklahoma (“Hillcrest”) and Saline Memorial Hospital in Benton, Arkansas (“Saline”) (the “Project Hospital(s)”). CareView-Hillcrest, LLC and CareView-Saline, LLC were created as the operating entities for the Project Hospitals under the Rockwell Agreement (the “Project LLC(s)”).
 
9


On January 31, 2017, under the terms of the Rockwell Agreement, wherein we have the option to purchase Rockwell’s interest in the Project LLCs, we exercised that right by entering into a Settlement and LLC Interest Purchase Agreement with Rockwell (the “Settlement Agreement). Pursuant to the terms of the Settlement Agreement, we paid Rockwell the aggregate amount of $1,213,786 by the issuance of a promissory note to Rockwell for $1,113,786 (the “Rockwell Note”) and a cash payment of $100,000. Pursuant to the terms of the Rockwell Note, we will make quarterly principal payments of $100,000, with each payment being made on the last day of each calendar quarter beginning with the first payment date of March 31, 2017 and continuing the last business day of each subsequent calendar quarter through September 30, 2019. The final payment due on December 31, 2019 was to be a balloon payment of $13,786 representing the remaining principal balance plus all accrued and unpaid interest. The Company entered an amendment (the “Rockwell Note Amendment”) to the Company’s Promissory Note to Rockwell Holdings I, LLC (“Rockwell”) dated as of January 31, 2017 (the “Rockwell Note”), pursuant to which Rockwell agreed to defer $50,000 of each $100,000 quarterly payment due under the Rockwell Note from January 1, 2018 through the present termination of the Modification Period. On December 31, 2019, the Company and Rockwell entered a Second Amendment to the Rockwell Note (the “Second Rockwell Note Amendment”) pursuant to which Rockwell agreed to extend the term of the Rockwell Note by one year, to December 31, 2020, and agreed to extend the time to make the quarterly payment that would otherwise be due on December 31, 2019 to January 31, 2020.
 
Effective as of January 31, 2020, the Company and Rockwell entered a Third Amendment to the Rockwell Note (the “Third Rockwell Note Amendment”), pursuant to which Rockwell agreed to extend the time to make the quarterly payment that would otherwise be due on December 31, 2019 from January 31, 2020 to February 10, 2020. The final balloon payment representing the remaining principal plus all accrued and unpaid interest is due on December 31, 2020.
 
Effective as of March 31, 2020, the Company and Rockwell entered a Fourth Amendment to the Rockwell Note (the “Fourth Rockwell Note Amendment”), pursuant to which Rockwell agreed to extend the time to make the quarterly payment that would otherwise be due on March 31, 2020 to April 16, 2020.
 
Effective as of December 31, 2020, the Company and Rockwell entered a Fifth Amendment to the Rockwell Note (the “Fifth Rockwell Note Amendment”), pursuant to which Rockwell agreed to extend the term of the Rockwell Note by one year, to December 31, 2021, and agreed to extend the time to make the quarterly payment that would otherwise be due on December 31, 2020 to March 31,2021. The final balloon payment representing the remaining principal plus all accrued and unpaid interest is due on December 31, 2020. We have evaluated the Fifth Amendment to the Rockwell Note under ASC 470 and determined that the amendment should be treated as a debt modification. We were not in default of any conditions under the Settlement Agreement and the Rockwell Note as amended as of December 31, 2020.
 
Effective as of November 30, 2021, the Company and Rockwell entered into a Sixth Amendment to the Rockwell Note (the “Sixth Rockwell Note Amendment”), pursuant to which Rockwell agreed to extend the term of the Rockwell Note by three months, to March 31, 2022, and agreed that the quarterly principal payment that would otherwise be due on December 31, 2021, will not be required to be made until March 31, 2022.
 
As additional consideration to Rockwell for entering into the Rockwell Agreement, we granted Rockwell Warrants to purchase 1,151,206 shares of our Common Stock on the date of the Rockwell Agreement, and, using the Black-Scholes Model, valued the Warrants at $1,124,728 (the “Project Warrant”), which amount was fully amortized at December 31, 2015. Pursuant to the terms of the Settlement Agreement, the expiration date of the Project Warrant was extended from November 16, 2017 to November 16, 2022. All other provisions of the Project Warrant remained unchanged. At the time of the extension, the Project Warrant were revalued resulting in a $11,512 increase in fair value, which has been recorded as non-cash costs included in general and administration expense in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2017. Effective February 2, 2018, pursuant to the terms of the PDL Modification Agreement, we entered an amendment to the Project Warrant wherein the Project Warrant’s exercise price was changed from $0.52 to $0.05, resulting in a $13,814 increase in fair value, this transaction was recorded as non-cash costs included in general and administration expense in the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2018.

Installation and Technical Support
 
Along with our employee installers and technical support staff, we provide installation and technical support for our customers through third-party providers located across the United States that we contract on a per-job basis.
Competition
 
We offer a unique solution to clinical video monitoring, sitter reduction, and fall prevention by leveraging our patented Virtual Bed Rails and Virtual Chair Rails technology. This technology allows an individual to watch more patients with a higher level of safety than they could without. We have competitors in clinical video monitoring; however, we believe that we offer a superior solution that provides for best ROI, reduction in patient falls, and reduction and sitter requirements. We compete with them based on price, engineering and technological expertise, knowledge, and the quality of our products, systems, and services. Additionally, we believe that the successful performance of our installed products and systems is a key factor in retaining current business and gaining new business as customers typically prefer to make significant purchases from a company with a solid performance history.
 
Clinical Video Monitoring and Fall Prevention: Cisco Systems, Inc., Avasure (a division of AvaSure Holdings, Inc.), Caregility, Royal Philips Electronics and Cerner Corporation all provide clinical video monitoring tools. Cisco offers Virtual Patient Observation, a video monitoring tool aimed at reducing sitter costs and preventing patient falls. AvaSure and Caregility offer a similar application using cameras mounted on a rolling camera stand, aimed at preventing patient falls. Philips offers the eICU product, which primarily targets a high-definition monitoring of patients in intensive-care applications and provides telephonic consults. Cerner offers the Cerner Patient Observer product, which uses depth sensors aimed at preventing patient falls.
 
Alternative fall prevention mechanisms include physical sensors manufactured by Stanley and Posey, and beds which include fall alarms manufactured by Stryker and Hill-Rom. Customers may consider these physical fall prevention mechanisms to be alternatives to a video-based fall prevention system such as the one we offer.
 
We believe we also compete based on the success of our products and services which provide our customers with:
 
• significant and tangible cost savings,
• reductions in patient falls, 
 • improved documentation, quality, and timeliness of patient care, 
 • enhanced safety and security for patients and facilities, 
 • support for new technologies, 
 • business growth, 
 • return on investment, and 
 • enhanced patient satisfaction.
 
We are currently unable to predict what competitive impact any regulatory development and advances in technology will have on our future business and results of operations. We believe our success depends upon our ability to maintain and enhance the performance, content, and reliability of our products in response to the evolving demands of the industry and any competitive products that may emerge. We cannot give assurances that we will be able to do so successfully or that any enhancements or new products that we introduce will gain acceptance in the marketplace. If we are not successful or if our products are not accepted, we could lose potential customers to our competitors.

During 2021, there were no major customers comprised of more than 10% or our revenue. During 2020, one customer comprised of approximately $1,179,000, or 18% of our revenue, while no other customer during 2020 comprised more than 10%.
Backlog
 
Our estimated backlog is driven by signed Master and Product & Service Agreements (P&S Agreement(s)). Each Master and P&S Agreement establishes the rates that we will charge for the use of our products and services as well as an approximate number of billable units that will be installed. Our Controllers, Nursing Stations and mobile devices are billed on a per unit basis. Most Master and P&S Agreements are for three years, but include options to continue in perpetuity on a monthly basis. Backlog, which covers the non- cancellable period, as of December 31, 2021 is approximately $5,800,000, of which approximately $3,400,000 is expected to be billed during 2022. Most of the current backlog will have future value as the Master and P&S Agreements continue beyond the three years and the Master and P&S Agreements move toward expiration and potential renewal. The amount of the non-cancellable backlog to be billed beyond December 31, 2021, is approximately $2,381,000.
Government Approval
 
Neither our Company nor our products are subject to government approval beyond required Federal Communication Commission (“FCC”) certifications. Certain medical devices and applications may be subject to Section 510(k) of the Food, Drug, and Cosmetics Act, which regulates the ability of medical device manufacturers to market their devices. CareView has reviewed the requirements for registration, and at the current time, we do not believe that our suite of applications is subject to 510(k) regulation. Although the parameters of our CareView Patient Safety System products and services complies with HIPAA as far as use by health care providers, CareView itself, as the manufacturer and installer of the units, is not subject to HIPAA regulations. We do not know of any other privacy laws that affect our business as we are not in control of, nor do we keep, patient medical records in our possession. We are unaware of any probable government regulations that may affect our business in the future. We have received Underwriters Laboratories (“UL”) and FCC approval on our products. Additionally, the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services does not pay or reimburse any party for use of our products and services.
Environmental Laws
 
Our Company and our products are not affected by any federal, state, or local environmental laws; therefore, we have reserved no funds for compliance purposes.
 
Employees
 
As of March 31, 2022, we employed 55 people on a full-time basis, two of whom are executive officers. None of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements and we have never experienced a major work stoppage, strike, or dispute. We consider our relationship with our employees to be outstanding.
