Item 1. Business
Business Overview
Icahn Enterprises L.P. (“Icahn Enterprises”) is a master limited partnership formed in Delaware on February 17, 1987 and headquartered in Sunny Isles Beach, Florida. We are a diversified holding company owning subsidiaries engaged in the following operating businesses: Investment, Energy, Automotive, Food Packaging, Real Estate, Home Fashion and Pharma. In addition, we operated a Metals segment until it was sold in December 2021. References to “we,” “our” or “us” herein include Icahn Enterprises and its subsidiaries, unless the context otherwise requires.
Icahn Enterprises owns a 99% limited partner interest in Icahn Enterprises Holdings L.P. (“Icahn Enterprises Holdings”). Icahn Enterprises Holdings and its subsidiaries own substantially all of our assets and liabilities and conduct substantially all of our operations. Icahn Enterprises G.P. Inc. (“Icahn Enterprises GP”), which is indirectly owned and controlled by Mr. Carl C. Icahn, owns a 1% general partner interest in each of Icahn Enterprises and Icahn Enterprises Holdings as of December 31, 2021, representing an aggregate 1.99% general partner interest in Icahn Enterprises Holdings and us. Mr. Icahn and his affiliates owned approximately 88% of our outstanding depositary units as of December 31, 2021.
We conduct and plan to continue to conduct our activities in such a manner as not to be deemed an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “Investment Company Act”). Therefore, no more than 40% of our total assets can be invested in investment securities, as such term is defined in the Investment Company Act. In addition, we do not invest or intend to invest in securities as our primary business. We intend to structure our investments to continue to be taxed as a partnership rather than as a corporation under the applicable publicly traded partnership rules of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended.
Our business strategy and core strengths, and certain other business developments, are not disclosed in this Report since they are not materially different from prior disclosures, as described in Item 1 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019, as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) on February 28, 2020, and which is incorporated by reference herein. 
Business Description
Icahn Enterprises began as American Real Estate Partners L.P. in 1987 and currently operates a portfolio of seven diversified reporting segments. With the exception of our Investment segment, our operating segments primarily comprise independently operated businesses that we have obtained a controlling interest in through execution of our business strategy. Our Investment segment derives revenues from gains and losses from investment transactions. Our other operating segments derive revenues principally from net sales of various products, primarily within our Energy and Automotive segments, which together accounted for the significant majority of our consolidated net sales for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2021. Our other operating segments’ revenues are also derived through various other revenue streams which primarily consists of automotive services and real estate leasing operations. The majority of our consolidated revenues are derived from customers in the United States. Our Food Packaging segment, and prior to August 2019, our Mining segment, accounted for the majority of our consolidated revenues derived from customers outside the United States.
Holding Company
We seek to invest our available cash and cash equivalents in liquid investments with a view to enhancing returns as we continue to assess further acquisitions of, or investments in, operating businesses. As of December 31, 2021, we had investments with a fair market value of approximately $4.2 billion in the Investment Funds, as defined below.

Investment
Our Investment segment is comprised of various private investment funds (“Investment Funds”) in which we have general partner interests and through which we invest our proprietary capital. We, certain of Mr. Icahn’s wholly-owned affiliates and Brett Icahn, son of Mr. Icahn, are the sole investors in the Investment Funds. As general partner, we provide investment advisory and certain administrative and back-office services to the Investment Funds but do not provide such services to any other entities, individuals or accounts. Interests in the Investment Funds are not offered to outside investors.
Investment Strategy
The investment strategy of the Investment Funds is set and led by Mr. Icahn. The Investment Funds seek to acquire securities in companies that trade at a discount to inherent value as determined by various metrics, including replacement cost, break-up value, cash flow and earnings power and liquidation value.
The Investment Funds utilize a process-oriented, research-intensive, value-based investment approach. This approach generally involves three critical steps: (i) fundamental credit, valuation and capital structure analysis; (ii) intense legal and tax analysis of fulcrum issues such as litigation and regulation that often affect valuation; and (iii) combined business valuation analysis and legal and tax review to establish a strategy for gaining an attractive risk-adjusted investment position. This approach focuses on exploiting market dislocations or misjudgments that may result from market euphoria, litigation, complex contingent liabilities, corporate malfeasance and weak corporate governance, general economic conditions or market cycles and complex and inappropriate capital structures.
The Investment Funds often act as activist investors ready to take the steps necessary to seek to unlock value, including through tender offers, proxy contests and demands for management accountability. The Investment Funds may employ a number of strategies and are permitted to invest across a variety of industries and types of securities, including long and short equities, long and short bonds, bank debt and other corporate obligations, options, swaps and other derivative instruments thereof, risk arbitrage and capital structure arbitrage and other special situations. The Investment Funds invest a material portion of their capital in publicly traded equity and debt securities of companies that they believe to be undervalued by the marketplace. The Investment Funds often take significant positions in the companies in which they invest.
Income
Our Investment segment’s income or loss is driven by the amount of funds allocated to the Investment Funds and the performance of the underlying investments in the Investment Funds. Funds allocated to the Investment Funds are based on the net contributions and redemptions by our Holding Company, by Mr. Icahn and his affiliates and by Brett Icahn.
Affiliate Investments
We and Mr. Icahn, along with the Investment Funds, have entered into a covered affiliate agreement, which was amended on March 31, 2011, pursuant to which Mr. Icahn agreed (on behalf of himself and certain of his affiliates, excluding Icahn Enterprises, and subsidiaries) to be bound by certain restrictions on their investments in any assets that we deem suitable for the Investment Funds, other than government and agency bonds and cash equivalents, unless otherwise approved by our Audit Committee. In addition, Mr. Icahn and such affiliates continue to have the right to co-invest with the Investment Funds. We have no interest in, nor do we generate any income from, any such co-investments, which have been and may continue to be substantial.
Energy
We conduct our Energy segment through our majority owned subsidiary, CVR Energy, Inc. (“CVR Energy”). CVR Energy is headquartered in Sugar Land, Texas. CVR Energy is a reporting company under the Exchange Act and files annual, quarterly and current reports, proxy statements and other information with the SEC that are publicly available.

CVR Energy is a diversified holding company primarily engaged in the petroleum refining and nitrogen fertilizer manufacturing businesses through its holdings in CVR Refining, LP (“CVR Refining”) and CVR Partners, LP (“CVR Partners”), respectively. CVR Refining is an independent petroleum refiner and marketer of high value transportation fuels. CVR Partners produces and markets nitrogen fertilizers in the form of ammonia and urea ammonium nitrate (“UAN”). CVR Energy has a general partner interest in each of CVR Refining and CVR Partners. In addition, CVR Energy is the sole limited partner of CVR Refining and owns 36% of the outstanding common units of CVR Partners as of December 31, 2021. As of December 31, 2021, we owned approximately 71% of the total outstanding common stock of CVR Energy.
Our Energy segment’s net sales for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 represented approximately 70%, 58% and 65%, respectively, of our consolidated net sales, primarily from the sale of its petroleum products.
Products, Raw Materials and Supply
CVR Refining has the capability to process a variety of crude oil blends. CVR Refining’s oil refineries in Coffeyville, Kansas and Wynnewood, Oklahoma have a combined capacity of 206,500 barrels per day. In addition to the use of third-party pipelines for the supply of crude oil, CVR Refining has an extensive gathering system consisting of logistics assets that are owned, leased or part of a joint venture operation. Petroleum refining product yield includes gasoline, diesel fuel, pet coke and other refined products such as natural gas liquids, asphalt and jet fuel among other products.
CVR Partners produces and distributes nitrogen fertilizer products, which are used by farmers to improve the yield and quality of their crops. The principal products are UAN and ammonia. CVR Partners’ Coffeyville, Kansas facility uses pet coke to produce nitrogen fertilizer and is supplied by its adjacent crude oil refinery pursuant to a renewable long-term agreement with CVR Refining, as well as by third parties. Historically, the Coffeyville nitrogen fertilizer plant has obtained the remainder of its pet coke requirements from third parties such as other Midwestern refineries or pet coke brokers at spot-prices. CVR Partners’ East Dubuque, Illinois facility uses natural gas to produce nitrogen fertilizer. The East Dubuque facility is able to purchase natural gas at competitive prices due to its connection to the Northern Natural Gas interstate pipeline system, which is within one mile of the facility, and a third-party owned and operated pipeline.
Environmental Regulations
CVR Energy’s petroleum and nitrogen fertilizer businesses are subject to extensive and frequently changing federal, state and local, environmental, health and safety laws and regulations governing the emission, transportation, storage, disposal and release of regulated substances or wastes, the treatment and discharge of waste-water and storm water, and the storage, handling, use and transportation of petroleum and nitrogen products, and the characteristics and composition of gasoline, diesel fuels, UAN and ammonia. These laws and regulations, their underlying regulatory requirements, and the enforcement thereof, impact the petroleum business and operations and the nitrogen fertilizer business and operations by imposing:

● | restrictions on operations or the need to install enhanced or additional monitoring of controls;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | liability for the investigation and remediation of contaminated soil and groundwater at current and former facilities (if any) and for off-site waste disposal locations; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | specifications for the products marketed by the petroleum business and the nitrogen fertilizer business, primarily gasoline, diesel fuel, UAN and ammonia.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

CVR Energy’s operations require numerous permits, licenses and authorizations. Failure to comply with these permits or environmental laws and regulations could result in fines, penalties or other sanctions or a revocation of CVR Energy’s permits, licenses or authorizations. In addition, the laws and regulations to which CVR Energy is subject to are often evolving and many of them have become more stringent or have become subject to more stringent interpretation or 

3



enforcement by federal or state agencies. These laws and regulations could result in increased capital, operating and compliance costs.
CVR Energy’s businesses are also subject to, or impacted by, various other environmental laws and regulations such as the federal Clean Air Act, the federal Clean Water Act, release reporting requirements relating to the release of hazardous substances into the environment, certain fuel regulations, renewable fuel standards, as discussed below, and various other laws and regulations.
Renewable Fuel Standard
CVR Refining is subject to the Clean Air Act’s renewable fuel standard (“RFS”) which requires refiners to either blend “renewable fuels” with their transportation fuels or purchase renewable fuel credits, known as renewable identification numbers, in lieu of blending. See Item 1A, “Risk Factors” and Note 17, “Commitments and Contingencies,” to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion.
Automotive
We conduct our Automotive segment through our wholly owned subsidiary, Icahn Automotive Group LLC (“Icahn Automotive”). Icahn Automotive is headquartered in Kennesaw, Georgia.
Icahn Automotive was formed by us to invest in and operate businesses involved in automotive repair and maintenance services (“automotive services”) as well as the distribution and sale of automotive aftermarket parts and accessories to end-user do-it-yourself customers, wholesale distributors, and professional auto mechanics (“aftermarket parts”). Icahn Automotive’s automotive services and aftermarket parts businesses serve different customer channels and have distinct strategies, opportunities and requirements. As a result, the board of directors of Icahn Automotive has approved the separation of its aftermarket parts and automotive services businesses into two independent operating companies, each with its own Chief Executive Officer and management teams, and both of which are supported by a central shared service group. 
Our Automotive segment’s net sales for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 represented approximately 17%, 28% and 24%, respectively, of our consolidated net sales.
Products, Services and Customers
The automotive aftermarket industry is in the mature stage of its life cycle. Over the past decade, consumers have moved away from do-it-yourself (retail) toward do-it-for-me (services) due to increasing vehicle complexity and electronic content, as well as decreasing availability of diagnostic equipment and know-how. Icahn Automotive provides its customers with access to over two million replacement parts for domestic and imported vehicles through an extensive network of suppliers. Icahn Automotive seeks to provide (i) an extensive selection of product offerings, (ii) competitive pricing, (iii) exceptional in-store service experience and (iv) superior delivery to its customers.
Suppliers
Icahn Automotive purchases parts from manufacturers and other distributors for sale in the aftermarket. Purchases are made based on current inventory or operational needs and are fulfilled by suppliers within short periods of time. During 2021, Icahn Automotive’s ten largest suppliers accounted for approximately 58% of the merchandise purchased and its two largest suppliers accounted for more than 27% of the merchandise purchased. Icahn Automotive believes that the relationships that it has established with its suppliers are generally positive. In the past, Icahn Automotive has not experienced difficulty in obtaining satisfactory sources of supply and it believes that adequate alternative sources of supply exist, at similar cost, for the types of merchandise sold in its stores.

In October 2020, Viskase completed an equity private placement whereby we acquired an additional 50,000,000 shares of Viskase common stock for $100 million. In connection with this transaction, our ownership of Viskase increased from approximately 79% to 89%.

We conduct our Pharma segment through our wholly owned subsidiary, Vivus LLC, formerly Vivus, Inc. (“Vivus”).

Vivus is a specialty pharmaceutical company with two approved therapies and one product candidate in active clinical development.
