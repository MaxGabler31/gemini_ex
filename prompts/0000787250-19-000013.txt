Item 1 – Business

OVERVIEW
DPL is a regional energy company incorporated in 1985 under the laws of Ohio. All of DPL’s stock is owned by an AES subsidiary.
DPL has three primary subsidiaries, DP&L, MVIC and AES Ohio Generation. DP&L is a public utility providing electric transmission and distribution services in West Central Ohio. AES Ohio Generation owns an undivided interest in a coal-fired generating facility and sells all of its energy and capacity into the wholesale market. MVIC is our captive insurance company that provides insurance services to DPL and our other subsidiaries. For additional information, see Note 1 – Overview and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of Notes to DPL's Consolidated Financial Statements and Note 1 – Overview and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of Notes to DP&L's Financial Statements. All of DPL's subsidiaries are wholly-owned.
As an electric public utility in Ohio, DP&L provides regulated transmission and distribution services to its customers as well as retail SSO electric service. DP&L's sales reflect the general economic conditions, seasonal weather patterns and the growth of energy efficiency initiatives; however, our distribution revenues have been decoupled from weather and energy efficiency variations beginning January 1, 2019 as a result of the decoupling rider approved in the DRO. See Note 3 – Regulatory Matters of Notes to DPL's Consolidated Financial Statements and Note 3 – Regulatory Matters of Notes to DP&L's Financial Statements for further information.
DPL also has a wholly-owned business trust, DPL Capital Trust II, formed for the purpose of issuing trust capital securities to investors.
DP&L does not have any subsidiaries.
DP&L’s electric transmission and distribution businesses are subject to rate regulation by federal and state regulators. Accordingly, DP&L applies the accounting standards for regulated operations to its electric transmission and distribution businesses and records regulatory assets when incurred costs are expected to be recovered in future customer rates, and regulatory liabilities when current cost recoveries in customer rates relate to expected future costs or overcollections of riders.
GENERATING CAPACITY
DPL, through AES Ohio Generation, owns an undivided interest in Conesville. AES Ohio Generation's share of this EGU's capacity is 129 MW. AES Ohio Generation sells all of its energy and capacity into the wholesale market.
DP&L also has a 4.9% interest in OVEC, an electric generating company. OVEC has two electric generating stations located in Cheshire, Ohio and Madison, Indiana with a combined generation capacity of 2,109 MW. DP&L’s share of this generation capacity is 103 MW.
SEGMENTS
DPL manages its business through one reportable operating segment, the Utility segment. See Note 13 – Business Segments of the Notes to DPL's Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding DPL’s reportable segment.

EMPLOYEES
DPL and its subsidiaries employed 659 people at January 31, 2019, of which 647 were employed by DP&L. Approximately 57% of all DPL employees are under a collective bargaining agreement.
SERVICE COMPANY
The Service Company provides services including accounting, legal, human resources, information technology and other services of a similar nature on behalf of companies that are part of the U.S. SBU, including, among other companies, DPL and DP&L. The Service Company allocates the costs for these services based on cost drivers designed to result in fair and equitable allocations. This includes ensuring that the regulated businesses served, including DP&L, are not subsidizing costs incurred for the benefit of other businesses. See Note 12 – Related Party Transactions of Notes to DPL's Consolidated Financial Statements and Note 12 – Related Party Transactions of Notes to DP&L's Financial Statements.
SEASONALITY
The power delivery business is seasonal, and weather patterns have a material effect on energy demand. In the region we serve, demand for electricity is generally greater in the summer months associated with cooling and in the winter months associated with heating compared to other times of the year. DP&L's sales typically reflect the seasonal weather patterns and the growth of energy efficiency initiatives, however, after the approval of the distribution rate order in 2018, our distribution revenues have been decoupled from weather and energy efficiency variations. Because of the impact of the new decoupling rider (effective January 1, 2019) and because DPL's generation has greatly decreased in recent years due to plant sales and closures, we expect that weather and other factors influencing demand will have minimal impact on our net operating results going forward.
Storm activity can also have an adverse effect on our operating performance. Severe storms often damage transmission and distribution equipment, thereby causing power outages, which increase repair costs. Partially mitigating this impact is DP&L’s ability to recover certain repair costs related to severe storms.
MARKET STRUCTURE
Retail rate regulation
DP&L's delivery service to all retail customers as well as the provisions of its SSO service are regulated by the PUCO. In addition, certain costs are considered to be non-bypassable and are therefore assessed to all DP&L retail customers, under the regulatory authority of the PUCO, regardless of the customer’s retail electric supplier. DP&L's transmission rates are subject to regulation by the FERC under the Federal Power Act.
Ohio law establishes the process for determining SSO and non-bypassable rates charged by public utilities. Regulation of retail rates encompasses the timing of applications, the effective date of rate changes, the cost basis upon which the rates are set and other service-related matters. Ohio law also established the Office of the OCC, which has the authority to represent residential consumers in state and federal judicial and administrative rate proceedings.
Ohio legislation extends the jurisdiction of the PUCO to the records and accounts of certain public utility holding company systems, including DPL. The legislation extends the PUCO's supervisory powers to a holding company system's general condition and capitalization, among other matters, to the extent that such matters relate to the costs associated with the provision of public utility service. Based on existing PUCO and FERC authorization, regulatory assets and liabilities are recorded on the balance sheets of both DPL and DP&L. See Note 3 – Regulatory Matters of Notes to DPL's Consolidated Financial Statements and Note 3 – Regulatory Matters of Notes to DP&L's Financial Statements.
COMPETITION AND REGULATION
Ohio Retail Rates
DP&L filed an amended stipulation to its 2017 ESP case on March 13, 2017. The PUCO issued a final decision on October 20, 2017, modifying and adopting the amended stipulation and recommendation. The six-year 2017 ESP establishes DP&L's framework for providing retail service on a going-forward basis including rate structures, non-bypassable charges and other specific rate recovery true-up rider mechanisms.

On September 26, 2018 the PUCO issued the DRO establishing new base distribution rates for DP&L, which became effective October 1, 2018. The DRO approved, without modification, a stipulation and recommendation previously filed by DP&L, along with various intervening parties and the PUCO staff. The DRO established a revenue requirement of $248.0 million for DP&L's electric service base distribution rates which reflects an increase to distribution revenues of approximately $29.8 million per year. In addition to the increase in base distribution rates, among other matters, the DRO also provides for a return on equity of 9.999% and a cost of long-term debt of 4.8%.
For more information regarding DP&L's ESP and DRO, see Note 3 – Regulatory Matters of Notes to DPL's Consolidated Financial Statements and Note 3 – Regulatory Matters of Notes to DP&L's Financial Statements.
In December 2018, DP&L filed a Distribution Modernization Plan (“DMP”) with the PUCO proposing to invest $576.0 million in capital projects over the next 10 years. There are eight principal components of DP&L’s DMP: 1) Smart Meters, 2) Self-Healing Grid, 3) Customer Engagement, 4) Enhancing Sustainability and Embracing Innovation. 5) Telecommunications, 6) Physical and Cyber Security, 7) Governance and Analytics, and 8) Grid Modernization R&D.
These initiatives will also allow DP&L to be ready to leverage and integrate Distributed Energy Resources into its grid, including demonstrations of community solar, energy storage, microgrids, as well as Electric Vehicle charging infrastructure. If approved, DP&L will implement a comprehensive grid modernization project that will deliver benefits to customers, society as a whole and to the Company.
On January 22, 2019, DP&L filed a request with the PUCO for a two-year extension of its DMR through October 2022, in the proposed amount of $199.0 million for each of the two additional years. The request was made pursuant to the PUCO’s October 20, 2017 ESP order, which approved the DMR and had the option for DP&L to file for a two-year extension. The extension request was set at a level expected to reduce debt obligations at both DP&L and DPL and to position DP&L to make capital expenditures to maintain and modernize its electric grid. To that end, DP&L’s DMP investments are contingent upon the PUCO approving the two-year extension of its DMR.
Ohio law and the PUCO rules contain targets relating to renewable energy, peak demand reduction and energy efficiency standards. If any targets are not met, compliance penalties will apply unless the PUCO makes certain findings that would excuse performance. DP&L is in full compliance with energy efficiency, peak demand reduction and renewable energy targets. DP&L is required to file an energy efficiency portfolio plan to demonstrate how it plans to meet the standards. On June 15, 2017, DP&L filed an energy efficiency portfolio plan for programs in years 2018 through 2020, which was settled and approved by the PUCO on December 20, 2017. DP&L recovers the costs of its compliance with Ohio energy efficiency and renewable energy standards through separate riders which are reviewed and audited by the PUCO.
The costs associated with providing high voltage transmission service and wholesale electric sales and ancillary services are subject to FERC jurisdiction. While DPL has market-based rate authority for wholesale electric sales, DPL would be required to file an application at FERC under section 101 of Title 18 of the Code of Federal Regulations to change any of its cost-based transmission or ancillary service rates.
As a member of PJM, DP&L receives revenues from the RTO related to DP&L’s transmission assets and incurs costs associated with its load obligations for retail customers. Ohio law includes a provision that would allow Ohio electric utilities to seek and obtain a reconcilable rider to recover RTO-related costs and credits. DP&L continues to recover non-market-based transmission and ancillary costs through its transmission rider.
DP&L and AES Ohio Generation filed an application before the FERC to adjust their rates with respect to reactive power provided to PJM from their generation units. On March 3, 2017, DP&L, AES Ohio Generation, and certain intervening parties filed an Offer of Settlement that was approved by the FERC on May 16, 2017. The changes from current reactive power rates were not material. Additionally, the FERC has referred to the FERC’s Office of Enforcement for investigation, an issue regarding reactive power charges under the previously effective rates in light of changes in DP&L’s generation portfolio. Prior to 2017, DP&L's reactive power rates had been last reset in 1998. As of the date of this report, DP&L is unable to predict the ultimate outcome of the investigation. Several other utilities within PJM are also being investigated by FERC’s Office of Enforcement with respect to the same issue of changes in the generation portfolio that occurred in between rate proceedings. In connection with transactions and other matters discussed above, there have been subsequent reactive power filings made, including filings to reflect: the transfer of generation from DP&L to AES Ohio Generation; the sale of interests in the 
10

Miami Fort and Zimmer stations to subsidiaries of Dynegy; the retirement of Stuart and Killen; and the sale of interests in the Peaker assets to subsidiaries of Kimura Power, LLC. 
DP&L is subject to a SEET threshold and is required to apply general rules for calculating earnings and comparing them to a comparable group to determine whether there were significantly excessive earnings during a given calendar year. In future years, the SEET could have a material effect on results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. See Note 3 – Regulatory Matters of Notes to DPL's Consolidated Financial Statements and Note 3 – Regulatory Matters of Notes to DP&L's Financial Statements.
Ohio Competition
Since January 2001, DP&L’s electric customers have been permitted to choose their retail electric generation supplier. DP&L continues to have the exclusive right to provide delivery service in its state-certified territory and the obligation to procure and provide electricity to SSO customers that do not choose an alternative supplier. The PUCO maintains jurisdiction over DP&L’s delivery of electricity, SSO and other retail electric services.
As part of Ohio’s electric deregulation law, all of the state’s investor-owned utilities were required to join an RTO. DP&L is a member of the PJM RTO. The role of the RTO is to administer a competitive wholesale market for electricity and ensure reliability of the transmission grid. PJM ensures the reliability of the high-voltage electric power system serving more than 50 million people in all or parts of Delaware, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Maryland, Michigan, New Jersey, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Virginia, West Virginia and the District of Columbia. PJM coordinates and directs the operation of the region’s transmission grid, administers the world’s largest competitive wholesale electricity market and plans regional transmission expansion improvements to maintain grid reliability and relieve congestion.
Like other electric utilities and energy marketers, AES Ohio Generation may sell or purchase electric products in the wholesale market. AES Ohio Generation competes with other generators, power marketers, privately and municipally-owned electric utilities and rural electric cooperatives when selling electricity. The ability of AES Ohio Generation to sell this electricity will depend not only on the performance of its generating unit, but also on how AES Ohio Generation’s prices, terms and conditions compare to those of other suppliers.
ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS
DPL’s and DP&L's facilities and operations are subject to a wide range of federal, state and local environmental laws, rules and regulations. The environmental issues that may affect us include the following. However, as described further below, as a result of DPL’s retirement of its Stuart and Killen generating stations, the sale of its ownership interest in the Miami Fort and Zimmer generating stations, the planned 2020 retirement of Conesville and our exiting of our generation business, certain of these environmental regulations and laws are now not expected to have a material impact on DPL with respect to these generating stations.

• | The federal CAA and state laws and regulations (including SIPs) which require compliance, obtaining permits and reporting as to air emissions;


• | Litigation with federal and certain state governments and certain special interest groups regarding whether modifications to or maintenance of certain coal-fired generating stations require additional permitting or pollution control technology, or whether emissions from coal-fired generating stations cause or contribute to global climate changes;


• | Rules and future rules issued by the USEPA, the Ohio EPA or other authorities that require or will require substantial reductions in SO2, particulates, mercury, acid gases, NOx, and other air emissions.


• | Rules and future rules issued by the USEPA, the Ohio EPA or other authorities that require or will require reporting and reductions of GHGs;


• | Rules and future rules issued by the USEPA, the Ohio EPA or other authorities associated with the federal Clean Water Act, which prohibits the discharge of pollutants into waters of the United States except pursuant to appropriate permits; and


• | Solid and hazardous waste laws and regulations, which govern the management and disposal of certain waste.

In addition to imposing continuing compliance obligations, these laws, rules and regulations authorize the imposition of substantial penalties for noncompliance, including fines, injunctive relief and other sanctions. In the normal course of business, we have investigatory and remedial activities underway at our facilities to 
11

comply, or to determine compliance, with such laws, rules and regulations. We record liabilities for loss contingencies related to environmental matters when a loss is probable of occurring and can be reasonably estimated in accordance with the provisions of GAAP. Accordingly, we have immaterial accruals for loss contingencies for environmental matters. We also have a number of environmental matters for which we have not accrued loss contingencies because the risk of loss is not probable, or a loss cannot be reasonably estimated. We evaluate the potential liability related to environmental matters quarterly and may revise our estimates. Such revisions in the estimates of the potential liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. See Note 11 – Contractual Obligations, Commercial Commitments and Contingencies – "Environmental Matters” of Notes to DPL's Consolidated Financial Statements and Note 11 – Contractual Obligations, Commercial Commitments and Contingencies – "Environmental Matters" of Notes to DP&L's Financial Statements for more information regarding environmental risks, laws and regulations and legal proceedings to which we are and may be subject to in the future.
In response to Executive Orders from the U.S. President, the USEPA is currently evaluating various existing regulations to be considered for repeal, replacement, or modification. We cannot predict at this time the likely outcome of the USEPA’s review of these or other existing regulations or what impact it may have on our business.
We have several pending environmental matters associated with our current and previously owned and operated coal-fired generation units. Some of these matters could have material adverse impacts on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.
Environmental Matters Related to Air Quality
As a result of DPL’s decision to retire its Stuart and Killen generating stations, the sale of its ownership interest in the Miami Fort and Zimmer generating stations and the planned 2020 retirement of Conesville, the following environmental matters, regulations and requirements are now not expected to have a material impact on DPL:

• | The CAA and the following regulations


◦ | CSAPR and associated updates;


◦ | MATS and any associated regulatory or judicial processes;


◦ | NAAQS; and


◦ | CPP or a potential replacement rule.

Litigation Involving Co-Owned Stations
As a result of a 2008 consent decree entered into with the Sierra Club and approved by the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Ohio, DPL and the other owners of the Stuart generating station are subject to certain specified emission targets related to NOX, SO2 and particulate matter. The consent decree also includes commitments for energy efficiency and renewable energy activities. An amendment to the consent decree was entered into and approved in 2010 to clarify how emissions would be computed during startups. Given that all of the commitments have been met and with the retirement of the Stuart generating station, DPL and the other owners plan to submit a request for termination of the consent decree.
Notices of Violation Involving Co-Owned Units
In June 2000, the USEPA issued an NOV to the then DP&L-operated Stuart generating station (co-owned by AES Ohio Generation, Dynegy and AEP Generation) for alleged violations of the CAA. The NOV contained allegations consistent with NOVs and complaints that the USEPA had brought against numerous other coal-fired utilities in the Midwest. The NOV indicated the USEPA may: (1) issue an order requiring compliance with the requirements of the Ohio SIP; or (2) bring a civil action seeking injunctive relief and civil penalties of up to $27,500 per day for each violation. To date, neither action has been taken. DPL cannot predict the outcome of this matter.
In January 2015, DP&L received NOVs from the USEPA alleging violations in opacity at the Stuart and Killen generating stations in 2014. On February 15, 2017, the USEPA issued an NOV alleging violations in opacity at the Stuart generation station in 2016. Operations at both Stuart and Killen have ceased. However, we are currently unable to predict the outcome of these matters.
Notices of Violation Involving Wholly-Owned Stations
On November 18, 2009, the USEPA issued an NOV to DP&L for alleged NSR violations of the CAA at the Hutchings EGU, which was closed in 2013, relating to capital projects performed in 2001 involving Unit 3 and 
12

Unit 6. We do not believe that the two projects described in the NOV were modifications subject to NSR. We cannot predict the outcome of this matter.
Environmental Matters Related to Water Quality, Waste Disposal and Ash Ponds
As a result of DPL’s decision to retire its Stuart and Killen generating stations, the sale of its ownership interest in the Miami Fort and Zimmer generating stations and the planned 2020 retirement of Conesville; the following environmental matters, regulations and requirements are now not expected to have a material impact on DPL with respect to these generating stations (although certain other requirements related to water quality, waste disposal and ash ponds are discussed further below):

• | water intake regulations, including those finalized by the USEPA on May 19, 2014;


• | the appeal of the NPDES permit governing the discharge of water from the Stuart Station; and


• | revised technology-based regulations governing water discharges from steam electric generating facilities, finalized by the USEPA on November 3, 2015 and commonly referred to as the ELG rules.

Clean Water Act – Regulation of Water Discharge
On January 7, 2013, the Ohio EPA issued a final NPDES permit to the Stuart Station which included a compliance schedule for performing a study to justify an alternate thermal limitation or take undefined measures to meet certain temperature limits. On February 1, 2013, DP&L appealed various aspects of the final permit to the Environmental Review Appeals Commission. As a result of DPL’s decision to retire the Stuart Station we do not expect this to have a material impact on us.
Clean Water Act rules for Selenium
On July 13, 2016, the USEPA published the final updated chronic aquatic life criterion for the pollutant selenium in freshwater per section 304(a) of the CWA. The rule will be implemented after state rulemaking occurs, and requirements will be incorporated into NPDES permits with compliance schedules in some cases. It is too early in the rulemaking process to determine the impact, if any, on our operations, financial position or results of operations.
Regulation of Waste Disposal
In 2002, DP&L and other parties received a special notice that the USEPA considered DP&L to be a PRP for the clean-up of hazardous substances at a third-party landfill known as the South Dayton Dump (“Landfill”). Several of the parties voluntarily accepted some of the responsibility for contamination at the Landfill and, in May 2010, three of those parties, Hobart Corporation, Kelsey-Hayes Company, and NCR Corporation (“PRP Group”), filed a civil complaint in Ohio federal court (the “District Court”) against DP&L and numerous other defendants, alleging that the defendants contributed to the contamination at the landfill and were liable for contribution to the PRP group for costs associated with the investigation and remediation of the site.
While DP&L was able to get the initial case dismissed, the PRP Group subsequently, in 2013, entered into an additional Administrative Settlement Agreement and Order on Consent (“ASAOC”) with the USEPA relating to vapor intrusion and again filed suit against DP&L and other defendants. Trial for that issue was scheduled to be held in 2019, but the District Court recently vacated that trial date and it is unknown when it will be rescheduled. Plaintiffs also attempted to add an additional ASAOC they entered into in 2016 pertaining to the investigation and remediation of all hazardous substances present in the Landfill - potentially including undefined areas outside the original dump footprint - to the vapor intrusion trial proceeding. The District Court allowed the claim to be added to the litigation but ruled that the 2016 ASAOC could not be adjudicated until after completion of the remedial investigation feasibility study, which is expected to be complete years after the vapor intrusion trial. While DP&L is unable to predict the outcome of these matters, if DP&L were required to contribute to the clean-up of the site, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
Regulation of CCR
On October 19, 2015, a USEPA rule regulating CCR under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act as nonhazardous solid waste became effective. The rule established nationally applicable minimum criteria for the disposal of CCR in new and currently operating landfills and surface impoundments, including location restrictions, design and operating criteria, groundwater monitoring, corrective action and closure requirements and post-closure care. The primary enforcement mechanisms under this regulation would be actions commenced by the states and private lawsuits. On December 16, 2016, President Obama signed into law the Water Infrastructure Improvements for the Nation Act ("WIN Act"), which includes provisions to implement the 
13

CCR rule through a state permitting program, or if the state chooses not to participate, a possible federal permit program. EPA has indicated that they will implement a phased approach to amending the CCR Rule.
On September 13, 2017, the USEPA indicated that it would reconsider certain provisions of the CCR rule in response to two petitions it received to reconsider the final rule. It is too early to determine whether the CCR rule or any reconsideration of the rule may have a material impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
Notice of Violation Involving Co-Owned Units
On September 9, 2011, DP&L received an NOV from the USEPA with respect to its co-owned Stuart generating station based on a compliance evaluation inspection conducted by the USEPA and the Ohio EPA in 2009. The notice alleged non-compliance by DP&L with certain provisions of the RCRA, the CWA NPDES permit program and the station’s storm water pollution prevention plan. The notice requested that DP&L respond with the actions it has subsequently taken or plans to take to remedy the USEPA’s findings and ensure that further violations will not occur. Based on its review of the findings, although there can be no assurance, we believe that the notice will not result in any material effect on DPL’s results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.
