ITEM 1. BUSINESS
In this Annual Report on Form 10-K, unless the content otherwise dictates, "Conduent", the "Company", "we" or "our" mean Conduent Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries.
Our Business
Conduent is a leading provider of business process services with expertise in transaction-intensive processing, analytics and automation. We serve as a trusted business partner in both the front office and back office, enabling personalized, seamless interactions on a massive scale that improve end-user experiences.
On December 31, 2016, Conduent Incorporated (formerly known as the BPO business) spun-off from Xerox Corporation, pursuant to the Separation and Distribution Agreement between the Company and Xerox Corporation (Separation). As a result of the spin-off, we now operate as an independent, publicly traded company on the New York Stock Exchange, under the ticker "CNDT".
We create value for our Commercial and Public Sector clients by applying our expertise, technology and innovation to help them drive customer and constituent satisfaction and loyalty, increase process efficiency and respond rapidly to changing market dynamics.
Our portfolio includes industry-focused service offerings in attractive growth markets such as Healthcare and Transportation, as well as multi-industry service offerings such as Transaction Processing, Human Resources Solutions and Payment Services.
Our strategy is to drive portfolio focus, operational discipline, sales and delivery excellence and innovation,
complemented by tightly aligned investments. As a result, we aim to deliver profitable growth and margin expansion and to deploy a disciplined capital allocation strategy.
With approximately 90,000 employees globally as of December 31, 2017, we provide differentiated services to clients spanning small, medium and large businesses and to governments around the world. 
Our Transformation
We have a portfolio of businesses that we are optimizing and effectively targeting attractive growth areas in a rapidly evolving business process services industry. We have taken significant actions to improve our profitability and drive growth with a more focused portfolio of services. 
Key initiatives include:

• | Realigned Delivery. During 2017 we reorganized the business to better align to our vertical go-to-market strategy and to our global delivery capabilities. We believe this operating structure will allow us to better integrate and tailor business solutions for our customers.


• | Divested Non-Core Assets. We divested five businesses in 2017 for aggregate proceeds of $56 million in cash. These sales enabled us to increase our focus on areas where we have a competitive advantage.


• | Increased Use of Automation. We have developed and deployed a set of advanced software-based automation tools as part of our service delivery operations. These tools reduce the amount of repetitive, manual labor required to deliver many of our services and improve service quality through lower error rates and faster processing times.


• | Real Estate, Infrastructure and Selling, General and Administrative (SG&A). We have significantly reduced the number of leased and owned properties from 462 to 339, reduced our information technology infrastructure costs by streamlining our operations and reduced our SG&A costs from $686 million in 2016 to $615 million in 2017.

Conduent Inc. 2017 Annual Report     1


We continue to execute on our strategic transformation program to deliver cost savings through infrastructure optimization, labor productivity and automation initiatives, restructuring of unprofitable contracts and other efficiencies. This transformation program has and will enable us to better capitalize on our differentiated service offerings, industry expertise and global delivery excellence and position us for long-term shareholder value creation.
Our Market Opportunity
We estimate our addressable market size in the global business process service industry at approximately $243 billion in 2017, according to third party industry reports, and we are a leader across several segments of this large, diverse and growing market. Providing business process services is complex and multi-faceted with services that span many industries.
Ongoing competitive pressures and increasing demand for further productivity gains have motivated businesses to outsource elements of their day-to-day operations to accelerate performance and innovation. As a result, our clients have become more focused on their core businesses and the range of outsourced activities has expanded greatly. Increasing globalization has also required many companies to optimize cost structures to retain competitiveness and business process services have become a key component of this strategy.
The ongoing shift to next-generation software and automation technologies is driving greater demand for, and expectation of, efficiency and personalization by the constituents and customers of the businesses and governments we serve. Addressing these business and operational challenges is necessary for business process
services companies to capitalize on these trends. In addition, business process services have the potential to
meaningfully enhance productivity for businesses and governments and satisfaction for their constituents and
customers.

Our Competitive Strengths
We possess a number of competitive strengths that distinguish us from our competitors, including:
Leadership in attractive growth markets. We are a leader in business process services. Our clients continue to outsource key business processes to accelerate performance and innovation. Additionally, clients are moving beyond services for back-office functions in order to drive customer satisfaction and loyalty, as well as productivity and efficiency. The increase in globalization and cost competition continues to accelerate, forcing companies to seek ways to stay ahead of the competition. These factors, along with clients and their customers demanding more personalized, seamless and secure solutions, are collectively driving the ongoing shift to next-generation software and automation technologies.

• | Healthcare. U.S. healthcare spending is estimated to have represented greater than 17.9% of GDP in 2016 and is continuing to grow. As one of the most regulated industries, healthcare providers must balance increased utilization with heightened complexity and new financial pressures such as government budget challenges to significantly reduce reimbursements, reimbursement penalties for hospital readmissions and a shift from fee-for-service to “value-based” population health management. We are widely recognized by industry analysts as a leader in healthcare payer operations, serving all 20 of the top 20 U.S. managed healthcare plans and providing administrative and care management solutions to Medicaid programs and federally funded U.S. government healthcare programs in 24 states, Puerto Rico and the District of Columbia.


• | Transportation. Traffic congestion continues to increase as urbanization and changing demographics take hold globally. As a result, optimized transportation systems are becoming critical to increase efficiency while maintaining strict safety requirements. Electronic toll collection, public transit and parking all represent key growth drivers as governments at all levels increasingly focus on transportation infrastructure. We maintain approximately 54% market share position in electronic toll collection in the United States based on toll revenues collected through our systems in 2017. We are also one of the largest U.S.-based commercial vehicle operations service providers in the United States with approximately 51% market share based on 2017 revenues, and we are an award-winning innovator in parking management.


• | Transaction Processing. We provide high volume print and mail services, enrollment processing and personalized and targeted marketing and communications, to large corporations and we believe we are a leading provider in this market.


• | Prepaid Cards: We are the leading provider of prepaid payment card services in support of the U.S. government prepaid card services market.

Global delivery expertise. Our scale and global delivery network enables us to deliver our proprietary technology, differentiated service offerings and service capabilities expertly to clients around the world. We have operations in India, Philippines, Jamaica, Guatemala, Mexico, Romania, Dominican Republic and several locations within the United States, giving our customers the option for "onshore" or "offshore" outsourced business process services. This global delivery model enables us to leverage lower-cost production locations, consistent methodologies and processes, time zone advantages and business continuity plans. As of December 31, 2017, our employee location mix was approximately 48% in North America, 20% in Latin America / Caribbean, 22% in Asia Pacific and 10% in Europe / Middle East / Africa.
Differentiated suite of multi-industry service offerings at scale. We manage transaction-intensive processes and work directly with end-users to meet their needs often in real-time. We are unique in our ability to offer our clients these business process services on a large scale and with high quality. Additionally, we are able to leverage our multi-industry services to bring the same scale and quality to our portfolio of industry-specific service offerings, such as healthcare claims management, employee benefits management and public transit fare collection.
Conduent Inc. 2017 Annual Report     6


Innovation and development. We innovate by developing and acquiring new technologies and capabilities that improve business processes. We are constantly creating the next generation of simple, automated and touchless business processes to drive lower costs, higher quality and increased end-user satisfaction. Analytics allow us to transform big data into useful information that helps identify operational improvements and constituent insights. Additionally, we leverage robotic process automation and predictive analytics and combine this with our deep subject matter expertise to create intelligent services that improve security, increase speed and improve accuracy, quality and regulatory compliance, and uncover insights that support better decision making and outcomes for our clients.
Stable recurring revenue model supported by a loyal, diverse client base. We have a broad and diverse base of clients in 31 countries across geographies and industries, including Fortune 1000 companies, small and midsize businesses and governmental entities. Our close client relationships and successful client execution support our stable recurring revenue model and high renewal rates. Excluding our strategic decision not to renew certain contracts, the renewal rate for the year ended December 31, 2017 was 94% and above our target range of 85%-90%. Including all contracts, renewal rate would have been approximately 87%. 
Our Strategies
Our strategy is to drive leadership in attractive markets by leveraging and building on our competitive strengths. We intend to execute our strategy through increased business portfolio focus and operating discipline, enhanced sales and delivery capabilities and tightly aligned investments. Our strategy is designed to deliver value by delivering profitable growth, expanding operating margins and deploying a disciplined capital allocation strategy.
Specific elements of our strategy include the following:
Expand within attractive industries. The industries in which we operate have attractive revenue growth rates, generally in the mid-single digits. We intend to sharpen our focus and expand our business in industries with strong growth and profitability characteristics. We will employ a disciplined approach to portfolio management to complement our competitive strengths and build depth and breadth in our core businesses. Within the Healthcare industry, we intend to leverage our data analytics, differentiated service offerings and industry know-how to continue to service payer, provider and core government healthcare clients. Within the Transportation industry, we will leverage our global, end-to-end platforms to continue to deliver seamless travel experiences while providing back-end Transaction Processing and Call Center services for government clients globally.
Optimize and strengthen our services capabilities. We plan to optimize our services capabilities and strengthen several core areas, including Transaction Processing, Finance and Accounting and Prepaid Card services by building out our services offerings and continuing to improve our competitive strengths. We have begun to divest non-core assets, refocused our business towards higher margin growing segments and consolidated delivery operations to enable greater productivity. Within Transaction Processing, we intend to continue to build industry-specific service offerings and advance inbound and outbound processing capabilities. Within Customer Experience, we intend to capitalize on our global scale, cost efficiencies and our ability to provide seamless communications between our clients and their end-users through traditional (e.g., voice) and digital (e.g., web, mobile and Internet of Things) channels. In Prepaid Cards, we plan to continue to leverage our scalable platform to help our clients simplify their payment disbursement processes.
Continue to advance next-generation platforms and capabilities. We intend to maintain our focus on innovation to create next-generation solutions aligned with our clients’ future needs and our growth strategies. We plan to advance our current platforms, further automate and personalize business processes and enhance data analytics capabilities to deliver value-added services for our clients.
Engage, develop and support our people. We intend to increasingly develop our employees by investing in training, processes and systems to equip them with modern tools that enable them to perform their jobs more
efficiently. Furthermore, we plan to strengthen our sales teams throughout improved and optimized coverage and effective talent management.
Conduent Inc. 2017 Annual Report     7


Competition
Although we encounter competition in all areas of our portfolio, we lead across many areas of our principal businesses. We compete on the basis of technology, performance, price, quality, reliability and customer service
and support. In the current political environment in the U.S. and other territories, we also consider our "onshore" delivery capacity to be a competitive advantage. We participate in a highly competitive and rapidly evolving market, driven by changes in industry standards and demands of customers to become more efficient. Our competitors range from large international companies to relatively small firms. Our competitors include:

• | Large multinational service providers such as CGI Group, Accenture, Aon Hewitt, Cognizant, Hewlett-Packard Enterprise, IBM, Teletech and Teleperformance;


• | Traditional Business Process Outsourcing companies such as Genpact, ELX Services, Exela Technologies and WNS Global Services;


• | Payroll processing and human capital management providers such as ADP and Paychex;


• | Healthcare-focused IT and service solutions providers such as Cerner and Maximus;


• | U.S. Federal focused government services such as CACI International and DXC Technology;


• | Transportation multi-nationals such as Roper/Transcore, Cubic and Kaptsh; and


• | Smaller niche business processing service providers and in-house departments that perform functions that could be outsourced to us.

Sales and Marketing
We market our business process services to both potential and existing clients through our worldwide sales force and our business development team. Additionally, we have dedicated “solution architects” who work with clients to better understand their situation and develop a custom-tailored solution to meet their unique needs.
Our sales and marketing strategy is to go to market by industry to deliver key industry-specific and multi-industry
service offerings to our clients. We focus on developing new prospects through market research and analysis, renewing expiring contracts and leveraging existing client relationships to offer additional services. We leverage our broad, multi-industry service offerings to package solutions through enterprise selling, while maintaining a disciplined approach to pricing and contracting. Our sales efforts typically involve extended selling cycles and our expertise in specific industries is critical to winning new business.
Our Geographies
We provide services globally and we have a diversified geographic delivery network, including a significant presence within the U.S. In 2017, approximately 12% of our revenues were generated by clients outside the United States. In 2017, our revenues by geography were as follows: $5,303 million in the United States (88% of total revenues), $538 million in Europe (9% of total revenues) and $181 million from the rest of the world (3% of total revenues). We present geographical information in Note 2 – Segment Reporting to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K, which is incorporated herein by reference.
Innovation and Research and Development
Our innovation and research and development (R&D) capabilities are critical to our client value proposition and competitive positioning. Our investments in innovation align with our growth strategies and are driven by a view of future needs and required competencies developed in close partnership with our clients and R&D partners. We are investing in attractive markets, such as healthcare and transportation, and building on proven platforms to create services that distinguish us from our competitors.
Our innovation and R&D are focused on three key areas: automation, personalization and analytics.
Conduent Inc. 2017 Annual Report     8


Automation—Create simple, automated and touchless business processes to drive lower cost, higher
quality and increased agility. Businesses require agility to quickly respond to market changes and new customer requirements. To enable greater business process agility, our R&D goals are to simplify, automate and enable business processes via flexible platforms that run on robust and scalable infrastructures. Automation of business processes benefits from our strong image, video and robotic processing, as well as our machine learning capabilities. Application of these methods to business processes enables technology to perform tasks that today are performed manually. Examples include providing automation solutions in transportation by aggregating and automatically applying business rules to simplify toll payments, using our state-of-the-art video and image analytics to reduce the need for manual review of license plates in tolling and toll adjustment scenarios, analyzing data on eligibility claims and checking for correctness on applications. The scope of automation is applied across our portfolio of services and is a key element of our ongoing strategy of modern, efficient services.
Personalization—Augment humans by providing secure, real-time and context-aware personalized products and services. Whether business correspondence, personal communication, manufactured items or information service, personalization increases the value to the recipient. Our R&D investments lead to technologies that improve the efficiency, economics and relevance of business services, such as customer care and health and
welfare services. In our current customer care service offerings, the human touch is seamlessly added as our
software automatically takes telephony data and merges it with customer records pulled from multiple sources to
seamlessly create targeted scripts and flows. This allows the agent to have the caller’s data at their fingertips and provide a more personal experience to the customer—whether on the phone or online. In toll systems, our systems automatically pull up a customer’s name, verify their information and prompt them for unpaid tolls. In transit systems, our mobile app aggregates and calculates the time, cost, carbon footprint and health benefits from walking, biking, driving, parking and taking public transit. For health and welfare, our systems provide state of the art personalized delivery to ensure the best utilization of funds for the neediest populations.
Analytics—Transform big data into useful information to support better decision making. Competitive advantage can be achieved by better utilizing available and real-time information. Today, information resides in an ever increasing universe of servers, repositories and formats. The vast majority of information is unstructured, including text, images, voice and videos. We seek to better manage large data systems in order to extract business insights to provide our clients with actionable recommendations and new services. Tailoring these methods to various industry applications leads to new customer value propositions. In hospitals, we mine usage and clinical indicators to improve patient experiences. We also help our healthcare clients identify waste and fraud by identifying networks of providers and patients with suspicious behavior, such as sudden and dramatic increases in a provider’s level of business or unusual or illogical patient treatment sequences. In transportation, we enable transport and parking operators to better understand and predict commuter needs, including adherence to schedules, passenger loading levels, car park utilization rates and the impact of varying factors such as weather and schedule variations. In our card payment services business, we perform geo location analytics to predict potential fraud behaviors to assure monies are being distributed to the intended recipients.
Intellectual Property
Our general policy is to seek patent protection for those inventions likely to be incorporated into our products and services or where obtaining such proprietary rights will improve our competitive position. We own approximately 1,024 patents and pending applications. Our patent portfolio evolves as new patents are awarded to us and as older patents expire. These patents expire at various dates, generally 20 years from their original filing dates. While we believe that our portfolio of patents and applications has value, in general no single patent is essential to our business or any individual segment. In addition, any of our proprietary rights could be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, or may not provide significant competitive advantages. 
Our business relies on software provided to an approximately equal extent, by both internal development and external sourcing to deliver our services in our businesses. With respect to internally developed software, we claim copyright on all such software, registering works which may be accessible to third parties. In addition, we rely on maintaining source code confidentiality to assure our market competitiveness. With respect to externally sourced software, we rely on contracts assuring our continued access for our business usage.
In the United States, we own 132 trademarks, which are either registered or applied for, reflecting the many businesses we participate in. These trademarks may have a perpetual life, subject to renewal every 10 years and may be subject to cancellation or invalidation based on certain use requirements and third-party challenges, or on other grounds. We vigorously enforce and protect our trademarks.
Conduent Inc. 2017 Annual Report     9


People and Culture
We draw on the business and technical expertise of our talented and diverse global workforce to provide our clients with high-quality services. Our business leaders bring a strong diversity of experience in our industry and a track record of successful performance and execution.
Conduent established its own diversity and inclusion program post-separation, which is overseen by Conduent's human resources department. Conduent promotes understanding and inclusion through a comprehensive set of diversity initiatives and strategies, including addressing under-representation by identifying shortfalls and developing action plans to close those gaps and through work-life programs that assist employees in certain aspects of their personal lives. Additionally, Conduent informs and educates all employees on diversity programs, policies and achievements. As an independent company, we intend to continue our commitment to diversity and inclusion and implement similar policies and programs.
In the United States, Conduent complies with Equal Employment Opportunity guidelines and all applicable federal, state and local laws that govern the hiring and treatment of its employees.
As of December 31, 2017, we had approximately 90,000 employees globally, with 48% located in the United States and the remainder located primarily in India, Philippines, Jamaica, Guatemala and Mexico.
Training and Talent Development
We believe our people are our most important asset, which is why we invest in employee growth and development programs. We are focused on building a workplace where our people can do their best work and have access to the tools and resources they need to perform their jobs more effectively. We are building a culture of learning and have shifted from delivering training to incorporating learning into day-to-day work.
We have a strong performance management system in place that requires all employees to engage with their managers on goal-setting and performance feedback, enabling personal and professional development. There is a strong emphasis on mentorship and coaching, both formal and informal, to help employees get to the next level in their careers. We enable this by developing management capability for our front line leaders to ensure they are able to coach and mentor their teams and engage in constructive and continuous two-way dialogue.
Corporate Ethics
Our commitment to business ethics represents more than a declaration to do the right thing. It has become an integral part of the way we do business. We operate according to our ethics and compliance program, which is designed to meet general governance and specific industry and regulatory requirements with a focus on values, culture and performance with integrity. Conduent has a business ethics program, which is overseen by the business ethics office, and a code of business conduct (Code), which serves as the foundation of our business ethics program. The Code makes clear Conduent’s expectations for ethical leadership, performance with integrity and compliance with company policies and the law. In addition, the Code embodies and reinforces Conduent’s commitment to integrity and helps employees resolve ethics and compliance concerns consistent with operating principles and legal and policy controls. In addition, as Conduent employees, our employees are required to complete business ethics training annually and we periodically solicit their input to gauge the state of Conduent’s ethical culture and help identify areas for improvement. 
Our directors must act in accordance with our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics for Members of the Board; our principal executive officer, principal financial officer and principal accounting officer, among others, must act in accordance with our Finance Code of Conduct; and all of our executives and employees must act in accordance with our Code of Business Conduct. Each of these codes of conduct can be accessed through our website at www.conduent.com/corporate-governance. They are also available to any shareholder who requests them in writing addressed to Conduent Incorporated, 100 Campus Drive Suite 200, Florham Park, NJ 07932, Attention: Corporate Secretary. We will disclose any future amendments to, or waivers from, provisions of our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics for members of the Board and, our Code of Business Conduct and our Finance Code of Conduct for our officers on our website as promptly as practicable, and consistent with the requirements of applicable SEC and NYSE rules.
