Item 1. Business
Introduction
 
We are a blank check company formed pursuant to the laws of the Republic of the Marshall Islands for the purpose of acquiring, through a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization, recapitalization, exchangeable share transaction or other similar business transaction with one or more operating businesses or assets. We have focused our efforts on seeking and completing an initial business combination with a company that has an enterprise value of between $250 million and $500 million, although a target entity with a smaller or larger enterprise value may be considered. While our efforts in identifying a prospective target business for our initial business combination will not be limited to a particular industry or geographic region, we are initially focusing our search on identifying a prospective target business in the international energy logistics industry.
 
We have assembled a group of directors, including independent directors, who provide public company governance, executive leadership, operations oversight, private equity investment management and capital markets experience. Our Board members have extensive experience, having served as directors, CEO’s or CFO’s, or in other executive and advisory capacities for publicly-listed and privately-owned companies. Our directors have experience with acquisitions, divestitures and corporate strategy and implementation, which we believe will continue to be of significant benefit to us as we evaluate potential acquisition or merger candidates as well as following the completion of our initial business combination.
 
We believe that the international energy logistics industry presents attractive opportunities for consolidation and growth and a favorable area in which to attempt to consummate a business combination. Our executive officers and directors have an aggregate of over 80 years of experience in the energy logistics industry, as managers, principals or directors of major worldwide maritime companies, where they have sourced, negotiated and structured transactions in these industries. We intend to leverage the industry experience of our executive officers, including their contacts and relationships, by focusing our efforts on identifying a prospective target business in the international energy logistics industry. While the amount of time our executive officers will devote in any time period will vary based on whether a target business has been selected for the initial business combination and the stage of the initial business combination process the company is in, we expect Messrs. Tsirigakis and Syllantavos to devote, in the aggregate, an average of approximately 20 hours per week to our business.
 
Messrs. Tsirigakis and Syllantavos, our co-Chief Executive Officers, were founders, officers and directors of two blank check companies that consummated business combinations, Nautilus Marine and Star Maritime. Nautilus Marine conducted an initial public offering in June 2011, consummated a business combination in February 2013, was taken private as Nautilus Offshore Services Inc. in October 2013, and in November 2015 was acquired by DryShips, Inc. (Nasdaq:DRYS). Star Maritime conducted an initial public offering in June 2005, consummated a business combination in November 2007, and trades on the Nasdaq Stock Market as Star Bulk Carriers Corp. (Nasdaq:SBLK). Messrs. Tsirigakis and Syllantavos played the leading role throughout the business combination transactions for Nautilus Marine and for Star Maritime, including identifying suitable acquisition candidates including the ultimate targets, and the consummation of such acquisitions. With respect to the above transactions, past performance by Messrs. Tsirigakis and Syllantavos, or any other member of our management team, is not a guarantee that we will be able to locate a suitable candidate for our initial business combination or of success with respect to any business combination we may consummate.

Management and Board Expertise
 
Our executive officers and directors have extensive experience in the logistics side of the energy industry as managers, principals or directors of companies involved in ocean transportation dealing with companies in the related logistics infrastructure areas of terminal and port facilities. We intend to leverage the industry experience of our executive officers, including their extensive contacts, relationships and access to acquisition opportunities, by focusing our efforts on identifying a prospective target business or businesses in the energy logistics industry and negotiating the terms of such transaction. 
 
Subsequent to the consummation of a business combination, we believe that the strengths of our management team, particularly their extensive operations experience in the transportation/logistics field, will be valuable with respect to contributing to the ongoing operations of any business we may acquire.
 
Significant Activities Since Inception
 
On August 24, 2016, we consummated our initial public offering of 6,500,000 units. Each unit consists of one share of common stock and one warrant to purchase one share of common stock at an exercise price of $11.50 per share. The units were sold at an offering price of $10.00 per unit, generating gross proceeds of $65,000,000. On August 24, 2016, simultaneously with the consummation of such offering, we completed a private placement of an aggregate of 7,650,000 warrants to our sponsors, generating gross proceeds of $3,825,000.
 
The underwriters exercised their over-allotment option in part and, on September 28, 2016, the underwriters purchased 400,610 units, which were sold at an offering price of $10.00 per unit, generating gross proceeds of $4,006,100. On September 28, 2016, simultaneously with the sale of such units, we consummated the private sale of an additional 320,488 private placement warrants to our sponsors, generating gross proceeds of $160,244. In connection with the partial over-allotment exercise, certain of our initial shareholders forfeited an aggregate of 166,758 founder shares.
 
A total of $70,386,222 of the net proceeds from our initial public offering (including the partial exercise of the over-allotment option) and the private placements was deposited in a trust account established for the benefit of our public shareholders.
 
On August 24, 2017 and November 24, 2017, we issued unsecured promissory notes (the “Notes”) in the aggregate amount of $303,300 and $301,000, respectively, to our sponsors. The Notes bear no interest and are repayable in full upon consummation of the Company’s initial business combination. The sponsors have the option to convert any unpaid balance of the Notes into warrants exercisable for shares of our common stock, based on a conversion price of $0.50 per warrant. The terms of any such warrants shall be identical to the terms of the warrants issued pursuant to the private placement that was consummated by us in connection with our initial public offering. On each of August 24, 2017 and November 24, 2017, our sponsors deposited cash (equal to the principal amount of the promissory note for such extension) into the Company’s trust account and we also instructed the trust agent to apply interest earned on the funds available for withdrawal toward the principal held in the trust account, representing an aggregate of $402,536, or $0.058 per public share for each extension. As such, we extended the period of time for us to consummate a business combination twice, each for three months, to February 24, 2018. Our sponsors have the option to further extend the period for consummating our business combination and intend to extend such period for another three months prior to May 24, 2018.

Initial Business Combination
 
We will have until February 24, 2018 to consummate our initial business combination and may extend such period for another three months to May 24, 2018. Pursuant to the terms of our amended and restated articles of incorporation and the trust agreement entered into between us and Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, in order to extend the time available for us to consummate our initial business combination, our sponsors or their affiliates or designees, upon five days advance notice prior to such deadline, must deposit into the trust account $402,536 ($0.058 per unit), on or prior to February 24, 2018 for another three month extension. In the event that we receive notice from our sponsors five days prior such deadline of their intent to effect an extension, we intend to issue a press release announcing such intention at least three days prior to such deadline. In addition, we intend to issue a press release the day after such deadline announcing whether or not the funds had been timely deposited. Our sponsors and their affiliates or designees are not obligated to fund the trust account to extend the time for us to complete our initial business combination. To the extent that some, but not all, of our sponsors, decide to extend the period of time to consummate our initial business combination, such sponsors (or their affiliates or designees) may deposit the entire $402,536 amount. In the event that interest in the trust is available for withdrawal for working capital purposes and has not been used to pay taxes or other working capital expenses, we may apply the accrued interest in the trust account or such withdrawn interest to the sponsors’ obligation to loan us money in connection with such extension, and the amount that our sponsors would be obligated to loan us in connection with such extension would be reduced by the amount of interest so applied (as we have done in the extensions in August and November of 2017). If we are unable to consummate our initial business combination within the applicable time period, we will, as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the public shares for a pro rata portion of the funds held in the trust account and as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining shareholders and our board of directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject in each case to our obligations under Marshall Islands law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. In such event, the warrants will be worthless. 
 
NASDAQ rules provide that our initial business combination must be with one or more target businesses that together have a fair market value equal to at least 80% of the balance in the trust account (less any deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable on interest earned) at the time of our signing a definitive agreement in connection with our initial business combination. If our board is not able to independently determine the fair market value of the target business or businesses, we will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm that is a member of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, or FINRA, or a qualified independent accounting firm with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria. If our securities are not listed on NASDAQ, we would not be required to satisfy the 80% requirement. However, we intend to satisfy the 80% requirement even if our securities are not listed on NASDAQ at the time of our initial business combination.
 
We anticipate structuring our initial business combination so that the post-transaction company in which our public shareholders own shares will own or acquire 100% of the equity interests or assets of the target business or businesses. We may, however, structure our initial business combination such that the post-transaction company owns or acquires less than 100% of such interests or assets of the target business in order to meet certain objectives of the target management team or shareholders or for other reasons, but we will only complete such business combination if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, or the Investment Company Act. Even if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the voting securities of the target, our shareholders prior to the business combination may collectively own a minority interest in the post-transaction company, depending on valuations ascribed to the target and us in the business combination transaction. For example, we could pursue a transaction in which we issue a substantial number of new shares in exchange for all of the outstanding capital stock of a target. In this case, we would acquire a 100% controlling interest in the target. However, as a result of the issuance of a substantial number of new shares, our shareholders immediately prior to our initial business combination could own less than a majority of our outstanding shares subsequent to our initial business combination. If less than 100% of the equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses are owned or acquired by the post-transaction company, the portion of such business or businesses that is owned or acquired is what will be valued for purposes of the 80% requirement. If the business combination involves more than one target business, the 80% requirement will be based on the aggregate value of all of the target businesses. If our securities are not listed on NASDAQ, we would not be required to satisfy the 80% requirement. However, we intend to satisfy the 80% requirement even if our securities are not listed on NASDAQ at the time of our initial business combination.
 
We have not established any specific attributes or criteria (financial or otherwise) for prospective target businesses or asset(s), although we have initially focused our search in the energy logistics industry. The determination of whether a target company or assets is attractive for acquisition is based on our analysis of a variety of factors, including whether such acquisition would be in the best interests of our security holders, the purchase price, the terms of the sale, our perceived quality of the assets, the financial status or prospects of the company and the likelihood that the transaction will close. We may decide to enter into our initial business combination with a target business that does not meet certain of these factors or guidelines.

-

 

In evaluating a prospective target business, we expect to conduct a thorough due diligence review which will encompass, among other things, meetings with incumbent management and employees, document reviews, inspection of facilities, as well as a review of financial and other information which will be made available to us.
 
We are not prohibited from pursuing an initial business combination with a company that is affiliated with our sponsors, officers or directors. In the event we seek to complete our initial business combination with a company that is affiliated with our sponsors, officers or directors, we, or a committee of independent directors, will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm which is a member of FINRA or a qualified independent accounting firm that our initial business combination is fair to our company from a financial point of view.
 
Members of our management team own common stock and warrants, and, accordingly, may have a conflict of interest in determining whether a particular target business is an appropriate business with which to effectuate our initial business combination. Further, each of our officers and directors may have a conflict of interest with respect to evaluating a particular business combination if the retention or resignation of any such officers and directors was included by a target business as a condition to any agreement with respect to our initial business combination.
 
Each of our officers and directors presently has, and any of them in the future may have additional, fiduciary or contractual obligations to another entity pursuant to which such officer or director is required to present a business combination opportunity to such entity. Accordingly, if any of our officers or directors becomes aware of a business combination opportunity which is suitable for an entity to which he or she has current fiduciary or contractual obligations, he or she will honor his or her fiduciary or contractual obligations to present such business combination opportunity to such entity, and only present it to us if such entity rejects the opportunity. We do not believe, however, that the fiduciary duties or contractual obligations of our executive officers will materially affect our ability to complete our business combination. Our amended and restated articles of incorporation provide that we renounce our interest in any corporate opportunity offered to any director or officer unless such opportunity is expressly offered to such person solely in his or her capacity as a director or officer of our company and such opportunity is one we are legally and contractually permitted to undertake and would otherwise be reasonable for us to pursue.
 
Our executive officers and directors have agreed, pursuant to a written letter agreement, not to participate in the formation of, or become an officer or director of, any other blank check company until we have entered into a definitive agreement regarding our initial business combination or we have failed to complete our initial business combination by February 24, 2018 (or by May 24, 2018 if we extend the period of time to consummate a business combination).
 
Our executive offices are located at 90 Kifissias Avenue, Maroussi 15125, Athens, Greece and our telephone number is +30 210 876-4858.
 
Status as a Public Company
 
We believe our structure will make us an attractive business combination partner to target businesses. As an existing public company, we offer a target business an alternative to the traditional initial public offering through a merger or other business combination. In this situation, the owners of the target business would exchange their shares of stock in the target business for shares of our stock or for a combination of shares of our stock and cash, allowing us to tailor the consideration to the specific needs of the sellers. Although there are various costs and obligations associated with being a public company, we believe target businesses will find this process a more certain and cost effective method to becoming a public company than the typical initial public offering. In a typical initial public offering, there are additional expenses incurred in marketing, road show and public reporting efforts that may not be present to the same extent in connection with a business combination with us.

Furthermore, once a proposed business combination is completed, the target business will have effectively become public, whereas an initial public offering is always subject to the underwriters’ ability to complete the offering, as well as general market conditions, which could prevent the offering from occurring. Once public, we believe the target business would then have greater access to capital and an additional means of providing management incentives consistent with shareholders’ interests. It can offer further benefits by augmenting a company’s profile among potential new customers and vendors and aid in attracting talented employees.
 
While we believe that our structure and our management team’s backgrounds will make us an attractive business partner, some potential target businesses may view our status as a blank check company, without an operating history, and the uncertainty relating to our ability to obtain stockholder approval of our proposed initial business combination and retain sufficient funds in our trust account in connection therewith, negatively.
 
Until May 31, 2017, we were a “foreign private issuer” as defined in Rule 405, but voluntarily chose to register and report using domestic forms. As of May 31, 2017, we no longer qualified as a “foreign private issuer” (as set forth in Rule 3b-4 of the Exchange Act). As a result, we are subject to the U.S. domestic issuer rules and have the option of conducting redemptions like other blank check companies in conjunction with a proxy solicitation pursuant to the proxy rules and not pursuant to the tender offer rules.
 
We are an “emerging growth company,” as defined in the JOBS Act. We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (1) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following the fifth anniversary of the completion of our initial public offering, (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.07 billion, or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the prior May 31st (the end of our second fiscal quarter), and (2) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt during the prior three-year period.
 
Financial Position
 
With funds available in our Trust Account for a business combination in the amount of $71,215,856 assuming no redemptions and before payment of $1,725,153 of deferred underwriting fees, we offer a target business a variety of options such as creating a liquidity event for its owners, providing capital for the potential growth and expansion of its operations or strengthening its balance sheet by reducing its debt ratio. Because we are able to complete our business combination using our cash, debt or equity securities, or a combination of the foregoing, we have the flexibility to use the most efficient combination that will allow us to tailor the consideration to be paid to the target business to fit its needs and desires. However, we have not taken any steps to secure third party financing and there can be no assurance it will be available to us.
The Energy Logistics Industry
 
We were formed to acquire, through a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition or other similar business combination, one or more businesses in the international energy logistics industry which we consider as businesses that support the process of moving energy, in the form of crude oil, natural and liquefied petroleum gas and distilled and specialized products (such as petrochemicals), from production to final consumption throughout the world. To date, our efforts have been limited to organizational activities.

We believe that the international energy logistics industry performs indispensable functions in the supply chain of getting energy from producers to final consumers by moving, storing, distributing petrochemicals or processed petrochemical products. We believe that the needs for energy in today’s global economy are expanding and present opportunities for consolidation and growth in the energy logistics industry. Before the marketplace can consume energy, it must be produced, transported, stored, processed or distilled, transported again and then ultimately distributed. This comprises the largest portion of what is known as the energy midstream industry which processes, stores, markets and transports commodities such as crude oil, distilled products and petrochemicals, natural gas, and natural gas liquids. The midstream provides the vital link between the far-flung crude petroleum producing areas and the population centers where most consumers are located. Additionally, each of these links within the energy chain, particularly terminalling and transportation, is typically fragmented, which our management believes represents a favorable opportunity to consummate a business combination with target companies within the three identified sectors listed below. They include businesses that are part of the following sub-segments of the energy logistics industry:
 

● | Energy Transportation: transportation of crude oil, gas or refined products by ocean going tanker and gas vessels; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Terminalling (Storage): terminalling facilities, on land or at sea, that are used to accumulate, store and distribute various forms of energy and/or petrochemical products; and
● | Pipelines: transportation of crude oil, gas or refined products by pipeline between production areas, refining facilities and storage/distribution terminals. 

 
We cannot assure you that we will be able to locate a target business meeting the criteria described above in these segments or that we will be able to engage in a business combination with a target business on favorable terms.
 
Maritime Energy Transportation
 
The transportation of crude oil, gas or refined products by ocean going tanker vessels is an important link in the energy chain. Energy must be transported from producing areas to refineries and then onto locations where consumers reside. 
 
The world oil tanker fleet is divided into two primary categories, crude oil and product/chemical tankers. As indicated below, crude oil tankers carry only crude oil and are very large ocean going vessels, whereas product tankers carry only refined products and are smaller ocean going vessels than crude oil tankers and chemical tankers carry refined products and chemicals. Tanker charterers of wet cargo will typically charter the appropriate sized tanker based on the length of journey, cargo size and port and canal restrictions. Crude oil tankers are typically larger than product tankers. The four major tanker categories with reference to size are:
 

● | Very Large Crude Carriers, or VLCCs. Tanker vessels that are used to transport crude oil with cargo capacity typically between 200,000 and 320,000 dead weight tons, or dwt, that are more than 300 meters in length. VLCCs are highly automated and their advanced computer systems allow for a minimal crew. The majority of the world’s crude oil is transported via VLCCs. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Suezmax. Tanker vessels with cargo capacity typically between 120,000 and 200,000 dwt. These vessels are used in some of the fastest growing oil producing regions of the world, including the Caspian Sea and West Africa. Suezmax tankers are the largest ships able to transit the Suez Canal with a full payload and are capable of both long and short haul voyages. 
● | Aframax. Tanker vessels with cargo capacity typically between 80,000 and 120,000 dwt. These tankers carry crude oil and serve various trade routes from short to medium distances mainly in the North Sea, the Mediterranean and Venezuela. These vessels are able to enter a larger number of ports throughout the world as compared to the larger crude oil tankers. 
● | Product. Tanker vessels with cargo capacity typically less than 60,000 dwt. Product tankers are capable of carrying refined petroleum products, such as fuel oils, gasoline and jet fuel, as well as various edible oils, such as vegetable and palm oil. 
● | Chemical. Specialized tanker vessels with cargo capacity typically ranging from 5,000 to 40,000 dwt. The cargo tanks of these vessels are either coated with specialized coatings such as phenolic epoxy or zinc-based paints, or made from stainless steel. The coating or cargo tank material largely determines what types of cargo a particular tank can carry, with stainless steel tanks being the most resistant to aggressive cargoes such as sulfuric and phosphoric acid.

The world gas tanker fleet is divided into two primary categories, liquid petroleum gas (LPG) vessels and liquefied natural gas (LNG) vessels. We will focus on the LPG vessels which are divided into the following four major LPG vessel categories with reference to size:
 

● | Very Large Gas Carriers, or VLGCs. The VLGC vessels primarily navigate the long routes from the countries in the Middle East region to Asia and from West Africa to the USA and Europe. The VLGCs primarily carry butane and propane and have a capacity of at least 60,000 m3.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Large Gas Carriers, or LGCs. The LGC vessels have a capacity of between 40,000 and 59,999 m3. The principal routes for LGC vessels are from the Black Sea to the USA and from West Africa to the USA. Most of the LGC fleet is employed for transporting ammonia. 
● | Medium Gas Carriers, or MGCs. The MGC vessels have a capacity of at least 20,000 m3 and less than 40,000 m3. The MGCs primarily navigate intra-European routes and in the Gulf of Mexico, but also operate from the Arabian Gulf to Asia. 
● | Small Gas Carriers, or SGCs. The SGC vessels have a capacity of more than 5,000 m3 and less than 20,000 m3. SGCs primarily operate on short distances and often carry olefins. 

Terminalling (Storage)
 
Petroleum terminals are land or sea based facilities that receive, store and re-deliver bulk quantities of crude oil, gasoline and other light petroleum products via pipelines, sea vessels or trucks. These facilities, which are used to store energy before or after it is refined and distributed to consumers, are a vital link in the energy chain. We believe there are several areas in the world where opportunities to locate and identify potential target businesses in terminalling exist. The acquisition of terminals either close to production or consumption areas creates economies of scale, minimizes transportation costs and enables more efficient distribution of energy to end users. These factors present attractive opportunities for consolidation and growth in the following:

● | areas of great shipping traffic such as Gibraltar, Fujairah and Singapore, where the demand for bunkering (supplying another vessel with fuel) has increased over the years and we believe will continue to increase in the future; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | areas with numerous small product streams that are accumulated for shipment, such as the Black Sea, the Baltic Sea, the Arctic and the Caribbean; and 
● | areas with poor distribution infrastructure and storage capacities, including a majority of the world’s emerging and developing markets where the demand for energy has left these markets behind other industrial regions, such as South America, India and China.

Pipelines
 
Industries in the Pipeline Transportation subsector use transmission pipelines to transport crude oil, natural gas and refined petroleum products. Pipelines move crude oil from oil fields on land and offshore to refineries where it is turned into fuels and other products, then from the refineries to terminals where fuels are trucked to retail outlets. Pipelines operate 24 hours a day, seven days a week. They connect producing areas to refineries and chemical plants while delivering the products consumers and businesses need, where they need them, when they need them.

-

 

Pipelines are identified based on the products transported (i.e., pipeline transportation of crude oil, natural gas, refined petroleum products, and other products). According to pipeline operators, in the United States alone, there were 199,243 miles of liquids pipeline in operation with 66,649 miles devoted to crude oil, 61,681 miles transporting refined petroleum products (gasoline, diesel, jet fuel, etc.) and 65,595 miles delivering gas liquids (propane, ethane, butane, etc.).
 
Pipelines are among the safest, most cost-effective and efficient was to deliver energy liquids and, because most are buried, they are largely unseen. A barrel of crude oil or petroleum products reaches its destination safely over 99.999% of the time. Delivering crude oil by pipeline can cost on a per barrel basis as little as half of other modes of transportation. Lower costs applied to the billions of barrels of crude oil and petroleum products flowing across pipelines makes them the most efficient means of energy transportation. It is these inherent safety, cost and efficiency characteristics of pipelines that provide an ongoing opportunity for pipeline growth in the continuous quest to connect supply areas to demand locations.
 
Government, Environmental and Other Regulations
 
Government regulations and laws will significantly affect the ownership and operation of energy related onshore facilities or vessels. If we consummate our initial business combination within the international energy logistics industry we may become subject to international conventions, national, state and local laws and regulations in force in the countries in which any of the onshore facilities, assets or vessels we acquire may operate or be located or registered and compliance with such laws, regulations and other requirements may entail significant expense.
 
We believe that the heightened levels of environmental and quality concerns among insurance underwriters, regulators and charterers have led to greater inspection and safety requirements on all vessels and may accelerate the scrapping of older vessels throughout the industry. Increasing environmental concerns have created a demand for vessels that conform to stricter environmental standards.
 
Effecting our Initial Business Combination
 
General
 
We are not presently engaged in, and we will not engage in, any operations for an indefinite period of time. We intend to effectuate our initial business combination using cash from the proceeds of our initial public offering and the private placement of the private placement warrants, our capital stock, debt or a combination of these as the consideration to be paid in our initial business combination. We may seek to complete our initial business combination with a company or business that may be financially unstable or in its early stages of development or growth, which would subject us to the numerous risks inherent in such companies and businesses. 
 
If our initial business combination is paid for using stock or debt securities, or not all of the funds released from the trust account are used for payment of the consideration in connection with our business combination or used for redemptions of purchases of our common stock, we may apply the balance of the cash released to us from the trust account for general corporate purposes, including for maintenance or expansion of operations of the post-transaction company, the payment of principal or interest due on indebtedness incurred in completing our initial business combination, to fund the purchase of other companies or for working capital.
 
There is no current basis for investors to evaluate the possible merits or risks of the target business with which we may ultimately complete our initial business combination. Although our management will assess the risks inherent in a particular target business with which we may combine, we cannot assure you that this assessment will result in our identifying all risks that a target business may encounter. Furthermore, some of those risks may be outside of our control, meaning that we can do nothing to control or reduce the chances that those risks will adversely impact a target business.

We may seek to raise additional funds through a private offering of debt or equity securities in connection with the completion of our initial business combination, and we may effectuate our initial business combination using the proceeds of such offering rather than using the amounts held in the trust account. Subject to compliance with applicable securities laws, we would complete such financing only simultaneously with the completion of our business combination. In the case of an initial business combination funded with assets other than the trust account assets, our tender offer documents or proxy materials disclosing the business combination would disclose the terms of the financing and, only if required by law, we would seek shareholder approval of such financing. There are no prohibitions on our ability to raise funds privately or through loans in connection with our initial business combination. At this time, we are not a party to any arrangement or understanding with any third party with respect to raising any additional funds through the sale of securities or otherwise.
 
Origination and Sourcing of Target Business Opportunities
 
We believe our management team’s extensive target sourcing and transaction experience, including in connection with two previous blank check companies, along with relationships with intermediaries and companies, provides us with a substantial number of potential business combination targets. Over the course of their careers, the members of our board and management team have developed a broad network of contacts and corporate relationships around the world. This network has been developed over the course of an aggregate of over 30 years, in the case of our co-Chief Executive Officers.
 
We expect that the management team’s network of existing contacts and relationships will continue to deliver a flow of potential platform and add-on acquisition opportunities which are proprietary or where a limited group of established, credentialed buyers have been invited to participate in the sale process. Our officers and directors, as well as their affiliates, also bring to our attention target business candidates that they become aware of through their business contacts as a result of formal or informal inquiries or discussions they may have, as well as attending trade shows or conventions. In addition, we receive a number of proprietary deal flow opportunities that would not otherwise necessarily be available to us as a result of the track record and business relationships of our officers and directors
 
In addition, target business candidates are brought to our attention from various unaffiliated sources, including investment market participants, private equity funds and large business enterprises seeking to divest non-core assets or divisions. Target businesses may be brought to our attention by such unaffiliated sources as a result of being solicited by us through calls or mailings. These sources may also introduce us to target businesses in which they think we may be interested on an unsolicited basis, since many of these sources will have read this Report and know what types of businesses we are targeting.
 
We are not prohibited from pursuing an initial business combination with a company that is affiliated with our sponsors, executive officers or directors, or making the acquisition through a joint venture or other form of shared ownership with our sponsors, executive officers or directors. In the event we seek to complete an initial business combination with a target that is affiliated with our sponsor, executive officers or directors, we, or a committee of independent directors, would obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm which is a member of FINRA or a qualified independent accounting firm that such an initial business combination is fair to our company from a financial point of view. We are not required to obtain such an opinion in any other context.
 
If any of our executive officers becomes aware of a business combination opportunity that falls within the line of business of any entity to which he or she has pre-existing fiduciary or contractual obligations, he or she may be required to present such business combination opportunity to such entity prior to presenting such business combination opportunity to us. All of our executive officers currently have certain relevant fiduciary duties or contractual obligations that may take priority over their duties to us. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that we renounce our interest in any corporate opportunity offered to any director or officer unless such opportunity is expressly offered to such person solely in his or her capacity as a director or officer of our company and such opportunity is one we are legally and contractually permitted to undertake and would otherwise be reasonable for us to pursue.

Selection of a target business and structuring of our initial business combination
 
NASDAQ rules provide that our initial business combination must be with one or more target businesses that together have a fair market value equal to at least 80% of the balance in the trust account (less any deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable on interest earned) at the time of our signing a definitive agreement in connection with our initial business combination. The fair market value of the target or targets will be determined by our board of directors based upon one or more standards generally accepted by the financial community, such as discounted cash flow valuation or value of comparable businesses. If our board is not able to independently determine the fair market value of the target business or businesses, we will obtain an opinion from independent investment banking firm that is a member of FINRA or a qualified independent accounting firm with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria. If our securities are not listed on NASDAQ, we would not be required to satisfy the 80% requirement. However, we intend to satisfy the 80% requirement even if our securities are not listed on NASDAQ at the time of our initial business combination. Subject to this requirement, our management has virtually unrestricted flexibility in identifying and selecting one or more prospective target businesses, although we are not permitted to effectuate our initial business combination with another blank check company or a similar company with nominal operations.
 
In any case, we will only complete an initial business combination in which we own or acquire 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquire a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. If we own or acquire less than 100% of the equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses, the portion of such business or businesses that is owned or acquired by the post-transaction company is what will be valued for purposes of the 80% requirement. There is no basis for investors to evaluate the possible merits or risks of any target business with which we may ultimately complete our business combination.
 
To the extent we effect our business combination with a company or business that may be financially unstable or in its early stages of development or growth we may be affected by numerous risks inherent in such company or business. Although our management will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in a particular target business, we cannot assure you that we will properly ascertain or assess all significant risk factors.
 
In evaluating a prospective target business, we conduct a thorough due diligence review which will encompasses, among other things, meetings with incumbent management and employees, document reviews, inspection of facilities, as well as a review of financial and other information which will be made available to us.
 
The time required to select and evaluate a target business and to structure and complete our initial business combination, and the costs associated with this process, are not currently ascertainable with any degree of certainty. Any costs incurred with respect to the identification and evaluation of a prospective target business with which our business combination is not ultimately completed will result in our incurring losses and will reduce the funds we can use to complete another business combination.
 
Lack of business diversification
 
For an indefinite period of time after the completion of our initial business combination, the prospects for our success may depend entirely on the future performance of a single business. Unlike other entities that have the resources to complete business combinations with multiple entities in one or several industries, it is probable that we will not have the resources to diversify our operations and mitigate the risks of being in a single line of business. By completing our business combination with only a single entity, our lack of diversification may:
 

● | subject us to negative economic, competitive and regulatory developments, any or all of which may have a substantial adverse impact on the particular industry in which we operate after our initial business combination, and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | cause us to depend on the marketing and sale of a single product or limited number of products or services.

Limited ability to evaluate the target’s management team
 
Although we intend to closely scrutinize the management of a prospective target business when evaluating the desirability of effecting our business combination with that business, our assessment of the target business’s management may not prove to be correct. In addition, the future management may not have the necessary skills, qualifications or abilities to manage a public company. Furthermore, the future role of members of our management team, if any, in the target business cannot presently be stated with any certainty. While it is possible that one or more of our directors will remain associated in some capacity with us following our business combination, it is unlikely that any of them will devote their full efforts to our affairs subsequent to our business combination. Moreover, we cannot assure you that members of our management team will have significant experience or knowledge relating to the operations of the particular target business.
 
We cannot assure you that any of our key personnel will remain in senior management or advisory positions with the combined company. The determination as to whether any of our key personnel will remain with the combined company will be made at the time of our initial business combination.
 
Following a business combination, we may seek to recruit additional managers to supplement the incumbent management of the target business. We cannot assure you that we will have the ability to recruit additional managers, or that the additional managers will have the requisite skills, knowledge or experience necessary to enhance the incumbent management.
 
Shareholders may not have the ability to approve our initial business combination
 
For so long as we are deemed to be a foreign private issuer, we will conduct redemptions in accordance with the SEC’s tender offer rules. However, if we are not a foreign private issuer, we will seek shareholder approval if it is required by law or applicable stock exchange rule, or we may decide to seek shareholder approval for business or other legal reasons. Presented in the table below is a graphic explanation of the types of initial business combinations we may consider and whether shareholder approval is currently required under Marshall Islands law for each such transaction.
 

Type of Transaction | Whether Shareholder Approval is Required
--------------------------------------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------
Purchase of assets | No 
Purchase of stock of target not involving a merger with the company | No 
Merger of target into a subsidiary of the company | No 
Merger of the company with a target | Yes 

 
Under NASDAQ’s listing rules, shareholder approval would be required for our initial business combination (unless we are deemed to be a foreign private issuer at such time) if, for example:
 

● | we issue common stock that will be equal to or in excess of 20% of the number of shares of our common stock then outstanding; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | any of our directors, officers or substantial shareholders (as defined by NASDAQ rules) has a 5% or greater interest (or such persons collectively have a 10% or greater interest), directly or indirectly, in the target business or assets to be acquired or otherwise and the present or potential issuance of common stock could result in an increase in outstanding shares of common stock or voting power of 5% or more; or


● | the issuance or potential issuance of common stock will result in our undergoing a change of control.

Permitted purchases of our securities
 
In the event we seek shareholder approval of our business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our sponsors, directors, officers, advisors or their affiliates may purchase shares in privately negotiated transactions or in the open market either prior to or following the completion of our initial business combination. However, they have no current commitments, plans or intentions to engage in such transactions and have not formulated any terms or conditions for any such transactions. None of the funds in the trust account will be used to purchase shares in such transactions. They will not make any such purchases when they are in possession of any material non-public information not disclosed to the seller or if such purchases are prohibited by Regulation M under the Exchange Act. Such a purchase may include a contractual acknowledgement that such shareholder, although still the record holder of our shares is no longer the beneficial owner thereof and therefore agrees not to exercise its redemption rights. We have adopted an insider trading policy which requires insiders to: (i) refrain from purchasing shares during certain blackout periods and when they are in possession of any material non-public information and (ii) to clear all trades with our legal counsel prior to execution. We cannot currently determine whether our insiders will make such purchases pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 plan, as it will be dependent upon several factors, including but not limited to, the timing and size of such purchases. Depending on such circumstances, our insiders may either make such purchases pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 plan or determine that such a plan is not necessary.
 
In the event that our sponsors, directors, officers, advisors or their affiliates purchase shares in privately negotiated transactions from public shareholders who have already elected to exercise their redemption rights, such selling shareholders would be required to revoke their prior elections to redeem their shares. We do not currently anticipate that such purchases, if any, would constitute a tender offer subject to the tender offer rules under the Exchange Act or a going-private transaction subject to the going-private rules under the Exchange Act; however, if the purchasers determine at the time of any such purchases that the purchases are subject to such rules, the purchasers will comply with such rules.
 
The purpose of such purchases would be to (i) vote such shares in favor of the business combination and thereby increase the likelihood of obtaining shareholder approval of the business combination or (ii) to satisfy a closing condition in an agreement with a target that requires us to have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash at the closing of our business combination, where it appears that such requirement would otherwise not be met. This may result in the completion of our business combination that may not otherwise have been possible.
 
In addition, if such purchases are made, the public “float” of our common stock may be reduced and the number of beneficial holders of our securities may be reduced, which may make it difficult to maintain or obtain the quotation, listing or trading of our securities on a national securities exchange.
 
Our sponsors, officers, directors and/or their affiliates anticipate that they may identify the shareholders with whom our sponsors, officers, directors or their affiliates may pursue privately negotiated purchases by either the shareholders contacting us directly or by our receipt of redemption requests submitted by shareholders following our mailing of proxy materials in connection with our initial business combination. To the extent that our sponsors, officers, directors, advisors or their affiliates enter into a private purchase, they would identify and contact only potential selling shareholders who have expressed their election to redeem their shares for a pro rata share of the trust account or vote against the business combination. Our sponsors, officers, directors, advisors or their affiliates will only purchase shares if such purchases comply with Regulation M under the Exchange Act and the other federal securities laws.
 
Any purchases by our sponsors, officers, directors and/or their affiliates who are affiliated purchasers under Rule 10b-18 under the Exchange Act will only be made to the extent such purchases are able to be made in compliance with Rule 10b-18, which is a safe harbor from liability for manipulation under Section 9(a)(2) and Rule 10b-5 of the Exchange Act. Rule 10b-18 has certain technical requirements that must be complied with in order for the safe harbor to be available to the purchaser. Our sponsors, officers, directors and/or their affiliates will not make purchases of common stock if the purchases would violate Section 9(a)(2) or Rule 10b-5 of the Exchange Act.

Redemption rights for public shareholders upon completion of our initial business combination
 
We will provide our public shareholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their shares of common stock upon the completion of our initial business combination at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account as of two business days prior to the consummation of the initial business combination, including interest (which interest shall be net of taxes payable and working capital released to us) divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, subject to the limitations described herein. The amount in the trust account is anticipated to be approximately $10.32 per public share (subject to increase of up to an additional $0.058 per share in the event that our sponsors elect to extend the period of time to consummate a business combination for another three months, as described in more detail in this Report). The per-share amount we will distribute to investors who properly redeem their shares will not be reduced by the deferred underwriting commissions we will pay to the underwriters. Our initial shareholders have entered into letter agreements with us, pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to their founder shares and any public shares they may hold in connection with the completion of our business combination.
 
Manner of Conducting Redemptions
 
We will provide our public shareholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their shares of common stock upon the completion of our initial business combination either (i) in connection with a shareholder meeting called to approve the business combination or (ii) by means of a tender offer. The decision as to whether we will seek shareholder approval of a proposed business combination or conduct a tender offer will be made by us, solely in our discretion, and will be based on a variety of factors such as the timing of the transaction and whether the terms of the transaction would require us to seek shareholder approval under the law or stock exchange listing requirement, or whether we will be deemed to be a foreign private issuer (in which case we would be required to conduct a tender offer under SEC rules rather than seeking shareholder approval). Asset acquisitions and stock purchases would not typically require shareholder approval while direct mergers with our company where we do not survive and any transactions where we issue more than 20% of our outstanding common stock (unless we are deemed to be a foreign private issuer at such time) or seek to amend our amended and restated articles of incorporation would require shareholder approval.
 
If a shareholder vote is not required and we do not decide to hold a shareholder vote for business or other legal reasons, we will, pursuant to our amended and restated articles of incorporation:
 

● | conduct the redemptions pursuant to Rule 13e-4 and Regulation 14E of the Exchange Act, which regulate issuer tender offers, and 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | file tender offer documents with the SEC prior to completing our initial business combination which contain substantially the same financial and other information about the initial business combination and the redemption rights as is required under Regulation 14A of the Exchange Act, which regulates the solicitation of proxies.

 
Upon the public announcement of our business combination, we or our sponsors will terminate any plan established in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 to purchase shares of our common stock in the open market if we elect to redeem our public shares through a tender offer, to comply with Rule 14e-5 under the Exchange Act.
 

13
--

 

In the event we conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules, our offer to redeem will remain open for at least 20 business days, in accordance with Rule 14e-1(a) under the Exchange Act, and we will not be permitted to complete our initial business combination until the expiration of the tender offer period. In addition, the tender offer will be conditioned on public shareholders not tendering more than a specified number of public shares which are not purchased by our sponsors, which number will be based on the requirement that we may not redeem public shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 upon the consummation of our business combination (so that we are not subject to the SEC’s “penny stock” rules) or any greater net tangible asset or cash requirement which may be contained in the agreement relating to our initial business combination. If public shareholders tender more shares than we have offered to purchase, we will withdraw the tender offer and not complete the initial business combination.
 
For so long as we are deemed to be a foreign private issuer, we will conduct redemptions in accordance with the SEC’s tender offer rules.
 
If, however, shareholder approval of the transaction is required by law or stock exchange listing requirement, or we decide to obtain shareholder approval for business or other legal reasons, we will, pursuant to our amended and restated articles of incorporation:
 

● | conduct the redemptions in conjunction with a proxy solicitation pursuant to Regulation 14A of the Exchange Act, which regulates the solicitation of proxies, and not pursuant to the tender offer rules, and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | file proxy materials with the SEC. 

 
In the event that we seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination, we will distribute proxy materials and, in connection therewith, provide our public shareholders with the redemption rights described above upon completion of the initial business combination.
 
If we seek shareholder approval, we will complete our initial business combination only if a majority of the outstanding shares of common stock voted are voted in favor of the business combination. In such case, our initial shareholders have agreed to vote their founder shares and any public shares purchased during or after our initial public offering in favor of our initial business combination. As a result, we would need only 2,356,452, or 36.25%, of the 6,900,610 public shares outstanding to be voted in favor of our initial business combination in order to have such transaction approved (assuming the over-allotment option is not exercised). Each public shareholder may elect to redeem their public shares irrespective of whether they vote for or against the proposed transaction. In addition, our initial shareholders have entered into letter agreements with us, pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to their founder shares and public shares in connection with the completion of a business combination.
 
Our amended and restated articles of incorporation provide that in no event will we redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 upon the consummation of our business combination (so that we are not subject to the SEC’s “penny stock” rules). Redemptions of our public shares may also be subject to a higher net tangible asset test or cash requirement pursuant to an agreement relating to our initial business combination. For example, the proposed business combination may require: (i) cash consideration to be paid to the target or its owners, (ii) cash to be transferred to the target for working capital or other general corporate purposes or (iii) the retention of cash to satisfy other conditions in accordance with the terms of the proposed business combination. In the event the aggregate cash consideration we would be required to pay for all shares of common stock that are validly submitted for redemption plus any amount required to satisfy cash conditions pursuant to the terms of the proposed business combination exceed the aggregate amount of cash available to us, we will not complete the business combination or redeem any shares, and all shares of common stock submitted for redemption will be returned to the holders thereof.

Limitation on redemption upon completion of our initial business combination if we seek shareholder approval
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if we seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our amended and restated articles of incorporation provide that a public shareholder, together with any affiliate of such shareholder or any other person with whom such shareholder is acting in concert or as a “group” (as defined under Section 13 of the Exchange Act), will be restricted from seeking redemption rights with respect to Excess Shares. We believe this restriction will discourage shareholders from accumulating large blocks of shares, and subsequent attempts by such holders to use their ability to exercise their redemption rights against a proposed business combination as a means to force us or our management to purchase their shares at a significant premium to the then-current market price or on other undesirable terms. Absent this provision, a public shareholder holding more than an aggregate of 26% of the public shares could threaten to exercise its redemption rights if such holder’s shares are not purchased by us or our management at a premium to the then-current market price or on other undesirable terms.
 
By limiting our shareholders’ ability to redeem no more than 26% of the public shares, we believe we will limit the ability of a small group of shareholders to unreasonably attempt to block our ability to complete our business combination, particularly in connection with a business combination with a target that requires as a closing condition that we have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash. However, we would not be restricting our shareholders’ ability to vote all of their shares (including Excess Shares) for or against our business combination.
 
Tendering stock certificates in connection with a tender offer or redemption rights
 
We may require our public shareholders seeking to exercise their redemption rights, whether they are record holders or hold their shares in “street name,” to either tender their certificates to our transfer agent prior to the date set forth in the tender offer documents or proxy materials mailed to such holders, or up to two business days prior to the vote on the proposal to approve the business combination in the event we distribute proxy materials, or to deliver their shares to the transfer agent electronically using Depository Trust Company’s DWAC (Deposit/Withdrawal At Custodian) System, at the holder’s option. The tender offer or proxy materials, as applicable, that we will furnish to holders of our public shares in connection with our initial business combination will indicate whether we are requiring public shareholders to satisfy such delivery requirements. Accordingly, a public shareholder would have from the time we send out our tender offer materials until the close of the tender offer period, or up to two days prior to the vote on the business combination if we distribute proxy materials, as applicable, to tender its shares if it wishes to seek to exercise its redemption rights. Given the relatively short exercise period, it is advisable for shareholders to use electronic delivery of their public shares.
 
There is a nominal cost associated with the above-referenced tendering process and the act of certificating the shares or delivering them through the DWAC System. The transfer agent will typically charge the tendering broker $35.00 and it would be up to the broker whether or not to pass this cost on to the redeeming holder. However, this fee would be incurred regardless of whether or not we require holders seeking to exercise redemption rights to tender their shares. The need to deliver shares is a requirement of exercising redemption rights regardless of the timing of when such delivery must be effectuated.
 
The foregoing is different from the procedures used by many blank check companies. In order to perfect redemption rights in connection with their business combinations, many blank check companies would distribute proxy materials for the shareholders’ vote on an initial business combination, and a holder could simply vote against a proposed business combination and check a box on the proxy card indicating such holder was seeking to exercise his or her redemption rights. After the business combination was approved, the company would contact such shareholder to arrange for him or her to deliver his or her certificate to verify ownership. As a result, the shareholder then had an “option window” after the completion of the business combination during which he or she could monitor the price of the company’s stock in the market. If the price rose above the redemption price, he or she could sell his or her shares in the open market before actually delivering his or her shares to the company for cancellation. As a result, the redemption rights, to which shareholders were aware they needed to commit before the shareholder meeting, would become “option” rights surviving past the completion of the business combination until the redeeming holder delivered its certificate. The requirement for physical or electronic delivery prior to the meeting ensures that a redeeming holder’s election to redeem is irrevocable once the business combination is approved.
 
Any request to redeem such shares, once made, may be withdrawn at any time up to the date set forth in the tender offer materials or the date of the shareholder meeting set forth in our proxy materials, as applicable. Furthermore, if a holder of a public share delivered its certificate in connection with an election of redemption rights and subsequently decides prior to the applicable date not to elect to exercise such rights, such holder may simply request that the transfer agent return the certificate (physically or electronically). It is anticipated that the funds to be distributed to holders of our public shares electing to redeem their shares will be distributed promptly after the completion of our business combination.
 

15
--

 

If our initial business combination is not approved or completed for any reason, then our public shareholders who elected to exercise their redemption rights would not be entitled to redeem their shares for the applicable pro rata share of the trust account. In such case, we will promptly return any certificates delivered by public holders who elected to redeem their shares.
 
If our initial proposed business combination is not completed, we may continue to try to complete a business combination with a different target until February 24, 2018 (or by May 24, 2018 if we extend the period of time to consummate a business combination, as described in more detail in this Report).
 
Ability to Extend Time to Complete Business Combination
 
If we anticipate that we may not be able to consummate our initial business combination by February 24, 2018, we may extend the period of time to consummate a business combination by an additional three months (no later than May 24, 2018). Pursuant to the terms of our amended and restated articles of incorporation and the trust agreement entered into between us and Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, in order to extend the time available for us to consummate our initial business combination, our sponsors or their affiliates or designees, upon five days advance notice prior to such deadline, must deposit into the trust account $402,536 ($0.058 per unit) on or prior to the date of such deadline for another three month extension. In the event that we receive notice from our sponsors five days prior to such deadline of their intent to effect an extension, we intend to issue a press release announcing such intention at least three days prior to such deadline. In addition, we intend to issue a press release the day after such deadline announcing whether or not the funds had been timely deposited. Our sponsors and their affiliates or designees are not obligated to fund the trust account to extend the time for us to complete our initial business combination. To the extent that some, but not all, of our sponsors, decide to extend the period of time to consummate our initial business combination, such sponsors (or their affiliates or designees) may deposit the entire $402,536 amount. In the event that interest in the trust is available for withdrawal for working capital purposes and has not been used to pay taxes or other working capital expenses, we may apply the accrued interest in the trust account or such withdrawn interest to the sponsors’ obligation to loan us money in connection with such extension, and the amount that our sponsors would be obligated to loan us in connection with such extension would be reduced by the amount of interest so applied (as we have done in the extensions in August and November of 2017).
 
Redemption of public shares and liquidation if no initial business combination
 
Our executive officers and directors have agreed that we will have only until February 24, 2018 (or by May 24, 2018 if we extend the period of time to consummate a business combination, as described in more detail in this Report), to complete our initial business combination. If we are unable to complete our initial business combination within the applicable time period we will: (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest (less up to $50,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses (which interest shall be net of taxes payable and working capital released to us) divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public shareholders’ rights as shareholders (including the right to receive further liquidation distributions, if any), subject to applicable law, and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining shareholders and our board of directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject in each case to our obligations under Marshall Islands law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. There will be no redemption rights or liquidating distributions with respect to our warrants, which will expire worthless if we fail to complete our business combination within the applicable time period.
 

16
--

 

Our initial shareholders have entered into letter agreements with us, pursuant to which they have waived their rights to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to their founder shares if we fail to complete our initial business combination by February 24, 2018 (or by May 24, 2018 if we extend the period of time to consummate a business combination, as described in more detail in this Report). However, if our initial shareholders acquire public shares, they will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to such public shares if we fail to complete our initial business combination within the applicable time period.
 
Our executive officers and directors have agreed, pursuant to a written letter agreement with us, that they will not propose any amendment to our amended and restated articles of incorporation that would affect the substance or timing of our obligation to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination by February 24, 2018 (or by May 24, 2018 if we extend the period of time to consummate a business combination, as described in more detail in this Report), unless we provide our public shareholders with the opportunity to redeem their shares of common stock upon approval of any such amendment at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest (which interest shall be net of taxes payable and working capital released to us) divided by the number of then outstanding public shares. However, we may not redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 upon the consummation of our business combination (so that we are not subject to the SEC’s “penny stock” rules). Prior to acquiring any securities from our initial shareholders, permitted transferees must enter into a written agreement with us agreeing to be bound by the same restriction.
 
We expect that all costs and expenses associated with implementing our plan of dissolution, as well as payments to any creditors, will be funded from amounts remaining out of the approximately $117,000 of proceeds held outside the trust account (as of November 30, 2017), although we cannot assure you that there will be sufficient funds for such purpose. However, if those funds are not sufficient to cover the costs and expenses associated with implementing our plan of dissolution, to the extent that there is any interest accrued in the trust account not required to pay taxes and not released to us to fund working capital expenses, we may request the trustee to release to us an additional amount of up to $50,000 of such accrued interest to pay those costs and expenses.
 
If we were to expend all of the net proceeds of our initial public offering, other than the proceeds deposited in the trust account, and without taking into account interest, if any, earned on the trust account, the per-share redemption amount received by shareholders upon our dissolution would be approximately $10.32 (or such higher amount then held in trust). The proceeds deposited in the trust account could, however, become subject to the claims of our creditors which would have higher priority than the claims of our public shareholders. We cannot assure you that the actual per-share redemption amount received by shareholders will not be substantially less than $10.32 (or such higher amount then held in trust). These claims must be paid or provided for before we make any distribution of our remaining assets to our shareholders. While we intend to pay such amounts, if any, we cannot assure you that we will have funds sufficient to pay or provide for all creditors’ claims.

Although we seek to have all vendors, service providers, prospective target businesses or other entities with which we do business execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies held in the trust account for the benefit of our public shareholders, there is no guarantee that they will execute such agreements or even if they execute such agreements that they would be prevented from bringing claims against the trust account including but not limited to fraudulent inducement, breach of fiduciary responsibility or other similar claims, as well as claims challenging the enforceability of the waiver, in each case in order to gain an advantage with respect to a claim against our assets, including the funds held in the trust account. If any third party refuses to execute an agreement waiving such claims to the monies held in the trust account, our management will perform an analysis of the alternatives available to it and will only enter into an agreement with a third party that has not executed a waiver if management believes that such third party’s engagement would be significantly more beneficial to us than any alternative. Examples of possible instances where we may engage a third party that refuses to execute a waiver include the engagement of a third party consultant whose particular expertise or skills are believed by management to be significantly superior to those of other consultants that would agree to execute a waiver or in cases where management is unable to find a service provider willing to execute a waiver. In addition, there is no guarantee that such entities will agree to waive any claims they may have in the future as a result of, or arising out of, any negotiations, contracts or agreements with us and will not seek recourse against the trust account for any reason. In order to protect the amounts held in the trust account, Messrs. Tsirigakis and Syllantavos have agreed that they will be jointly liable to us if and to the extent any claims by a vendor for services rendered or products sold to us, or a prospective target business with which we have discussed entering into a transaction agreement, reduce the amount of funds in the trust account to below (i) $10.32 per public share (or such higher amount then held in trust) or (ii) such lesser amount per public share held in the trust account as of the date of the liquidation of the trust account, due to reductions in value of the trust assets other than due to the failure to obtain such waiver, in each case net of the amount of interest which may be withdrawn to pay taxes or working capital expenses, except as to any claims by a third party who executed a waiver of any and all rights to seek access to the trust account and except as to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of our initial public offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. In the event that an executed waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against a third party, then Messrs. Tsirigakis and Syllantavos will not be responsible to the extent of any liability for such third-party claims. We cannot assure you, however, that Messrs. Tsirigakis and Syllantavos would be able to satisfy those obligations. None of our other officers will indemnify us for claims by third parties including, without limitation, claims by vendors and prospective target businesses.
 
In the event that the proceeds in the trust account are reduced below (i) $10.32 per public share (or such higher amount then held in trust) or (ii) such lesser amount per public share held in the trust account as of the date of the liquidation of the trust account, due to reductions in value of the trust assets other than due to the failure to obtain such waiver, in each case net of the amount of interest which may be withdrawn to pay taxes or working capital expenses, and Messrs. Tsirigakis and Syllantavos assert that they are unable to satisfy their indemnification obligations or that they have no indemnification obligations related to a particular claim, our independent directors would determine whether to take legal action against Messrs. Tsirigakis and Syllantavos to enforce their indemnification obligations. While we currently expect that our independent directors would take legal action on our behalf against Messrs. Tsirigakis and Syllantavos to enforce their indemnification obligations to us, it is possible that our independent directors in exercising their business judgment may choose not to do so in any particular instance. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that due to claims of creditors the actual value of the per-share redemption price will not be substantially less than $10.32 per share (or such higher amount then held in trust).
 
We will seek to reduce the possibility that Messrs. Tsirigakis and Syllantavos will have to indemnify the trust account due to claims of creditors by endeavoring to have all vendors, service providers, prospective target businesses or other entities with which we do business execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to monies held in the trust account. Messrs. Tsirigakis and Syllantavos will also not be liable as to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of our initial public offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. We will have access to up to approximately $117,000 from the proceeds of our initial public offering (as of November 30, 2017) with which to pay any such potential claims (including costs and expenses incurred in connection with our liquidation, currently estimated to be no more than approximately $50,000). In the event that we liquidate and it is subsequently determined that the reserve for claims and liabilities is insufficient, shareholders who received funds from our trust account could be liable for claims made by creditors.
 
Under the BCA, shareholders may be held liable for claims by third parties against a corporation to the extent of distributions received by them in a dissolution. The pro rata portion of our trust account distributed to our public shareholders upon the redemption of our public shares in the event we do not complete our initial business combination by February 24, 2018 (or by May 24, 2018 if we extend the period of time to consummate a business combination, as described in more detail in this Report), may be considered a liquidation distribution under Marshall Islands law. If a corporation complies with certain procedures set forth in Section 105 of the BCA intended to ensure that it makes reasonable provision for all claims against it, including a period of between six months and three years (which may be extended under certain circumstances) during which third party claims can be brought against the corporation before any liquidating distributions are made to shareholders, any liability of shareholders with respect to a liquidating distribution is limited to the lesser of such shareholder’s pro rata share of the claim or the amount distributed to the shareholder, and any liability of the shareholder would be barred after the third anniversary of the dissolution. However, it is our intention to redeem our public shares as soon as reasonably possible following February 24, 2018 (or May 24, 2018 if we extend such deadline for another three months) in the event we do not complete our business combination and, therefore, we do not intend to comply with those procedures.

Furthermore, if the pro rata portion of our trust account distributed to our public shareholders upon the redemption of our public shares in the event we do not complete our business combination by February 24, 2018 (or by May 24, 2018 if we extend the period of time to consummate a business combination, as described in more detail in this Report), is not considered a liquidation distribution under Marshall Islands law and such redemption distribution is deemed to be unlawful, then pursuant to Section 100 of the BCA, the statute of limitations for claims of creditors could then be three years (which may be extended under certain circumstances) after the unlawful redemption distribution. If we are unable to complete our business combination by February 24, 2018 (or by May 24, 2018 if we extend the period of time to consummate a business combination, as described in more detail in this Report), we will: (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest (net of the amount of interest which may be withdrawn to pay taxes or working capital expenses and less up to $50,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public shareholders’ rights as shareholders (including the right to receive further liquidation distributions, if any), subject to applicable law, and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining shareholders and our board of directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject in each case to our obligations under Marshall Islands law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. Accordingly, it is our intention to redeem our public shares as soon as reasonably possible following May 24, 2018, and, therefore, we do not intend to comply with those procedures. As such, our shareholders could potentially be liable for any claims to the extent of distributions received by them (but no more) and any liability of our shareholders may extend well beyond the third anniversary of such date.
 
Because we will not be complying with Section 106 of the BCA with respect to giving published notice to third party claimants or creditors, based on facts known to us at such time that will provide for our payment of all existing and pending claims or claims that may be potentially brought against us within the three years (which may be extended under certain circumstances) following our dissolution. However, because we are a blank check company, rather than an operating company, and our operations will be limited to searching for prospective target businesses to acquire, the only likely claims to arise would be from our vendors (such as lawyers, investment bankers, etc.) or prospective target businesses. As described above, pursuant to the obligation contained in our underwriting agreement, we will seek to have all vendors, service providers, prospective target businesses or other entities with which we do business execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies held in the trust account.
 
If we file a bankruptcy petition or an involuntary bankruptcy petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, the proceeds held in the trust account could be subject to applicable bankruptcy law, and may be included in our bankruptcy estate and subject to the claims of third parties with priority over the claims of our shareholders. To the extent any bankruptcy claims deplete the trust account, we cannot assure you we will be able to return $10.32 per share (or such higher amount then held in trust) to our public shareholders. Additionally, if we file a bankruptcy petition or an involuntary bankruptcy petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, any distributions received by shareholders could be viewed under applicable debtor/creditor and/or bankruptcy laws as either a “preferential transfer” or a “fraudulent conveyance.” As a result, a bankruptcy court could seek to recover all amounts received by our shareholders. Furthermore, our board may be viewed as having breached its fiduciary duty to our creditors and/or may have acted in bad faith, and thereby exposing itself and our company to claims of punitive damages, by paying public shareholders from the trust account prior to addressing the claims of creditors. We cannot assure you that claims will not be brought against us for these reasons.

Our public shareholders will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account only (i) in the event of the redemption of our public shares if we do not complete our business combination by February 24, 2018 (or by May 24, 2018 if we extend the period of time to consummate a business combination, as described in more detail in this Report), (ii) in connection with a shareholder vote to amend our amended and restated articles of incorporation to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination by February 24, 2018 (or by May 24, 2018 if we extend the period of time to consummate a business combination, as described in more detail in this Report), or (iii) if they redeem their respective shares for cash upon the completion of the initial business combination. In no other circumstances will a shareholder have any right or interest of any kind to or in the trust account. In the event we seek shareholder approval in connection with our initial business combination, a shareholder’s voting in connection with the business combination alone will not result in a shareholder’s redeeming its shares to us for an applicable pro rata share of the trust account. Such shareholder must have also exercised its redemption rights described above.
 
Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation
 
Our amended and restated articles of incorporation contain certain requirements and restrictions that apply to us until the consummation of our initial business combination. If we seek to amend any provisions of our amended and restated articles of incorporation relating to shareholders’ rights or pre-business combination activity, we will provide public shareholders with the opportunity to redeem their public shares in connection with any such vote. Our initial shareholders have agreed to waive any redemption rights with respect to their founder shares and public shares in connection with the completion of our initial business combination. Specifically, our amended and restated articles of incorporation provide, among other things, that:

● | prior to the consummation of our initial business combination, we shall either (1) seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination at a meeting called for such purpose at which shareholders may seek to redeem their shares, regardless of whether they vote for or against the proposed business combination, into their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest (which interest shall be net of taxes payable and working capital released to us) or (2) provide our shareholders with the opportunity to tender their shares to us by means of a tender offer (and thereby avoid the need for a shareholder vote) for an amount equal to their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest (which interest shall be net of taxes payable and working capital released to us) in each case subject to the limitations described herein;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | we will consummate our initial business combination only if we have net tangible assets of at least $5,000,001 upon such consummation and, solely if we seek shareholder approval, a majority of the outstanding shares of common stock voted are voted in favor of the business combination; 
● | if our initial business combination is not consummated by February 24, 2018 (or by May 24, 2018 if we extend the period of time to consummate a business combination, as described in more detail in this Report), then our existence will terminate and we will distribute all amounts in the trust account; and 
● | prior to our initial business combination, we may not issue additional shares of capital stock that would entitle the holders thereof to (i) receive funds from the trust account or (ii) vote on any initial business combination. 

 
These provisions cannot be amended without the approval of holders of 65% of our common stock. In the event we seek shareholder approval in connection with our initial business combination, our amended and restated articles of incorporation provide that we may consummate our initial business combination only if approved by a majority of the shares of common stock voted by our shareholders at a duly held shareholders meeting.

Competition
 
In identifying, evaluating and selecting a target business for our business combination, we encounter intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours, including other blank check companies, private equity groups and leveraged buyout funds, and operating businesses seeking strategic acquisitions. Many of these entities are well established and have extensive experience identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates. Moreover, many of these competitors possess greater financial, technical, human and other resources than us. Our ability to acquire larger target businesses will be limited by our available financial resources. This inherent limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the acquisition of a target business. Furthermore, our obligation to pay cash in connection with our public shareholders who exercise their redemption rights may reduce the resources available to us for our initial business combination and our outstanding warrants, and the future dilution they potentially represent, may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses. Either of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating an initial business combination.
Employees
 
We currently have two executive officers. Members of our management team are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters but they intend to devote as much of their time as they deem necessary to our affairs until we have completed our initial business combination. The amount of time that Messrs. Tsirigakis and Syllantavos or any other members of our management devote in any time period will vary based on whether a target business has been selected for our initial business combination and the current stage of the business combination process, but we expect that they will devote approximately 20 hours a week on average to our affairs.
Periodic Reporting and Financial Information
 
We registered our units, common stock and warrants under the Exchange Act and have reporting obligations, including the requirement that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with the SEC. In accordance with the requirements of the Exchange Act, our annual reports contain financial statements audited and reported on by our independent registered public auditors.
 
We will provide shareholders with audited financial statements of the prospective target business as part of the tender offer materials or proxy solicitation materials sent to shareholders to assist them in assessing the target business. In all likelihood, these financial statements will need to be prepared in accordance with GAAP, however, they may alternatively be prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). We cannot assure you that any particular target business identified by us as a potential acquisition candidate will have financial statements prepared in accordance with either GAAP or IFRS or that the potential target business will be able to prepare its financial statements in accordance with either GAAP or IFRS. To the extent that this requirement cannot be met, we may not be able to acquire the proposed target business. While this may limit the pool of potential acquisition candidates, we do not believe that this limitation will be material.
 
Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires that we evaluate and report on our system of internal controls. As long as we maintain our status as an emerging growth company, however, we will not be required to comply with the independent registered public accounting firm attestation requirement on our internal control over financial reporting. The fact that we are a blank check company makes compliance with the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act particularly burdensome on us as compared to other public companies because a target company with which we seek to complete our business combination may not be in compliance with the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act regarding adequacy of their internal controls. The development of the internal controls of any such entity to achieve compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act may increase the time and costs necessary to complete any such acquisition.

We are an “emerging growth company,” as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act, as modified by the JOBS Act. As such, we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not “emerging growth companies” including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. If some investors find our securities less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our securities and the prices of our securities may be more volatile.
 
In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an “emerging growth company” can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an “emerging growth company” can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We intend to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period.
 
We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (1) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following the fifth anniversary of the completion of our initial public offering, (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.07 billion, or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the prior May 31st , and (2) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt during the prior three-year period. References herein to “emerging growth company” shall have the meaning associated with it in the JOBS Act.
