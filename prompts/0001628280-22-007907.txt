Our Mission and Vision
Our mission is to bring our farm to your kitchen. Our vision is to deliver the freshest, locally grown produce over the fewest food miles. We believe that happy plants make happy taste buds and we are committed to reimagining the standards of freshness. We also believe that local is the best kind of business, and we are committed to helping communities thrive for generations to come. We are committed to building empowered local teams. Together, we believe we are capable of extraordinary things.
Company Overview
Local Bounti was founded in August 2018 and is headquartered in Hamilton, Montana. Local Bounti is a controlled environment agriculture ("CEA") company that produces sustainably grown living lettuce, herbs, and loose leaf lettuce. Local Bounti utilizes patent pending Stack & Flow Technology™, which is a hybrid of vertical farming and hydroponic greenhouse farming, to grow healthy food sustainably and affordably. Through our CEA process, it is our goal to produce our products in an environmentally sustainable manner that will increase harvest efficiency, limit water usage and reduce the carbon footprint of the production and distribution process. The environmental greenhouse conditions help to ensure nutritional value and taste, and that the products are non-genetically modified organisms ("non-GMO") and use significantly less pesticides and herbicides than traditional farming operations. Our products use 90% less water and 90% less land than conventional agriculture to produce its products. Our first CEA facility in Hamilton, Montana (the "Montana Facility") commenced construction in 2019 and reached full commercial operation by the second half of 2020. In 2021, we successfully added seven additional greenhouses bringing our total producing greenhouses to twelve at the Montana Facility. With the additional capacity in place, the farm is producing commercial produce in approximately half of the facility, with the balance focused on research and development, to include new products, technology, and systems designs.
Importantly, the Company continues to exceed its expectations for crop cycle improvement for its commercial butter lettuce, which as of December 31, 2021 was 17 turns annually compared to nine turns achieved in 2020, representing an 88% improvement year-over-year. Notably, this performance already exceeds the Company’s long-term assumptions that were previously reported and performance within its trials are generating further gains. 
Local Bounti’s founders are Travis M. Joyner and Craig M. Hurlbert, business partners with a track record of building and managing capital-intensive, commodity-based businesses in energy, water, and industrial technology. After initially setting out to invest in a CEA business, Travis and Craig could not find a suitable existing business or technology in which to invest. Instead, they took a clean sheet approach and began to build a business with long-term CEA leadership 
in mind and a focus on unit economics and sustainability. With this background, we created our high yield and low-cost Stack & Flow Technology™.
Recent Developments
On March 14, 2022, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire California-based complementary indoor farming company Hollandia Produce Group, Inc., which operates under the name Pete’s® ("Pete's"), for total consideration of $122.5 million, subject to customary adjustments (the "Pete's Acquisition"). The Pete's Acquisition consideration will be comprised of $92.5 million in cash, expected to be provided pursuant to Local Bounti’s existing lending facility with Cargill Financial Services International, Inc. ("Cargill Financial"), and the remaining $30.0 million of consideration payable in shares of Local Bounti common stock. 
Pete’s is a California-based indoor farming company with three greenhouse growing facilities, including two operating facilities in California and one under construction in Georgia which is scheduled to begin operations in the second quarter of 2022. Pete’s has distribution to approximately 10,000 retail locations across 35 U.S. states and Canadian provinces, primarily through direct relationships with blue-chip retail customers, including Albertsons, Kroger, Target, Walmart, as well as Whole Foods and AmazonFresh. Pete’s primary products include living butter lettuce – where it is a leading provider with an approximate 80 percent share of the CEA market within the Western U.S. – as well as packaged salad and cress. Pete’s has been in operation for over 50 years while focusing the last 25 years in leafy greens, has long-standing relationships with the majority of its customers, and has a demonstrated track record of generating positive EBITDA. 
Local Bounti plans to install its patent pending Stack & Flow Technology™ at Pete's facilities, combining the best aspects of vertical farming and greenhouse growing technologies to deliver higher yields of diverse leafy greens at superior unit economics. The Pete's Acquisition also allows Local Bounti to gain access to Pete’s existing retail customer base of more than 10,000 retail locations nationwide.
Local Bounti expects to close the Pete’s Acquisition in the second quarter of 2022.
Business Summary
We are differentiated by our focus on unit economics, modular and locally distributed strategy, brand and product diversity and strong focus on sustainability.
Our focus on unit economics defines our execution strategy, which underpins our value proposition and enhances value for all stakeholders as depicted in the diagram below.
 
Our hybrid facility design is at the core of our focus on unit economics and serves as a platform intended to grow margins through investment in technology and in the future, plant genetics. In our facility configuration, we grow plants during their early development period "stacked" in a space and energy efficient vertical nursery. This configuration reduces facility square footage and increases returns on invested capital. This vertical nursery produces a stock of young plants to fill growing space in our controlled environment hydroponic greenhouses, where young plants accelerate growth when exposed to a specified set of conditions involving natural light, temperature, humidity, carbon dioxide, nutrients, pH balance and other key elements. With this approach, we believe that by 2025 our facilities yield 1.5 to 2.0 times more produce than traditional hydroponic greenhouse farms and, we believe can be built for a cost of approximately 3.0 times run rate EBITDA generation, a build multiple up to two times lower than targets published by CEA competitors for loose leaf lettuce. Additionally, our greenhouse configuration is organized in a highly modular layout with our proprietary control center technology suite we are developing to centralize operational control. Our control center technology suite provides for remote monitoring of our operations to efficiently collect and analyze information to drive yields, reduce risk, and grow product more consistently.
We use flexible, modular facility designs to enable rapid expansion near major population centers. The Company is assessing its pipeline of future farm locations to maximize Pete’s national distribution footprint upon the anticipated closing of the Pete’s Acquisition. Key considerations include meeting known demand from key existing customers within the network, as well as optimizing freight routes to ensure that transportation is optimized to limit cost while enhancing customer service with consistent delivery schedules. Our approach is to build or acquire geographically distributed production facilities so we can provide our customers with locally and sustainably grown produce delivered at peak freshness on a year-round basis. We plan to use substantial pre-engineered, pre-fabricated and standardized components when building our modular facilities in order to reduce execution risk for facilities where we build from the ground up. For pre-existing facilities like those anticipated to be acquired with the Pete’s Acquisition, we will update facilities using our Stack & Flow Technology™. We are working to develop key partnerships with agricultural and equipment vendors to ensure efficient construction. As a result, we believe we can build, scale and commission a facility within 15 months of acquiring the underlying land, which we believe is significantly faster than our competitors. This strategy enables us to reduce the distance of our farms to our customers by more than 50% of the distance that is standard in the industry, mitigate supply chain risk, simplify transportation logistics and reduce food spoilage and waste.
Our branded loose leaf lettuce, living lettuce and living herbs are currently sold at more than 500 retail locations in nine states (Montana, Oregon, Washington, Utah, Idaho, Colorado, Wyoming, Nevada, Arizona), including Albertsons, Associated Food Stores and URM under banners such as Rosauers, Super 1 Foods and Yoke’s Fresh Market. In the future, we plan to co-locate with nationally recognized distributors in order to leverage their existing distribution networks and thereby decreasing further the carbon footprint by not adding additional distribution networks. In 2021, we offered eight stock keeping units ("SKUs") and intend to expand to between 15 and 25 SKUs by the end of 2022 to meet customer 
demand. The additional target SKUs will include blends that incorporate spinach, kale, and arugula all continuing to grow in popularity in American households. We believe the power of our brand and the quality of our products allow customers and consumers to associate Local Bounti produce with freshness and sustainability, and choose our products to enhance their diets while safeguarding the environment. Paired with our geographically distributed production, we believe that our branding and SKU diversity will allow us to capture greater market share with customers and consumers who seek a diversity of leafy green produce and are oriented to locally-produced, sustainable food.
Retail Store Count Timeline
Sustainability is at the core of our business focus, and our business directly addresses 12 of the 17 United Nations ("U.N.") Sustainable Development Goals. Our farming practices use 90% less land and water than traditional farming, and our usage of pesticides and herbicides is significantly lower as compared to field grown lettuce. Compared to field-grown loose leaf lettuce, our lettuce and herbs contain 10 to 1,000 times less bacteria than conventional farming, leading to a three to five times longer shelf life, which greatly reduces waste for both customers and consumers. Our local production facilities enable lower greenhouse gas emissions associated with transportation and provide greater access to fresh produce. We believe that our production methods also yield significantly greater worker welfare compared to traditional farming methods due to the type of farming inherent with the use of CEA technology (i.e., indoors). This is also central to our commitment to grow our people, which is as critical to us as growing our produce.
Market Overview
According to the U.N., by 2050, the global population is projected to be 9.8 billion with about 68% of the population living in an urban area, which presents challenges around energy, transportation, housing and food availability. In addition, consumer demands are challenging agriculture businesses to produce food in ways that are more safe, transparent, personalized, and sustainable.
Expanding Global Agriculture Crisis. The world is facing a rapidly expanding global agriculture crisis. According to a report released by the U.N. and its partners in 2020, we will need significantly more capacity to produce approximately 70% more food to feed the world’s population by 2050, but there will not be enough arable land and water for traditional agriculture to meet these needs. According to studies from The University of Sheffield, the world has lost more than 30% of its arable land in just the last 40 years, and approximately 60% of total global cropland has been depleted from irrigation usage. Significant enhancements in food production are also needed in the near term as the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization estimates that a quarter of the world’s population is "food insecure," which means it lacks consistent access to enough food for an active, healthy life. According to the international relief agency Mercy Corps, approximately nine million people die annually from hunger while approximately 10% to 30% of agricultural produce spoils before it is sold to consumers.
Increasing focus on healthy eating. Over the past few decades, there has been a growing consumer focus on healthy eating. Individuals are increasingly conscious of their diets and are opting for more fresh vegetables and produce. According to the International Food Information Council’s 2019 Food and Health Survey of American Consumers, 75% of respondents claimed they were eating healthier than a decade ago, including limiting sugar intake, eating less carbohydrates and processed foods, eating more fruits and vegetables, and paying more attention to what they are putting into their bodies. As the trend toward fresh food continues, the market for vegetables and herbs in the United States is expected to reach $30 billion by 2025 and grow 15% annually, according to a report published by S2G Ventures.

Demand for fresh and local produce. We believe consumers are increasingly drawn to local and sustainably grown food due to the freshness of the product, the taste, and a sense of supporting the local economy and environment. However, weather and geography limit the ability for traditional agriculture methods to provide most geographies with sufficient locally grown food year-round, or at all. For example, from November through March, approximately 90% of all leafy vegetables grown in the United States are sourced from Yuma County in southwest Arizona, according to the Yuma County Chamber of Commerce, which is thousands of miles from where much of this food is ultimately consumed.
CEA Overview
CEA is a technology-oriented approach towards plant-based food production and employs enclosed structures to grow plants in a protected environment where optimal growing conditions are maintained. Drivers for growth of CEA include scarcity of resources, such as arable land, water and suitable climate, as well as changing climatic conditions putting increased stress on conventional farming practices. CEA involves increased control over variables which optimizes the plant growing conditions, resulting in higher plant quality and larger production volume while ensuring resource efficiency. These variables include temperature, humidity, carbon dioxide, light, nutrient concentration, and nutrient pH. With a stable control of the plant environment, CEA can provide secure, high quality produce, year-round production of previously seasonal produce and higher production volume compared to conventional farming on the same size land. Moreover, CEA allows for a more efficient use of land and fresh water (up to 90% less water and land than soil-based agriculture), reduced need to use fertilizer or pesticides, reduced carbon emissions as CEA allows operations to be located closer to end-users, reduced food waste, and avoidance of chemical runoff from broad applications of fertilizer associated with field-based agriculture.
CEA growers employ various permutations of growing environments and growing methods to meet customer, operational and other metrics that are important determinants of the CEA operation.
Types of growing environments:
Greenhouse: A glass or polycarbonate structure that uses sunlight in crop production. Variables such as temperature, humidity and sunlight need to be considered carefully when growing produce in greenhouses, particularly during the summer months.
Indoor Farming / Vertical Farming: A crop production that utilizes supplemental lighting such as LED lights and gives the ability to control the environment. This type of controlled environment agriculture often uses a vertical space where plants can be stacked horizontally or in tall towers and may include rooms, warehouses, containers, factories and other converted indoor spaces not usually created for growing crops.
Protected Cropping: A crop production that is grown outdoors with some protection against exogenous elements. The protection may offer value against rain, hail and frost.
Types of growing methods:
Aeroponics: Plants suspended in a closed or semi-closed environment; the exposed roots and lower stem are sprayed with a nutrient-rich water solution.
Aquaponics: Cultivation of plants in a recirculating water medium with aquatic animal wastewater from an adjacent tank of fish, crayfish, prawns or snails. The waste is broken down by bacteria into usable nutrients for the plants.
Hydroponic: Growing plants in a soil-less water or media matrix by bathing roots in a nutrient-rich solution, which can be paired with aquaponics.
The rise of commercially-viable CEA. CEA can offer the food industry resiliency and dependability beyond what traditional agriculture can offer. CEA can produce a broad array of product consistently, year-round, and despite weather or other adverse growing conditions. CEA can also be implemented locally, which reduces the supply-chain risk associated with distanced or international suppliers. Recent events, including the COVID-19 pandemic, have forced grocers, restaurants and other food providers to reconsider their supply chain risk and seek reliable and less variable suppliers. We believe that CEA represents an attractive alternative for industry players seeking greater reliability and will lead to further adoption.
On a more global basis, CEA addresses 12 of the 17 total U.N. Sustainable Development Goals, including:

U.N. SustainableDevelopment Goal | CEA Benefit 
2) Zero Hunger | The flexibility of Local Bounti's locations enables access to fresh, local food from many parts of the world 
6) Clean Water and Sanitation | Drastic reduction in water usage in Local Bounti facilities conserves resources and does not produce polluted runoff like traditional, field-based agriculture 
7) Affordable and Clean Energy | Local Bounti facilities can be designed to be energy-efficient and sited with near renewable energy supply in the community and/or on-site, as well as take advantage of natural sunlight 
8) Decent Work and Economic Growth | Local Bounti provides full time, full year, indoor jobs versus transient, outdoor and seasonal labor in traditional agriculture 
9) Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure | Local Bounti spurs investment in sustainable and innovative infrastructure and technology, and provides jobs for local communities 
11) Sustainable Cities and Communities | Local Bounti locates facilities in and near urban environments, increasing jobs, taxes and investment in cities 
12) Responsible Consumption and Production | Due to reduction in transportation distance and controlled growing conditions, Local Bounti increases product shelf life and reduce food waste throughout the agricultural supply chain, as well as uses less land and fertilizer to grow more
13) Climate Action | Distributed, regional production potential of Local Bounti drastically reduces emissions from food supply chain transportation 
14) Life Below Water | Local Bounti eliminates agricultural runoff and uses recycled plastics to reduce the pollution of aquatic habitats 
15) Life on Land | Local Bounti utilizes 90% less land and has zero high nutrient runoff and thus reduces the impact on wildlife and the environment 
16) Peace Justice and Strong Institutions | Local Bounti's company policies and values include anti-discrimination, human rights, and anti-bribery commitments 
17) Partnerships for the Goals | Local Bounti participates in the UN Global Compact and is a member of the GRI community and United Fresh Produce Association/Produce Marketing Association 

Large and growing market opportunity for CEA.
Our initial geographic focus has been on the Western region of the United States, which we believe represents a total addressable market ("TAM") of approximately $10.6 billion out of the estimated $30 billion U.S. vegetable and herb TAM in 2025, according to a report published by S2G ventures. We believe the Mountain and West regions of the United States represent attractive target markets given their historical struggles with food scarcity and the greenfield opportunity for us to be the first large-scale CEA operator in many parts of this region. The Pete’s Acquisition helps to advance our focus in these regions, with two existing operational facilities in California. Pete’s also has an operating facility under construction in Georgia which is scheduled to begin operations in the second quarter of 2022. Following the anticipated closing of the Pete’s Acquisition, the Company will be in a position to capture a greater portion of the U.S. TAM. Our location selection analysis suggests that we will be able to build distributed, regional facilities that each serve multiple regional population centers, giving leverage to local production on a regional basis, including as we expand outside of the Western region of the United States. Additionally, we target initial addressable market facility expansion in states with 
favorable conditions for growth in light industrial production, including favorable state and local processes for facility siting, permitting, construction and operation. Additionally, we may target existing greenhouse or CEA operations for acquisitions if they are strategically located and meet our other business criteria, including, for example, our anticipated Pete’s Acquisition.

Our Solution
We believe Local Bounti is positioned as a disruptor to loose leaf lettuce and herbs production by changing the way food is grown with our Farm of the Future™, which focuses on driving profitable unit economics and is based on our patent pending Stack & Flow Technology™.

Our approach combines the features that we found most attractive from vertical farming and traditional hydroponic greenhouse growing to grow plants during their early development in our "stack" phase. This reduces facility square footage, drives capital expenditure and operating expenditure efficiency, increases the annual turns of the farm, and ultimately leads to increased returns on invested capital. This vertical nursery produces a stock of young plants to fill growing space in our controlled environment hydroponic greenhouses, where young plant growth is accelerated when exposed to a specified set of conditions, including natural light, temperature, humidity, carbon dioxide, nutrients, pH balance, and other key variables.
Environment Control Variables
We believe that we are well-positioned to redefine environmental, social and governance ("ESG") standards for indoor agriculture while delivering the freshest and highest quality produce to local communities with minimal carbon footprint. The key components to Local Bounti’s strategy are set forth below.
Unit economics focus with technology-driven approach. Local Bounti utilizes proprietary Stack & Flow Technology™, which combines the best of vertical and greenhouse growing technologies, enabling superior unit economics and efficiencies across the production cycle. Plants spend early development in a stacked nursery design, reducing facility square footage. When the plants reach targeted maturity, they are transported to hydroponic greenhouses, which are arranged on horizontal planes with natural sunlight and other controlled environmental variables, resulting in optimal growth conditions specified for each type of plant as well as space and energy efficiency. With less land requirement and fewer days in the greenhouse, our technology enables lower capital expenditure, lower operating expenses, higher labor efficiency and higher yield, and retrofit potential that others lack compared to results published by greenhouse farms and other CEA operations.
Modular and distributed production. Local Bounti uses a modular building system, which reduces time and cost of construction. Facilities are designed for automation and efficiency without being capital intensive. Pre-engineered, off-the-shelf construction and in-house developed technologies are used, which help to lower risks of execution for 
building and commissioning new production facilities. Our approach is to build geographically distributed production so we can provide our customers with locally-grown, lower pesticide and herbicide produce delivered at peak freshness on a year-round basis. Our current facility Hamilton, Montana was built in 2019 and reached full commercial operation by the second half of 2020. The Montana Facility underwent an expansion which was completed in the third quarter of 2021, and was fully commissioned in the fourth quarter of 2021. Additionally, we are developing a proprietary control center technology suite to enable remote monitoring of our operations to efficiently collect and analyze information to drive yields and grow better products.
Branded product with SKU diversity. Local Bounti sells branded product to food retail customers, including major grocery store operators, such as Albertsons, Associated Food Stores and URM under banners such as Rosauers, Super 1 Foods and Yoke’s Fresh Market. We believe that customers and consumers will associate our brand with high quality, locally-grown produce with better taste, freshness and significantly longer shelf life. Our modular, distributed model and Stack & Flow Technology™ allows for high SKU diversity. In 2021, we offered eight SKUs and intend to expand to between 15 and 25 SKUs by the end of 2022 to meet customer demand. The additional target SKUs will include blends that incorporate spinach, kale, and arugula - all continuing to grow in popularity in American households. We believe that SKU diversity in loose leaf lettuce will allow us to capture more in-store real estate and will result in consumer loyalty across multiple regional markets.
Local Bounti Product Offering
Montana Facility. Our Montana Facility was built in 2019 and reached commercial operations in the second half of 2020. The Montana Facility incorporates our patent pending Stack & Flow Technology™, including five operational greenhouses, a cold storage room for finished goods and a packaging room with processing equipment to transform freshly harvested produce into packaged goods that are ready for retail shelves. By leveraging our flexible modular approach, we completed an increase to the capacity of the Montana Facility by approximately 140% to 12 hydroponic ponds in the third quarter of 2021, which is now operational, and was fully commissioned in the fourth quarter of 2021. In October 2021, the Company acquired 20 acres of land adjacent to the Montana Facility for a potential research and development facility.
Development Pipeline. The Company is assessing its pipeline of future farm locations to maximize Pete’s national distribution footprint following the anticipated closing of the Pete’s Acquisition. Key considerations include meeting known demand from key existing customers within the network, as well as optimizing freight routes to ensure that transportation is optimized to limit cost while enhancing customer service with consistent delivery schedules. Given these considerations and the transformational nature of the anticipated Pete’s acquisition, the Company paused its construction of the Pasco facility to ensure that its design is fully optimized to drive best-in-class unit economics and that synergies with Pete’s existing growing systems are considered prior to continuing construction. The Company remains committed to the 
build-out of the Pasco facility and has completed site preparations, as well as obtained the necessary local and state permits to resume construction of the facility once the Company completes its planning.
Grown with Fewer Pesticides and Herbicides. Local Bounti produce is grown with significantly less pesticides and herbicides than traditional field-grown produce, is non-GMO and is certified by the United States Department of Agriculture ("USDA") as compliant with Harmonized Good Agricultural Practices (GAP Plus+). Local Bounti’s current SKUs are certified Pesticide Residue Free. Upon consummation of the Pete’s Acquisition, the additional SKUs which will be sold under the Pete’s name, will continue our commitment to using fewer pesticides and herbicides. Pete’s SKUs are generally grown with either an Organic (no non-Organic Materials Review Institute ("OMRI") approved fertilizer and no pesticide, herbicide or fungicides; certified as USDA Organic by a third party) or Pesticide Free (no pesticides used) pesticide profile, but are not currently certified Pesticide Residue Free. Following the closing of the Pete’s Acquisition, Local Bounti intends to help Pete’s facilities attain Pesticide Residue Free certifications and ultimately eliminate the use of non-organic pesticides altogether.
Cargill Relationship. In September 2021, Local Bounti Operating Company, along with certain other subsidiaries of the Company, and Cargill Financial Services International, Inc. ("Cargill Financial") entered into (a) a credit agreement (the "Original Senior Credit Agreement") for an up to $150 million multiple-advance term loan (the "Senior Facility") and (b) a subordinated credit agreement (the "Original Subordinated Credit Agreement" and, together with the Original Senior Credit Agreement, the "Original Credit Agreements") for an up to $50 million multiple-advance subordinated term loan (the "Subordinated Facility" and, together with the Senior Facility, the "Original Facilities"). On March 14, 2022, Local Bounti and Local Bounti Operating Company, along with certain subsidiaries of the Company, entered into a First Amendment to Credit Agreements and Subordination Agreement (the "Amendment") to amend the Original Credit Agreements and the Original Facilities (as amended, the "Amended Facilities"). The Amendment provides that, subject to and upon the closing of the Pete’s Acquisition, (a) the Pete’s Acquisition will be funded pursuant to the Amended Facilities, (b) the aggregate commitment amount of the Original Facilities will be reduced to $170.0 million which is anticipated to be the amount necessary to fund the Pete’s Acquisition, the Property Acquisition (as defined below), the updating of the facilities to be acquired in the Pete’s Acquisition with the Company’s Stack & Flow Technology™ and certain expansion at one facility, (c) the minimum liquidity covenant will be reduced from $30 million to $20 million (inclusive of existing restricted cash on the Consolidated Balance Sheets) and (d) the interest rate of each of the Senior Facility and the Subordinated Facility will increase by 2%, among other matters. As part of the Amendment, the Company agreed to (i) pay a $2.0 million amendment fee and (ii) issue 1,932,931 shares of Common Stock to Cargill Financial (the "Cargill Financial Equity") upon the closing of the Pete’s Acquisition. Additionally, Cargill, Incorporated participated in the PIPE Financing (as defined in Note 3, Business Combination and Recapitalization, to our Consolidated Financial Statements).
Our Competitive Strengths
We believe the following competitive strengths will enable us to capitalize on the expanding opportunity for CEA and locally grown produce.
Ability to drive production yield and lower costs. We designed and purpose-built our Farm of the Future™, which focuses on driving profitable unit economics and is based on our patent pending Stack & Flow Technology™. We are developing a centralized monitoring system which collects, organizes and analyzes data from distributed facilities. Our sophisticated data analytics enable us to continually improve the operations of our facilities and to centrally control key variables such as temperature, humidity, carbon dioxide, light, nutrients and pH balances. We have also implemented additional innovations that shorten growing cycles, improve production yield and lower costs, such as optimizing plant density to increase greenhouse production capacity. Our Montana Facility currently supports a greenhouse crop cycle of 14 to 24 days depending on the SKU. We have further identified a clear roadmap for margin expansion and product diversification with significant visibility into reduced labor cost opportunities and improved profitability. We expect our facility capital cost to EBITDA ratio to be 3.0 times by the end of 2025.  
Importantly, the Company continues to exceed its expectations for crop cycle improvement for its commercial butter lettuce, which as of December 31, 2021 was 17 turns annually compared to nine turns achieved in 2020, representing an 88% improvement. Notably, this performance already exceeds the Company’s long-term assumptions that were previously reported and performance within its trials are generating further gains. 
Branded products that are strategic for retailers and trusted by consumers. We expect Local Bounti branded products to generate strong customer loyalty by offering affordable, high-quality produce that is locally grown and sustainably sourced. We believe that consumers choose our products because the Local Bounti brand is a promise that the food they eat is sustainably and locally grown, non-GMO, healthy and at the peak of freshness because it is at the retailer’s distribution centers within 24 to 48 hours from harvest. Our produce has a three-to-five week shelf life compared to three-to-five days for traditionally grown produce, which leads to substantially less waste and, in turn, cost savings for grocers as well as consumers. In addition to cost savings from reduced spoilage, we are an increasingly important supplier for our 
retail grocer customers given our diverse and quality product offerings and reliability. Our CEA methods enable year-round crop production and consistent supply regardless of the local climate or weather conditions.
Highly scalable turnkey platform. Local Bounti’s patent pending Farm of the Future™ facilities are designed to use pre-engineered, pre-fabricated and standardized components to enable efficient expansion with low execution risk or added costs. Our facilities have been purposely designed for rapid expansion, allowing us to potentially build and commission a facility within 15 months of land acquisition, as compared to 21 to 24 months reported by our most direct competitor.
Experienced management team. We have an experienced and passionate management team with deep industry knowledge and a diverse set of core competencies. Our diverse leadership team has operational and brand building experience at Plenty, Bushel Boy Farms, Earthbound Farms, Jacks Links, Chobani, and other established brands. Our Co-CEO, Craig M. Hurlbert, has a track record of building successful businesses through his former roles, including as CEO and Chairman of TAS Energy. Our other Co-CEO, Travis M. Joyner, has a long career in venture capital and management consulting. Our COO, Mark McKinney, has extensive experience in the food industry through his previous roles as CEO of Al Ghurair Foods and his roles with Dole Foods, which included President of Dole Packaged Foods Asia, President and Managing Director of Dole Thailand, and earlier in his career, senior global supply chain management positions with Dole for its Europe, North America and Asia operations. Our CIO, B. David Vosburg Jr., has extensive experience in agricultural technology through his previous roles as CFO of Crop One and CFO of Sensei Ag. Our CFO, Kathleen Valiasek, has extensive experience as a public company CFO, most recently at Amyris.
Growth Strategies
We intend to leverage our competitive strengths to continue to optimize our production and distribution to meet the rising demand for our products through the growth strategies set forth below.
Continue to improve unit economics through technology focus and design improvements. CEA is an emerging industry that is continually benefiting from technological advancement and development. We intend to continue to optimize our facilities through design and materials improvements and by leveraging computer vision, artificial intelligence and robotics to optimize energy and labor usage. Through these enhancements, we believe we can shorten grow cycles to a maximum of seven to 21 days. We also believe we can continue to drive profitability with identified opportunities to reduce packaging costs and with an increasingly efficient cost structure as we gain economies of scale.
Importantly, the Company continues to exceed its expectations for crop cycle improvement for its commercial butter lettuce, which as of December 31, 2021 was 17 turns annually compared to nine turns achieved in 2020, representing an 88% improvement. This performance already exceeds the Company’s long-term assumptions that were previously reported and performance within its trials are generating further gains. 
Scale our platform by adding additional capacity and new facilities near our customers. We use flexible, modular facility designs to enable rapid expansion near major population centers. The Company is assessing its pipeline of future farm locations to maximize Pete’s national distribution footprint upon the anticipated closing of the Pete’s Acquisition. Key considerations include meeting known product demand from key existing customers within the network, as well as optimizing freight routes to ensure that transportation is optimized to limit cost while enhancing customer service with consistent delivery schedules. Our approach is to build or acquire geographically distributed production facilities so we can provide our customers with locally-grown, lower pesticide and herbicide produce delivered at peak freshness on a year-round basis. We plan to use substantial pre-engineered, pre-fabricated and standardized components when building our modular facilities in order to reduce execution risk for facilities where we build from the ground up. For pre-existing facilities like those anticipated to be acquired with the Pete’s Acquisition, we will update facilities using our Stack & Flow Technology™. We are working to develop key partnerships with agricultural and equipment vendors to ensure efficient construction. As a result, we believe we can build, scale and commission a facility within 15 months of acquiring the underlying land, which we believe is significantly faster than our competitors. This strategy enables us to reduce the distance of our farms to our customers by more than 50% of the distance that is standard in the industry, mitigate supply chain risk, simplify transportation logistics, and reduce food spoilage and waste.
Continue to develop our brand to further our differentiation and customer and consumer loyalty. We believe we are innovating within the living and loose leaf lettuce and herbs produce category, and we intend to further establish our Local Bounti branded line of products as synonymous with fresh, delicious, locally and sustainably grown food. We will develop and foster these brand associations to accelerate customer adoption, increase brand loyalty and gain greater share of customer grocery spend. As an early CEA mover in our markets, we believe we are capturing customer mind share for locally-sourced produce through our quality products, lively packaging and marketing initiatives. We actively market our brand in partnership with our retailers through retail activation strategies, including in-store displays, circular advertisements, point-of-purchase signage and promotions. We intend to continue to support the customer experience via media strategies – both traditional and digital media – supported by our local-minded approach we will geo-target consumers serving up messaging and awareness at every touchpoint. This will further strengthen brand awareness 
and loyalty. We believe that our attractive and recyclable packaging will also contribute to the success of our products and we intend to invest in developing even more appealing and sustainable packaging over time. We believe that strategic branding and marketing efforts will be critical to growing our market presence, expanding within our customers as we grow our product line, and building consumer loyalty.
Expand our product line. Utilizing our advanced design and technology features, including strategic partitioning and environment control technology, we intend to leverage our proven ability to efficiently accommodate greater product diversity at our facilities. We believe our differentiated hybrid technology will yield greater product diversity over a reduced footprint. In 2021, we offered eight SKUs and intend to expand to between 15 and 25 SKUs by the end of 2022 to meet customer demand. The additional target SKUs will include blends that incorporate spinach, kale, and arugula - all continuing to grow in popularity in American households. We believe our differentiated branded offering will enable us to capture greater shelf space and in-store real estate at our retailers as we expand our product line, which will in turn expand our consumer visibility.
Continue to develop and diversify our sales channels and geographies. We intend to expand our sales channels where we can enhance our brand and maximize the efficiency of our distribution. We focus on the retail channel and complement our distribution with foodservice. In the future, we plan to co-locate with nationally recognized distributors in order to leverage their existing distribution networks and thereby decreasing further the carbon footprint by not adding additional distribution. We believe that our leading technology and brand will enable licensing and franchising opportunities to other indoor agriculture operators, with minimal capital investment from us. Lastly, global regions with geographic constraints to traditional agriculture, such as the Middle East and parts of Asia have expressed interest in expanding CEA capabilities and represent potential significant opportunities for us to monetize our technology and expertise through international expansion, should we decide to expand into those markets.
Expected High Market Share Capture with Strategic Facility Expansion Plan,
Strong Branding and Broad Product Offering

Continue to invest in research and development and develop genetics and advanced technology. We believe further investment in research and development, advanced technology and in the future, genetics, is critical to our plan to expand margins and increase SKU diversity over the subsequent years. Investment in plant science will enable greater yield optimization, creating plants that are bred for optimal growth in facility environments. We note that plant science and breeding for optimal growth does not mean our plants are genetically modified but are purposefully grown under specific conditions using innovative farming techniques. Additionally, we are developing our own, proprietary control center technology suite that enables remote, centralized control for data-driven environmental control and research and development. Currently this control center technology allows us to manage our Montana Facility efficiently with high data generation and capture. Over time, we plan to build substantial efficiency and research and development through this control center technology, including centralized control to optimize grower resources, data modeling and tracking, and development of crop growth algorithms that can be rapidly tested and rolled out across our fleet of facilities.
Importantly, the Company continues to exceed its expectations for crop cycle improvement for its commercial butter lettuce, which as of December 31, 2021 was 17 turns annually compared to nine turns achieved in 2020, representing 
an 88% improvement. Notably, this performance already exceeds the Company’s long-term assumptions that were previously reported and performance within its trials are generating further gains. 
Leverage our industry leading focus on sustainability. We believe that the CEA space is inherently sustainable. Many of our competitors do not have the commitment to an aggressively transparent process, disclosing the good and bad. Local Bounti is committed to improving our business using the benefits of a consistent, business wide focus on our stakeholders (employees, consumers, customers, communities and investors) and their growing interest in how our actions and products impact them. Our sustainability efforts are already generating tremendous business value with employee engagement, community commitment, and reduction of valuable process inputs. See "Local Bounti Sustainability Plan" below for further information on our Sustainability Program.
Product shelf-life tests have demonstrated our product lasts three to five times longer than competing offerings. We believe our unique technology and process provides customers with longer lasting freshness, higher nutritional content, and less bacteria, mold and yeast due to our controlled indoor environment. We have performed product shelf-life tests which demonstrated that our loose leaf lettuce lasts three to five times longer in the consumer’s refrigerator (assuming purchased on the day of delivery to the purchase point) than one of our organic loose leaf lettuce competitors. Research reports attribute much of this shelf-life extension to the reduced bacteria, mildew and mold achieved using CEA production, as compared to traditionally grown products (even post-harvest washed). Additionally, all of Local Bounti’s products are certified pesticide residue free (excluding new SKUs attained through the proposed Pete’s Acquisition).
Local Bounti Sustainability Plan
Local Bounti’s compact, efficient, and local farms provide fresh produce with minimum transportation distances. Combined with our advanced technologies, the location of our facilities in less developed communities and areas with available supporting resources such as adequate water and renewable energy, Local Bounti believes it has the potential to be among the most sustainable produce suppliers in the nation. We have developed a sustainability program which is aligned with ESG best practices in the CEA space. To increase the visibility of our sustainability activities, our first Sustainability Report was published in December 2021. It reports according to both the Global Reporting Initiative ("GRI") and Sustainability Accounting Standards Board ("SASB") frameworks.
Environment: Our Montana Facility is located in an area with 90%+ greenhouse gas (GHG) free electricity generation and we have committed to producing GHG neutral leafy greens by the year 2030. The short transport distances to our customers dramatically reduces food miles and transportation emissions. Delivering fresher and higher quality product reduces food waste in the supply chain and lowers consumer food waste. Our produce lasts three times longer than non-CEA lettuce due to these conditions. Additionally, we use significantly less pesticides, and our indoor facilities have zero high nutrient water runoff, which is common in traditional agriculture. We currently use recycled polyethylene terephthalate ("rPET") for some of our packaging.
Social – Employees: Being local and producing year round not only allows for competitive produce prices and the opportunity for more consumers to access high quality produce, it also allows our facilities to offer full time, indoor jobs to members of the community, offsetting the seasonal work offered by more traditional agriculture businesses. We are also committed to paying a living wage, hiring locally, and promoting internally by investing in internal and community training programs. At our Montana Facility, our wages, including benefits which start on first day of employment are more than double the state mandated minimum wage. To keep up with the evolving market, we are also committed to engaging our workforce to help us understand any issues with our current strategy and to develop and enhance our indoor agriculture training and internal development opportunities. Effective January 2022, our co-CEOs, Craig M. Hurlbert and Travis M. Joyner decided to reduce their salaries to be in-line with the lowest level of our employees at the Montana Facility, approximately $35 thousand.
Social – Community: We prioritize under-served communities where our facilities are located and as a corporation are and will continue donating produce to our communities. These investments are more impactful and provide better economic and social results in these underserved areas. These investments are supported by large on-going local purchases and significant employment. We used the Federal Opportunity Zone program to help identify communities in need of investments, and our first two (non-Pete's) facilities are in such communities. These two facilities are bringing almost $70 million of capital investment and over 80 new jobs for these locations. We plan to consider underserved communities in our future site selection process as well.
Governance: Local Bounti sees ESG as a competitive advantage and strives to be fully supportive of these endeavors at all levels of the Company. This alignment and focus will aid us in steering our long-term corporate actions in the right direction. Our sustainability program is led by a senior executive who reports directly to the co-CEOs.
Competition
Local Bounti’s competition includes greenhouse operators and other CEA operators such as vertical farming operators. Greenhouse operators grow crops within a sheltered structure on a horizontal plane, while vertical farming operators grow crops in vertically stacked layers indoors.
There are over 9,000 greenhouses in the United States according to the United States Census of Agriculture in 2017, an increase of 115% from seven years earlier. However, 90% of these farms are small – less than 8,000 square feet in area. Large-scale greenhouse operators have the largest market position and own and operate hundreds to thousands of acres of greenhouse. Most of the companies have the major portions of their operations in Mexico and Canada, but all are either looking to develop, are developing, or have already developed U.S.-based high-tech greenhouses. These companies include Mastronardi Produce Ltd. and Pure Flavour.
We potentially compete with traditional greenhouse producers, as well as CEA companies using high technology greenhouses such as AppHarvest, Bright Farms, and Revol Greens. We also potentially compete against vertical farming operators, including AeroFarms, Bowery Farming, and Plenty.
We believe that our Stack & Flow Technology™, modular and distributed approach and local branded product diversity provide competitive advantages over our peers as the mainstream facility formats in CEA present a challenging trade-off between yield and operating/capital costs. Each method, independently, brings key challenges, including (a) inability to maximize revenue without consistent yield; (b) poor profitability with high costs; (c) limited retail relationships and lack of product diversity; and (d) inability to scale quickly and effectively. Local Bounti leverages a hybrid of vertical and greenhouse growing formats, which efficiently unites the best aspects of both technologies, resulting in increased volumes and year-round production. In addition, this model results in 1.5 to 2.0 times the yield of comparable greenhouse farms.
Government Regulation
Local Bounti is subject to laws and regulations administered by various federal, state and local government agencies in the United States, such as the United States Food and Drug Administration ("FDA"), the Federal Trade Commission ("FTC"), the Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA"), the Occupational Safety and Health Administration ("OSHA"), and the USDA. These laws and regulations apply to the production, packaging, distribution, sale, marketing, labeling, quality, safety and transportation of our products, as well as occupational safety and health practices.

The farms also have to comply with FDA and USDA labeling and marketing requirements, and could be subject to the Organic Food Production Act, among other laws and regulations implemented by the FDA the USDA and other regulators. Certain FSMA regulations are still being developed and implemented, including product traceability requirements recently proposed, which would be directly applicable to our products. The FDA and the USDA have the authority to inspect our farms depending on the type of product and operations involved. The FDA and the USDA also require that certain information appear on our product labels and, more generally, that our labels and labeling be truthful and non-misleading. Similarly, the FTC requires that Local Bounti’s marketing and advertising be truthful, non-misleading, not deceptive to consumers and not otherwise an unfair means of competition. Local Bounti is also restricted by the FDA and the USDA from making certain types of claims about our products, including nutrient content claims, health claims, organic claims

In the event the Pete’s Acquisition has not been consummated by April 6, 2022, the Local Bounti 
Operating Company will be obligated to pay a nonrefundable advance payment of $5.8 million to Pete’s (the "Nonrefundable Payment"). In the event the Pete’s Acquisition has not been consummated by April 30, 2022, either the Sellers’ Representative or the Local Bounti Operating Company may terminate the Purchase Agreements at any time and the Nonrefundable Payment will be retained by Pete’s upon such termination. If the Pete’s Acquisition is consummated after April 6, 2022 but before April 30, 2022, the Nonrefundable Payment will credited toward the Cash Payment.
The Purchase Agreements also contain customary representations and warranties and covenants from each of the parties, including certain restrictive covenants applicable to the Selling Parties. The Company has obtained representation and warranty insurance in connection with the Purchase Agreements.
Local Bounti expects to close the Pete’s Acquisition in the second quarter of 2022.
