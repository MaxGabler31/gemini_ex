Business

The Company, through its subsidiaries, SilverLight Aviation, LLC (“SLA LLC”) and Silverlight Electric Vehicle Inc. is actively engaged in the design, development, manufacturing, distribution and marketing of reverse trikes and gyrocopters. We operate in two divisions, Aviation and Reverse Trike. We maintain a website at www.silverlightaviation.com for the Aviation Division and www.silverlightev.com (website is under construction) for the Reverse Trike Division. We are commencing our efforts to expand operations of the business and establish a global network of distributors and dealers. We have recently received an order from Taiwan for two AR-1 gyrocopters along with an option for 20 more.
Aviation Division

The Company is manufacturing a two-seat gyrocopter “AR-1” (American Ranger 1). A gyrocopter looks like a small helicopter but the main difference is there is no engine turning the main rotor. The rotor simply self-propelled (which we call “auto-rotate”) due to the way that the air flows through them. It also does not have a tail rotor. As the engine is not connected to the rotors, this means that a Gyrocopter is not seriously affected if the engine should stop in flight. This, together with a very short landing roll (we can land in a very small open space, about the size of a putting green). Today, Gyrocopters are one to three seat aeroplanes whose maximum take-off weight does not exceed 560 kgs.

SLA, LLC started in February 2012 as a light aircraft engineering consulting company facilitating and managing compliance projects at the technical level for various light aircraft manufacturers. In 2015, it changed operations to design and manufacture a light experimental gyroplane kit to fit FAA allowed regulations for gyroplanes. In such an effort, it acquired the rights to a design for a two seat tandem gyroplane which was used as a basis to develop the AR-1 gyroplane. To date SLA LLC has sold 53 gyroplanes, 48 of them as AR-1 kits.

Inventory consists of CNC machined parts, raw materials like metal tubing, composite materials, resins, and hardware. SLA LLC maintains a hangar at the Zephyrhills Airport. At this facility we have the capacity to produce 12 gyroplane kits per year. Sales have traditionally averaged approximately 10 per year, with sales expected to be lower for 2021, due to factors including decreased demand associated with COVID 19. We manufacture kits for gyroplanes that are not put together, but rather we manufacture parts and assemblies used in the gyroplanes but they do not get put together by us but by our customers who are considered the "builders" of the gyroplanes by the FAA as they do 51% of the work on the aircraft.

SLA LLC is also in the process of designing a brand-new Side-by-Side four-seater VTOL (vertical take-off & landing) model, it is scheduled to be completed within the next two years and certified under the FAA Experimental Type Certificate program. We anticipate our manufacturing capacity to be approximately 15 to 20 units a year depending on options and configuration. We anticipate commencing production for a side gyroplane July 2023.

(AR-1) American Ranger 1 Gyroplane

The AR-1 is a modern gyroplane manufactured in the United States in our 12,000 square foot factory located in the greater Tampa Bay area of central Florida. We also offer buyers assistance at our facility. The AR-1 combines eye-catching design elements and style, balanced with ever-important safety features and performance. The AR-1 cuts through turbulence and high wind, for smooth and comfortable flying. With speeds ranging as high as 110 mph or as slow as 25 mph, you can enjoy a cross-country adventure or sight-see around your environment at a leisurely pace, while in complete control.
Performance

Unlike a helicopter, a gyroplane’s rotor blades are not connected to the engine, except during pre-rotation just before takeoff. The rotor blades auto-rotate by way of being loaded and traveling through air. Thus, a gyroplane does not need the engine to be in control in order to fly. Instead, the engine keeps the gyroplane moving forward, without losing altitude. In the event of an engine failure, the gyroplane will simply start to lose altitude and can land with almost zero roll – meaning it can touch down gently and then safely come to a stop. It needs a relatively small space (300 to 600 feet) to break ground on takeoff.
Gyroplane Stowing & Hauling

Gyroplanes are compact aircraft that can easily be stowed in a relatively small space, in a hangar or garage. Gyroplanes take up much less space than any aircraft with wings, and can be easily transported in a trailer.
Enclosure Options

The AR-1 gyroplane has a convertible option (AR-1C), with the choice of being fully-enclosed or having two windshields. This is a unique option, in its class and price range, giving the option to fly with a semi-open cockpit with windshields or with a fully-enclosed canopy with cabin heat for winter months. The enclosed canopy can also be ordered and installed at a later point by the factory or service station.
Engineering

Our rotor system is the venerable high-inertia Stella rotor system, which is an aluminum alloy rotor. The carriage is built on a high-strength welded stainless-steel frame, with a fiberglass composite streamlined fairing, with an effective tail for excellent stability and control. The AR-1’s controls are easily accessible and made primarily of metal tubes not push-pull control cables. The main landing gear is 7075-T6 aluminum leaf spring which supplies a slower spring back rate than composite leaf gear found in many production machines. Landing gear is covered by lift generating composite fairings. Hydraulic disc brakes are installed on both main wheels, with wheel pants.

Additionally, the AR-1 is available powered by field-proven industry standard Rotax aircraft four-stroke power plants. It comes with a choice of either Rotax 912ULS (dual carbs) or 912iS (fuel injected) 100 HP engine or the turbocharged Rotax 914UL 115HP engine for better performance and operation at higher altitudes or the latest technology in Rotax aircraft engine line, Rotax 915iS, with fuel injected turbo charged 141 HP that can really kick things up.

Flight Dynamics

The AR-1’s gyro establishes new norms in modern pusher-style gyroplanes. The AR-1 has little coupling between power and yaw, and power and pitch. The AR-1’s high inertia rotor system and clean lines give it a better glide ratio and energy retention, making landing easier and more forgiving – even for beginner pilots. Its front (or nose) wheel is linked to the rudder for easier taxing, but also has trail which allows a good compromise in both ground handling and in lessening danger of a pilot touching down the nose wheel while the front wheel is angled sideways (like in a crosswind but there is still some forward speed left).

With these capabilities, it was anticipated that the improved safety, performance, reliability, maneuverability, and operating cost of our gyrocopters would permit them to compete with helicopters for most of their missions. Potential customers included:


· | Law enforcement (police, sheriff, border patrol, customs, drug interdiction); 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Public service agencies (fire patrol, wildlife, land management); 
· | Military (courier, armed surveillance, VIP transport, forward artillery control, ground attack, unmanned aerial vehicle); 
· | Commercial (oil, gas, and power line patrol and inspection, land survey, aerial photography, crop spraying, herd management, air taxi service, corporate transport) and
· | Private (commuting, sport flying, training).

The company plans on selling our vehicles through the company website and reseller agents. We have received our WMI (World Manufacturer Identification ), and we are working on our Florida DMV Manufacturer License at the moment too. Once acquired, we will have the capability to issue our VIN numbers, and start selling our new reverse-trike products. SilverLight Electric Vehicle Inc. has recently received its NHTSA (National Highway and Transportation Safety Administration Manufacturer Identification) number. This newly issued NHTSA number enables the company to issue VIN’s (Vehicle identification Number) for the sales of its electric reverse-trike products.

In addition, we hope to finalize our powertrain testing of two entry models - a convertible roadster model and a gull-wing fully enclosed cabin model. We expect the powertrain system will deliver up to 45 KW (60 HP) of peak output, up to 150 miles per charge with its 15 Kwh and 20 Kwh lithium-ion battery packs.

Government Regulation

The nature of aviation products has resulted in their manufacture being regulated by governments for public safety, national defense, and economic and/or political purposes. Such regulations vary widely by country, by product type and by usage. Our products and intended products are principally impacted by United States laws and regulations, but also by requirements in our potential export markets. As our products can be used for private, commercial, public agency or military purposes, their sale and operation are governed by regulations appropriate to each category. Developmental flight testing of our aircraft is carried out under exemption rules covering experimental aircraft. The following section reviews the principal regulations applicable to each category of our activities in the United States. Our gyroplanes are subject to the Federal Aviation Administration (“FAA”) - LSA (Light Sports Aircraft) classification. We are classified as “Experimental Amateur Built” and are not required to obtain certifications other than maintaining our general business registration. As we manufacture the kits (parts and assemblies) for gyroplanes that are not put together, but rather are put together by our customers who are considered the "builders" of the gyroplanes by the FAA.
Intellectual Property

We do not currently own, and do not have any current plans to seek, any patents in connection with our existing and planned operations. Except for the trademark of ORCA from the United States Patent and Trademark Office, we do not have any copyrights, trademarks, but we generally rely upon copyright, trademark and trade secret laws to protect and maintain our proprietary rights for our technology and products. Notwithstanding the steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property rights, third parties may infringe or misappropriate our proprietary rights. Competitors may also independently develop technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to the technologies we employ in our products and services.
Competition

There are several companies offering or developing reverse trikes and gyrocopters, and there can be no assurance that direct competitors to our solutions will arise. The markets for our products are intensely competitive, continually evolving and subject to changing technologies. We face significant competition, including from companies that have entered this space much earlier than us and are better capitalized, with vertically integrated business models, larger than us, have more access to capital and have lower operating costs than we do. These competitors may be able to respond more rapidly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements or to devote greater resources to the development, promotion and sale of their products. These competitors may enter our existing or future markets with currencies that may be less expensive, that may provide higher performance or additional features or that may be introduced more quickly than our products. Our products are also competing with other forms of trikes and copters which are currently more widely accepted and used by the public.
