Item 1. | Business.
--------+----------

 The GUC Trust was formed on March 30, 2011 as a statutory trust under the Delaware Statutory Trust Act, as amended, or the Delaware Act, upon the execution of the Motors Liquidation Company GUC Trust Agreement, or the GUC Trust Agreement, by Motors Liquidation Company, or MLC, MLC of Harlem, Inc., MLCS, LLC, MLCS Distribution Corporation, Remediation and Liability Management Company, Inc. and Environmental Corporate Remediation Company, Inc., Wilmington Trust Company, not in its individual capacity but solely in its capacity as trust administrator and trustee of the GUC Trust, or the GUC Trust Administrator, and FTI Consulting, Inc., solely in its capacity as trust monitor of the GUC Trust, or the GUC Trust Monitor, and upon the filing of the Certificate of Trust of Motors Liquidation Company GUC Trust with the Office of the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware. 
 The GUC Trust has no officers, directors or employees. The GUC Trust is administered by the GUC Trust Administrator, which is authorized by the GUC Trust Agreement to engage professionals, or GUC Trust Professionals, to assist the GUC Trust Administrator in the administration of the GUC Trust. Accordingly, the GUC Trust and GUC Trust Administrator rely on receiving accurate information, reports and other representations from (i) the GUC Trust professionals, (ii) the GUC Trust Monitor, and (iii) other service providers to the GUC Trust. Notwithstanding such reliance, the GUC Trust Administrator is ultimately responsible for the disclosure provided in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Among other rights and duties, pursuant and subject to the GUC Trust Agreement, the GUC Trust Administrator has the powers and authority as set forth in the GUC Trust Agreement, including, without limitation, the power and authority to hold, manage, sell, invest and distribute the assets comprising the corpus of the GUC Trust, prosecute and resolve objections to Disputed General Unsecured Claims (as defined below), take all necessary actions to administer the wind-down of the affairs of the Debtors (as defined below), and resolve and satisfy (to the extent allowed) any administrative expenses, priority tax claims, priority non-tax claims and secured claims, or collectively the Residual Wind-Down Claims. The activities of the GUC Trust Administrator are overseen by the GUC Trust Monitor. As further described below, the GUC Trust was formed for the purposes of implementing the Plan (as defined below) as a post-confirmation successor to MLC and resolving Disputed General Unsecured Claims against MLC and its affiliated debtors and debtors-in-possession, or the Debtors, and winding-down the Debtors affairs, with no objective to engage in the conduct of a trade or business. The GUC Trust is a post-confirmation successor to MLC within the meaning of Section 1145 of title 11 of the United States Code, or the Bankruptcy Code. 
 Background: The General Motors Corporation Bankruptcy 
 General Motors Corporation, or Old GM, which is also known as MLC, and certain of its direct and indirect subsidiaries, Chevrolet-Saturn of Harlem, Inc., n/k/a MLC of Harlem, Inc., Saturn, LLC, n/k/a MLCS, LLC and Saturn Distribution Corporation, n/k/a MLCS Distribution Corporation, filed voluntary petitions for relief under chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code, in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York, or the Bankruptcy Court, on June 1, 2009. On October 9, 2009, Remediation and Liability Management Company, Inc. and Environmental Corporate Remediation Company, Inc., each of which was a subsidiary of Old GM, filed voluntary petitions for relief under chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code with the Bankruptcy Court. 
 On July 5, 2009, the Bankruptcy Court authorized the sale of substantially all of the assets of the Debtors to an acquisition vehicle principally formed by the United States Department of the Treasury, or the U.S. Treasury. On July 10, 2009, the acquisition vehicle, NGMCO, Inc., acquired substantially all of the assets and assumed certain liabilities of the Debtors pursuant to a Master Sale and Purchase Agreement, or, as amended, the MSPA, among Old GM and certain of its debtor subsidiaries and NGMCO, Inc., in a transaction under Section 363 of the Bankruptcy Code, or the 363 Transaction. In connection with the 363 Transaction, Old GM changed its name to Motors Liquidation Company and the acquisition vehicle, pursuant to a holding company reorganization, became General Motors Company, or (together with its consolidated subsidiaries) New GM. 
 The primary consideration provided by New GM to the Debtors under the MSPA was 150 million shares of common stock of New GM, or the New GM Common Stock, issued by General Motors Company, amounting to approximately 10% of the outstanding New GM Common Stock at the time of the closing of the 363 Transaction, a series of warrants to acquire 136,363,635 newly issued shares of New GM Common Stock with an exercise price set at $10.00 per share that were scheduled to expire on July 10, 2016, or the New GM Series A Warrants, and another series of warrants to acquire 136,363,635 newly issued shares of New GM Common Stock with an exercise price set at $18.33 per share that were scheduled to expire on July 10, 2019, or the New GM Series B Warrants, and, collectively, the New GM Warrants. Together, the New GM Warrants constituted approximately 15% of the New GM Common Stock on a fully-diluted basis at the time of their issuance. Collectively, the New GM Common Stock and the New GM Warrants are referred to as the New GM Securities. As described below, all of the GUC Trusts holdings of the New GM Securities were liquidated in July and August 2015. 
 Additional consideration was also provided in the form of (i) the assumption of certain liabilities by New GM, (ii) a credit bid of certain outstanding obligations under (a) certain prepetition debt held by the U.S. Treasury and (b) a debtor-in-possession credit 
 
2 


  agreement, or the DIP Credit Agreement, held by, as lenders thereunder, the U.S. Treasury and the Governments of Canada and Ontario (through Export Development Canada), and together with the U.S. Treasury, the DIP Lenders, and (iii) the cancellation of certain warrant notes issued to the U.S. Treasury. 
 In the event that the Bankruptcy Court enters an order, or orders, that include a finding that the estimated aggregate Allowed General Unsecured Claims against the Debtors exceed $35 billion, New GM will be required, pursuant to the MSPA, to issue additional shares of New GM Common Stock, or Additional Shares, for the benefit of the GUC Trusts beneficiaries. The number of Additional Shares to be issued will be equal to the number of such shares, rounded up to the next whole share, calculated by multiplying (i) 30 million shares (adjusted to take into account any stock dividend, stock split, combination of shares, recapitalization, merger, consolidation, reorganization or similar transaction with respect to such New GM Common Stock from and after the closing of the 363 Transaction and before issuance of the Additional Shares) and (ii) a fraction, (a) the numerator of which is the amount by which Allowed General Unsecured Claims exceed $35 billion (such excess amount being capped at $7 billion) and (b) the denominator of which is $7 billion. No Additional Shares have been issued as of the date of filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Revised Settlement Agreement is approved by the Bankruptcy Court, any Additional Shares issued as a result of the entry of a claims estimation order relating to certain claims underlying the Late Claims Motions will be placed in a fund for the exclusive benefit of certain plaintiffs with respect to such claims, and the holders of beneficial interests in the GUC Trust, including those future holders that are expected from the settlement of the Term Loan Avoidance Action as defined and described below under Term Loan Avoidance Action, will be deemed to irrevocably waive and release any and all right to the Additional Shares. 
 On March 18, 2011, the Debtors filed the Debtors Second Amended Joint Chapter 11 Plan, or the Plan, with the Bankruptcy Court, and on March 29, 2011, or the Confirmation Date, the Bankruptcy Court entered an order confirming the Plan, or the Confirmation Order. The Plan became effective on March 31, 2011, or the Effective Date. On December 15, 2011, or the Dissolution Date, as required by the Plan, MLC filed a Certificate of Dissolution with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware and MLC was dissolved as of such date. On April 18, 2013, the Bankruptcy Court entered an order granting the GUC Trusts request for entry of a final decree administratively closing each of the Debtors chapter 11 cases other than that of MLC. 
 The Plan and the Formation of the GUC Trust 
 The Plan treats all creditors and equity interest holders in accordance with their relative priorities under the Bankruptcy Code, and designates six distinct classes of claims or equity interests: secured claims, priority non-tax claims, general unsecured claims, property environmental claims, asbestos personal injury claims and equity interests in MLC. The GUC Trust is primarily tasked with the resolution and satisfaction of general unsecured claims. Under the terms of the Plan, for each $1,000 in amount of allowed general unsecured claims against the Debtors, or the Allowed General Unsecured Claims, the holders of such claims are currently entitled to receive (upon delivery of any information required by the GUC Trust) approximately $296 in cash (which dollar value shifts slightly due to rounding as required by the Plan), which represents the net cash value of the New GM Securities that otherwise would have been distributed to such claimant prior to entry of the Liquidation Order (as defined below), together with associated cash in lieu of fractional shares and Dividend Cash (as defined below), as well as one GUC Trust Unit. Any holders of disputed general unsecured claims against the Debtors, or the Disputed General Unsecured Claims, will receive subsequent distributions of cash and GUC Trust Units, in respect of such claims, only if and to the extent that their Disputed General Unsecured Claims are subsequently allowed, or Resolved Disputed Claims. There are currently no unresolved Disputed General Unsecured Claims. (See Functions and Responsibilities of the GUC Trust  Resolution of Disputed General Unsecured Claims below.) 
 The Plan provides for the formation of the GUC Trust to, among other duties, administer the prosecution, resolution and satisfaction of general unsecured claims and Residual Wind-Down Claims against the Debtors. As further described below, the GUC Trust is responsible for implementing the Plan, including distributing the assets comprising the corpus of the GUC Trust and GUC Trust Units to holders of Allowed General Unsecured Claims in satisfaction of their claims, resolving (that is, seeking allowance or disallowance of all or part of such claims) Disputed General Unsecured Claims that were outstanding as of the Effective Date and distributing cash and GUC Trust Units in satisfaction of the Resolved Allowed Claims (as defined below). 
 Under the Plan, the Debtors were required to be dissolved no later than the Dissolution Date. Upon the dissolution of MLC, the GUC Trust assumed responsibility for the winding down of the affairs of the Debtors and resolving and satisfying the Residual Wind-Down Claims. 
 The GUC Trust had an initial stated term of three years from the Effective Date. The Bankruptcy Court has entered orders extending the duration of the GUC Trust to March 31, 2021. The duration of the GUC Trust may in the future be shortened or further extended upon application to and approval by the Bankruptcy Court as necessary to complete the resolution of all potential claims, the wind-down of the Debtors affairs and the distribution of any remaining assets of the Debtors. The GUC Trust will remain under the jurisdiction of the Bankruptcy Court throughout the term of its existence. 
 
3 


 The GUC Trust Assets 
 As of the Effective Date, the corpus of the GUC Trust consisted solely of approximately $52.7 million in cash contributed by the Debtors to fund the administrative fees and expenses (including certain tax obligations), or the Wind-Down Costs, incurred by the GUC Trust in administering its duties pursuant to the Plan and the GUC Trust Agreement, or the Administrative Fund. The cash comprising the Administrative Fund was obtained by MLC from the DIP Lenders and is subject to a lien held by the DIP Lenders pursuant to the DIP Credit Agreement, with any excess funds remaining in the Administrative Fund required to be returned to the DIP Lenders after (i) the satisfaction in full of all Wind-Down Costs and other liabilities of the GUC Trust (subject to the terms of the GUC Trust Agreement) and (ii) the winding up of the GUC Trusts affairs. As such, the Administrative Fund cannot be utilized for distributions to holders of Allowed General Unsecured Claims. 
 Moreover, the usage of the Administrative Fund for the payment of fees and expenses of the GUC Trust is subject to a budget (the Budget), which must be submitted on an annual basis to the GUC Trust Monitor and the DIP Lenders for their approval and is updated quarterly as needed. The GUC Trust Agreement provides that any Wind-Down Costs incurred by the GUC Trust that exceed or are not covered by the Budget cannot be paid from the Administrative Fund, except with written consent of the DIP Lenders or Bankruptcy Court approval, in limited circumstances. 
 The GUC Trust Agreement provides that the Administrative Fund may not be utilized to fund certain specified costs, fees and expenses, which are referred to as Reporting Costs, including those directly or indirectly relating to (i) reports to be prepared and filed by the GUC Trust pursuant to applicable rules, regulations and interpretations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC), (ii) the transfer, registration for transfer and certification of GUC Trust Units, (iii) the application by the Committee (as defined below) to the Internal Revenue Service (the IRS) for a private letter ruling regarding the tax treatment of the GUC Trust and the holders of Allowed General Unsecured Claims in respect to the distribution of New GM Securities, which is discussed in more detail below under the heading Income Tax Liabilities for Certain Capital Gains, Investment Income and Dividends on New GM Common Stock, and (iv) certain legal proceedings relating to the Term Loan Avoidance Action. In addition, the Administrative Fund cannot be used to fund any current or projected tax liabilities of the GUC Trust, other than those included in the Budget. However, the GUC Trust Agreement provides the GUC Trust Administrator with the authority to set aside from distribution and appropriate Distributable Cash (as defined below) to fund such Reporting Costs (the Reporting and Transfer Cash) and projected tax liabilities (other than those included in the Budget), with the approval of the Bankruptcy Court and/or the GUC Trust Monitor, in each case as described below. Prior to the sale of all New GM Securities previously held by the GUC Trust in July and August 2015 as described below, the GUC Trust Administrator was authorized to set aside from distribution and sell New GM Securities to fund such Reporting Costs and projected tax liabilities with the approval of the Bankruptcy Court and/or the GUC Trust Monitor as described below. 
 The GUC Trust Agreement affords the GUC Trust Administrator, with the approval of the GUC Trust Monitor, the authority to set aside from distribution Distributable Cash (previously New GM Securities were set aside) in amounts sufficient to satisfy (i) any current or projected Wind-Down Costs of the GUC Trust that exceed the amounts budgeted or were not budgeted in the Administrative Fund, including U.S. federal income taxes on dividends received by the GUC Trust on New GM Common Stock previously held by the GUC Trust and on investment income earned on Distributable Cash, (ii) any current or projected Reporting Costs that exceed the then current Reporting and Transfer Cash, or (iii) any current or projected Taxes on Distribution (as defined below). This process is not related to, and is separate from, the process of recording any current and deferred income tax liabilities, as well as reserves for expected costs of liquidation in the Statement of Net Assets in Liquidation as a matter of financial reporting, which is only required for expected costs of liquidation for which there is a reasonable basis for estimation under applicable accounting standards. See Critical Accounting Policies and EstimatesReserves for Expected Costs of Liquidation and Income Taxes in Item 7 (Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations) below. The GUC Trust Administrator reevaluates, on a quarterly basis, the amount of Distributable Cash needed to be set aside from distribution for purposes of funding projected liquidation and administrative costs (including projected Dividend Taxes and Investment Income Taxes) and potential Taxes on Distribution. 
 The GUC Trust Administrator may appropriate Distributable Cash (previously New GM Securities were sold) that has been set aside from distribution to fund (with the required approval of the Bankruptcy Court) the current or projected Wind-Down Costs (including any Dividend Taxes and Investment Income Taxes) or Reporting Costs of the GUC Trust and (with the required approval of only the GUC Trust Monitor) any current and projected Taxes on Distribution of the GUC Trust. Such appropriated Distributable Cash (previously the cash proceeds of sales of New GM Securities and the marketable securities in which such cash proceeds were invested) is referred to as Other Administrative Cash. Pursuant to the GUC Trust Agreement, any cash or marketable securities constituting Other Administrative Cash that remain at the winding up and conclusion of the GUC Trust will be distributed to the holders of GUC Trust Units.

 Prior to the liquidation of all New GM Securities in July and August 2015 described above, the GUC Trust was authorized, with the approval of the GUC Trust Monitor, to set aside from distribution New GM Securities for the funding of Wind-Down Costs and Reporting Costs described above and to sell such set aside New GM Securities with the approval of the Bankruptcy Court. The Bankruptcy Court previously approved in March and December 2012, and again in January 2015, the sale of New GM Securities to fund certain accrued and projected Wind-Down Costs which were in excess of the amounts budgeted in the Administrative Fund for such costs, and certain projected Reporting Costs. Prior to the liquidation of all the GUC Trusts holdings of New GM Securities described above, sales of New GM Securities to fund projected Wind-Down Costs and Reporting Costs through calendar year 2015 aggregated approximately $61.7 million, including Dividend Cash of $0.2 million and approximately $5.7 million expressly authorized by the GUC Trust Agreement to be liquidated shortly after the Effective Date for the purposes of funding certain Reporting Costs, which is referred to as the Initial Reporting Cash. In December 2015, February 2017, March 2018 and January 2019, the Bankruptcy Court approved the appropriation of Distributable Cash aggregating approximately $48.0 million to fund the projected costs and expenses of the GUC Trust through calendar year 2019. Such appropriations reduced Distributable Cash and increased Other Administrative Cash. As of March 31, 2019, approximately $31.4 million remained in Other Administrative Cash and was recorded in cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities in the Statement of Net Assets in Liquidation. 
 As described in Item 3 (Legal Proceedings), the GUC Trust has executed the Revised Settlement Agreement with certain plaintiffs. If approved by the Bankruptcy Court, the Revised Settlement Agreement would provide for the payment of noticing costs of up to $13.72 million, among other provisions. On February 1, 2019, the GUC Trust Administrator filed a motion seeking authority from the Bankruptcy Court to appropriate Distributable Cash of $13.72 million for the purpose of satisfying such noticing costs. No hearing date has been scheduled with respect to the noticing costs. 
 Prior to the dissolution of MLC, certain designated assets and the New GM Securities were maintained at MLC (the latter was retained by MLC to avoid federal income taxes that might have been payable by the GUC Trust upon distribution of the New GM Securities with respect to any appreciation of the securities while in possession of the GUC Trust, or Taxes on Distribution; see discussion below). As required by the Plan, MLC transferred to the GUC Trust on the Dissolution Date (i) record ownership of all remaining undistributed New GM Securities, which consisted of 30,967,561 shares of New GM Common Stock, 28,152,186 New GM Series A Warrants and 28,152,186 New GM Series B Warrants, (ii) approximately $2.0 million designated for Reporting Costs, (iii) approximately $1.4 million designated for reimbursing the indenture trustees and the fiscal and paying agents under the Debtors prepetition debt issuances for costs associated with, among other things, administering distributions to registered holders of the Debtors prepetition debt issuances, or Indenture Trustee/Fiscal and Paying Agent Costs, and (iv) certain rights and obligations. Separately, on the Dissolution Date, MLC transferred $500,000 to the Avoidance Action Trust (as defined below) for the purposes of funding any potential public reporting requirements of the Avoidance Action Trust, in which funds the GUC Trust holds a residual interest to the extent unused by the Avoidance Action Trust. As of March 31, 2019, such remaining funds held by the Avoidance Action Trust are approximately $0.4 million and are expected to be repaid to the GUC Trust by the Avoidance Action Trust upon its dissolution. Such expected repayment is included in other assets in the Statement of Net Assets in Liquidation as of March 31, 2019 in Item 8 (Financial Statements and Supplementary Data). 
 By order dated July 2, 2015 (the Liquidation Order), the Bankruptcy Court approved the conversion of the GUC Trusts holdings of New GM Securities into cash. To effect such conversion, on July 7, 2015, the GUC Trust converted all of its holdings of New GM Warrants into New GM Common Stock in a cashless exercise. In total, the GUC Trust converted (i) 10,352,556 New GM Series A Warrants into 7,407,155 shares of New GM Common Stock, and (ii) 10,352,556 New GM Series B Warrants into 4,953,635 shares of New GM Common Stock. Thereafter, the GUC Trust sold all of its holdings of New GM Common Stock for net proceeds aggregating $741.7 million, having completed all such sales on August 5, 2015. As a result, all distributions by the GUC Trust thereafter in respect of Allowed General Unsecured Claims (including in respect of the GUC Trust Units) have been and will be made solely in cash. Pursuant to the Liquidation Order, the proceeds of such liquidations (net of applicable costs, fees, and expenses paid in respect thereof) were allocated to the beneficiaries of the GUC Trust on a pro rata basis in the following manner: 
 

(a) | A GUC Trust beneficiarys entitlement to a particular number of New GM Warrants that were exercised was converted into an entitlement to receive the number of shares of New GM Common Stock into which such New GM Warrants were exercised. Such conversions were 0.71549 shares of New GM Common Stock for each New GM Series A Warrant and 0.47849 shares of Common Stock for each New GM Series B Warrant; and
----+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(b) | A GUC Trust beneficiarys entitlement to a particular number of shares of New GM Common Stock that were liquidated (including the exercised New GM Warrants as set forth above), was converted into an entitlement to receive an amount of cash equal to the weighted average sales price (net of any applicable costs, fees, and expenses paid in respect thereof) of all of the New GM Common Stock sold, multiplied by the number of shares of New GM Common Stock to which such
----+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
5 


 
GUC Trust beneficiary would otherwise be entitled (including exercised New GM Warrants as set forth above). Such weighted average sales price for the GUC Trusts holdings of New GM Common Stock that were sold subsequent to June 30, 2015 was $31.23 per share.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Following the liquidation described above, the GUC Trust has invested most of the proceeds in certain marketable securities as permitted under the GUC Trust Agreement. The amount of cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities held for distribution to GUC Trust beneficiaries, including Dividend Cash, is referred to herein as Distributable Cash. 
 Upon the dissolution of MLC, the GUC Trust assumed responsibility for the winding down of the affairs of the Debtors and resolving and satisfying the Residual Wind-Down Claims. Under the Plan, upon the dissolution of MLC, the Debtors were directed to transfer to the GUC Trust, Residual Wind-Down Assets (as defined below) in an amount sufficient, based upon the Debtors reasonable estimate, to satisfy the Residual Wind-Down Claims and the Residual Wind-Down Costs (as defined below). On the Dissolution Date, MLC transferred approximately $42.8 million in Residual Wind-Down Assets to the GUC Trust (which amount consisted of approximately $40.0 million in cash, including approximately $1.4 million for payment of certain defense costs related to the Term Loan Avoidance Action, or the Avoidance Action Defense Costs, and the transferred benefit of approximately $2.8 million in prepaid expenses). 
 Pursuant to the GUC Trust Agreement and the Plan, the Residual Wind-Down Assets are to be administered in accordance with the GUC Trust Agreement and Plan and are to be used to satisfy and resolve the Residual Wind-Down Claims and to fund the Residual Wind-Down Costs and certain Avoidance Action Defense Costs. Any unused portions of the Residual Wind-Down Assets, along with any unused funds designated for Indenture Trustee/Fiscal and Paying Agent Costs, must be returned to the DIP Lenders and will not be available for distribution to the holders of GUC Trust Units at the winding up and conclusion of the GUC Trust. While not expected, if, collectively, the actual amounts of Residual Wind-Down Claims allowed, the Residual Wind-Down Costs and the Avoidance Action Defense Costs exceed the Residual Wind-Down Assets, the GUC Trust Administrator may be required to set aside from distribution and appropriate Distributable Cash to fund the shortfall. Any such appropriation of Distributable Cash would reduce the amount of Distributable Cash available for distribution to holders of GUC Trust Units. 
 Prior to the liquidation of all its holdings of New GM Common Stock described above, the GUC Trust received dividends on the New GM Common Stock it held as of the respective record dates aggregating approximately $24.7 million. Such dividends are required to be applied to the same purpose as the New GM Common Stock to which such dividends relate. If the portion of Distributable Cash applicable to the proceeds from the liquidation of New GM Common Stock is distributed to holders of subsequently allowed Disputed General Unsecured Claims and Term Loan Avoidance Action Claims, or GUC Trust Units, then the dividends relating to such Distributable Cash will also be distributed to such holders. If, however, Distributable Cash is appropriated by the GUC Trust in accordance with the GUC Trust Agreement to fund the costs and liabilities of the GUC Trust, then, in that case, the dividends relating to such Distributable Cash will be applied to such costs and liabilities of the GUC Trust and (just like the appropriated Distributable Cash) will be maintained in Other Administrative Cash. Because such dividends are applied to the same purpose as the associated Distributable Cash, any references in this Annual Report on Form 10-K to Distributable Cash should be understood to include the dividends relating to such Distributable Cash, unless expressly indicated otherwise. The amount of cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities held by the GUC Trust that relates to dividends received by the GUC Trust on New GM Common Stock previously held by the GUC Trust is referred to as Dividend Cash and is included in the amount of cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities held for distribution to GUC Trust beneficiaries that is referred to herein as Distributable Cash (except to the extent of dividends relating to appropriated Distributable Cash that is classified as Other Administrative Cash following such appropriation). 
 The GUC Trust does not and will not engage in any trade or business. As a result, the only income earned by the GUC Trust is interest income and dividends from permitted investments of cash as prescribed by the GUC Trust Agreement. The GUC Trust has no other sources of income. As of March 31, 2019, the GUC Trust had an aggregate of approximately $1.8 million in cash and cash equivalents and $503.2 million in marketable securities consisting of U.S. Treasury bills. 
 Functions and Responsibilities of the GUC Trust 
 The functions and responsibilities of the GUC Trust are governed by the Plan and the GUC Trust Agreement, as amended, with the oversight of the GUC Trust Monitor. The GUC Trust has no officers, directors or employees. The GUC Trust is administered by the GUC Trust Administrator, which is authorized by the GUC Trust Agreement to engage GUC Trust Professionals to assist the GUC Trust Administrator in the administration of the GUC Trust. Accordingly, the GUC Trust and GUC Trust Administrator rely on receiving accurate information, reports and other representations from (i) the GUC Trust Professionals, (ii) the GUC Trust Monitor, and (iii) other service providers to the GUC Trust. Notwithstanding such reliance, the GUC Trust Administrator is ultimately responsible for the disclosure provided in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Under the GUC Trust Agreement, among other duties 
 
6 


  and obligations, the GUC Trust is obligated to distribute the assets comprising the corpus of the GUC Trust to satisfy Allowed General Unsecured Claims, prosecute and resolve objections to Disputed General Unsecured Claims, take all necessary actions to administer the wind-down of the affairs of the Debtors and resolve and satisfy (to the extent allowed) the Residual Wind-Down Claims assumed by the GUC Trust. 
 

 | Satisfaction of Allowed General Unsecured Claims
--+-------------------------------------------------

 Pursuant to the GUC Trust Agreement, the GUC Trust is required to make quarterly distributions, provided that either (i) the Minimum Threshold (as defined below) with respect to the Excess GUC Trust Distributable Assets (as defined below) is reached or (ii) Resolved Allowed Claims have arisen during the GUC Trusts preceding fiscal quarter. If a distribution of Excess GUC Trust Distributable Assets is required to be made, then the GUC Trust Administrator must select the record date for such distribution. Each quarterly distribution is made as promptly as practicable following the close of the immediately preceding fiscal quarter. 
 In addition to cash, the GUC Trust Agreement provides for the distribution of GUC Trust Units to holders of Allowed General Unsecured Claims equal to one GUC Trust Unit per $1,000 in Allowed General Unsecured Claims, subject to rounding under the GUC Trust Agreement. Each GUC Trust Unit represents the contingent right to receive, on a pro rata basis, the excess assets of the GUC Trust, including Distributable Cash, if any, available for distribution in respect of the GUC Trust Units, either through a periodic distribution as provided for under the GUC Trust Agreement, or upon the dissolution of the GUC Trust, in each case subject to the terms and conditions of the GUC Trust Agreement and the Plan, or the Excess GUC Trust Distributable Assets. 
 Pursuant to the GUC Trust Agreement, quarterly distributions are required to be made to (i) holders of Resolved Allowed Claims and (ii) beneficiaries of GUC Trust Units (including persons listed in (i)), subject to the following limitation: the GUC Trust will make quarterly distributions in respect of the GUC Trust Units only if and to the extent that (a) certain previously Disputed General Unsecured Claims asserted against the Debtors are either disallowed or are otherwise resolved favorably to the Debtors estates (thereby reducing the amount of GUC Trust distributable assets which would be required to satisfy in full all the then-remaining Disputed General Unsecured Claims), (b) as a result of a litigated or consensual resolution, the amount of Term Loan Avoidance Action Claims is reduced (thereby reducing the amount of GUC Trust distributable assets which would be required to satisfy in full all the then-remaining Term Loan Avoidance Action Claims), or (c) the amount of Distributable Cash set aside for purposes of funding potential Wind-Down Costs, Reporting Costs and/or Taxes on Distribution, as applicable, is reduced from prior levels, and in each case the resulting amount of Excess GUC Trust Distributable Assets as of the end of the relevant quarter exceeds thresholds set forth in the GUC Trust Agreement, or the Minimum Threshold. Prior to the liquidation of all New GM Securities previously held by the GUC Trust described above, the Minimum Threshold was equal to: (i) with respect to New GM Common Stock, 1,000,000 shares of New GM Common Stock, (ii) with respect to the New GM Series A Warrants, warrants to acquire 909,091 shares of New GM Common Stock (subject to customary adjustment), (iii) with respect to the New GM Series B Warrants, warrants to acquire 909,091 shares of New GM Common Stock (subject to customary adjustment), and (iv) with respect to cash, $5 million. Following such liquidation of New GM Securities, the Minimum Threshold is equal to: (i) with respect to Distributable Cash, approximately $67.0 million, and (ii) with respect to other distributable assets of the GUC Trust, if any, an amount to be determined by the GUC Trust Administrator (and approved by the GUC Trust Monitor) or determined by the Bankruptcy Court, as appropriate. Notwithstanding the foregoing, holders of Resolved Allowed Claims receiving quarterly distributions will additionally receive distributions in respect of their GUC Trust Units that such recipients would have previously received had they been holders of Initial Allowed General Unsecured Claims (as defined below). 
 Holders of Allowed General Unsecured Claims who do not satisfy certain informational requirements by a date, or dates, established by the GUC Trust Administrator in connection with a quarterly distribution may not receive cash pursuant to such distribution; provided, however, that each such holder will be entitled to participate in the first quarterly distribution following its satisfaction of such informational requirements. In addition, if a holder of an Allowed General Unsecured Claim fails to satisfy such informational requirements prior to dissolution of the GUC Trust, such holder may risk forfeiting the distribution to which it would otherwise be entitled, and any such assets would be distributed to the beneficiaries of GUC Trust Units. 
 On or about the Effective Date, there were approximately $29,771 million in Allowed General Unsecured Claims, or the Initial Allowed General Unsecured Claims. As of March 31, 2019, there were approximately $31,855 million in Allowed General Unsecured Claims. See the table on page 43 for a summary of the Allowed General Unsecured Claims, Disputed General Unsecured Claims and Term Loan Avoidance Action Claims. 
 Since the Effective Date, the GUC Trust has made certain quarterly distributions. These quarterly distributions have been made (i) to holders of Resolved Allowed Claims arising during the GUC Trusts preceding fiscal quarter, if any, (ii) to holders of Allowed General Unsecured Claims who previously failed to fulfill informational requirements for distribution established in accordance with the GUC Trust Agreement, but subsequently fulfilled such information requirements, if any, and (iii) to beneficiaries of GUC Trust Units for fiscal quarters in which the amount of GUC Trust Distributable Assets as of the end of the relevant quarter exceeded the Minimum Threshold. Distributions in the fiscal years ended March 31, 2019 and 2018 are described below.

 During the years ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, distributions were made to holders of Allowed General Unsecured Claims who previously failed to fulfill informational requirements for distribution established in accordance with the GUC Trust Agreement, but subsequently fulfilled such information requirements. Additionally, distributions were made during the year ended March 31, 2018 to holders of Allowed General Unsecured Claims arising in the quarters ended December 31, 2017 and June 30, 2017. 
 In respect of Allowed General Unsecured Claims aggregating $31,855 million as of March 31, 2019, the GUC Trust had previously distributed in the aggregate 137,298,736 shares of New GM Common Stock, 124,817,263 New GM Series A Warrants and 124,817,263 New GM Series B Warrants and $246.2 million of Distributable Cash. In addition, the GUC Trust was obligated to distribute as of March 31, 2019, $1.8 million of Distributable Cash. See the table on page 44 for a summary of the GUC Trusts distributable assets. 
 As discussed above, in addition to Distributable Cash, the GUC Trust Agreement also provides for the distribution of beneficial interests in units, or GUC Trust Units, to holders of Allowed General Unsecured Claims in an amount equal to one GUC Trust Unit per $1,000 in Allowed General Unsecured Claims, subject to rounding under the GUC Trust Agreement. Each GUC Trust Unit represents the contingent right to receive, on a pro rata basis, a share of the Excess GUC Trust Distributable Assets. Pursuant to a No Action Letter received from the SEC on May 23, 2012 (the No Action Letter), the GUC Trust Units are currently issued in book-entry form only, represented by one or more global certificates registered in the name of the Depository Trust Company (which is referred to in this Annual Report on Form 10-K as DTC), as depositary, or Cede & Co., its nominee. See Description of the GUC Trust Units below for a more detailed discussion of the GUC Trust Units. As such, the GUC Trust Units are transferable in accordance with the procedures of DTC and its direct and indirect participants. The GUC Trust has issued additional GUC Trust Units, in transferable form, in connection with each of the quarterly distributions that occurred in respect of the fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2012 and thereafter. As of March 31, 2019, the total number of GUC Trust Units outstanding or issuable was 31,855,504. 
 The Plan prohibits the distribution of fractional New GM Securities in respect of Allowed General Unsecured Claims and GUC Trust Units. Prior to the liquidation of all New GM Securities described above, cash distributions were made in lieu of fractional New GM Securities to beneficiaries of GUC Trust Units, subject to certain minimum cash distribution thresholds. In addition, the GUC Trust was permitted to distribute cash in lieu of New GM Securities to any governmental entity to the extent such governmental entity requested a sale of such New GM Securities and demonstrated to the satisfaction of the GUC Trust Administrator that such governmental entity was precluded by applicable law from receiving distributions of New GM Securities. Since the Effective Date, the GUC Trust has sold an aggregate of 29,047 shares of New GM Common Stock and 26,673 of each series of New GM Warrants, realizing net proceeds of approximately $1.7 million in respect of the foregoing. The proceeds from these sales were distributed to qualifying governmental entities or beneficiaries of GUC Trust Units, as applicable. 
 

 | Resolution of Disputed General Unsecured Claims
--+------------------------------------------------

 There were approximately $8,154 million in Disputed General Unsecured Claims as of the Effective Date. This amount reflects liquidated disputed claims and a Bankruptcy Court ordered reserve for unliquidated disputed claims, but does not include Term Loan Avoidance Action Claims. As of March 31, 2019, there were no remaining Disputed General Unsecured Claims, but there remained $50.0 million in claim amount that is not associated with any particular claim, which has been set aside by the GUC Trust Administrator as a general claim contingency for any future disputed claims or other obligations of the GUC Trust. Including such amount, Disputed General Unsecured Claims decreased by approximately $8,104 million as compared to the amount of Disputed General Unsecured Claims existing on or around the Effective Date. See the table on page 43 for a summary of the status of the claims resolution process as of March 31, 2019. 
 The process of resolving Disputed General Unsecured Claims was generally administered by the GUC Trust through GUC Trust Professionals it retained specifically for this purpose. 
 In an attempt to ensure that there is sufficient Distributable Cash available to provide distributions to all holders of Resolved Allowed Claims as if such holders were holders of Initial Allowed General Unsecured Claims, the GUC Trust Agreement authorizes and directs the GUC Trust Administrator to withhold from distribution the amount of Distributable Cash that would be sufficient to satisfy all Disputed General Unsecured Claims and Term Loan Avoidance Action Claims in the event that such claims were allowed in full. 
 Prior to the liquidation of all New GM Securities described above, in certain circumstances, holders of Resolved Allowed Claims and GUC Trust Units received from the GUC Trust cash in lieu of or in addition to New GM Securities. This occurred when 
 
8 


  cash dividends were received by the GUC Trust on the New GM Common Stock previously held by the GUC Trust, in which case the holders of subsequently Resolved Allowed Claims and GUC Trust Units received the cash dividends that had been paid in respect of the shares of New GM Common Stock they received. Prior to the liquidation of all its holdings of New GM Common Stock, the GUC Trust received dividends on such New GM Common Stock aggregating $24.7 million. See Net Assets in Liquidation in Item 7 (Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations) below. Also, the GUC Trust distributed cash in lieu of New GM Securities to any governmental entity to the extent such governmental entity requested a sale of such New GM Securities and demonstrated to the satisfaction of the GUC Trust Administrator that such governmental entity was precluded by applicable law from receiving distributions of New GM Securities. Finally, the GUC Trust distributed cash in lieu of fractional New GM Securities in any distribution of Excess GUC Trust Distributable Assets, subject to any distribution rules or rounding under the Plan, the GUC Trust Agreement and/or the rules of any applicable clearing system. For each $1,000 in amount of Allowed General Unsecured Claims (including Resolved Allowed Claims), each holder of such claim is currently entitled to receive (upon delivery of any information required by the GUC Trust) approximately $296 in cash (which dollar value shifts slightly due to rounding as required by the Plan), which represents the net cash value of the New GM Securities that otherwise would have been distributed to such claimant prior to entry of the Liquidation Order, together with associated cash in lieu of fractional shares and Dividend Cash, as well as one GUC Trust Unit, subject in each case to rounding under the Plan, the GUC Trust Agreement and/or the rules of any applicable clearing system and exclusive of any securities received, or to be received, in respect of GUC Trust Units. 
 

 | Resolution and Satisfaction of Residual Wind-Down Claims
--+---------------------------------------------------------

 In accordance with the Plan, each of the Debtors was dissolved on or prior to the Dissolution Date. Upon the dissolution of MLC, the New GM Securities and certain remaining cash and other assets of MLC were transferred to the GUC Trust and the GUC Trust assumed responsibility for the wind-down of the Debtors. This includes monitoring and enforcing the implementation of the Plan as it relates to the wind-down, paying taxes and filing tax returns, making any other necessary filings related to the wind-down and taking any other actions necessary or appropriate to wind-down the Debtors and obtain an order, or orders, closing the chapter 11 cases of the Debtors. The GUC Trust is also responsible for resolving and satisfying (to the extent allowed) any remaining disputed Residual Wind-Down Claims. 
 Under the Plan, the Debtors were directed to transfer to the GUC Trust assets in an amount sufficient, based upon the Debtors reasonable estimate, to satisfy the ultimate allowed amount of the Residual Wind-Down Claims, or the Residual Wind-Down Assets, including the costs, fees and expenses related to satisfying and resolving the Residual Wind-Down Claims, or the Residual Wind-Down Costs. On the Dissolution Date, MLC transferred approximately $42.8 million in Residual Wind-Down Assets to the GUC Trust (which amount consisted of approximately $40.0 million in cash (including approximately $1.4 million for the payment of Avoidance Action Defense Costs) and the transferred benefit of approximately $2.8 million in prepaid expenses. Based on the Debtors estimate of the amount necessary to satisfy the ultimate allowed amount of the Residual Wind-Down Claims, the GUC Trust Administrator established a reserve for Residual Wind-Down Claims of approximately $33.8 million relating to approximately $246.2 million in Residual Wind-Down Claims (which amount was increased to $278.5 million by additional Residual Wind-Down Claims arising subsequent thereto). In addition, the GUC Trust increased its reserve for liquidation costs by approximately $9.0 million for Residual Wind-Down Costs associated with these obligations and Avoidance Action Defense Costs (subsequently the remaining amounts associated with Residual Wind-Down Costs in reserves for expected liquidation costs were reclassified to reserves for Residual Wind-Down Claims and Costs). Since the Dissolution Date, the GUC Trust has resolved approximately $278.5 million in disputed Residual Wind-Down Claims, allowing $35.5 million, while disallowing $243.0 million. 
 As of March 31, 2019, the amount of Avoidance Action Defense Costs incurred to date exceeds the corresponding cash of $1.4 million received by the GUC Trust from MLC on the Dissolution Date by approximately $30.2 million. As a result, new Residual Wind-Down Claims have arisen in the amount of such excess. In April 2017, the GUC Trust entered into a letter agreement with the administrative agent for the prepetition lenders who were the defendants in the Term Loan Avoidance Action, or the Administrative Agent. Such letter agreement provides that the GUC Trusts obligation to pay Avoidance Action Defense Costs of the Administrative Agent is limited to an amount approximating the remaining designated Residual Wind-Down Assets. Such cap on Avoidance Action Defense Costs will remain in place unless and until the Term Loan Avoidance Action is resolved in full (by final court order or by settlement), which court order or settlement contains a determination that the Administrative Agent was oversecured with respect to the loan which is the subject of the Term Loan Avoidance Action, or otherwise contains a voluntary agreement by the GUC Trust with respect to payment of the Avoidance Action Defense Costs. As described in Item 3 (Legal Proceedings), a settlement of the Term Loan Avoidance Action has been reached and, as a result, the GUC Trust will not incur additional Avoidance Action Defense Costs. 
 As of March 31, 2019, Residual Wind-Down Assets of $0.2 million were held by the GUC Trust and were recorded in cash and cash equivalents in the accompanying Statement of Net Assets in Liquidation. There were no remaining expected Residual Wind-Down Claims and Costs against such assets as of March 31, 2019. Accordingly, the GUC Trust expects to return the remaining Residual Wind-Down Assets to the DIP Lenders upon the winding up and conclusion of the GUC Trust. A corresponding amount is recorded in the reserve for Residual Wind-Down Claims and Costs in the accompanying Statement of Net Assets in Liquidation.

 | Administrative Structure and Responsibilities of the GUC Trust
--+---------------------------------------------------------------

 The GUC Trust has no officers, directors or employees. The GUC Trust is administered by the GUC Trust Administrator, which is authorized by the GUC Trust Agreement to engage GUC Trust Professionals to assist the GUC Trust Administrator in the administration of the GUC Trust. The GUC Trust Administrator is authorized by the GUC Trust Agreement to retain, pay, oversee, direct the services of, and (subject to GUC Trust Monitor approval) terminate GUC Trust Professionals, to assist in the administration of the GUC Trust, particularly in connection with the claims resolution process, the preparation of financial statements, and the GUC Trusts record keeping and reporting functions. The GUC Trust and GUC Trust Administrator rely solely on receiving accurate information, reports and other representations from (i) the GUC Trust Professionals, (ii) the GUC Trust Monitor, and (iii) other service providers to the GUC Trust. In filing this Annual Report on Form 10-K and executing any related documentation on behalf of the GUC Trust, the GUC Trust Administrator has relied upon the accuracy of such reports, information and representations. Notwithstanding such reliance, the GUC Trust Administrator is ultimately responsible for the disclosure provided in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In addition to issuing GUC Trust Units and making distributions of Distributable Cash to holders of Allowed General Unsecured Claims, the GUC Trust is also responsible for the administrative tasks that are incidental to the resolution and, to the extent they are allowed, satisfaction of any Disputed General Unsecured Claims remaining against the Debtors as of the Effective Date. 
 The GUC Trust Monitor was appointed for the purpose of overseeing the activities of the GUC Trust Administrator. Pursuant to the GUC Trust Agreement, the GUC Trust Administrator is required to obtain the approval of the GUC Trust Monitor for a variety of actions, including but not limited to: preparation of budgets; reserving Distributable Cash for the purposes of satisfying fees, costs and expenses of the GUC Trust (including any Taxes on Distribution, Dividend Taxes and Investment Income Taxes (as defined below)); the appropriation of Distributable Cash to satisfy any Taxes on Distribution; the incurrence of any costs or expense in excess of 10% of any line item in the Budget measured on a yearly basis (except to the extent such cost or expense is approved by the Bankruptcy Court); settling Disputed General Unsecured Claims in excess of $10.0 million; the retention or termination of GUC Trust Professionals; and amendments to the GUC Trust Agreement. 
 As discussed above, the GUC Trust was initially provided with the Administrative Fund by MLC for the purposes of paying Wind-Down Costs. The Administrative Fund was created with cash provided to MLC by the DIP Lenders. It is fixed in amount and payments from the Administrative Fund are made in accordance with the Budget. The principal expenses of the GUC Trust in connection with the Administrative Fund are professional, advisory and administrative fees of the legal and financial advisors of the GUC Trust and the GUC Trust Administrator and the GUC Trust Monitor. The GUC Trust has no income other than income on permitted investments of cash prescribed by the GUC Trust Agreement. 
 As of March 31, 2019, approximately $1.2 million remained in the Administrative Fund and is recorded in cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities in the Statement of Net Assets in Liquidation. Such remaining amount has been designated for the satisfaction of certain specifically identified costs and liabilities of the GUC Trust, and such amount may not be used for the payment of GUC Trust Professionals fees and expenses or other Wind-Down Costs. Cash or investments from the Administrative Fund, if any, which remain at the winding up and conclusion of the GUC Trust must be returned to the DIP Lenders. As has previously occurred with respect to the Administrative Fund and the Reporting and Transfer Cash, if the GUC Trust Administrator determines that (i) the Administrative Fund is not sufficient to satisfy the current or projected Wind-Down Costs (including any Dividend Taxes and Investment Income Taxes), (ii) the Reporting and Transfer Cash is not sufficient to satisfy the current or projected Reporting Costs, or (iii) the GUC Trust is required to fund Taxes on Distribution, the GUC Trust Administrator, with the approval of the GUC Trust Monitor, is authorized to reserve Distributable Cash for these purposes. The GUC Trust Administrator may then appropriate Distributable Cash to fund these costs and expenses, with the required approval of the Bankruptcy Court (other than with respect to appropriation of Distributable Cash for the purposes of funding Taxes on Distribution, pursuant to which only GUC Trust Monitor approval is required), and the appropriation of such Distributable Cash will constitute part of Other Administrative Cash. 
 Distributable Cash that is reserved or appropriated in the manner described above will not be available for distribution to the beneficiaries of GUC Trust Units. As such, increased Wind-Down Costs (including any Dividend Taxes and Investment Income Taxes), Reporting Costs and/or any Taxes on Distribution could reduce the GUC Trusts otherwise distributable assets. To the extent that any reserved Distributable Cash or Other Administrative Cash is not ultimately required and is held by the GUC Trust at the time of its dissolution, such remaining funds will be distributed by the GUC Trust to the holders of the GUC Trust units. 
 Other than for the matters described above and matters that are incidental to them, the GUC Trust does not and will not engage in any business activities. In particular, the GUC Trust does not and will not engage in any trade or business.

 Income Tax Liabilities for Certain Capital Gains, Investment Income and Dividends on New GM Common Stock 
 The GUC Trust incurs U.S. federal income tax liabilities on any capital gains realized upon (a) the distribution of New GM Securities to holders of Allowed General Unsecured Claims or GUC Trust Units, (b) by sale of New GM Securities, or (c) any receipt and subsequent distribution or sale by the GUC Trust of Additional Shares (if the fair market value of the Additional Shares on the date of distribution or sale is greater than the fair market value of such shares on the date of receipt), unless such capital gains are offset by capital losses, deductible expenses and accumulated net operating losses, which are referred to as Taxes on Distribution. The GUC Trust also incurs U.S. federal income tax liabilities on investment income and dividends received on New GM Common Stock previously held by the GUC Trust, unless such income is offset by deductible expenses and accumulated net operating losses (such income tax liabilities on dividends received on New GM Common Stock and investment income are referred to as Dividend Taxes and Investment Income Taxes, respectively). The GUC Trust records any current taxes payable from such realized net capital gains and interest and dividends (net of deductible operating losses and expenses) and records a deferred tax asset with a corresponding valuation allowance (resulting in no net deferred tax asset) for remaining net capital loss carryovers from the disposition of New GM Securities, along with net operating loss carryovers. A full valuation allowance is recorded because, as a result of the liquidation of all of the GUC Trusts holdings of New GM Securities, it has been determined that such deferred tax assets are not realizable at this time. See Critical Accounting Policies and EstimatesIncome Taxes in item 7 (Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations) and Note 8 (Income Taxes) in Item 8 (Financial Statements and Supplementary Data) below. As a result of cumulative capital losses utilizing the new tax position described below and net operating losses, the GUC Trust has not incurred or paid any income tax liabilities, and, as described below, the GUC Trust does not expect to incur any income tax liabilities in the future, except potentially with respect to any Taxes on Distribution from receipt and subsequent distribution or sale by the GUC Trust of Additional Shares, which is not determinable or estimable at this time. 
 As previously disclosed, during the quarter ended September 30, 2013, the GUC Trust made a determination to file its U.S. federal income tax returns taking the position that beneficial ownership for a substantial majority of New GM Securities was transferred from MLC to the GUC Trust on March 31, 2011, and that the tax basis of such New GM Securities should be determined with reference to the value of such securities on such date, instead of December 15, 2011, when record ownership of the remaining New GM Securities still held by MLC was transferred from MLC to the GUC Trust. For the remaining substantial minority of New GM Securities transferred from MLC to the GUC Trust, the GUC Trust determined that the transfer of beneficial ownership occurred on other dates for which the tax basis should be determined by reference to the value of such securities on such dates. This new tax position resulted in an increased tax basis of the New GM Securities from the prior tax position and, therefore, reduced taxable gains and increased taxable losses on distributions and sales of New GM Securities since March 31, 2011. The new tax position has not been sustained on examination by the IRS as of the date hereof. However, the GUC Trust believes, based on the available evidence and consultation with GUC Trust Professionals, that it is more likely than not that the new tax position will be sustained on examination by the IRS based on the technical merits of the position. Accordingly, this new tax position has been recognized in the current and deferred income tax liabilities and the income tax provision in the GUC Trusts financial statements since the quarter ended September 30, 2013. 
 Following the GUC Trusts determination to utilize the new tax position set forth above, the GUC Trust filed its U.S. federal income tax returns for the years ended March 31, 2013 and thereafter with the IRS using such new tax position. Such tax returns were accompanied by requests for prompt determination of tax liability pursuant to Section 505(b) of the Bankruptcy Code, and the 60-day statutory notification periods set forth in Section 505(b) of the Bankruptcy Code with respect to the GUC Trusts U.S. federal income tax returns for the year ended March 31, 2018 and prior years have expired. Accordingly, the tax liabilities set forth in the GUC Trusts U.S. federal income tax returns for the year ended March 31, 2018 and prior years are no longer subject to examination by the IRS, and no income taxes can be assessed for such years. Also, no income taxes are expected to be paid in the future as a result of the liquidation of all the GUC Trusts holdings of New GM Securities during the year ended March 31, 2016, except potentially with respect to any Taxes on Distributions resulting from any receipt and subsequent distribution or sale by the GUC Trust of Additional Shares referred to above, which is not determinable or estimable at this time. 
 The GUC Trust Administrator reevaluates, on a quarterly basis, the amount of Distributable Cash needed to be set aside from distribution to fund potential Taxes on Distribution. The current methodology for calculating such set aside estimates potential Taxes on Distribution by applying the applicable U.S. federal income tax rate to net realized capital gains that are still subject to examination by the IRS, less current period tax deductible expenses and future tax deductible expenses. Such realized capital gains are computed using a tax basis for the New GM Securities based on the date of transfer of record ownership of the New GM Securities to the GUC Trust from MLC on December 15, 2011, and the tax basis of the New GM Common Stock received for the exercise of the New GM Warrants pursuant to the Liquidation Order. However, as a result of the application of Section 505(b) of the Bankruptcy Code, the GUC Trusts federal income tax returns for the year ended March 31, 2018 and all prior years are no longer subject to examination, and no income taxes may be assessed for the year ended March 31, 2018 or any prior year. In addition, while the GUC Trusts remaining capital losses (based on the tax basis of previously held New GM Securities for financial reporting purposes) and net operating losses are still subject to examination by the IRS in subsequent years if those losses are utilized, such utilization (on a net 
 
11 


  basis) is not expected as a result of the sale of all New GM Securities in the year ended March 31, 2016, except potentially with respect to any receipt and subsequent distribution or sale by the GUC Trust of Additional Shares referred to above (if the fair market value of the Additional Shares on the date of distribution or sale is greater than the fair market value of such shares on the date of receipt), which is not determinable or estimable at this time. In addition, no income taxes are expected to be paid in the future, except potentially with respect to any Taxes on Distribution resulting from any receipt and subsequent distribution or sale of Additional Shares, which is not determinable or estimable at this time. Further, if any Taxes on Distribution resulting from the receipt and subsequent distribution or sale of Additional Shares were to become payable, it is anticipated that such income taxes would be funded from the sale of a portion of such Additional Shares. As a result, the GUC Trust Administrator determined that no Distributable Cash should be set aside for potential Taxes on Distribution (or Dividend Taxes and Investment Income Taxes) at this time. Such determination was also made for each quarter since (and including) September 30, 2016. 
 For additional information, see Net Assets in LiquidationDistributable Cash Set Aside from Distribution in Item 7 (Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations) below. 
 Term Loan Avoidance Action 
 On July 31, 2009, the Committee commenced a legal action against certain prepetition lenders of the Debtors, styled as Official Committee of Unsecured Creditors of Motors Liquidation Co. v. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. et al. (Adv. Pro. No. 09-00504 (Bankr. S.D.N.Y. July 31, 2009)), which is referred to as the Term Loan Avoidance Action. Among other things, the Term Loan Avoidance Action seeks the return of approximately $1.5 billion that had been transferred to a consortium of prepetition lenders of the Debtors, pursuant to the court order approving the debtor-in-possession loans made by the DIP Lenders to MLC. On the Dissolution Date, the Term Loan Avoidance Action was transferred to a trust established for the purpose of holding and prosecuting the Term Loan Avoidance Action, or the Avoidance Action Trust. As previously disclosed in a Current Report on Form 8-K filed on May 17, 2019 and as described in Item 3 (Legal Proceedings) below, the parties to the Term Loan Avoidance Action have reached a settlement in principle. During April and May 2019, all parties executed a settlement agreement and, on May 13, 2019, the Avoidance Action Trust filed with the Bankruptcy Court a motion to approve the settlement pursuant to Federal Rule of Bankruptcy Procedure 9019. Also on May 13, 2019, the GUC Trust filed with the Bankruptcy Court a joinder to the motion to approve the settlement. At this time, ultimate approval of settlement of the Term Loan Avoidance Action remains subject to Bankruptcy Court approval. A hearing to consider approval of the motion to approve the settlement is scheduled for June 12, 2019 in the Bankruptcy Court. 
 The proper beneficiaries of the proceeds of the Term Loan Avoidance Action had been a matter of dispute, with both the DIP Lenders and the Committee, on behalf of the holders of Allowed General Unsecured Claims, claiming sole rights to such proceeds. As described in Item 3 (Legal Proceedings) below, the Committee, the DIP Lenders and the Avoidance Action Trust reached a settlement agreement concerning, among other things, the allocation of potential distributable recoveries from the Term Loan Avoidance Action. The Bankruptcy Court approved the settlement agreement in an opinion and order entered on August 24, 2016 (the Approval Order), which order was affirmed on appeal and is fully in effect. No funds reclaimed from the prepetition lenders in the Term Loan Avoidance Action will be transferred to or otherwise benefit the GUC Trust or be distributed on account of GUC Trust Units. 
 Any amounts recovered by the Avoidance Action Trust will, pursuant to the Plan, give rise to Allowed General Unsecured Claims on behalf of the prepetition lenders from which such amounts were recovered (as beneficiaries of the GUC Trust) (such allowed general unsecured claims Resolved Term Loan Avoidance Action Claims, and together with Resolved Disputed Claims, the Resolved Allowed Claims). As used in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the amounts of Disputed General Unsecured Claims do not include any Term Loan Avoidance Action Claims. Prior to the execution of the settlement agreement in April and May 2019 referred to above, the Avoidance Action Trust had reached settlements with certain defendants to the Term Loan Avoidance Action resulting in recoveries to the Avoidance Action Trust of approximately $1.8 million. As a result, corresponding Term Loan Avoidance Action Claims of approximately $1.8 million were allowed by the GUC Trust pursuant to the Plan. As a result of the execution of the settlement agreement in April and May 2019, it is expected that approximately $231.0 million of Term Loan Avoidance Action Claims will become allowed and the holders of such claims will become entitled to receive a distribution from the GUC Trust of approximately $68.5 million. As noted above, pursuant to the Plan, no funds reclaimed from the prepetition lenders will be transferred to the GUC Trust or be distributed to holders of GUC Trust Units in respect of such GUC Trust Units. Accordingly, a holder of a GUC Trust Unit that does not hold a corresponding Allowed General Unsecured Claim (because such holder received the GUC Trust Unit as a subsequent transferee and not in a direct distribution from the GUC Trust in satisfaction of an Allowed General Unsecured Claim) will have its recovery diluted through the incurrence of Resolved Term Loan Avoidance Action Claims by the GUC Trust, without receiving the benefit of any cash recovered pursuant to the Term Loan Avoidance Action. 
 Pursuant to the Plan, the GUC Trust was obligated to satisfy reasonable Avoidance Action Defense Costs, subject to the right of the GUC Trust or the DIP Lenders to seek disgorgement in accordance with the terms of the Plan. As described under the heading Residual Wind-Down Claims and Costs above, the amount of Avoidance Action Defense Costs incurred to date exceeds the amount 
 
12 


  of Residual Wind-Down Assets received from MLC which was designated for this purpose by approximately $30.2 million. As a result, new Residual Wind-Down Claims have arisen in the amount of such excess. In April 2017, the GUC Trust entered into a letter agreement with the administrative agent for the prepetition lenders who are defendants in the Term Loan Avoidance Action. Such letter agreement provides that the GUC Trusts obligation to pay Avoidance Action Defense Costs of the Administrative Agent is limited to an amount approximating the remaining designated Residual Wind-Down Assets. As a result of the Term Loan Avoidance Action settlement and by virtue of the terms of the settlement agreement, the GUC Trust is not responsible for payment of any further Avoidance Action Defense Costs. 
 For additional information about the Term Loan Avoidance Action, see Term Loan Avoidance Action in Item 3 (Legal Proceedings) below. 
 Dissolution of the GUC Trust 
 The GUC Trust had an initial stated term of three years from the Effective Date. The Bankruptcy Court has entered orders extending the duration of the GUC Trust to March 31, 2021. The GUC Trust Administrator can apply to the Bankruptcy Court for a shorter or longer term in order to complete the resolution of all potential claims, the wind-down of the Debtors affairs and the distribution of any remaining assets of the Debtors. It is currently anticipated that the GUC Trust will be required to seek approval to further extend its term, because, although it is uncertain at this time, it is anticipated that the wind-down and distribution of assets will not be completed prior to March 31, 2021. 
 If, as of the final distribution date, any GUC Trust Units remain undistributed, such GUC Trust Units will be deemed cancelled and will cease to be outstanding. If, as of the final distribution date, any Distributable Cash (including Dividend Cash) remains undistributed, any such assets will be distributed pro rata to the beneficiaries of the GUC Trust Units then outstanding on the final distribution date to the extent permitted by law, and to the extent not so permitted, will otherwise be disposed of in accordance with applicable law. 
 Fiscal Year 
 The GUC Trusts fiscal year begins on April 1 and ends on the following March 31. 
 Availability of Information Relating to the GUC Trust and New GM 
 The GUC Trust files annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, and current reports on Form 8-K with the SEC. In addition, the GUC Trust files quarterly reports pursuant to the requirements of the GUC Trust Agreement, or GUC Trust Reports, with the Bankruptcy Court. The GUC Trust Agreement, related documentation and all information filed with the Bankruptcy Court by the GUC Trust Administrator, including the GUC Trust Reports, can be accessed free of charge on the GUC Trust website at www.mlcguctrust.com, and the GUC Trusts and New GMs filings with the SEC can be accessed free of charge at www.sec.gov. As of March 29, 2019, the last trading day before the end of the current fiscal year, New GMs common stock was trading at $37.10 per share and New GMs 2019 warrants were trading at $19.44 per warrant. The GUC Trust does not currently hold any New GM common stock or warrants. 
 Description of the GUC Trust Units 
 The following summary of the GUC Trust Units is not intended to be complete and is subject to, and qualified in its entirety by reference to, the GUC Trust Agreement, as amended, and the Delaware Act. You should read the GUC Trust Agreement, as amended and restated, which is filed as an exhibit to this annual report on Form 10-K for additional information. 
 The GUC Trust Agreement provides for the distribution of GUC Trust Units for the benefit of creditors holding Allowed General Unsecured Claims, in an amount equal to one GUC Trust Unit per $1,000 in Allowed General Unsecured Claims, subject to rounding under the GUC Trust Agreement. Each GUC Trust Unit represents the contingent right to receive, on a pro rata basis, a share of the Excess GUC Trust Distributable Assets. To the extent a Disputed General Unsecured Claim or a Term Loan Avoidance Action Claim became or becomes an Allowed General Unsecured Claim, the holder of that claim received or receives Distributable Cash (including Dividend Cash) and the GUC Trust Units corresponding to what the holder would have received had the claim been allowed as of the Effective Date. To the extent all or portion of a Disputed General Unsecured Claim was ultimately disallowed (or it becomes clear that the Term Loan Avoidance Claims, or a portion thereof, shall not become Allowed General Unsecured Claims), Distributable Cash reserved for that claim or such disallowed portion of that claim became or will become excess assets of the GUC Trust available for distribution to beneficiaries of GUC Trust Units.

 | Book-Entry Only IssuanceThe Depository Trust Company
--+------------------------------------------------------

 The GUC Trust Units are book-entry form only, represented by one or more global certificates registered in the name of DTC, as depository, or Cede & Co., its nominee, for so long as DTC is willing to act in that capacity. Wilmington Trust Company, or its designated affiliate, is currently acting as registrar and transfer agent for the GUC Trust Units, and facilitates the issuance of the GUC Trust Units through the DTC participant system (as necessary). Beneficiaries of GUC Trust Units do not receive physical certificates for their GUC Trust Units, and beneficial interests in the GUC Trust Units are not directly registered on the books and records of the GUC Trust Administrator. The aggregate number of GUC Trust Units issued thereunder may from time to time be increased by adjustments made on the records of the GUC Trust and a corresponding increase in the number of GUC Trust Units evidenced by such global certificate (as specified in the schedule included as part of the global certificate in respect of such additional GUC Trust Units). 
 

 | Transferability of the GUC Trust Units
--+---------------------------------------

 The GUC Trust Units are currently transferable in accordance with the procedures of DTC and its direct and indirect participants. However, in the event that DTC is unwilling or unable to continue as a depositary for the GUC Trust Units, the GUC Trust Agreement provides that the GUC Trust Administrator shall exchange the transferable GUC Trust Units for definitive certificates. 
 

 | Designation of a DTC Participant and Other Required Actions
--+------------------------------------------------------------

 In order to receive a distribution from the GUC Trust of Distributable Cash (previously New GM Securities) or GUC Trust Units, holders of Allowed General Unsecured Claims (other than previous holders of Note Claims and Eurobond Claims, each as defined in the GUC Trust Agreement) must designate a direct or indirect participant in DTC with whom such holder has an account and take such other ministerial actions as the GUC Trust Administrator will from time to time reasonably require by written communication to the holders of such Allowed General Unsecured Claims. With respect to previous holders of Note Claims and Eurobond Claims, the GUC Trust has issued New GM Securities and GUC Trust Units to such holders in accordance with the procedures of DTC and its participants. 
 If and so long as a holder of an Allowed General Unsecured Claim (other than the previous holders of Note Claims and Eurobond Claims) does not designate a direct or indirect participant in DTC and take the required actions described above, the GUC Trust Administrator will hold Distributable Cash and GUC Trust Units such holder is otherwise entitled to receive, together with any Excess GUC Trust Distributable Assets distributed in respect of the GUC Trust Units, until such time as such holder complies with the requirements. At any time following the date on which a holder of an Allowed General Unsecured Claim complies in full with the requirements, but in any event, as soon as practicable following the beginning of the calendar quarter next following such date, the GUC Trust Administrator will distribute to such holder Distributable Cash and GUC Trust Units and any distributions thereon to which such holder is entitled. However, if a holder has not complied with the requirements prior to the final distribution date, then (i) such holder will be deemed to have forfeited any entitlement to such distributions, which will become Excess GUC Trust Distributable Assets of the GUC Trust, (ii) the GUC Trust Units otherwise distributable to such holder will be deemed cancelled and not outstanding, and (iii) Distributable Cash otherwise distributable to such holder will be distributed as Excess GUC Trust Distributable Assets pro rata to all beneficiaries of GUC Trust Units then outstanding on the final distribution date. 
 

 | Voting Rights
--+--------------

 A GUC Trust Unit beneficiary has no title or right to, or possession, management, or control of, the GUC Trust or the GUC Trust assets, or to any right to demand a partition or division of such assets or to require an accounting of the GUC Trust Administrator or the GUC Trust Monitor. The whole legal title to the GUC Trust assets is vested in the GUC Trust as a separate legal entity under the Delaware Act and the sole beneficial interest of the GUC Trust Unit beneficiaries are as set forth in the GUC Trust Agreement. 
 Beneficiaries of GUC Trust Units do not have the right to vote or participate in the administration of the GUC Trust. They have no right to appoint or remove the GUC Trust Monitor or the GUC Trust Administrator, although, in certain circumstances, they may petition the Bankruptcy Court for these purposes. Beneficiaries of a majority of GUC Trust Units may at any time petition the Bankruptcy Court for the removal of the GUC Trust Administrator or for the removal of the GUC Trust Monitor, but only for good cause shown. In determining whether the beneficiaries of a majority of the GUC Trust Units have concurred in any such petition, GUC Trust Units held by the GUC Trust Administrator or the GUC Trust Monitor or any of their respective affiliates will be disregarded. 
 
14 


 
 | Potential Effects on the Rights of Beneficiaries of GUC Trust Units
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------

 As has previously occurred as described under The GUC Trust Assets above, if the GUC Trust Administrator determines that (i) the Administrative Fund is not sufficient to satisfy the current or projected Wind-Down Costs (including Dividend Taxes and Investment Income Taxes), (ii) the Reporting and Transfer Cash is not sufficient to satisfy the current or projected Reporting Costs, or (iii) that the GUC Trust is projected to fund current or potential Taxes on Distribution, the GUC Trust Administrator, with the approval of the GUC Trust Monitor, is authorized to reserve Distributable Cash for these purposes. The GUC Trust Administrator may then appropriate such reserved Distributable Cash to fund these costs and expenses, with the required approval of the Bankruptcy Court (other than with respect to the appropriation of Distributable Cash for the purposes of funding Taxes on Distribution, pursuant to which only GUC Trust Monitor approval is required), and the appropriated Distributable Cash will constitute part of the Other Administrative Cash. Distributable Cash that is reserved in this manner will not be available for distribution to the beneficiaries of GUC Trust Units. Therefore, any additional costs or Taxes on Distribution will reduce the assets available for distribution to beneficiaries of GUC Trust Units. After the GUC Trust has concluded its affairs, any remaining reserved or appropriated Distributable Cash will be distributed to the beneficiaries of the GUC Trust Units. 
 

 | Liquidation Distribution upon Dissolution
--+------------------------------------------

 The GUC Trust had an initial stated term of three years from the Effective Date, which has been extended by the Bankruptcy Court to March 31, 2021. The duration of the GUC Trust may be again extended upon application to and approval of the Bankruptcy Court as necessary to complete the resolution of all potential claims, the wind-down of the Debtors affairs and the distribution of any remaining assets of the Debtors. The GUC Trust will remain under the jurisdiction of the Bankruptcy Court throughout the term of its existence. 
 If, at the time of the final distribution date, any Excess GUC Trust Distributable Assets or GUC Trust Units remain in the GUC Trust, then (i) any such GUC Trust Units will be deemed cancelled and will cease to be outstanding, and (ii) to the extent permitted by law, any such Excess GUC Trust Distributable Assets will be distributed pro rata to all beneficiaries of the GUC Trust Units then outstanding on the final distribution date, and, to the extent not so permitted, will otherwise be disposed of in accordance with applicable law.
