Item 1. Business
General

Stewardship Financial Corporation (the “Corporation”) is a one-bank holding company, which was incorporated under the laws of the State of New Jersey in January 1995 to serve as a holding company for Atlantic Stewardship Bank (the “Bank”). The only significant activity of the Corporation is ownership and supervision of the Bank.

The Bank is a commercial bank formed under the laws of the State of New Jersey on April 26, 1984. The Bank operates from its main office at 630 Godwin Avenue, Midland Park, New Jersey, and its current eleven additional branches located in the State of New Jersey.

The Corporation is subject to the supervision and regulation of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the “FRB”). The Bank’s deposits are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, an agency of the federal government (the “FDIC”), up to applicable limits. The operations of the Corporation and the Bank are subject to the supervision and regulation of the FRB, the FDIC and the New Jersey Department of Banking and Insurance (the “NJDOBI”).

Stewardship Investment Corp. is a wholly-owned, non-bank subsidiary of the Bank, whose primary business is to own and manage an investment portfolio. Stewardship Realty, LLC is a wholly-owned, non-bank subsidiary of the Bank, whose primary business is to own and manage property at 612 Godwin Avenue, Midland Park, New Jersey. Atlantic Stewardship Insurance Company, LLC is a wholly-owned, non-bank subsidiary of the Bank, whose primary business is insurance. The Bank also has several other wholly-owned, non-bank subsidiaries formed to hold title to properties acquired through foreclosure or deed in lieu of foreclosure. In addition to the Bank, in 2003, the Corporation formed, Stewardship Statutory Trust I, a wholly-owned, non-bank subsidiary for the purpose of issuing trust preferred securities.
The principal executive offices of the Corporation are located at 630 Godwin Avenue, Midland Park, New Jersey 07432. Our telephone number is (201) 444-7100 and our website address is www.asbnow.bank.

The Corporation has adopted a Code of Ethical Conduct for Senior Financial Managers that applies to its principal executive officer, principal financial officer, principal accounting officer, controller and any other person performing similar functions. The Corporation’s Code of Ethical Conduct for Senior Financial Managers is posted on our website, www.asbnow.bank. The Corporation intends to satisfy the disclosure requirement under Item 5.05 of Form 8-K regarding an amendment to, or waiver from, a provision of its Code of Ethical Conduct for Senior Financial Managers by filing an 8-K and by posting such information on our website.
Business of the Corporation

The Corporation’s primary business is the ownership and supervision of the Bank. The Corporation, through the Bank, conducts a traditional commercial banking business, and offers deposit services including personal and business checking accounts and time deposits, money market accounts and regular savings accounts. The Corporation structures the Bank’s specific products and services in a manner designed to attract the business of the small and medium-sized business and professional community as well as that of individuals residing, working and shopping in Bergen, Morris and Passaic Counties, New Jersey. The Corporation engages in a wide range of lending activities and offers commercial, consumer, residential real estate, home equity and personal loans.

In forming the Bank, the members of its Board of Directors envisioned a community-based institution which would serve the local communities surrounding its branches, while also providing a return to its shareholders. This vision has been reflected in the Bank’s tithing policy, under which the Bank tithes 10% of its pre-tax profits to worthy Christian and civic organizations primarily in the communities where the Bank maintains branches.

Service Area

The Bank’s service area primarily consists of Bergen, Morris and Passaic Counties in New Jersey, although the Corporation makes loans throughout New Jersey. Throughout 2018, the Bank operated from its main office in Midland Park, New Jersey and eleven additional branch offices in Hawthorne, Ridgewood, Montville, Morristown, North Haledon, Pequannock, Waldwick, Wayne (2), Westwood and Wyckoff, New Jersey.
Competition

The market for banking services remains highly competitive. The Bank competes for deposits and loans with commercial banks, thrifts and other financial institutions, many of which have greater financial resources than the Bank. Many large financial institutions in New York City and other parts of New Jersey compete for the business of New Jersey residents and companies located in the Bank’s service area. Certain of these institutions have significantly higher lending limits and expend greater resources on marketing and advertising than the Bank and provide services to their customers that the Bank does not offer.

Management believes the Bank is able to compete on a substantially equal basis with its competitors because it provides responsive, personalized services through management’s knowledge and awareness of the Bank’s service area, customers and business.

Employees

At December 31, 2018, the Corporation employed 119 full-time employees and 28 part-time employees. None of these employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement and the Corporation believes that its employee relations are good.
Supervision and Regulation

General

Bank holding companies and banks are extensively regulated under both federal and state law. These laws and regulations are intended to protect depositors, not shareholders. To the extent that the following information describes statutory and regulatory provisions, it is qualified in its entirety by reference to the particular statutory and regulatory provisions and is not intended to be an exhaustive description of the statutes or regulations applicable to the Corporation’s and the Bank's business. Any change in the applicable law or regulation may have a material effect on the business and prospects of the Corporation and the Bank.

Dodd-Frank Act

The scope of the laws and regulations and the intensity of supervision to which our business is subject have increased in the decade after the financial crisis, in large part, as a result of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the “Dodd-Frank Act”), and its implementing regulations, most of which are now in place. Provisions in the Dodd-Frank Act and related rules that affect deposit insurance assessments, payment of interest on demand deposits, and interchange fees have increased the costs associated with deposits as well as place limitations on certain revenues that those deposits may generate. The Corporation is subject to the requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act, which includes provisions that, among other things, have:

• | centralized responsibility for consumer financial protection by creating a new agency, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (the “CFPB”), responsible for implementing, examining, and enforcing compliance with federal consumer financial laws;


• | applied to most bank holding companies, the same leverage and risk-based capital requirements applicable to insured depository institutions. The Corporation’s existing trust preferred securities continue to be treated as Tier 1 capital; 

2


• | changed the assessment base for federal deposit insurance from the amount of insured deposits to consolidated assets less tangible equity, eliminated the ceiling on the size of the Deposit Insurance Fund (“DIF”) and increased the floor on the size of the DIF, which generally requires an increase in the level of assessments for institutions with assets in excess of $10 billion;


• | implemented corporate governance revisions, including with regard to executive compensation and proxy access by shareholders, that apply to all public companies, not just financial institutions;


• | made permanent the $250,000 limit for federal deposit insurance;


• | repealed the federal prohibitions on the payment of interest on demand deposits, thereby permitting depository institutions to pay interest on business transactions and other accounts; and


• | restricted the interchange fees payable on debit card transactions for issuers with $10 billion in assets or greater.

The Economic Growth Act, as defined and described below, could result in meaningful regulatory changes for community banks and their holding companies. However, the Corporation and the Bank remain subject to extensive regulation and supervision.
2018 Regulatory Reform
In May 2018, Congress enacted the Economic Growth, Regulatory and Consumer Protection Act (the “Economic Growth Act”) to modify or remove certain post-financial crisis financial reform rules and regulations, including some of those implemented under the Dodd-Frank Act. The Economic Growth Act maintains most of the regulatory structure established by the Dodd-Frank Act, but amends certain aspects of the regulatory framework for small depository institutions with assets of less than $10 billion and for large banks with assets of more than $50 billion.
The Economic Growth Act, among other matters, expands the definition of qualified mortgages which may be held by a financial institution and simplifies the regulatory capital rules for financial institutions and their holding companies with total consolidated assets of less than $10 billion by instructing the federal banking regulators to establish a single “community bank leverage ratio” of between 8% and 10%. Any qualifying depository institution or its holding company that exceeds the “community bank leverage ratio” will be considered to have met generally applicable leverage and risk-based regulatory capital requirements and any qualifying depository institution that exceeds the new ratio will be considered to be “well capitalized” under the prompt corrective action rules
In addition, the Economic Growth Act includes regulatory relief for community banks regarding regulatory examination cycles, call reports, the proprietary trading prohibition known as the Volcker Rule (as discussed below), mortgage disclosures and risk weights for certain high-risk commercial real estate loans. The Economic Growth Act also expands the category of holding companies that may rely on the “Small Bank Holding Company Policy Statement” by raising the maximum amount of assets a qualifying holding company may have from $1 billion to $3 billion and excluding such holding companies from the minimum capital requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act.
It is difficult at this time to predict when or how any new standards under the Economic Growth Act will ultimately be applied to us or what specific impact the Economic Growth Act and its yet-to-be-written implementing rules and regulations will have on us and other community banks.
Volcker Rule
In December 2013, federal banking and securities regulators adopted final rules to implement the Volcker Rule contained in Section 619 of the Dodd-Frank Act. The Volcker Rule prohibits an insured depository institution and its affiliates (referred to as "banking entities") from engaging in “proprietary trading” and investing in or sponsoring certain types of funds subject to certain limited exceptions. The Volcker Rule also effectively prohibits short-term trading strategies by any U.S. banking entity if those strategies involve instruments other than those specifically permitted for trading and prohibits the use of some hedging strategies. Based upon management’s review of the Bank's securities portfolio, management believes that there are no securities in our portfolio that are impacted by the Volcker Rule. Consistent with the Economic Growth Act, federal banking agencies have proposed to exclude community banks, such as us, 
3

with $10 billion or less in total consolidated assets and total trading assets and liabilities of 5% or less of total consolidated assets from the restrictions of the Volcker Rule.

Bank Holding Company Act

As a bank holding company registered under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the “BHCA”), the Corporation is subject to the regulation, supervision, examination and inspection of the FRB. The Corporation is required to file with the FRB annual reports and other information demonstrating that its business operations and those of its subsidiaries are limited to banking, managing or controlling banks, furnishing services to or performing services for its subsidiaries or engaging in any other activity which the FRB determines to be so closely related to banking or managing or controlling banks as to be properly incident thereto. The FRB may also conduct examinations of the Corporation and its subsidiaries.

The BHCA requires, among other things, the prior approval of the FRB in any case where a bank holding company proposes to (i) acquire all or substantially all of the assets of any other bank, (ii) acquire direct or indirect ownership or control of more than 5% of the outstanding voting stock of any bank (unless it owns a majority of such bank’s voting shares), or (iii) merge or consolidate with any other bank holding company. The FRB will not approve any merger, acquisition, or consolidation that would have a substantially anti-competitive effect, unless the anti-competitive impact of the proposed transaction is clearly outweighed by a greater public interest in meeting the convenience and needs of the community to be served. The FRB also considers capital adequacy and other financial and managerial resources and future prospects of the companies and the banks concerned, together with the convenience and needs of the community to be served.

Additionally, the BHCA prohibits, with certain limited exceptions, a bank holding company from (i) acquiring or retaining direct or indirect ownership or control of more than 5% of the outstanding voting stock of any company which is not a bank or bank holding company, or (ii) engaging directly or indirectly in activities other than those of banking, managing or controlling banks, or performing services for its subsidiaries; unless such non-banking business is determined by the FRB to be so closely related to banking or managing or controlling banks as to be properly incident thereto. In making such determinations, the FRB is required to weigh the expected benefits to the public, such as greater convenience, increased competition or gains in efficiency, against the possible adverse effects, such as undue concentration of resources, decreased or unfair competition, conflicts of interest, or unsound banking practices.

The BHCA prohibits depository institutions whose deposits are insured by the FDIC and bank holding companies, among others, from transferring and sponsoring and investing in private equity funds and hedge funds.

There are a number of obligations and restrictions imposed on bank holding companies and their depository institution subsidiaries by law and regulatory policy that are designed to minimize potential loss to the depositors of such depository institutions and the FDIC insurance funds in the event the depository institution becomes in danger of default. Under a policy of the FRB with respect to bank holding company operations, a bank holding company is required to commit resources to support such institutions in circumstances where it might not do so absent such a policy. The FRB also has the authority under the BHCA to require a bank holding company to terminate any activity or to relinquish control of a non-bank subsidiary upon the FRB’s determination that such activity or control constitutes a serious risk to the financial soundness and stability of any bank subsidiary of the bank holding company.

Capital Adequacy Guidelines for Banks and Bank Holding Companies

The Corporation is subject to capital adequacy guidelines promulgated by the FRB. The Bank is subject to somewhat comparable but different capital adequacy requirements imposed by the FDIC. The federal banking agencies have adopted risk-based capital guidelines for banks and bank holding companies. The risk-based capital guidelines are designed to make regulatory capital requirements more sensitive to differences in risk profiles among banks and bank holding companies, to account for off-balance sheet exposure, and to minimize disincentives for holding liquid assets. Under these guidelines, assets and off-balance sheet items are assigned to broad risk categories, each with appropriate weights. The resulting capital ratios represent capital as a percentage of total risk-weighted assets and off-balance sheet items.
4

Federal banking regulators have also adopted leverage capital guidelines to supplement the risk-based measures. Leverage capital to average total assets is determined by dividing Tier 1 Capital as defined under the risk-based capital guidelines by average total assets (non-risk adjusted).

Guidelines for Banks

In December 2010 and January 2011, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (the “Basel Committee”) published the final texts of reforms on capital and liquidity, which are generally referred to as “Basel III”. The Basel Committee is a committee of central banks and bank supervisors and regulators from the major industrialized countries that develops broad policy guidelines for the regulation of banks and bank holding companies. In July 2013, the FDIC and the other federal bank regulatory agencies adopted final rules (the “Basel Rules”) to implement certain provisions of Basel III and the Dodd-Frank Act. The Basel Rules revised the leverage and risk-based capital requirements and the methods for calculating risk-weighted assets. The Basel Rules apply to all depository institutions, top-tier bank holding companies with total consolidated assets of $1 billion or more and top-tier savings and loan holding companies.

Among other things, the Basel Rules (a) established a new common equity Tier 1 Capital (“CET1”) to risk-weighted assets ratio minimum of 4.5% of risk-weighted assets, (b) raised the minimum Tier 1 Capital to risk-based assets requirement (“Tier 1 Capital Ratio) from 4% to 6% of risk-weighted assets and (c) assigned a higher risk weight of 150% to exposures that are more than 90 days past due or are on nonaccrual status and to certain commercial real estate facilities. The minimum ratio of Total Capital, as defined under the rules, to risk-weighted assets (including certain off-balance sheet activities, such as standby letters of credit) is 8%. At least 6% of the Total Capital is required to be “Tier 1 Capital”, which consists of common shareholders’ equity and certain preferred stock, less certain items and other intangible assets. The remainder, “Tier 2 Capital,” may consist of (a) the allowance for loan losses of up to 1.25% of risk-weighted assets, (b) excess of qualifying preferred stock, (c) hybrid capital instruments, (d) debt, (e) mandatory convertible securities and (f) qualifying subordinated debt. “Total Capital” is the sum of Tier 1 Capital and Tier 2 Capital less reciprocal holdings of other banking organizations’ capital instruments, investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries and any other deductions as determined by the federal banking regulatory agencies on a case-by-case basis or as a matter of policy after formal rule-making. A small bank holding company that has the highest regulatory examination rating and is not contemplating significant growth or expansion must maintain a minimum level of Tier 1 Capital to average total consolidated assets leverage ratio of at least 3%. All other bank holding companies are expected to maintain a leverage ratio of at least 100 to 200 basis points above the stated minimum.
The Basel Rules also require unrealized gains and losses on certain available-for-sale securities to be included for purposes of calculating regulatory capital unless a one-time opt-out was exercised. Additional constraints are also imposed on the inclusion in regulatory capital of mortgage-servicing assets and deferred tax assets. The Basel Rules limit a banking organization’s capital distributions and certain discretionary bonus payments if the banking organization does not hold a “capital conservation buffer” consisting of 2.5% of CET1 to risk-weighted assets in addition to the amount necessary to meet a minimum risk-based capital requirement. The purpose of the capital conservation buffer is to ensure that banking organizations conserve capital when it is needed most, allowing them to weather periods of economic stress. Banking institutions with a CET1 Ratio, Tier 1 Capital Ratio or Total Capital Ratio above the minimum capital ratios but below the minimum capital ratios plus the capital conservation buffer will face constraints on their ability to pay dividends, repurchase equity and pay discretionary bonuses to executive officers based on the amount of the shortfall. The Basel Rules became effective for the Bank on January 1, 2015. The capital conservation buffer requirement of 0.625% became effective January 1, 2016 and was phased in annually through January 1, 2019, when the full capital conservation buffer requirement of 2.50% became effective. At December 31, 2018, the Bank's capital conservation buffer requirement was 1.875%, and the actual capital conservation buffer was 5.54%.

Bank assets are given risk-weights of 0%, 20%, 50%, 100%, and 150%. In addition, certain off-balance sheet items are given similar credit conversion factors to convert them to asset equivalent amounts to which an appropriate risk-weight will apply. These computations result in the total risk-weighted assets. Most loans are assigned to the 100% risk category, except for performing first mortgage loans fully secured by residential property which carry a 50% risk-weighting. Loan exposures past due 90 days or more or on nonaccrual are assigned a risk-weighting of at least 100%. High volatility commercial real estate ("HVCRE") loan exposures are assigned to the 150% category; provided, however, Section 214 of the Economic Growth Act, prohibits federal banking agencies from requiring the financial institution to 
5

assign heightened risk weights to HVCRE loans unless the loan is related to real estate acquisition, development and construction (“HVCRE ADC”). Under the Basel III capital rules, HVCRE ADC loans are assigned a higher risk weight than other commercial real estate loans. Most investment securities (including, primarily, general obligation claims of states or other political subdivisions of the United States) are assigned to the 20% category, except for municipal or state revenue bonds, which have a 50% risk-weight, and direct obligations of the U.S. Treasury or obligations backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government, which have a 0% risk-weight. In converting off-balance sheet items, direct credit substitutes, including general guarantees and standby letters of credit backing nonfinancial obligations, and undrawn commitments (including commercial credit lines with an initial maturity of more than one year) have a 50% risk-weighting. Short-term undrawn commitments and commercial letters of credit with an initial maturity of under one year have a 50% risk-weighting and certain short-term unconditionally cancelable commitments are not risk-weighted.
Community Bank Leverage Ratio
The recently enacted Economic Growth Act requires federal banking agencies to develop a “community bank leverage ratio” (the ratio of a bank’s tangible equity capital to average total consolidated assets) for financial institutions with assets of less than $10 billion. A “qualifying community bank” that exceeds this ratio will be deemed to be in compliance with all other capital and leverage requirements, including the capital requirements to be considered “well capitalized” under prompt corrective action rules. The federal banking agencies may consider an institution’s risk profile when evaluating whether it qualifies as a community bank for purposes of the capital ratio requirement. The minimum capital for the new community bank leverage ratio must be set at not less than 8% and not more than 10%. A financial institution can elect to be subject to this new definition. The Economic Growth Act requires the federal banking agencies to consult with state banking regulators and notify the applicable state banking regulator of any qualifying community bank that exceeds or no longer exceeds the Community Bank Leverage Ratio.
Guidelines for Small Bank Holding Companies

The Dodd-Frank Act required the FRB to establish for all bank and savings and loan holding companies minimum consolidated capital requirements that are as stringent as those required for the insured depository subsidiaries. The FRB has updated and amended its Small Bank Holding Company Policy Statement to extend to bank and savings and loan holding companies the applicability of the “Small Bank Holding Company” exception to its consolidated capital requirements and, as a result of the Economic Growth Act, increased the threshold for the exception from $1.0 billion in consolidated assets to $3.0 billion in consolidated assets. As a result of the revised Small Bank Holding Company Policy Statement, Basel III capital rules and reporting requirements do not apply to small bank holding companies (“SBHC”), such as the Corporation, that have total consolidated assets of less than $3 billion unless otherwise advised by the FRB. The minimum risk-based capital requirements for a SBHC to be considered adequately capitalized are 4% for Tier 1 Capital and 8% for Total Capital to risk-weighted assets.

The regulations for SBHCs classify risk-based capital into two categories: “Tier 1 Capital” which consists of common and qualifying perpetual preferred shareholders’ equity less goodwill and other intangibles and “Tier 2 Capital” which consists of (a) the allowance for loan losses of up to 1.25% of risk-weighted assets, (b) the excess of qualifying preferred stock, (c) hybrid capital instruments, (d) debt, (e) mandatory convertible securities and (f) qualifying subordinated debt. Total qualifying capital consists of Tier 1 Capital and Tier 2 Capital less reciprocal holdings of other banking organizations’ capital instruments, investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries and any other deductions as determined by the FRB on a case-by-case basis or as a matter of policy after formal rule-making. However, the amount of Tier 2 Capital may not exceed the amount of Tier 1 Capital. The Corporation must maintain a minimum level of Tier 1 Capital to average total consolidated assets leverage ratio of 3%, which is the leverage ratio reserved for top-tier bank holding companies having the highest regulatory examination rating and not contemplating significant growth or expansion.

Bank holding company assets are given risk-weights of 0%, 20%, 50%, and 100%. In addition, certain off-balance sheet items are given similar credit conversion factors to convert them to asset equivalent amounts to which an appropriate risk-weight will apply. These computations result in the total risk-weighted assets.
As of December 31, 2018, the Corporation and the Bank exceeded all regulatory capital requirements.

Regulation of the Bank by the FDIC and the NJDOBI

As a New Jersey-chartered commercial bank, the Bank is subject to the regulation, supervision, and control of the NJDOBI. As an FDIC-insured institution, the Bank is also subject to regulation, supervision and control by the FDIC. The regulations of the FDIC and the NJDOBI impact virtually all activities of the Bank, including the minimum level of capital the Bank must maintain, the ability of the Bank to pay dividends, the ability of the Bank to expand through new branches or acquisitions, and various other matters.

Insurance of Deposits

Substantially all of the deposits of the Bank are insured up to applicable limits by the DIF of the FDIC and are subject to deposit insurance assessments to maintain the DIF. The Dodd-Frank Act permanently raised the standard maximum deposit insurance amount to $250,000.

The FDIC redefined its deposit insurance premium assessment base to be an institution’s average consolidated total assets minus average tangible equity as required by the Dodd-Frank Act and revised deposit insurance assessment rate schedules in light of the changes to the assessment base. The rate schedule and other revisions to the assessment rules, which were adopted by the FDIC Board of Directors on February 7, 2011, became effective April 1, 2011 and were first used to calculate the June 30, 2011 assessment. The assessment rules were further modified in November, 2014; the revisions became effective on January 1, 2015. Further modified as of September 30, 2016, the Bank’s assessment rate averaged $0.03 per $100 in assessable assets minus average tangible equity.

In addition to the assessment for deposit insurance, institutions are required to make payments on bonds issued in the late 1980s by the Financing Corporation (“FICO”) in connection with the failure of certain savings and loan associations. This payment obligation is established quarterly and averaged 0.31% and 0.52% of the assessment base for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The Corporation paid $25,000 and $40,000 under this assessment for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. These assessments will continue until the FICO bonds mature in 2019.

FDIC’s Capital Adequacy Guidelines for Banks

Similar to the FRB, the FDIC has promulgated risk-based capital guidelines for banks that are designed to make regulatory capital requirements more sensitive to differences in risk profile among banks, to account for off-balance sheet exposure, and to minimize disincentives for holding liquid assets. These guidelines are substantially the same as those put in place by the FRB for bank holding companies.
Dividend Rights

Under the New Jersey Banking Act of 1948, as amended (the "New Jersey Banking Act"), a bank may declare and pay dividends only if, after payment of the dividend, the capital stock of the bank will be unimpaired and either the bank will have a surplus of not less than 50% of its capital stock or the payment of the dividend will not reduce the bank’s surplus.
Federal Securities Laws and Listing Requirements
The common stock of the Corporation is registered with the United States Securities Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”) and is listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol “SSFN.” The Corporation is subject to the reporting, information disclosure, corporate governance, proxy solicitation, insider trading and other requirements imposed on public companies by the SEC under the Exchange Act as well as the Securities Act. As a company listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market, we are also subject to the standards for Nasdaq-listed companies. The SEC and the Nasdaq have adopted regulations under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the Dodd-Frank Act intended to improve corporate governance and the reliability of disclosures in SEC filings and provide enhanced penalties for financial reporting fraud. The Corporation’s insiders are subject to limits on sales of our common stock and must file insider ownership reports with the SEC. The Corporation is currently 
7

a “smaller reporting company”, which allows us to provide certain simplified and scaled disclosures in our SEC filings. In June 2018, the SEC adopted rule amendments that raised the thresholds for a company to be eligible to provide scaled disclosures as a smaller reporting company to $250 million of public float. As such, the Corporation will remain a smaller reporting company for so long as the market value of the Corporation’s common stock held by non-affiliates as of the end of its most recently completed second fiscal quarter is less than $250 million. Although we remain a smaller reporting company, we have become an “accelerated filer” because our public float exceeds $75 million.
USA Patriot Act of 2001

On October 26, 2001, the USA Patriot Act of 2001 (the “Patriot Act”) was signed into law. Enacted in response to the terrorist attacks in New York, Pennsylvania, and Washington, D.C. on September 11, 2001, the Patriot Act is intended to strengthen the ability of U.S. law enforcement and the intelligence community to work cohesively to combat terrorism on a variety of fronts. The Patriot Act contains sweeping anti-money laundering and financial transparency laws and requires various regulations, including, but not limited to: (a) due diligence requirements for financial institutions that administer, maintain, or manage private bank accounts or correspondent accounts for non-U.S. persons; (b) standards for verifying customer identification at account opening; (c) rules to promote cooperation among financial institutions, regulators and law enforcement entities in identifying parties that may be involved in terrorism or money laundering; (d) reports of nonfinancial trades and business filed with the Treasury Department’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network for transactions exceeding $10,000; and (e) filing of suspicious activities reports by brokers and dealers if they believe a customer may be violating U.S. laws and regulations.

Regulations promulgated under the Patriot Act impose obligations on financial institutions to maintain appropriate policies, procedures and controls to detect, prevent and report money laundering and terrorist financing. Failure of the Corporation or the Bank to comply with the Patriot Act’s requirements could have serious legal consequences for us and adversely affect our reputation.
