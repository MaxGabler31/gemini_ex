Item 1. BUSINESS

National Holdings Corporation (“National,” “we,” “us,” “our,” or the “Company”) is a full-service investment banking and asset management firm that operates through its wholly-owned subsidiaries which principally provide financial services. Through our broker-dealer and investment advisory subsidiaries, we (1) offer full service retail brokerage services to individual, corporate and institutional clients, (2) provide investment banking, merger and acquisition and advisory services to high-growth micro-, small- and mid-cap companies and (3) trade securities, including making markets in micro- and small-cap stocks listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market (“Nasdaq”) and other exchanges. 
National is a Delaware corporation organized in 1996. Our broker-dealer subsidiary is National Securities Corporation, a Washington corporation (“NSC”). NSC conducts a national securities brokerage business through its main offices in New York City, New York and Boca Raton, Florida. NSC is an introducing broker and clears all transactions through clearing organizations on a fully disclosed basis. NSC is registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) and is a member of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (“FINRA”) and Securities Investor Protection Corporation (the “SIPC”).

Our brokers, who we also refer to as our registered representatives, operate either as independent contractors or employees. An independent contractor registered representative typically establishes such representative’s own office and is responsible for the payment of expenses associated with the operation of such office, including rent, utilities, furniture, computer and other equipment, market data, software and general office supplies. As a result, such independent contractor registered representative is entitled to retain a higher percentage of the commissions generated by such representative’s sales than a registered representative employee at a traditional employee-based brokerage firm. This arrangement allows us to operate with a reduced amount of fixed costs and lowers the risk of operational losses for less productive independent contractor registered representatives. A registered representative employee is provided with office space, technology, regulatory support and administrative support in exchange for a lower retention percentage of such employee’s production.

Our wholly-owned subsidiary, National Asset Management, Inc., a Washington corporation (“NAM”), is a federally-registered investment advisor providing asset management advisory services to retail clients for a fee based upon a percentage of assets managed.
Our wholly-owned subsidiaries, National Insurance Corporation, a Washington corporation (“National Insurance”), and Prime Financial Services, a Delaware corporation (“Prime Financial”), provide fixed insurance products to their clients, including life insurance, disability insurance, long-term care insurance and fixed annuities.

Our wholly-owned subsidiary, National Tax and Financial Services, Inc. (“National Tax”) formerly Gilman Ciocia, Inc., a Delaware corporation, provides tax preparation services to individuals, predominantly in the middle- and upper-income tax brackets and accounting services to small and midsize companies.

Our wholly-owned subsidiary, GC Capital Corporation, a Delaware corporation (“GC”), provides licensed mortgage brokerage services in New York and Florida.
B. Riley Transaction
On November 14, 2018, B. Riley Financial, Inc. (“B. Riley”) and FBIO Acquisition, Inc. (“FBIO Acquisition”), a subsidiary of Fortress Biotech, Inc. (“Fortress”), entered into a stock purchase agreement whereby FBIO Acquisition agreed to sell FBIO Acquisition’s majority stake in the Company to a wholly-owned subsidiary of B. Riley (the “FBIO Sale”). Under the terms of the agreement, B. Riley agreed to purchase 7,037,482 shares of our common stock from FBIO Acquisition, representing approximately 56.1% of our outstanding common stock and Fortress’s entire economic interest in the Company. An aggregate of 3,010,054 shares were purchased immediately at $3.25 per share. After approval from FINRA was received on February 4, 2019, B. Riley purchased an additional 3,149,496 shares of our common stock on February 11, 2019 and assigned its right to purchase the remaining 877,932 shares to a third party.
Further, in connection with the FBIO Sale, we entered into an agreement with B. Riley (the “B. Riley Agreement”), pursuant to which B. Riley agreed to certain customary standstill provisions, effective as of the date of the B. Riley Agreement through December 31, 2021 (the “Standstill Period”), prohibiting B. Riley and any of its affiliates or associates, directly or indirectly, from, among other things: (i) acquiring, agreeing to acquire or otherwise seeking to acquire any beneficial interest in the Company’s share capital or any of its material assets other than (x) the FBIO Sale and (y) pursuant to B. Riley’s pro rata 
1

participation rights described in the B. Riley Agreement; (ii) making a take-over bid, tender offer or exchange offer for all or any part of the Company’s share capital; (iii) announcing, or taking any action which would require the announcement of, any proposals by B. Riley for any business combination or any other similar transaction involving the securities of the Company or its material assets or businesses; (iv) soliciting proxies with respect to any securities of the Company or otherwise influencing any shareholders of the Company for any action or transaction; (v) requesting that the Board expand or reduce the number of directors or the number of Board designees nominated by otherwise designated by B. Riley; (vi) take any other action that would constitute a “business combination” for purposes of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law (including any successor statute thereto) (“Section 203”) (other than any transactions covered by Section 203(c)(3)(v) of the Delaware General Corporation Law that are in the ordinary course of our business operations); (vii) make any public announcement with respect to any of the foregoing, except as, and solely to the extent, legally required or compelled (and provided that the reason for any such required announcement is not the result of any action taken by B. Riley) or (viii) contest the validity of the standstill terms of the B. Riley Agreement or initiate or participate in any judicial proceeding to amend, waive, terminate or seek a release of the restrictions of such standstill terms.
Pursuant to the B. Riley Agreement, we granted to B. Riley the right to appoint two B. Riley representatives to attend meetings of the Board and any committee thereof in a non-voting observer capacity. If B. Riley’s beneficial ownership of the Company’s common stock is reduced to below 24%, B. Riley’s rights to designate board observers will be reduced to one board observer, and if B. Riley’s beneficial ownership of the Company’s common stock is reduced to below 5%, B. Riley’s rights to designate board observers will cease.
The B. Riley Agreement further permits B. Riley to participate pro rata in any bona fide common stock equity offering by us (including the offering of any securities convertible into common stock) if the offering price of the Company’s common stock in such offering is equal to or less than $3.25 per share, as adjusted for stock splits, stock dividends, stock combinations and similar events, subject to certain exceptions. This participation right will end upon the earlier of (x) the end of the Standstill Period and (y) a change in control of the Company, as defined in the B. Riley Agreement.
The B. Riley Agreement also contains non-solicitation terms that prohibit either the Company or B. Riley, or any of their respective affiliates, associates and related parties, from hiring any executive officer or member of senior management of the other party during the Standstill Period, subject to certain exceptions.
In connection with the B. Riley Agreement, the Board waived the applicability of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law to B. Riley in connection with the FBIO Sale.
Upon final closing of the FBIO Sale, the Company's warrants held by FBIO Acquisition ceased to be outstanding.
Winslow, Evans & Crocker, Inc. Acquisition
On August 26, 2019, we entered into a stock purchase agreement (as amended, the “Winslow Agreement” and the transactions contemplated thereunder, the “Winslow Acquisition”) whereby we agreed to acquire all of the outstanding equity interests (the “Purchased Shares”) of Winslow Evans & Crocker, Inc. (“WEC”), Winslow, Evans & Crocker Insurance Agency, Inc. (“WIA”), and Winslow Financial, Inc. (“WF” and collectively with WEC and WIA, the “Winslow Targets”). The Company entered into an amendment to the Winslow Agreement on October 11, 2019, to reflect certain clarifications to the terms of the Winslow Agreement as agreed to by the parties. The Winslow Acquisition is expected to close in the first fiscal quarter of 2020, subject to customary conditions and regulatory approvals. 
Under the terms of the Winslow Agreement, at the closing of the Winslow Acquisition, the Company will acquire the Purchased Shares for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $3.2 million paid at closing in cash, subject to certain adjustments, plus additional consideration to be based on (i) the amount of net operating capital of WEC and WF as of the closing, payable in three annual installments and not to exceed $1.0 million in the aggregate, (ii) the aggregate pre-tax net income (loss) of the Winslow Targets through September 22, 2022, provided that such additional consideration shall not be less than $1.5 million and shall not exceed $3.0 million in the aggregate, and (iii) a portion of the synergies achieved through September 20, 2022. At the signing of the Winslow Agreement, the Company deposited $500,000 into escrow, which will be applied to the amount payable at closing or which would be forfeited if the Winslow Acquisition is approved by FINRA but are not consummated due to certain breaches of the Winslow Agreement by the Company.
WEC is a Boston-based, full-service investment firm established in 1991. WEC is an SEC Registered Investment Advisor and a FINRA registered broker-dealer. More than 50 financial professionals including Certified Financial Planners, Investment Advisor Representatives, Financial Consultants, brokers and other specialists are part of the Winslow team with over $2.5B in assets under management. Located in the heart of the financial district in Boston, MA, we believe that WEC is a strategic 
2

location for the Company to build out its banking platform. We expect that the Winslow Acquisition will be accretive to gross margin and adjusted EBITDA margin.
Clearing Relationships

NSC has clearing arrangements with National Financial Services LLC (“NFS”), Axos Clearing (“Axos”) formerly COR Clearing LLC and Raymond James (“RJ”).
Financial Information about Industry Segments
The Company has two reportable segments: (i) the brokerage and advisory services segment, and (ii) the tax and accounting services segment. The brokerage and advisory services segment includes broker-dealer and investment advisory services, sale of insurance products and licensed mortgage brokerage services provided by NSC, NAM, National Insurance, Prime Financial, and GC. The tax and accounting services segment includes tax preparation and accounting services provided by National Tax.
During the fiscal years ended September 30, 2019, 2018 and 2017, we recognized approximately 73%, 81% and 82%, respectively, of our total revenues from brokerage services, principal and agency transactions, and investment banking. During the fiscal years ended September 30, 2019, 2018 and 2017, (i) brokerage services consisting of retail brokerage commissions represented 41%, 52% and 51%, respectively, of total revenues, (ii) principal and agency transactions consisting of net dealer inventory (losses) gains represented (1)%, 2% and 8%, respectively, of total revenues, and (iii) investment banking consisting of corporate finance commissions and fees, represented 33%, 27% and 23%, respectively, of total revenues. For a more detailed analysis of our results by segment, see Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”
Business Lines
Brokerage Services

NSC is registered as a broker-dealer with the SEC and licensed to conduct activities as a broker-dealer in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. NSC is also a member of FINRA and SIPC.

Registered representatives are given broad discretion to structure their own practices and specialize in different areas of the securities markets subject to supervisory procedures and applicable rules and regulations. In addition, registered representatives have direct access to research materials, our management, our traders, and all levels of our support personnel.

The brokerage services provided by our registered representatives and investment advisors include execution of purchases and sales of stocks, options, bonds, mutual funds, annuities and various other securities for individual and institutional customers. In the fiscal year ended September 30, 2019, trades of stocks and options represented approximately 58% of our brokerage revenues, trade of bonds represented approximately 8% of our brokerage revenues, and trade of mutual funds, annuities and various other securities made up approximately 32% of our brokerage revenues. The percentage of each type of business varies over time as the investment preferences of our customers change based on market conditions.

Typically, NSC does not recommend particular securities to customers. Rather, recommendations to customers are determined by individual registered representatives based upon NSC’s research and analysis or their own research and analysis, subject to applicable FINRA customer suitability standards. Most registered representatives perform fundamental (as opposed to technical) analysis. Solicitations are made by telephone, email, seminars or newsletters.

NSC generally acts as an agent in executing customer orders to buy or sell listed and over-the-counter securities in which we do not make a market and charge commissions based on the services we provide to our customers. In executing customer orders to buy or sell a security in which we make a market, we may sell to, or purchase from, customers at a price that is substantially equal to the current inter-dealer market price plus or minus a mark-up or mark-down. We may also act as agent and execute a customer’s purchase or sale order with another broker-dealer market-maker at the best inter-dealer market price available and charge a commission. We believe our mark-ups, mark-downs and commissions are competitive based on various factors including the services we provide to our customers. The commissions and mark-ups or mark-downs must be in compliance with guidelines established by FINRA. In order to increase revenues generated from these activities, we continuously seek to hire additional registered representatives and work with our current registered representatives to increase their productivity.
Payments to both our independent and employee registered representatives are based on commissions generated and represent a variable cost rather than a fixed cost of operating our business. Commission expense represents a significant majority of our 
3

total expenses. We work to control our fixed costs in order to achieve operating profitability based upon our expectation of market conditions and the related level of revenues. Our operations include execution of orders, processing of transactions, internal financial controls, supervision and compliance with regulatory and legal requirements.
Historically, most of our registered representatives served as independent contractors responsible for providing their own office facilities, sales assistants, telephone, Internet, computer and other equipment, software, market data, supplies and other items of overhead. As of September 30, 2019, we had a total of approximately 970 associates of which 340 were employees and 630 were independent contractors. Of these associates, approximately 690 were registered representatives.

We believe that registered representatives in the brokerage industry are traditionally compensated on the basis of set percentages of total commissions and mark-ups generated. Most brokerage firms bear substantially all of the costs of maintaining their sales forces, including providing office space, sales assistants, telephone and Internet service, computers and other equipment and supplies. We believe that the average commission paid to employee registered representatives in the brokerage industry generally ranges from 30% to 50% of total commissions generated.

Since we require a majority of our registered representatives to absorb their own overhead and expenses, we pay a higher percentage of the commissions and mark-ups generated by our registered representatives, as compared to traditional registered representatives in the brokerage industry. This arrangement also reduces fixed costs and lowers the risk of operational losses for lower or non-producing brokers. 
Our business plan includes the growth of our retail and institutional brokerage business, while recognizing the volatility of the financial markets. In response to historical market fluctuations, we have periodically adjusted certain business activities, including proprietary trading and market-making trading. We believe that consolidation within the industry may occur and we may consider strategic acquisitions in the future, but we are focused on generating positive cash flow and maintaining profitability of our current operations.

We conduct periodic reviews of our controls and our supervision, administrative and operations personnel meet frequently with our management to review operating conditions. Our compliance, supervision and operations personnel monitor compliance with applicable laws, rules and regulations.

Broker-Dealer Trading

NSC buys and may maintain inventories in equity securities as “market-makers” for sale of those securities to other dealers and our customers. NSC may also maintain inventories in corporate, government and municipal debt securities for sale to our customers. The level of our market-making trading activities typically increases or decreases depending on the relative strength or weakness of the broader markets. As of September 30, 2019, we made markets in approximately 300 micro- and small-cap Nasdaq and other exchange-listed and over the counter quoted stocks. We anticipate that we will continue market-making trading activity in the future, which may include securities of companies for which we participated as an underwriter for in a public offering of securities.

Our trading departments require a commitment of capital. Most principal transactions place our capital at risk. Profits and losses are dependent upon the skill of our traders, price movements, trading activity and the size of inventories. Since our trading activities occasionally may involve speculative and thinly capitalized stocks, including stabilizing the market for securities which we have underwritten, we impose position limits to reduce our potential for loss.

In executing customer orders to buy or sell a security in which we make a market, we may sell to, or purchase from, customers at a price that is substantially equal to the current inter-dealer market price plus or minus a mark-up or mark-down. We may also act as agent and execute a customer’s purchase or sale order with another broker-dealer market-maker at the best inter-dealer market price available and charge a commission. We believe our mark-ups, mark-downs and commissions are competitive based on various factors including the services we provide to our customers.
Investment Banking

We provide corporate finance and investment banking services, including underwriting the sale of securities to the public in both initial and follow-on offerings and arranging for the private placement of securities with investors. Our investment banking services require a short-term commitment of our capital. Our corporate finance operations provide a broad range of financial and corporate advisory services, including mergers and acquisitions, project financing, capital structure and specific financing opportunities. Corporate finance revenues are generated from capital raising transactions of equity and debt securities 
4

and fees for strategic advisory services. Recognizing the diversity of our clients, we plan to work closely with our independent advisors to identify key additional investment banking verticals that we can strengthen to enhance our offerings to our clients.
Among the areas in which we intend to enhance our presence are biotechnology and healthcare. Our emerging biotechnology and healthcare investment banking business, accounted for approximately 27% of all investment banking revenues for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2019. 
Investment Advisory Services
NAM, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company and a SEC-registered investment advisor, offers advisory services described below to clients in various programs. Under such customized engagements, clients authorize NAM to purchase and sell securities on a discretionary or non-discretionary basis (depending on the program) pursuant to investment objectives chosen by the client. The client’s Investment Advisory Representative (“IAR”) obtains the essential facts from the client, and assists in determining the appropriate program. The IAR provides ongoing investment advice and management that is tailored to the individual needs of the client through a review of the investment profile and objectives of the client. Depending on the program selected and the client’s profile and objectives, the types of securities that may be purchased or sold include mutual funds, ETFs, equities, options, fixed income securities, structured notes and partnership interests in real estate, oil and gas, as well as management of variable annuity sub-accounts. Clients generally may impose reasonable restrictions on investing in certain securities or groups of securities.
NAM receives compensation from clients through assets under management fees, administrative fees, and in some instances, hourly fees, fixed fees, performance-based fees or carried interest. IARs receive a portion of the fees in accordance with their contract with NAM. A NAM IAR may also be a registered representative with NSC, a subsidiary of the Company and an affiliate of NAM, and therefore can establish and service brokerage accounts for NAM clients. 
Programs currently offered by NAM include: 

• | The Portfolio Advisor Program, pursuant to which the IAR manages individual client accounts on a discretionary basis, with an asset-based fee;


• | The Portfolio Advisor Plus Program, in which the IAR manages individual client accounts on a discretionary basis, with an alternative pricing structure whereby qualified clients may pay a performance-based fee in addition to an asset-based fee;


• | The Morningstar Managed Portfolios Program, a proprietary program offered through Morningstar Investment Services, Inc., consisting of multiple investment strategies with multiple portfolios intended for a range of clients based on such factors as age, financial situation, time horizon, risk tolerance and any reasonable restrictions that the client may place on the portfolio selected for the account. Fees in this program are asset-based;


• | The Investment Advisor Program, pursuant to which IARs provide advisory services with respect to variable annuity products, plans such as 401(k)s, 403(b)s, mutual funds, and retirement funds, as well as individually managed client accounts. Fees in this program are asset-based;


• | Financial planning, offered for a flat fee or an hourly rate;


• | Discretionary management services for private funds;


• | Retirement solutions provided to retirement plan providers, sponsors, and participants through various products, services and custodial platforms, including FOLIO Institutional, which is a custodian and financial technology firm;


• | Wrap programs, which are advisory programs in which advisory fees and execution fees are bundled, using a platform offered by Envestnet Asset Management, Inc., a SEC-registered investment adviser and “turnkey” asset management platform provider. The Envestnet platform provides wealth management technology for registered investment advisers along with asset management programs;

5


• | A unified managed account program (a unified managed account refers to an account that combines investment vehicles into a single or “unified” account managed by one or more independent money managers) using Foliofn Investments, Inc. Foliofn is a custodian that offers a fractionalized share trading platform which enables investors to diversify investments across multiple securities; and


• | A program utilizing the FTJ FundChoice Program, in which NAM serves as the advisor for the client on a non-discretionary basis.

NAM operates its programs as a directed brokerage subject to most favorable execution of client transactions. NAM does not require a client to utilize any particular broker/custodian and currently has relationships with a number of brokers/custodians that provide brokerage, clearing and custody services to clients in the programs. The choice of which broker/custodian to utilize is determined by the client in consultation with their IAR, and a client enters into a separate contractual relationship with the selected broker/custodian. Based on the client’s selection, all transactions in their accounts are then placed through the selected broker-dealer. NAM clients may pay ticket charges for brokerage services according to the agreement between the client and the selected custodian. 
Clients may elect to use NSC as their broker-dealer for certain programs. NSC maintains a clearing arrangement with NFS to execute transactions at negotiated clearing rates. NSC receives a portion of ticket charges paid by NAM clients for trades executed through NSC. NAM does not receive any compensation for such brokerage services. 
NAM may combine multiple orders for shares of the same securities purchased for advisory accounts. NAM then allocates a portion of the shares to participating accounts in a fair and equitable manner. NAM does this to obtain, to the extent possible, the optimal execution for clients. The distribution of the shares purchased is typically pro rata based on size of the orders placed for each account. It is not based on account performance or the amount or structure of management fees. When NAM IARs combine orders, each participating account pays an average price per share for all transactions and pays a proportionate share of all transaction costs. Accounts owned by associated IARs may participate in block trading with client accounts; however, they will receive an allocation only after all client orders are filled.
Institutional Services

A critical element of our business strategy is to identify institutional quality investments that offer above market returns. We support that mission by providing institutional investment managers, primarily hedge fund managers, a complete array of services designed to enhance portfolio performance. Hedge funds represent a segment of the money management market and by definition are focused on achieving positive returns for their investors while controlling risk. We offer fund managers access to investment opportunities and independent research products. Additionally, we offer fund managers, the ability to reduce their transaction costs by offering them access to our trading desk for illiquid securities and automated trading systems for their liquid transactions as well as special execution services using volume weighted averages and average pricing for micro and small-cap stocks. We believe that our registered representatives engaged in institutional services have a mutually beneficial relationship with our Investment Banking Division (“IBD”), as fund managers looking for investment opportunities participate in offerings by IBD’s corporate clients. Our relationships with fund managers may create opportunities to increase the number and breadth of IBD clients.
Administration, Operations, Securities Transactions Processing and Customer Accounts

NSC does not hold any funds or securities for customers. Rather, it uses the services of clearing agents on a fully-disclosed basis. These clearing agents process securities transactions and maintain customer accounts. In addition to transactions executed through our clearing agents, NSC also conducts direct business. Customer accounts are protected through SIPC for up to $500,000, of which coverage for cash balances is limited to $250,000. In addition to SIPC protection, NFS, our primary clearing agent, provides brokerage accounts additional “excess of SIPC” coverage from Lloyd’s of London, together with other insurers. The “excess of SIPC” coverage would only be used when SIPC coverage is exhausted. Like SIPC protection, “excess of SIPC” protection does not cover investment losses in customer accounts due to market fluctuations. It also does not cover other claims for losses incurred while the firms remain in business. Total aggregate “excess of SIPC” coverage available on all accounts held at NFS is $1.0 billion. Within the “excess of SIPC” coverage, there is no per account dollar limit on coverage of securities, just a per account limit of $1.9 million on coverage of cash.

Tax Preparation and Accounting Services

We provide tax preparation and small business accounting services through our wholly-owned subsidiary, National Tax. Tax preparation business is conducted predominantly during the period from February through April of each year. During the 2019 tax year season, National Tax prepared approximately 24,000 federal, state and local tax returns.
We believe that we offer clients a cost effective and proactive tax preparation and tax planning service. National Tax’s volume allows it to provide uniform services at competitive prices. In addition, as compared to certain of its competitors that are open only during tax season, all of National Tax’s offices are open year round to provide financial planning and other services to our clients. 
National Tax's preparers are generally not certified public accountants, attorneys or enrolled agents. Therefore, they are limited in the representation that they can provide to clients in the event of an audit by the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”).
Competition

We are engaged in a highly competitive business. With respect to one or more aspects of our business, our competitors include member organizations of the New York Stock Exchange and other registered securities exchanges in the United States and Canada, the U.K., Europe and members of FINRA. Many of these organizations have substantially greater personnel and financial resources and more sales offices than we do. Discount brokerage firms affiliated with commercial banks provide additional competition, as well as companies that provide electronic online trading. In many instances, the Company is also competing directly for customer funds with investment opportunities offered by the real estate, insurance, banking, and savings and loan industries.

The securities industry has become considerably more concentrated and competitive since we were founded, as numerous firms have either ceased operations or been acquired by or merged into other firms. In addition, companies not engaged primarily in the securities business, but with substantial financial resources, have acquired leading securities firms. These developments have increased competition from firms with greater capital resources than ours.

Since the adoption of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999, commercial banks and thrift institutions have been able to engage in traditional brokerage and investment banking services, thus increasing competition in the securities industry and potentially increasing the rate of consolidation in the securities industry.

We also compete with other securities firms for successful sales representatives, securities traders and investment bankers. Competition for qualified employees and independent contractors in the financial services industry is intense. Our continued ability to compete effectively depends on our ability to attract new employees and independent contractors and to retain and motivate our existing employees and independent contractors. For a further discussion of risks facing the Company, please see “Risk Factors.”

In addition, our tax preparation business is also subject to extensive competition. We compete with national tax return preparers such as H&R Block, Jackson Hewitt, and Liberty Tax. The remainder of the tax preparation industry is highly fragmented and includes regional tax preparation services, accountants, attorneys, small independently owned companies, and financial service institutions that prepare tax returns as ancillary parts of their business. To a lesser extent, we compete with the online and software self-preparer market.
Government Regulation and Supervision

NSC and our investment adviser businesses are subject to extensive regulation by the SEC, FINRA, state securities regulators and other governmental regulatory authorities. The principal purpose of these regulations is the protection of customers and the securities markets. The SEC is the federal agency charged with the administration of the federal securities laws. Much of the regulation of broker-dealers, however, has been delegated to self-regulatory organizations (“SROs”), such as FINRA, that adopt rules, subject to approval by the SEC, which govern their members and conduct periodic examinations of member firms’ operations. Securities firms are also subject to regulation by state securities commissions in the states in which they are registered. NSC is a registered broker-dealer with the SEC and a member of FINRA. It is licensed to conduct activities as a broker-dealer in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. A number of changes have been proposed to the rules and regulations that govern our securities business, and other rules and regulations have been adopted, which may result in changes in the way we conduct our business.
7

Broker-Dealer Regulation
As a result of federal and state registration and SRO memberships, broker-dealers are subject to overlapping schemes of regulation that cover all aspects of their securities businesses. Such regulations cover matters including capital requirements; uses and safekeeping of clients’ funds and securities; conduct of directors, officers, and employees; record keeping and reporting requirements; supervisory and organizational procedures intended to ensure compliance with securities laws and to prevent improper trading on material nonpublic information; employee-related matters, including qualification and licensing of supervisory and sales personnel; limitations on extensions of credit in securities transactions; clearance and settlement procedures; requirements for the registration, underwriting, sale, and distribution of securities; customer identification rules; rules related to the identification and reporting of suspicious activity; and rules of the SROs designed to promote high standards of commercial honor and just and equitable principles of trade. A particular focus of the applicable regulations concerns the relationship between broker-dealers and their customers. As a result, many aspects of the broker-dealer customer relationship are subject to regulation, including, in some instances, “suitability” determinations as to certain customer transactions, limitations on the amounts that may be charged to customers, timing of proprietary trading in relation to customers’ trades, and disclosures to customers.
Regulation NMS and Regulation SHO have substantially affected the trading of equity securities. These regulations were intended to increase transparency in the markets and have acted to further reduce spreads and, with competition from electronic marketplaces, to reduce commission rates paid by investors. 
Additional legislation, changes in rules promulgated by the SEC and by SROs, and changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing laws and rules often directly affect the method of operation and profitability of broker-dealers. The SEC and the SROs conduct regular examinations of our broker-dealer subsidiaries and also initiate targeted and other specific inquiries from time to time, which generally include the investigation of issues involving substantial portions of the securities industry. The SEC and the SROs may conduct administrative proceedings, and the SEC may initiate litigation in federal court, either of which can result in censures, fines, suspension, or expulsion of a broker-dealer, its officers, or employees. The principal purpose of regulation and discipline of broker-dealers is the protection of customers and the securities markets rather than the protection of creditors and stockholders of broker-dealers. The US Department of Justice and state criminal authorities may also investigate activities of broker-dealers and institute criminal or civil proceedings against broker-dealers for violations of applicable law.
NSC is subject to the Securities Investor Protection Act and is a member of Securities Investors Protection Corporation (“SIPC”), whose primary function is to provide financial protection for the customers of failing brokerage firms. SIPC provides protection for customers up to $500,000, of which a maximum of $250,000 may be in cash.
Margin lending by NSC is subject to the margin rules of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and FINRA. Under such rules, NSC is limited in the amount it may lend in connection with certain purchases of securities and is also required to impose certain maintenance requirements on the amount of securities and cash held in margin accounts. In addition, NSC may impose more restrictive margin requirements than required by such rules.

Net Capital Rule
In addition, as a registered broker-dealer and a member of FINRA, NSC is subject to the SEC’s Uniform Net Capital Rule 15c3-1 (the “Net Capital Rule”), which is designed to measure the general financial integrity and liquidity of a broker-dealer and requires, among other things, the maintenance of minimum net capital. Net capital is defined as the net worth of a broker-dealer subject to certain adjustments that exclude assets not readily convertible into cash. Additionally, the regulations require that certain assets, such as a broker-dealer’s position in securities, be valued in a conservative manner so as to avoid overstating of the broker-dealer’s net capital.

In February 2015, pursuant to a directive from FINRA, NSC reverted back to using the alternative method of computing net capital from the aggregate indebtedness method. At September 30, 2019, NSC had net capital of $5,887,912, which was $4,887,912 in excess of its required minimum net capital of $1,000,000. 
NSC is exempt from the provisions of the SEC’s Customer Protection Rule 15c3-3 (the “Customer Protection Rule”), since NSC is an introducing broker-dealer that clears all transactions on a fully disclosed basis and promptly transmits all customer funds and securities to clearing brokers. 

8

Tax Preparation
Our tax preparation business is also subject to extensive regulation. Federal legislation requires income tax return preparers to, among other things, register as a tax preparer, set forth their signatures and identification numbers on all tax returns prepared by them, and retain all tax returns prepared by them for three years. Federal laws also subject income tax preparers to accuracy-related penalties in connection with the preparation of income tax returns. Preparers may be prohibited from further acting as income tax return preparers if they continuously and repeatedly engage in specified misconduct. In addition, authorized IRS e-filer providers are required to comply with certain rules and regulations, as per IRS Publication 1345 and other notices of the IRS applicable to e-filing.

IRS regulations require among other things, that all tax return preparers use a Preparer Tax Identification Number (“PTIN”) as their identifying number on federal tax returns filed after December 31, 2010, to be authorized to practice before the IRS. As a prerequisite to obtaining or renewing a PTIN, the PTIN applicants allow the IRS to conduct tax compliance checks and identify the individuals who are considered “tax return preparers”. The IRS also conducts background checks on PTIN applicants.
Other Regulations
We are also subject to the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 (the “Patriot Act”), which imposes obligations regarding the prevention and detection of money-laundering activities, including the establishment of customer due diligence, customer verification and other compliance policies and procedures. The conduct of research analysts is also the subject of rule-making by the SEC, FINRA, and the federal government through the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. These regulations require certain disclosures by, and restrict the activities of, research analysts and broker-dealers, among others. Failure to comply with these requirements may result in monetary, regulatory and, in the case of the USA Patriot Act, criminal penalties.
Our asset management subsidiaries, NAM, is a SEC-registered investment adviser and is accordingly subject to regulation by the SEC. Requirements under the Investment Advisors Act of 1940 include record-keeping, advertising and operating requirements, as well as prohibitions on fraudulent activities.
Various regulators, including the SEC, FINRA and state securities regulators and attorneys general, are conducting both targeted and industry-wide investigations of certain practices relating to the financial services industry, including marketing, sales practices, valuation practices, asset managers, and market and compensation arrangements. These investigations have involved mutual fund companies, broker-dealers, hedge funds, investors and others.
In addition, the SEC staff has conducted studies with respect to soft dollar practices in the brokerage and asset management industries and proposed interpretive guidance regarding the scope of permitted brokerage and research services in connection with soft dollar practices.

The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and related Federal Trade Commission regulations require us to adopt and disclose customer privacy policies.

Application of Laws and Rules to Internet Business and Other Online Services

Due to the increasing popularity and use of the Internet and other online services, various regulatory authorities are considering laws and/or regulations with respect to the Internet or other online services covering issues such as user privacy, pricing, content copyrights and quality of services. In addition, the growth and development of the market for online commerce may prompt more stringent consumer protection laws that may impose additional burdens on those companies conducting business online. When the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), were enacted, such acts did not contemplate the conduct of a securities business through the Internet and other online services. The recent increase in the number of complaints by online traders could lead to more stringent regulations of online trading firms and their practices by the SEC, FINRA and other regulatory agencies.

Although the SEC, in releases and no-action letters, has provided guidance on various issues related to the offer and sale of securities and the conduct of a securities business through the Internet, the application of the laws to the conduct of a securities business through the Internet continues to evolve. Furthermore, the applicability to the Internet and other online services of existing laws in various jurisdictions governing issues such as property ownership, sales and other taxes and personal privacy is uncertain and may take years to resolve. Uncertainty regarding these issues may adversely affect the viability and profitability of our business.

As our services through our subsidiaries are available over the Internet in multiple jurisdictions and we have numerous clients residing in these jurisdictions, these jurisdictions may claim that our subsidiaries are required to qualify to do business as a foreign corporation in each such jurisdiction. While NSC is currently registered as broker-dealer in the jurisdictions described in this report, all of our subsidiaries are qualified to do business as corporations in only a few international jurisdictions. Failure to qualify as an out-of-state or foreign corporation in a jurisdiction where we are required to do so could subject us to taxes and penalties for the failure to qualify.

Seasonality and Backlog

Other than our tax preparation business, we are not subject to significant seasonal fluctuations, and there are no material backlogs in our business. Because most tax returns are filed during the period from February through April of each year, most revenues from our tax preparation and related services and products will be earned during this period.
Research and Development and Environmental Matters

We did not incur any research and development expenses during the last three fiscal years. We do not incur any significant costs or experience any significant effects as a result of compliance with federal, state and local environmental laws.
