Item 1. Business
 
Standex International Corporation and subsidiaries ("we," "us," "our," the "Company" and "Standex" is a diversified industrial manufacturer with leading positions in a variety of products and services that are used in diverse commercial and industrial markets. Headquartered in Salem, New Hampshire, we have seven operating segments aggregated into five reportable segments: Electronics, Engraving, Scientific, Engineering Technologies, and Specialty Solutions. Three operating segments are aggregated into Specialty Solutions. Our businesses work in close partnership with our customers to deliver custom solutions or engineered components that solve their unique and specific needs, an approach we call "Customer Intimacy."
 
Standex was incorporated in 1975 and is the successor of a corporation organized in 1955. We have paid dividends each quarter since Standex became a public corporation in November 1964. Overall management, strategic development and financial control are led by the executive staff at our corporate headquarters. Our growth strategy is focused on four key areas: (1) Increasing our presence in rapidly growing markets and applications (2) executing new product development in both core and adjacent market applications; (3) expanding geographically where meaningful business opportunities exist; and (4) undertaking strategically aligned acquisitions that strengthen and/or expand these core businesses. We direct our investments towards markets with long term, secular growth prospects such as renewable energy, electric vehicles, smart power grid, military and defense and life sciences. 
 
Unless otherwise noted, references to years are to fiscal years. Currently our fiscal year end is June 30. Our fiscal year 2022 includes the twelve-month period from July 1, 2021 to June 30, 2022.

Our long-term business strategy is to create, improve, and enhance shareholder value by building more profitable, focused industrial platforms through our Standex Value Creation System. This methodology employs four components: Balanced Performance Plan, Growth Disciplines, Operational Excellence, and Talent Management and provides both a company-wide framework and tools used to achieve our goals. We intend to continue investing organically and inorganically in high margin and growth businesses using this balanced and proven approach.
 
It is our objective to grow larger and more profitable business units through both organic and inorganic initiatives. We have a particular focus on identifying and investing in opportunities that complement our products and will increase the overall scale, global presence and capabilities of our businesses.  We recently established an innovation and technology function focused on accelerating new, longer-term growth opportunities for emerging technologies, including our ongoing development project with a global renewable energy company. We continue to execute on acquisitions where strategically aligned with our businesses and where the opportunity meets our investment metrics. We have divested, and likely will continue to divest, businesses that we feel are not strategic or do not meet our growth and return expectations.
 
The Company’s strong historical cash flow has been a cornerstone for funding our capital allocation strategy.  We use cash flow generated from operations to fund investments in capital assets to upgrade our facilities, improve productivity and lower costs, invest in the strategic growth programs described above, including organic and inorganic growth, and to return cash to our shareholders through payment of dividends and stock buybacks.

Standex competes on the basis of Customer Intimacy in which our teams work as extensions of our customers organizations to apply our expertise and technology to address needs with customer solutions.
International Operations
 
International operations are conducted at 41 locations, in Europe, Canada, China, Japan, India, Southeast Asia, Korea, Mexico, Brazil, and South Africa.

We develop and design new products to meet customer needs in order to offer enhanced products or to provide customized solutions for customers. Developing new and improved products, broadening the application of established products, and continuing efforts to improve our methods, processes, and equipment continues to drive our success. However, due to the nature of our manufacturing operations and the types of products manufactured, expenditures for research and development are not significant to any individual segment or in the aggregate. Research and development costs are quantified in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
