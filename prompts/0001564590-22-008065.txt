Overview
 Ultra Clean Holdings, Inc., (“UCT”, the “Company” or “We”) is a leading developer and supplier of critical subsystems, components, parts, and ultra-high purity cleaning and analytical services primarily for the semiconductor industry. UCT offers its customers an integrated outsourced solution for major subassemblies, improved design-to-delivery cycle times, design for manufacturability, prototyping and part and component manufacturing, as well as tool chamber parts cleaning and coating, and micro-contamination analytical services. We report results for two operating segments: Products and Services (formerly known as “SPS” and “SSB”, respectively). Our Products segment primarily designs, engineers and manufactures production tools, components and parts, and modules and subsystems for the semiconductor and display capital equipment markets. Products include chemical delivery modules, frame assemblies, gas delivery systems, fluid delivery systems, precision robotics, process modules as well as other high-level assemblies. Our Services segment provides ultra-high purity parts cleaning, process tool part recoating, surface encapsulation and high sensitivity micro contamination analysis primarily for the semiconductor device makers and wafer fabrication equipment (“WFE”) markets. 
 We ship a majority of our products and provide most of our services to U.S. registered customers with locations both in and outside the U.S. In addition to U.S. manufacturing and service operations, we manufacture products and provide parts cleaning and other related services in our Asian, Europe and Middle East (“EMEA”) facilities to support local and U.S. based customers. We conduct our operating activities primarily through our subsidiaries. 
 Over the long-term, we believe the semiconductor market we serve will continue to grow due to multi-year industry demand from a broad range of drivers including mobile demand driven by 5G, new CPU architectures that enable higher performance servers, necessary for cloud, artificial intelligence (“AI”) and Machine Learning applications. We also believe that semiconductor original equipment manufacturers (“OEM”) are increasingly relying on partners like UCT to fulfill their expanding capacity requirements. Additionally, our Services business is benefiting as device manufacturers rely on precision cleaning and coating to manufacture ever more complex devices.
 On March 31, 2021, we completed the acquisition of Ham-Let (Israel-Canada) Ltd. (“Ham-Let” or “Fluid Solutions”), a public company organized under the laws of the State of Israel (not a U.S. registrant), pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger, for approximately $362.9 million. Ham-Let engages in the development, manufacturing and marketing of innovative control valves, fittings, and hoses for the control and monitoring of industrial systems in a variety of markets, including the Semiconductor market. These products are primarily used in ultra clean gas delivery systems as well as other systems for the transmission of liquids and gases. The Company’s primary reason for this acquisition was to broaden UCT’s relevance to the semiconductor equipment market and to provide access to a new set of customers in the semiconductor fab infrastructure market.
 During April 2021, we completed an underwritten public offering of 3.7 million shares of our common stock, for which we received net proceeds of $192.8 million, after deducting the underwriting discounts and offering expenses.  We intend to use the net proceeds from this offering for general corporate purposes, which may include

Customers
 We sell our products and services primarily to customers in the semiconductor capital equipment and semiconductor integrated device manufacturing industries, and we also sell to the display, consumer, medical, energy, industrial, and research equipment industries. 
 The majority of our total revenues comes from the semiconductor capital equipment industry (OEM customers), which is highly concentrated, so we are therefore highly dependent upon a small number of customers. Our two largest revenue customers in fiscal years 2021, 2020 and 2019 were Applied Materials, Inc. and Lam Research Corporation, each of which accounted for more than 10.0% of our total revenues in fiscal years 2021, 2020 and 2019. As a group, our respective year’s top two customers accounted for 64.0%, 67.1% and 66.9% of the Company’s revenues for fiscal years 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. 
 Approximately 91.0% of our total revenues for the fiscal year 2021 came from multiple segments of the semiconductor industry, which include IDM, Foundry, OEM, and sub-tier suppliers. 
 We have successfully been qualified as a supplier of equipment, cleaning, coating and analytical services with each of our customers who require such qualifications. This lengthy qualification process typically involves the inspection and audit of our facilities and evaluation by our customers of our engineering, documentation, manufacturing and quality control processes and procedures. Our customers generally place orders with suppliers who have met and continue to meet their qualification criteria.
 Customer Business Management
 We sell and support our products and services through our Customer Business Management organization. Our customer relationship directors are responsible for establishing sales strategy and setting the objectives for specific customer accounts. Each customer relationship manager is dedicated to a specific customer account and is responsible for maintaining strong working relationships with that customer, and in many cases provide on-site support. OEM Customer relationship managers often attend customers’ internal meetings related to production and engineering design and quality to ensure that customer expectations are interpreted and communicated properly to our operations group. Customer relationship managers also work with our customers to identify and meet their cost and design-to-delivery cycle time objectives. Our IDM Customer relationship managers work with process tool owners and Fab maintenance managers relating to the development and validation of cleaning recipes, addressing new tools cleaning and analytical requirements, and optimizing cleaning processes and analytical testing requirements to support node transitions.
 We have dedicated new business development managers for both our product and service businesses. Our new business development managers initiate and develop long-term, multilevel customer relationships and work closely with them on new business opportunities. Our customer relationship organization includes technical sales support for order placement, spare parts quotes, production status updates as well as service and maintenance contracts and analysis business. We have a technical relationship representative located at most of our facilities. 
 We integrate new business wins into our facilities via a rigorous product transition process, working in concert with our customers to ensure all production, cleaning and/or test requirements are identified, documented, and validated. We employ the same process at all our sites, enabling products and service offerings to smoothly transition into and between our sites as needed to support customer demand. 
 In addition, we have developed an overall service and support infrastructure to provide our customers with service and support 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Our dedicated global field service engineers provide customer support through the performance of on-site installation, servicing and repair.
 Technology Development
 We engage in ongoing technology development efforts to remain a leader for gas delivery systems and to further develop our expertise in other critical subsystems. We work closely with our customers to identify and anticipate changes and trends in next-generation equipment. We participate in customer technology partnership programs that focus on process application requirements for gas and liquid delivery systems and other critical subsystems. These 
 7


development efforts are designed to meet specific customer requirements in the areas of subsystem design, materials, component selection and functionality. Our technology development group also works directly with our suppliers to help them identify new component technologies and make necessary changes in, and enhancements to, the components that we integrate into our products. Our analytical and testing capabilities enable us to evaluate multiple supplier component technologies and provide our customers with a wide range of appropriate component and design choices for their gas delivery systems and other critical subsystems.
 Our analytical and testing capabilities also help us anticipate technological changes and requirements in component features for our core next-generation gas delivery systems and other critical subsystems. We are continuously developing additional features to improve the performance and functionality of these subsystems. Our technology development activities for next-generation gas delivery and other critical subsystems are performed in Hayward, CA and Israel.
 We also engage in ongoing technology development to maintain technological leadership in the cleaning, coating and analytical markets. Our Services business works closely with customers to identify and anticipate changes that will be required in next-generation equipment. UCT’s technical capability is becoming extremely critical and differentiated to ensure high wafer yields and throughput as geometries shrink and density increases. Our Services business development activities are performed primarily in Hillsboro, OR, Phoenix, AZ, Israel and South Korea. 
 Intellectual Property
 Our success depends in part on our ability to maintain and protect our proprietary technology and to conduct our business without infringing the proprietary rights of others. Both our products and services businesses largely depend upon our design, engineering, manufacturing, testing, cleaning, coating and analytical know-how. We also rely on a combination of trade secrets and confidentiality provisions, and to a much lesser extent, patents, copyrights and trademarks, to protect our proprietary rights. We have 131 patents with various expiration dates and intellectual property that we develop on behalf of our customers is generally owned exclusively by those customers.
 We require our employees, suppliers, customers and potential business partners to enter into confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements before we disclose to them any sensitive or proprietary information regarding our products, technology or business plans. We require employees to assign to us proprietary information, inventions and other intellectual property they create, modify or improve.
 Competition
 Our industry is highly fragmented. When we compete for new business, we face competition from other suppliers of gas delivery systems, critical subsystems, parts and components, cleaning and analytical services, as well as the internal manufacturing and services groups of our customers. Customers that have elected to outsource their gas delivery systems and other critical subsystems including cleaning and analytics, could elect in the future to develop and manufacture these subsystems internally, leading to further competition.
 Our principal competitor for gas delivery systems is Ichor Systems, Inc., and our principal competitors for other critical subsystems are Flex Ltd., Foxsemicon Integrated Technology Inc., Jabil, Inc., Sanmina Corporation, Fujikin Incorporated, VDL ETG and Celestica Inc. For our gas delivery component solutions our principal competitors are Swagelok, Parker Hannifin, and Watlow. For our services, cleaning and coating offerings, our main competitors in the US are Pentagon Technologies and Cleanpart, and in South Korea, KoMiCo. For analytical services our primary competitors are Balazs (an Air Liquide company) and Cerium Labs. Some of these competitors have substantially greater financial, technical, manufacturing and marketing resources than we do. We expect our competitors to continue to improve the performance of their current products and to introduce new products or new technologies that could adversely affect sales of our current and future products. 
 The limited number of potential customers in our industry further intensifies competition. The primary competitive factors in our industry are quality, meeting customer timeline demands, price, technology, design-to-delivery cycle time, customer qualification approvals, the development of product recipes for cleaning and analytics and historical customer relationships. We anticipate that increased competitive pressures will cause intensified price-based competition and we may have to reduce the prices of our products. In addition, we expect to face new competitors as we enter new markets.

Governmental Regulation and Environmental Matters
 Our operations are subject to federal, state and local regulatory requirements and foreign laws relating to environmental, waste management and health and safety matters, including measures relating to the release, use, storage, treatment, transportation, discharge, disposal and remediation of contaminants, hazardous substances and waste, as well as practices and procedures applicable to the construction and operation of our UCT facilities.
 In 2020, UCT committed to a program titled “SuCCESS2030” designed to enhance the Company’s sustainability vision through its supply chain. UCT will endeavor to identify and coordinate efforts and develop capabilities to ensure its suppliers operate in an ethical, responsible, and sustainable manner. The goal is to build a responsible and sustainable end-to-end supply chain for the future of semiconductors.
 UCT participates in the Responsible Business Alliance’s Responsible Minerals Assurance Process for Tantalum. Our cleaning processes for tantalum-deposited parts recovers the tantalum, enabling it to re-enter the commodity market and reduce the demand for mined material, the majority of which originates from the Conflict Region in Africa. 
 Although cleaning is a chemical-intensive business, UCT, where possible, utilizes chemical-free processing to remove significant volumes of deposited material. Reduction in the volume of film being chemically removed reduces the amount of chemicals used to meet the target cleanliness specifications.
 The semiconductor industry has stringent packaging requirements which include the need to maintain the cleanliness of a part/system while providing structural support of heavy modules. These requirements may necessitate the  design and fabrication of product-specific crates or the use of plastic cleanroom boxes. To minimize packaging waste UCT has implemented re-use programs for these type of materials with our customers and suppliers. 
 Our past or future operations may result in injury or claims of injury by employees or the public which may result in material costs and liabilities to us. Although some risk of costs and liabilities related to these matters is inherent in our business, we believe that our business is in compliance with applicable US and international regulations and laws. However, new, modified or more stringent requirements or enforcement policies could be adopted by governmental agencies, which could affect us.
 Employees and Human Capital
 As of December 31, 2021, we had 7,066 employees, of which 1,206 were temporary. Of our total employees, there were 120 in engineering, 21 in technology development, 335 in sales and support, 4,529 in direct manufacturing, 1,395 in indirect manufacturing and 491 in administrative and executive functions. These figures include 3,137 employees in Asia and 1,537 employees in EMEA. None of our employees are represented by a labor union and we have not experienced any work stoppages.
 UCT believes that its employees are its most important assets. The Company has a long history of embracing diversity, multiculturalism and belonging and is reinforcing a culture of inclusion by committing to even greater transparency, clearer targets and comprehensive training to improve diversity and inclusion within the company to ensure every employee is treated with dignity and respect. The ultimate goal is to foster an atmosphere of acceptance, inclusion, trust and of mutual respect for all. To reach that goal, UCT provides mandatory practical and continuous education to all employees on behavioral expectations.
 We believe that UCT’s success depends on our ability to attract, develop and retain key personnel. We believe that the skills, experience and industry knowledge of our key employees significantly benefit our operations and performance. The Company strives to provide fair and equal opportunity for career development and advancement to all its employees. UCT offers competitive rewards, compensation and benefits, including an Employee Stock Purchase Plan, healthcare and retirement benefits, parental and family leave, adoption credits, holiday and paid time off, and tuition assistance. Ensuring employee health and safety in the workplace is one of our core values. The COVID-19 pandemic has further reinforced the importance of keeping our employees safe and healthy. In response to the pandemic, we have taken actions aligned with the World Health Organization and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in an effort to protect our workforce so they can more safely and effectively perform their work.

UCT uses its annual operating plan and industry growth projections to determine the appropriate level of staffing requirements. Staffing levels are aligned and adjusted on occasion throughout the year to ensure UCT meets its customer obligations, in line with any changes in demand, to ensure business continuity. 
 
Social Responsibility
 
UCT believes that social responsibility is defined as “positively impacting society by ensuring the people we work with are safe and treated with dignity and respect, and by being a good neighbor in the communities in which we operate ”. UCT applies its core values to employee engagement inside and outside the Company. Positively involving employees and giving back to communities is central to UCT’s culture. Supported by the Company, UCT employees contribute directly to the community with their time and resources. In 2021, UCT organized and conducted 45 events designed to give back and support its communities.
