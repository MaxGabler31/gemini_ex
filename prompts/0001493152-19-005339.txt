ITEM 1. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS.
 
This Report contains summaries of the material terms of various agreements executed in connection with the transactions described herein. The summaries of these agreements are subject to, and are qualified in their entirety by reference to, these agreements, all of which are incorporated herein by reference.
 
Overview of Business
 
We are focused on (i) acquiring facilities and licenses in states that permit medical cannabis, in order to operate cannabis cultivation and processing facilities, and (ii) the research, design, development and manufacturing of advanced, energy efficient indoor horticulture lighting, plant nutrient products, and ancillary equipment. Our vision is to apply the latest advances in high efficiency lighting and controls technology as well as effective manufacturing techniques to deliver highly differentiated lighting and nutrient products with clear benefits at competitive prices to the greenhouse and indoor horticulture markets.
 
In 2018, we acquired YLK Partners AZ, LLC, or YLK Partners, an Arizona-based company to provide turn-key services for the management, administration, and operation of a medical marijuana cultivation and processing facility. YLK has a cultivation management services agreement, or the Management Agreement, with an Arizona licensee, or the Arizona Licensee, that was entered into on January 5, 2018.
 
Our subsidiary, Solis Tek, Inc., a California corporation, was formed in June of 2010. Its operations consist of designing, developing and sourcing of a line of Solis Tek Digital Ballasts intended for use in high intensity lighting systems used for horticulture. An electrical ballast is a device intended to limit the amount of current in an electric circuit. A familiar and widely used example is the inductive ballast used in fluorescent lamps, which limits the current through the tube, which would otherwise rise to destructive levels due to the tube’s negative resistance characteristic. Since the commencement of operations, our product line has evolved from digital ballasts to a line of lighting products including a line of specialty ballasts ranging from 400 watts to 1,000 watts with various features, our Lamp Products, a line of reflectors, high intensity lighting accessories and a new line of LED lighting technologies.
 
Cannabis Cultivation and Processing Management Services
 
In 2018, we acquired YLK Partners to provide turn-key services to other companies in the cannabis industry, whereby we handle the management, administration, and operation of a medical marijuana cultivation and processing facility. The Arizona Licensee is authorized to operate a medical marijuana dispensary, one (1) onsite facility and one (1) offsite facility, to produce, sell and dispense medical marijuana and manufactured and derivative products that contain marijuana pursuant to Title 9; Chapter 17 of the Arizona Department of Health Services, or AZDHS, Medical Marijuana Program and Arizona Revised Statute § 36-2801 et seq., as amended from time to time. Pursuant to the Management Agreement, YLK will provide the management services for the offsite facility, on behalf of the Arizona Licensee.
 
On April 2, 2019, we acquired, through our wholly-owned subsidiary Extracting Point, LLC, or Extracting Point, the real property located at 2601 West Holly Street in Phoenix, Arizona, or the Arizona Facility, for $3,500,000. The Arizona Facility holds the approval and authorization for a Conditional Use Permit, which allows the Arizona Facility to be used for the operation of a cultivation and infusion facility, allowing for the cultivation, harvesting, preparation, packaging and storing of medical cannabis, as well as extraction, refinement, infusion, production, preparation, packaging, and storage of manufactured and derivative oils, waxes, concentrates, edible and non-edible products that contain cannabis.
 
We anticipate having this facility operational and cash flow positive by the second quarter of 2020, after the completion of the design, permitting and construction buildout. We are currently sourcing the additional capital needed to fund the construction and purchase of the necessary equipment for the buildout of the Arizona Facility. We are actively looking for additional opportunities to replicate this business model in other legal medical and adult use states.

Indoor Lighting Industry
 
Light and plant growth
 
Light is essential for plant growth. Natural sunlight is the cheapest source available, but for horticulture it is not always attainable in sufficient quantities due to weather and other climate challenges. Therefore, the uses of artificial or alternative light sources have become very common in order to increase production and quality predominantly in indoor or greenhouse environments. Plants have a completely different sensitivity to light spectrum than humans. Every plant has their own sensitivity and receptivity for colors and intensity of light. Using these alternate light sources for plants, effective light recipes are essential to obtain the optimal results in plant production.
 
Grow lights
 
A grow light or plant light is an artificial light source, generally an electric light, designed to stimulate plant growth by emitting an electromagnetic spectrum appropriate for photosynthesis. Grow lights are used in applications where there is either no naturally occurring light, or where supplemental light is required. For example, in the winter months when the available hours of daylight may be insufficient for the desired plant growth, lights are used to extend the time the plants receive light.
 
Grow lights either attempt to provide a light spectrum similar to that of the sun, or to provide a spectrum that is more tailored to the needs of the plants being cultivated. Outdoor conditions are mimicked with varying color, temperatures and spectral outputs from the grow light, as well as varying the lumen output (intensity) and PAR output of the lamps. Depending on the type of plant being cultivated, the stage of cultivation (e.g., the germination/vegetative phase or the flowering/fruiting phase), and the photoperiod required by the plants, specific ranges of spectrum, luminous efficacy and color temperature are desirable for use with specific plants and time periods.
 
Specially designed artificial light sources can improve diverse growth parameters. These all depends on several factors, like crop, environmental circumstances, light recipe and many more. The following is a list of benefits that can be achieved with specially designed artificial lighting:
 

● | Increased production and yield 
--+-------------------------------------------------
● | Increased aromatic flavor and higher potency 
● | Shortening of the total growth cycle 
● | Better plant uniformity 
● | Better space utility 
● | Improved plant quality 
● | Energy savings 
● | Better germination rate 
● | Higher multiplication factor 
● | Higher survival rate in rooting 
● | Improved/controlled stretching process 
● | Accelerated hardening phase 

Hydroponics
 
The great majority of our customers are retailers that specialize in Hydroponics and sell our products to Hydroponic enclosed farm and grower operators. Hydroponics is a method of growing plants in mineral nutrient solutions, in water, without soil. Terrestrial plants may be grown with their roots in the mineral nutrient solution only or in an inert medium, such as polite, gravel, expanded clay pebbles or coconut husks.

-


Some of the reasons why hydroponics is being adapted around the world for plant production are the following:
 

● | No soil is needed for hydroponics. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | The water stays in the system and can be reused - thus, a lower water requirement. 
● | It is possible to control the nutrition levels in their entirety; thus, lower nutrition requirements. 
● | No nutrition pollution is released into the environment because of the controlled system. 
● | Stable and high yields. 
● | Pests and diseases are easier to get rid of than in soil because of the container’s mobility. 
● | Ease of harvesting. 
● | No pesticide damage. 

Our Business Strategy
 
Due to the expected increase in the number of States where the use of cannabis, both for medical and recreational use is being legalized, we intend to take advantage of what we believe is our premium brand image within the cannabis farming and growing community. We believe that as participation in the cannabis farming industry grows, in order to supply increasing demand caused by legalization, our Solis Tek brand equipment will be sought out by existing and new cannabis farms and commercial businesses. Our strategy is to maintain and increase our market share by expanding our marketing efforts and by introducing new and improved lighting technology to help the industry become more efficient. In addition, we have started to market and sell a new line of plant nutrients and fertilizers through Zelda to help expand our market reach and maximize our revenue potential. Additionally, we are aggressively pursuing opportunities within the cannabis sector for expansion of our product offerings, or compatible opportunities to represent other products to the retail and commercial trade.
Products
 
We sell our products primarily to retailers in the United States and international markets who specialize in hydroponic horticulture. Currently, we have approximately 500 retail stores in the United States as well as various ecommerce websites that sell our products. We have four full time sales employees and three wholesale distributors who cover U.S., Canada, Spain and the United Kingdom for both retail customers as well as commercial growers in cannabis legal states and countries.
 
We believe that almost all of the end users that use our products are using the equipment for the growing of cannabis. However, our products can be, and are used for, the hydroponic and indoor growing of other horticultural products, such as hothouse vegetables, decorative plant nurseries, indoor aquariums, and industrial painting facilities. We intend to continue to expand and improve our products for use in as many applications as possible and to market our products to the entire indoor horticultural industry as well as other industrial applications that require artificial lighting.
 
Digital Lighting Controller
 
The Solis Tek Digital Lighting Controller is a temperature monitoring control system which was specifically designed for commercial cultivation. A single controller can run up to 300 lights with 150 lights per zone and contains such features integrated temperature sensors, custom sunrise and sunset modes, data log tracking, and cloud cover simulation. The controller has been rigorously tested in multiple garden environments and has been specifically designed for both commercial grows and large gardens. The data log tracks garden activity and events with options to run up to two independent light zones, each with their own customized sunrise, sunset, and cloud modes. The controller includes high temperature auto-dim and shut off prevention systems to prevent systems overheating.
Ballasts
 
Ballasts provide the proper starting voltage, operating voltage and current to the lamp to initiate and sustain its arc. High Intensity Discharge (HID) lamps have negative resistance, which causes them to draw an increasing amount of current; hence, they require a current-limiting device. The ballast provides the following functions:
 
It provides starting voltage and, in some cases, ignition pulses. All ballasts must provide some specific minimum voltage to ignite the lamp. In the case of pulse start lamps, an additional high voltage pulse is needed to ionize the gases within the lamp. These pulses are superimposed near the peak starting voltage waveform; it regulates the lamp’s current and power. The ballast limits the current through the lamp once it has started. The ballast’s current is set to a level that delivers the proper power to the lamp. In addition, the ballast regulates the lamp’s current through the range of typical line voltage variations, thereby keeping the lamp’s power fairly stable to maximize the lamp’s life and performance and; it provides appropriate sustaining voltage and current wave shape to achieve the lamp’s rated life. The ballast provides sufficient voltage to sustain the lamp as it ages. Solis Tek ballasts come in a variety of voltage settings to conform to the consumer needs.

Solis Tek Digital Ballasts were designed to work with our exclusive “Ignition Control” sequential lamp ignition, and “SenseSmart”, self- diagnostic safety systems. Solis Tek Digital Ballasts are software based, that makes our ballasts more versatile and enables us to incorporate special features such as sequential ballast ignition technology and SenseSmart technologies that ignites metal halide lamps one at a time based on load stability. Ignition Control is a main feature of our ballasts that comes as a standard feature in all of our ballasts. The exclusive Ignition Control assures that no matter how many lamps are contained in a lighting array attached to one power source, only one lamp will turn on at a predetermined time. This technology (not a randomized ignition startup) detects the voltage and amperage frequencies of the electrical circuit and ignites an array of metal halide or sodium lamps when the load for each lamp is most stable. The use of our technology prevents surges and spikes in electrical environment in which an array of ballasts operates and also prevents the overloading of circuit breakers.
 
Our SenseSmart self-diagnosing system feature enables our ballasts to internally safety check for over/under voltage, overheating, open circuits, short circuits and more. SenseSmart will recognize an unsafe condition and take pre-determined actions to alleviate the safety issue.
 
We offer a line of remote ballasts that include: 400W 120/240V, 600W 120/240V, 1000W 120/240V, 1000W 120/240V with remote control and timer, 1000W 240V only, and 1000W 277V.
 
A1 1000W Complete Fixture
 
Beginning in 2015, we introduced a new A1 complete fixture equipped with ballast, reflector, and double ended lamp.
 
Digital Lamps
 
Metal halide lamps are a type of HID (High Intensity Discharge) lamp; mercury vapor and high-pressure sodium lamps are also HID lamps. Light is generated by creating an arc between the two electrodes located inside the inner arc tube. The inner arc tube is typically made of quartz, and this is a very harsh environment, with high temperatures approaching 1000°C and pressures of 3 or 4 atmospheres. To start a metal halide lamp, a high starting voltage is applied to the lamp’s electrodes to ionize the gas before current can flow and start the lamp.
 
Solis Tek Digital Lamps are designed to be specifically tuned and matched with Solis Tek Digital Ballasts. Our lamps feature color enhanced full balanced spectrums, prolonged lamp life, less depreciation of lumen output over time, and precise gas combinations for increased blues, reds, and ultra violet output. Our Lamps emit a full spectrum of light tuned specifically for particular types of plants. As well, our lamps provide ample Ultra Violet light that plants thrive upon. We have designed our lamps using special low iron glass envelopes so as to prevent the blockage of the full spectrum of light that our lamps are designed to provide. Using Solis Tek lamps, growers can expect superior photo-chemical reactions, proper UV balance, advanced HID lamp designed especially for plant growth, plant quality, and plant yield.
 
We offer a select variety of light color spectrums in both High Pressure Sodium (HPS), Metal Halides (MH), and Ceramic Metal Halides (CMH).
 
LED Technology
 
In 2018, Solis Tek Digital Lighting launched its propriety LED (light emitting diode) lighting solution called the B9. LED lighting supports sustainable design in several ways. It uses less energy than most other types of lamps, produces less heat, lasts longer (which means less frequent replacement and therefore reduced waste), is mercury-free, and is housed in special semi-conductor “chips” designed for easier configuration, disassembly, and recycling.
 
In our ongoing research and development program, we have designed and are developing our next generation of high intensity lighting. Our LED technology, unlike other LED lighting sources, uses an advanced UV (Ultra Violet) diode phosphor combination to make our high intensity LED based lighting systems. Our LED systems should be available in the same light spectrums as our current HID lamps. Our design will emit lighting equivalent to the high-pressure sodium spectrum and ultra-violet spectrums and eliminate the inadequacies of current LED offerings to the horticultural industry i.e.: a) low intensity; b) lack of proper spectrum for particular plants; and c) longevity. Our LED “chips” will provide, from one LED, a full spectrum of light that mimics sunlight, as compared to other LED manufacturers of LEDs who provide arrays of several color specific LEDs in an attempt to cover the full light spectrum.

LED lighting produces significantly less heat than conventional HID and HPS lamps, so growers can control their greenhouse climate more accurately. Less heat also means more effective use of light, for example by increasing light levels, extending lighting periods, or by using LED light in greenhouses on warmer days without having to ventilate. Less heat also means you can place the light source closer to plants, reducing light loss.
 
Solis Tek Reflectors
 
Our line of “Reflectors” is designed for use with our digital ballasts and lamps. However, they additionally have standard sockets so that lamps and ballasts manufactured by others may also be used. Each Reflector features air cooling, heavily tinned wiring, low iron glass for less filtering of light, and utilize highly reflective aluminum to reflect light in the desired direction.
 
We offer five different variations and sizes of Reflectors.
 
Plant Nutrients and Fertilizers
 
Zelda has developed “Terpenez™” which is a proprietary product formulated from all organic botanical extracts and is designed to assist plants with processes associated with oil and resin production. Terpenez is all natural and has organic inputs aimed at enhancing the aromatics of cannabis cultivation. Zelda commenced test marketing Terpenez in late 2016 and had rolled out the product regionally across the USA in 2017.
 
Terpenez, the first product in our launch into the approximately $32 billion nutrient/additive sector of the greenhouse and growing business, leads a new class of horticultural products aimed at enhancing the cannabis aromatic experience and intensity. It does not contain cannabis derived terpenes within, instead it is made from the finest natural components available and is specifically formulated to assist the cannabis plant with processes associated with oil and resin production and naturally enhances the cannabis plant’s terpene profile. The formula provides essential oil-bearing plants with both precursors (i.e. metabolic building blocks, trace elements, etc.) and readily available bio-identical plant compounds aiming to increase overall essential oil production and intensity. It is the first product of its kind to deliver plant nutrients to cannabis cultivating customers with a fully plant derived 0-0-0 (Nitrogen, Phosphate, and Potassium free) product. Independent bioanalytical testing laboratory analysis was conducted and determined the level of heavy metals to be below the EPA’s detection limit. Terpenez is used to increase the value of cannabis crops through the intensification of oil production, which has results in a significant improvement in flavor and aroma. Terpenez is unique to our family of products in that it is intended for daily use as a nutrient additive to the cannabis grow, and is available through the over 500+ retail hydroponic stores and online retailers throughout the USA and Europe.
 
We plan to extensively develop additional nutrient products within the Zelda line and expect these products to flourish in an environment of lighter regulatory controls at both the State and Federal level. We are under discussion to additionally add to the product line via custom blending in third-party laboratories under our proprietary formulations.
 
Additionally, we signed an exclusive Distributor Agreement in March 2018 with Torus Hydro, a California based manufacturer of a pH stabilizer that automatically balances the pH of a hydroponic nutrient feed. Their proprietary capsule keeps the ideal range of pH in a growers feed system for optimal nutrient absorption. This capsule uses next generation ionization technology to eliminate pH swing that inhibits plant growth and weakens the plants immune system. We believe this is the perfect “razor and blades model”, since a customer who purchases the capsule will necessarily need to repurchase the complementary recharging solution for each new grow (approximately 12 weeks).
 
Marketing
 
We currently market our products directly and through distributors, to hydroponic retailers through direct contacts, on-line email advertising, social media, trade magazine advertising, trade show promotions, and cross-promotional offerings. Our officers, along with six retail and commercial sales representatives and four distributors, are engaged in marketing our products. Our primary brand-building marketing efforts are directed through a New York City based national firm who also coordinates our public relations efforts. In addition, we work with a select few wholesale distributors who cover parts of the United States, Canada, Spain and the United Kingdom. Approximately 2% and 3% of our revenues were derived from non-U.S. sources in 2018 and 2017, respectively.

Manufacturing and Supply
 
All of our current lighting products are manufactured to our specifications in China. We currently rely upon one manufacturer and supplier of our ballast products. We continue to evaluate and upgrade our China manufacturing specifications and relationships and believe that the prices charged by these suppliers are industry-wide competitive. All of our other lighting products, including our lamps, are manufactured and supplied by third-party suppliers.
 
Our reliance upon manufacturers and suppliers located in China, subjects us to various political, economic, and other risks and uncertainties inherent in importing products from this country, including among other risks, export/import duties, quotas and embargoes; domestic and international customs and tariffs; changing taxation policies; foreign exchange restrictions; and political conditions and governmental regulations. There can be no assurance that if there were an interruption of our supply lines from China, that we would be able to quickly find replacement suppliers of our products domestically, or from other countries, and even if we found replacement suppliers, that we would be able to obtain the products at the quality and prices we currently pay which is why our founders continue to develop alternate relationships in China light and ballast manufacturing.
 
Our Terpenez nutrient products are formulated in our facility in Carson, CA under the strictest of manufacturing protocols. We intend to develop additional nutrient lines using local state-of-the-art processing labs in southern California under our proprietary formulations. Given the regulatory environment and intense scrutiny and testing required by both State and Federal agencies, we believe staying the course with natural, organic, and heavy-metal free ingredients will allow Zelda to provide substantial growth and opportunity within the industry.
 
Intellectual Property
 
We own a number of trademarks and rely on a combination of copyright and trade secrets as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary technology and our brand. We rely on copyright laws to protect copy on our web site, www.solis-tek.com, and all marketing materials.
 
We own the trademark for our proprietary product “Terpenez”.
 
From time to time, we may encounter disputes over rights and obligations concerning intellectual property. Also, the efforts we have taken to protect our proprietary rights may not be sufficient or effective. Any significant impairment of our intellectual property rights could harm our business, our brand and reputation, or our ability to compete. Also, protecting our intellectual property rights could be costly and time consuming.
 
Government and Industry Regulation
 
Cannabis is currently a Schedule I controlled substance and is therefore illegal under federal law. Even in those states in which the use of cannabis has been legalized, its use, possession, or cultivation remains a violation of federal laws. A Schedule I controlled substance is defined as one that has no currently accepted medical use in the United States, a lack of safety for use under medical supervision and a high potential for abuse. The U.S. Department of Justice (the “DOJ”) defines Schedule I controlled substances as “the most dangerous drugs of all the drug schedules with potentially severe psychological or physical dependence.” If the federal government decides to enforce the Controlled Substances Act with respect to cannabis, persons that are charged with distributing, possessing with intent to distribute, or growing cannabis could be subject to fines and terms of imprisonment, the maximum being life imprisonment and a $50 million fine.
 
As of the date of this report, 33 states and the District of Columbia allow their residents to use medical cannabis. The state laws are in conflict with the federal Controlled Substances Act (the “CSA”), which makes cannabis use and possession illegal on a national level. The Obama administration stated that it is not an efficient use of resources to direct federal law enforcement agencies to prosecute those lawfully abiding by state-designated laws allowing the use and distribution of medical cannabis. However, recent statements by the Trump administration, in particular by then Attorney General Jeff Sessions, indicate that this policy may be under review. In March 2015, legislation was introduced in the U.S. Senate proposing to change federal law such that states could regulate medical use of cannabis without risk of prosecution. A key component of the proposed Compassionate Access, Research Expansion, and Respect States Act (the “CARERS Act”) is to reclassify cannabis under the Controlled Substances Act to Schedule II, thereby changing the plant from a federally-criminalized substance to one that has recognized medical uses. There is no guarantee that the administration will not change its stated policy regarding the low-priority enforcement of federal laws. Additionally, any new administration could change this policy and decide to enforce the federal laws strongly. Any such change in the federal government’s enforcement of current federal laws could cause significant financial damage to us. We intend to harvest, distribute and sell cannabis, and we may be irreparably harmed by a change in enforcement by the federal government.

Section 537 of the Consolidated Appropriations Act for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017 prohibits the expenditure by the Department of Justice of any funds to prevent the implementation of medical marijuana laws by any state or the District of Columbia or Puerto Rico. In United States v McIntosh, the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals held that the operators and growers had standing to challenge federal indictments for violations of the Controlled Substances Act. It is unknown whether future appropriations acts will include similar provisions or whether other circuits will follow the lead of the 9th Circuit.
 
DOJ Deputy Attorney General James M. Cole issued a memorandum (the “Cole Memo”) to all United States Attorneys providing updated guidance to federal prosecutors concerning cannabis enforcement under the CSA. The Cole Memo guidance applies to all of DOJ’s federal enforcement activity, including civil enforcement and criminal investigations and prosecutions, concerning cannabis in all states. In January 2018, former Attorney General, Jeff Sessions rescinded the Cole Memo. However, the federal government, to date, has not determined to devote federal government resources to companies operating in states which have passed laws legalizing medical and recreational marijuana use whose businesses are operating in conformity with the provisions of the Cole Memo.
 
We intend to remain within the guidelines outlined in the Cole Memo (see “The Cole Memo”), however, we cannot provide assurance that the Company is in full compliance with the laws since the repeal of the Cole Memo or with the Cole Memo itself or any other federal laws or regulations. The Cole Memo reiterates Congress’s determination that cannabis is a dangerous drug and that the illegal distribution and sale of cannabis is a serious crime that provides a significant source of revenue to large-scale criminal enterprises, gangs, and cartels. The Cole Memo notes that DOJ is committed to enforcement of the CSA consistent with those determinations. It also notes that DOJ is committed to using its investigative and prosecutorial resources to address the most significant threats in the most effective, consistent, and rational way. In furtherance of those objectives, the Cole Memo provides guidance to DOJ attorneys and law enforcement to focus their enforcement resources on persons or organizations whose conduct interferes with any one or more of the following important priorities (the “Enforcement Priorities”): (a) preventing distribution of cannabis to minors; (b) preventing revenue from cannabis from going to gangs, cartels and other illegal participants; (c) preventing the diversion of cannabis from states where it is legal to states where it is illegal; (d) preventing state-authorized cannabis activity from being a cover or pretext for the trafficking of other illegal drugs; (e) preventing violence and the use of firearms in the cultivation and distribution of cannabis; (f) preventing drugged driving and the exacerbation of other adverse public health consequences associated with cannabis use; and (g) preventing the growing of cannabis on public lands and its use or possession on Federal property.
 
The DOJ may issue in the future supplemental guidance directing that prosecutors also consider the Enforcement Priorities with respect to federal money laundering, unlicensed money transmitter, and BSA offenses predicated on cannabis-related violations of the CSA.
 
Competition
 
Our Lighting Products currently face competition from traditional lighting fixture companies, lamp manufacturers and from non-traditional companies focused on LED lighting systems including fixtures and lamps. Lighting companies such as Acuity Brands, Inc., the Cooper Lighting division of Eaton Corporation plc, General Electric Company, Hubbell Incorporated, Philips, OSRAM, Gavita, Nanolux, Sunlight Supply and Hydrofarm are the main competitors in this market. Increasingly, however, other companies (i.e., start-ups) are beginning to emerge in the LED lighting markets in which we compete. We compete on the basis of product features, quality, product availability and price.
 
Our LED lighting products compete against traditional lighting products using incandescent, fluorescent, halogen, ceramic metal halide or other lighting technology. Our LED lighting products compete against traditional lighting products based upon superior energy savings, extended life, improved lighting quality and lower total cost of ownership. Also, our LED lighting products have a reduced impact on the environment as compared to fluorescent and compact fluorescent technologies that contain mercury.
 
We will also compete with LED-based products from traditional and non-traditional lamp and fixture companies, some of which are customers for our LED chips and LED components. Our products compete on the basis of color quality and consistency, superior light output, reduced energy consumption, brand and lower total cost of ownership. Within the Zelda nutrient product line, the Terpenez product is unique in its product class. The formula provides essential oil-bearing plants with both precursors (i.e. metabolic building blocks, trace elements, etc.) and readily available bio-identical plant compounds aiming to increase overall essential oil production and intensity. It is the first product of its kind to deliver plant nutrients to cannabis cultivating customers with a fully plant derived 0-0-0 (Nitrogen, Phosphate, and Potassium free) product. Independent bioanalytical testing laboratory analysis was conducted and determined the level of heavy metals to be below the EPA’s detection limit (BDL). Terpenez is used to increase the value of cannabis crops through the intensification of oil production, which has results in a significant improvement in flavor and aroma. With other nutrient lines, products that provide plant growth, and insect and pest protection, are marketed through a plethora of local and regional brands with literally scores of names and claims of value and productivity- none of which compete head on with Terpenez whose lab tested and grower proven track record is beyond compare.
