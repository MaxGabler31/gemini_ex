General
Triumph Group, Inc. ("Triumph", the "Company", "we", "us", or "our") was incorporated in 1993 in Delaware. Our companies design, engineer, manufacture, repair, overhaul and distribute a broad portfolio of aerostructures, aircraft components, accessories, subassemblies and systems. We serve a broad, worldwide spectrum of the aviation industry, including original equipment manufacturers, or OEMs, of commercial, regional, business and military aircraft and aircraft components, as well as commercial and regional airlines and air cargo carriers.
Products and Services
Effective January 1, 2018, the Company combined its Aerospace Structures and Precision Components reporting segments into one reporting segment, Aerospace Structures. Aerospace Structures and Precision Components share many of the same customers and suppliers and have substantial inter-company work on common programs. As a single operating segment, the Company believes it will be able to leverage its combined resources to make it more cost competitive and to enhance performance. The newly formed operating segment is also a reportable segment. As a result, effective January 1, 2018, the Company has three reporting segments for financial reporting purposes - Integrated Systems, Aerospace Structures, and Product Support.
We offer a variety of products and services to the aerospace industry through three operating segments: (i) Triumph Integrated Systems, whose companies revenues are derived from the design, development and support of proprietary components, subsystems and systems, as well as production of complex assemblies using external designs; (ii) Triumph Aerospace Structures, whose companies supply commercial, business, regional and military manufacturers with large metallic and composite structures and produce close-tolerance parts primarily to customer designs and model-based definition, including a wide range of aluminum, hard metal and composite structure capabilities; and (iii) Triumph Product Support, whose companies provide full life cycle solutions for commercial, regional and military aircraft.

Certain financial information about our three segments is set forth in Note 2 of "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements."
Proprietary Rights
We benefit from our proprietary rights relating to designs, engineering and manufacturing processes, and repair and overhaul procedures. For some products, our unique manufacturing capabilities are required by the customer's specifications or designs, thereby necessitating reliance on us for the production of such specially designed products.
We view our name and trademark as significant to our business as a whole. Our products are protected by a portfolio of patents, trademarks, licenses or other forms of intellectual property that expire at various dates in the future. We continually develop and acquire new intellectual property and consider all of our intellectual property to be valuable. However, based on the broad scope of our product lines, management believes that the loss or expiration of any single intellectual property right would not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, our financial position or our business segments. Our policy is to file applications and obtain patents for our new products as appropriate, including product modifications and improvements. While patents generally expire 20 years after the patent application filing date, new patents are issued to us on a regular basis.
In our overhaul and repair businesses, OEMs of equipment that we maintain for our customers often include language in repair manuals that relate to their equipment, asserting broad claims of proprietary rights to the contents of the manuals used in our operations. There can be no assurance that OEMs will not try to enforce such claims, including the possible use of legal proceedings. In the event of such legal proceedings, there can be no assurance that such actions against the Company will be unsuccessful. However, we believe that our use of manufacture and repair manuals is lawful.
Raw Materials and Replacement Parts
We purchase raw materials, primarily consisting of extrusions, forgings, castings, aluminum and titanium sheets and shapes and stainless steel alloys, from various vendors. We also purchase replacement parts, which are utilized in our various repair and overhaul operations. We believe that the availability of raw materials to us is adequate to support our operations.
Sales, Marketing and Engineering
While each of our operating companies maintains responsibility for selling and marketing its specific products, we have developed two marketing teams at the group level who are focused on cross-selling our broad capabilities. One team supports Integrated Systems and Aerospace Structures and the other team supports Product Support. These teams are responsible for selling systems, integrated assemblies and repair and overhaul services, reaching across our operating companies, to our OEM, military, airline and air cargo customers. In certain limited cases, we use independent, commission-based representatives to serve our customers' changing needs and the current trends in some of the markets and geographic regions in which we operate. 
The two group-level marketing teams operate as the front-end of the selling process, establishing or maintaining relationships, identifying opportunities to leverage our brand, and providing service for our customers. Each individual operating company is responsible for its own technical support, pricing, manufacturing and product support. Also, within the Product Support, we have created a group engineering function to provide integrated solutions to meet our customer needs by designing systems that integrate the capabilities of our companies. Also, we are increasingly meeting our customers' needs by designing systems that integrate the extended capabilities of our companies.
A significant portion of our government and defense contracts are awarded on a competitive bidding basis. We generally do not bid or act as the primary contractor, but will typically bid and act as a subcontractor on contracts on a fixed-price basis. We generally sell to our other customers on a fixed-price, negotiated contract or purchase order basis.
Backlog
We have a number of long-term agreements with several of our customers. These agreements generally describe the terms under which the customer may issue purchase orders to buy our products and services during the term of the agreement. These terms typically include a list of the products or repair services customers may purchase, initial pricing, anticipated quantities and, to the extent known, delivery dates. In tracking and reporting our backlog, however, we only include amounts for which we have actual purchase orders with firm delivery dates or contract requirements generally within the next 24 months, which primarily relate to sales to our OEM customer base. Purchase orders issued by our aftermarket customers are usually completed within a short period of time. As a result, our backlog data relates primarily to the OEM customers. The backlog information set forth below does not include the sales that we expect to generate from long-term agreements for which we do not have actual purchase orders with firm delivery dates.
5

As of March 31, 2018, we had outstanding purchase orders representing an aggregate invoice price of approximately $4.50 billion, of which $1.34 billion, $3.13 billion and $27 million relate to Integrated Systems, Aerospace Structures and Product Support, respectively. As of March 31, 2017, our continuing operations had outstanding purchase orders representing an aggregate invoice price of approximately $3.98 billion, of which $1.08 billion, $2.86 billion and $33 million related to Integrated Systems, Aerospace Structures and Product Support, respectively. Of the existing backlog of $4.50 billion, approximately $1.85 billion will not be shipped by March 31, 2019.
Dependence on Significant Customers
For the fiscal years ended March 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, the Boeing Company ("Boeing") represented approximately 31%, 35% and 38%, respectively, of our net sales, covering virtually every Boeing plant and product. 
For the fiscal years ended March 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, Gulfstream Aerospace Corporation ("Gulfstream") represented approximately 13%, 12% and 12%, respectively, of our net sales, covering several of Gulfstream's products. 
A significant reduction in sales to Boeing and/or Gulfstream would have a material adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
United States and International Operations
Our revenues from customers in the United States for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, were approximately $2,440 million, $2,764 million and $3,088 million, respectively. Our revenues from customers in all other countries for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, were approximately $759 million, $769 million and $798 million, respectively.
As of March 31, 2018 and 2017, our long-lived assets located in the United States were approximately $1,661 million and $2,326 million, respectively. As of March 31, 2018 and 2017, our long-lived assets located in all other countries were approximately $223 million and $315 million, respectively.
Competition
We compete primarily with Tier 1 and Tier 2 aerostructures manufacturers, systems suppliers and component manufacturers, some of which are divisions or subsidiaries of other large companies, in the manufacture of aircraft structures, systems components, subassemblies and detail parts. OEMs are increasingly focusing on assembly and integration activities while outsourcing more manufacturing and, therefore, are less of a competitive force than in previous years.
Competition for the repair and overhaul of aviation components comes from four primary sources, some of whom possess greater financial and other resources than we have: OEMs, major commercial airlines, government support depots, and other independent repair and overhaul companies. Some major commercial airlines continue to own and operate their own service centers, while others have begun to sell or outsource their repair and overhaul services to other aircraft operators or third parties. Large domestic and foreign airlines that provide repair and overhaul services typically provide these services not only for their own aircraft but for other airlines as well. OEMs also maintain service centers which provide repair and overhaul services for the components they manufacture. Many governments maintain aircraft support depots in their military organizations that maintain and repair the aircraft they operate. Other independent service organizations also compete for the repair and overhaul business of other users of aircraft components.
Participants in the aerospace industry compete primarily on the basis of breadth of technical capabilities, quality, turnaround time, capacity and price.
Government Regulation and Industry Oversight
The aerospace industry is highly regulated in the United States by the FAA and in other countries by similar agencies. We must be certified by the FAA and, in some cases, by individual OEMs, in order to engineer and service parts and components used in specific aircraft models. If material authorizations or approvals were revoked or suspended, our operations would be adversely affected. New and more stringent government regulations may be adopted, or industry oversight heightened, in the future and these new regulations, if enacted, or any industry oversight, if heightened, may have an adverse impact on us.
We must also satisfy the requirements of our customers, including OEMs, that are subject to FAA regulations, and provide these customers with products and repair services that comply with the government regulations applicable to aircraft components used in commercial flight operations. The FAA regulates commercial flight operations and requires that aircraft components meet its stringent standards. In addition, the FAA requires that various maintenance routines be performed on aircraft components, and we currently satisfy these maintenance standards in our repair and overhaul services. Several of our operating locations are FAA-approved repair stations.
Generally, the FAA only grants licenses for the manufacture or repair of a specific aircraft component, rather than the broader licenses that have been granted in the past. The FAA licensing process may be costly and time-consuming. In order to 
6

obtain an FAA license, an applicant must satisfy all applicable regulations of the FAA governing repair stations. These regulations require that an applicant have experienced personnel, inspection systems, suitable facilities and equipment. In addition, the applicant must demonstrate a need for the license. Because an applicant must procure manufacturing and repair manuals from third parties relating to each particular aircraft component in order to obtain a license with respect to that component, the application process may involve substantial cost.
The license approval processes for the European Aviation Safety Agency ("EASA"), which regulates this industry in the European Union; the Civil Aviation Administration of China; and other comparable foreign regulatory authorities are similarly stringent, involving potentially lengthy audits. EASA was formed in 2002 and is handling most of the responsibilities of the national aviation authorities in Europe, such as the United Kingdom Civil Aviation Authority.
Our operations are also subject to a variety of worker and community safety laws. For example, the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970, or OSHA, mandates general requirements for safe workplaces for all employees in the United States. In addition, OSHA provides special procedures and measures for the handling of hazardous and toxic substances. Specific safety standards have been promulgated for workplaces engaged in the treatment, disposal or storage of hazardous waste. We believe that our operations are in material compliance with OSHA's health and safety requirements.
Environmental Matters
Our business, operations and facilities are subject to numerous stringent federal, state, local and foreign environmental laws and regulation by government agencies, including the Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA"). Among other matters, these regulatory authorities impose requirements that regulate the emission, discharge, generation, management, transportation and disposal of hazardous materials, pollutants and contaminants, govern public and private response actions to hazardous or regulated substances which may be or have been released to the environment, and require us to obtain and maintain licenses and permits in connection with our operations. This extensive regulatory framework imposes significant compliance burdens and risks on us. Although management believes that our operations and our facilities are in material compliance with such laws and regulations, future changes in these laws, regulations or interpretations thereof or the nature of our operations or regulatory enforcement actions which may arise, may require us to make significant additional capital expenditures to ensure compliance in the future.
Certain of our facilities, including facilities acquired and operated by us or one of our subsidiaries have at one time or another been under active investigation for environmental contamination by federal or state agencies when acquired, and at least in some cases, continue to be under investigation or subject to remediation for potential environmental contamination. We are frequently indemnified by prior owners or operators and/or present owners of the facilities for liabilities which we incur as a result of these investigations and the environmental contamination found which pre-dates our acquisition of these facilities, subject to certain limitations. We also maintain a pollution liability policy that provides coverage for certain material liabilities associated with the clean-up of on-site pollution conditions, as well as defense and indemnity for certain third-party suits (including Superfund liabilities at third-party sites), in each case, to the extent not otherwise indemnified. This policy applies to all of our manufacturing and assembly operations worldwide. Also, as we proceed with our plans to exit certain facilities as part of restructuring and related initiatives, the need for remediation for potential environmental contamination could be identified. If we are required to pay the expenses related to environmental liabilities because neither indemnification nor insurance coverage is available, these expenses could have a material adverse effect on us.
Employees
As of March 31, 2018, we employed 13,554 persons, of whom 3,446 were management employees, 93 were sales and marketing personnel, 747 were technical personnel, 607 were administrative personnel and 8,661 were production workers. Our segments were composed of the following employees: Integrated Systems - 2,803 persons, Aerospace Structures - 9,515 persons, Product Support - 1,062 persons, and Corporate - 174 persons.
Several of our subsidiaries are parties to collective bargaining agreements with labor unions. Under those agreements, we currently employ approximately 2,293 full-time employees. Currently, approximately 17% of our permanent employees are represented by labor unions and approximately 49% of net sales are derived from the facilities at which at least some employees are unionized. Of the 2,293 employees represented by unions, no employees are working under contracts that have expired or will expire within one year. 
During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2017, we settled a strike and agreed to a new collective bargaining agreement with our union employees with IAM District 751 at our Spokane, Washington facility which had expired during the quarter, resulting in a charge of $15.7 million due to disruption costs. 
7

 During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018, the Company ratified a collective bargaining agreement with its union employees with United Autoworkers of America and its Local Union 848 at its Red Oak, Texas facility.
Subsequent to the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018, the Company ratified a collective bargaining agreement with its union employees with United Autoworkers of America and its Local Union 952 at its Tulsa, Oklahoma facility.
Our inability to negotiate an acceptable contract with any of these labor unions could result in strikes by the affected workers and increased operating costs as a result of higher wages or benefits paid to union members. If the unionized workers were to engage in a strike or other work stoppage, or other employees were to become unionized, we could experience a significant disruption of our operations and higher ongoing labor costs, which could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.
Research and Development Expenses
Certain information about our research and development expenses for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, is available in Note 2 of "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements."
