POLYMER SEGMENT PRODUCTS AND COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS
SBCs are highly-engineered synthetic elastomers, which we invented and commercialized over 50 years ago. We developed the first unhydrogenated styrenic block copolymers (“USBC”) in 1964 and the first hydrogenated styrenic block copolymers (“HSBC”) in the late 1960s. Our SBCs enhance the performance of numerous products by imparting greater flexibility, resilience, strength, durability, and processability, and are used in a wide range of applications, including adhesives, coatings, consumer and personal care products, sealants, lubricants, medical, packaging, automotive, paving and roofing, and footwear products. Under the Cariflex brand name, we also sell isoprene rubber (“IR”) and isoprene rubber latex (“IRL”), which are non-SBC products primarily used in applications such as medical products, personal care, adhesives, tackifiers, paints, and coatings.
Our SBCs are high performance elastomers that are engineered for a wide range of applications. Our SBC products possess a combination of high strength and low viscosity, which facilitates ease of processing at elevated temperatures and high processing speeds. Our products can be processed in a variety of manufacturing applications, including injection molding, blow molding, compression molding, extrusion and hot melt, and solution applied coatings.
The majority of worldwide SBC production is dedicated to USBCs, which are primarily used in paving, roofing, adhesives, sealants, coatings, and footwear applications. HSBCs, which are significantly more complex and capital-intensive to manufacture than USBCs, are used in applications such as soft touch and flexible materials, personal hygiene products, medical products, automotive components, and certain adhesive and sealant applications. Our Cariflex IR and IRL products are primarily used in surgical gloves and condoms.
Our Polymer segment products are manufactured and our commercial activities are organized in the following product groups based upon polymer chemistry and process technologies: Performance Products, Specialty Polymers, and Cariflex.
Performance Products
Our Performance Products impart characteristics such as:

• | resistance to temperature and weather extremes in roads and roofing;


• | resistance to cracking, reduced road noise, and better water dispersion; and


• | increased processing flexibility in adhesive formulations for packaging tapes and labels, and materials used in disposable diapers.

In paving and roofing applications, our Performance Products primarily consist of styrene-butadiene-styrene (“SBS”) for use in modified asphalt applications, which in roofing applications produces stronger and more durable felts and shingles, 
4

and in paving applications enhances the strength and elasticity of asphalt-based paving compositions over an extended temperature range. In paving applications, we believe our HiMA technology polymers will extend road life by allowing pavements to withstand heavy traffic loads and varying climate conditions. Our products primarily compete with chemicals such as styrene-butadiene rubber latex, acetates, polyphosphoric acids and thermoplastic materials like ethylene-propylene-diene-monomer, polyethylene, atactic polypropylene and unmodified asphalts. We believe that customer choice for these markets is driven principally by total end-product cost, temperature performance, bitumen source and application. 
In personal care applications, our Performance Products primarily consist of SBS and styrene-isoprene-styrene (“SIS") for the manufacturing of ultra-thin stretchable films used for the production of diapers. In addition, our SIS polymers are also used in the lamination process for other personal care products. Our products primarily compete against low priced alternatives such as metallocenes. We believe that customer choice for these markets is driven principally by total end-product cost and performance.
In adhesives applications, our Performance Products primarily compete with ethylene-vinyl acetate, polyolefins, and metallocene polyolefins. The choice between these materials is influenced by bond strength, specific adhesion, consistent performance to specification, processing speed, hot-melt application, resistance to water and cost. Our SBCs are compatible with many other formulating ingredients. We believe demand for utilization of SBC-based adhesives is primarily driven by cost reduction and higher performance.
Specialty Polymers. Our Specialty Polymers are comprised of HSBC products that are significantly more complex to produce than our Performance Products. As a result, our Specialty Polymers generally generate higher margins than our Performance Products. 
Our Specialty Polymers impart characteristics such as:

• | improved flow characteristics for many industrial and consumer sealant and lubricating fluids;


• | soft feel in numerous consumer products such as razor handles, power tools, and automobile components;


• | impact resistance for demanding engineered plastic applications;


• | flexibility for wire and cable plastic outer layers;


• | stretch properties in disposable diapers and adult incontinence products;


• | resistance to ultraviolet light;


• | processing stability and viscosity; and


• | elevated temperature resistance.

Our products primarily compete against a variety of chemical and non-chemical alternatives including, but not limited to, thermoplastic vulcanizate, thermoplastic polyurethane, PVC, thermoplastic polyolefin, polyethylene terephthalate, polycarbonate, polyamide, and ethylene-propylene-diene-monomer based products. We believe demand for our Specialty Polymers portfolio is principally driven by customer-specific needs and by the ability to balance performance characteristics such as soft-touch, durability, stretch and impact.
Because many of our products are highly engineered and customized formulations, they require specialized product testing and validation, production and process evaluation. This results in potentially long lead times to achieve customer and industry established approvals. Our innovation-led growth strategy focuses on translating the inherent strengths of our product technologies such as flexibility, resilience, impact and moisture resistance, and aesthetics (clarity and haptics) to target opportunities in which we can expand and/or have the potential to create new market spaces for our solutions.
CariflexTM. Our Cariflex IR and IRL products combine the key qualities of natural rubber, such as good mechanical properties and hysteresis, with purity and clarity enhancements, good flow, low gel content, and absence of nitrosamines and natural rubber proteins. 
We focus our high purity IR polymers in demanding applications such as medical products, paints, coatings, and specialized footwear. Our IRL is specialized polyisoprene latex with a controlled structure and low chemical impurity level obtained through an anionic polymerization process followed by a proprietary latex processing step, both of which were first developed by us. IRL is durable, tear resistant, soft, transparent and odorless. In addition, the synthetic material is non-allergenic and has superior consistency and other advantages over natural rubber latex. As a result, IRL is a substitute for natural rubber latex, particularly in applications with high purity requirements, such as medical, healthcare, personal care, including products such as synthetic surgical gloves and condoms as well as in food contact operations. 
Our products primarily compete with natural rubber, conventional Ziegler Natta sourced solid IR, halo butyl rubber and several synthetic latex alternatives, notably neoprene, nitrile, and polychloroprene latex rubber, as well as polyurethane.

CHEMICAL SEGMENT PRODUCTS AND COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS
Effective January 1, 2018, results for our Roads and Construction product line have been consolidated into our Adhesives and Performance Chemicals product lines to better align customer portfolio and end usage. We have adjusted the presentations for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 to conform to the respective 2018 presentations.
We manufacture and sell high value products primarily derived from pine wood pulping co-products. We refine and further upgrade two primary feedstocks, crude tall oil (“CTO”) and crude sulfate turpentine (“CST”), both of which are co-products of the wood pulping process, into value-added specialty chemicals. We refine CTO through a distillation process into four primary constituent fractions: tall oil fatty acids ( “TOFA”); tall oil rosin (“TOR”); distilled tall oil (“DTO”); and tall oil pitch. We further upgrade TOFA, TOR, and DTO into derivatives such as dimer acids, polyamide resins, rosin resins, dispersions, and disproportionated resins. We refine CST into terpene monomer fractions, which can be further upgraded into terpene resins. The various fractions and derivatives resulting from our CTO and CST refining process provide for distinct functionalities and properties, determining their respective applications and end markets. 
While this business is based predominantly on the refining and upgrading of CTO and CST, we have the capacity to use both hydrocarbon-based raw materials, such as alpha-methyl-styrene (“AMS”), tall oil, and gum rosins where appropriate and, accordingly, are able to offer tailored solutions for our customers.
Our Chemical segment products are manufactured and our commercial activities are organized in the following product groups based upon end markets and process technologies: Adhesives, Performance Chemicals, and Tires.
Adhesives. We offer a broad range of products to service target adhesives submarkets, including rosin-based tackifiers for packaging and pressure-sensitive adhesive applications, terpene-based tackifiers for bookbinding, hygiene and pressure-sensitive adhesive applications, AMS resins for bookbinding and pressure-sensitive adhesive applications and hot melt polyamides for flexible packaging.
Our tackifiers are primarily used in hot melt adhesives, which are heavily used in the packaging submarket. Our focus in packaging is to improve our competitive position by introducing higher stability tackifiers that work in new polymer systems. We believe our efforts to improve functionality of tackifier offerings will enable differentiated and profitable growth in emerging markets. 
Roads and Construction. Within the pavement marking submarket, we provide rosin-based binders for the thermoplastic pavement marking submarket and produce insoluble maleic-based tackifiers. 
Performance Chemicals. We serve various submarkets with a wide product offering, providing value across several different applications including, among others, fuel additives, oilfield chemicals, mining fluids, coatings, and metalworking fluids and lubricants. Our products include:
TOFA. Compared to other fatty acids obtained from various vegetable and animal origins, TOFA has a chemical composition characterized by distinctive features used as components in various applications. For example: 

End use market | Features 
Coatings | •serves as a binder in solvent-based paints as well as in hybrid coatings•preferred over soybean oil due to its higher unsaturation, better reactivity, flexibility, and compatibility
Mining | •lower viscosity and higher affinity with the ore extract allow a higher recovery yield•preferred over oleic acid 
Oilfield chemicals | •easier handling, better solubility in drilling muds, as well as higher surface activity and emulsifying power•preferred over oleic acid 
Fuel additives | •improves the lubricity of low-sulfur diesel fuel, preventing engine fuel pump wear 

We also sell TOFA for the asphalt paving market and niche products, including bitumen additives. Our performance bitumen additives were developed to increase the amount of reclaimed asphalt that can be used in a paving application, while meeting local performance specifications. We believe we have a strong market position supported by our increasing expertise in bitumen chemistry for aged materials, a comprehensive understanding of market needs, innovative product solutions, and a growing patent portfolio.

Dimer Acids. Our dimer acids are used for the production of polyamide resins used in applications such as epoxy coatings, flexographic inks, and high performance adhesive applications. In addition, dimer acids are building blocks in the production of corrosion inhibitors and emulsifiers used in the production and recovery of petroleum and natural gas. Our dimer acids compete with dimer acids derived from other feedstocks such as rapeseed and cottonseed oil.
TOR. TOR is used in all major rosin applications for the manufacture of adhesives, inks, pavement markers, rubber, and paper.
DTO. DTO is a mixture of TOFA and rosin acids. Our DTO is primarily used as an emulsifier for metalworking fluids and lubricants, in which our product offers improved performance attributes and, in many cases, replaces less environmentally friendly hydrocarbon-based chemicals. In these applications, it is sometimes used in place of TOFA.
Terpene Fractions. We supply terpene fractions, alpha-pinene and beta-pinene, and upgrade them mainly as specialty tackifiers for the adhesives market and tread enhancers for the tires market.
Tires. We sell a range of products that enhance the performance and manufacturing of high performance, winter, and all-season tires. Our terpene-based tread enhancement resins optimize wet grip of tire treads while maintaining reduced rolling resistance and enhanced durability which contribute to improved vehicle fuel efficiency. We market our AMS-based tread enhancement additives through product attributes that include reduced rolling resistance, increased durability, wet grip enhancement, and exceptional compatibility with rubber compounds, especially solution styrene-butadiene rubber polymers. We also sell TOFA, DTO, and rosins as processing aids, which provide select functionalities at various steps in the rubber and tire manufacturing process.
We were one of the first companies to supply tread enhancement resins to the tire industry and won early qualifications with innovative tire manufacturers. The quest for improved fuel economy has prompted the introduction of silica-based “green tires” in which certain of our products are a key component. AMS resins were the first tread enhancement additive commercialized beyond basic hydrocarbon tackifiers, and we believe they offer a good balance of properties, price, and performance for current generation tires. 
GENERAL
Sales and Marketing
Our business is predominantly based on a short sales cycle. We sell our products through a number of channels including a direct sales force, marketing representatives, and distributors. We use third-party marketing representatives and distributors in markets where they have existing platforms and are more cost effective in completing market coverage. We have long-term relationships and a wide network of distributors across North America, Europe, Latin America, and Asia Pacific.
Our sales personnel are primarily responsible for maintaining relationships with our customer base and providing product advice. In general, they coordinate contact between our customers and our research and development personnel to provide quality control and new product solutions. Our close interaction with our customers has allowed us to develop and maintain what we consider to be strong customer relationships.
Competition
In each of our markets, we compete on a range of factors, including price, breadth of product availability, product quality, and the speed of service from order to delivery. We believe our customers also base their supply decisions on the supplier’s ability to design and produce customized products and the availability of technical support. We also compete against a broad range of alternative materials throughout our product groups, including petrochemical, animal and vegetable-based substitutes. Major competitors in our market include large domestic and international companies. No one or small number of competitors is dominant across all industries in which we compete and no single customer accounted for 10.0% or more of our total revenue during the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016
Sources and Availability of Raw Materials
We use butadiene, styrene, and isoprene as our primary raw materials in our Polymer segment and CTO and CST in our Chemical segment as our primary raw materials. 
For our Polymer segment, we procure our raw materials from multiple sources in the U.S. and foreign countries, through a range of short-term and long-term supply agreements. 
7

For our Chemical segment, we have an exclusive long-term supply contract with International Paper, which extends through 2027, under which it has agreed to sell to us, and we have agreed to purchase from it, all of the CTO and CST produced at its paper mills. We also maintain long-standing relationships with other major suppliers of our raw materials in the U.S. and Europe. Additionally, our CTO supply sources are further diversified by our ability to refine and process black liquor soap into CTO in the U.S. Most of our Chemical segment manufacturing facilities are located in close proximity to the facilities of our raw material suppliers, allowing us to procure our raw materials at a low delivered cost. Furthermore, we work directly with our suppliers at their production facilities to enhance their CTO and CST yields through technological improvements, which we believe allows us to maximize our raw material supplies, to improve the efficiency of our suppliers’ operations, and to foster strong, long-lasting relationships with them. 
We believe that raw material supplies for both segments will be available in quantities sufficient to meet demand in 2019. The cost of these raw materials has generally correlated with changes in energy prices and is generally influenced by supply and demand factors, and for our isoprene monomers the prices of natural and synthetic rubber. Each of our reportable segments were impacted to a varying degree in 2018 by the volatility of raw material costs and these conditions may continue in 2019.
Research, Development, and Technology
Our research and development activities are primarily conducted in laboratories in Almere, Netherlands; Amsterdam, Netherlands; Houston, Texas; Savannah, Georgia; and Shanghai, China. We also have a world class facility located at our Belpre, Ohio, site that accelerates polymer development efforts and the commercialization of new products and reduces customer qualification lead times. In addition to our core research activities, research and development personnel also support maintenance of ongoing business activities and other support functions. The below details our significant research and development activities:
Core research and development 

• | New product and process development


• | Technical support and new application development


• | Technology platform development

Business support

• | Safety and regulatory compliance


• | Operations and quality support


• | Technical support to sales team and customers

Patents, Trademarks, Copyrights, and Other Intellectual Property Rights
We rely on a variety of intellectual property rights to conduct our business, including patents, trademarks, and trade secrets. We had 1,054 granted patents and 343 pending patent applications at December 31, 2018. These patents protect our innovative technologies and applications against infringement, and create long-term, sustainable competitive advantages in our core growth markets. Since patents are generally in effect for a period of 20 years from the filing date, and therefore, assuming most of these applications will be granted, we expect a significant portion of our patent portfolio to remain in effect for a significant period. The granted patents and the applications cover both the U.S. and foreign countries. We do not expect that the expiration of any single patent or specific group of patents would have a material impact on our business and the overall profitability of our business is not dependent on any single patent, trademark, license, or franchise.
Our material trademarks will remain in effect unless we decide to abandon any of them, subject to possible third-party claims challenging our rights. Similarly, our trade secrets will preserve their status as such for as long as they are the subject of reasonable efforts, on our part, to maintain their secrecy. We maintain a number of trade names that are protected by trademark laws. 
Employees
As of December 31, 2018, we had 1,918 employees, the majority of which are full-time employees. 
Environmental Regulation
Our operations in the U.S. and abroad are subject to a wide range of environmental laws and regulations at the international, national, state, and local levels. Matters pertaining to the environment are discussed in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors; Part I, Item 3. Legal Proceedings; and Part II, Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

We have made, and intend to continue to make, the expenditures necessary for compliance with applicable laws and regulations relating to health, safety, environmental, and security matters. We incurred capital expenditures in 2018 for regulatory purposes of $9.6 million, and estimate such expenditures will be approximately $7.0 million in 2019 and $4.9 million in 2020. 
Costs of remediation at our current and former facilities are covered by indemnification agreements, insurance or through allocated reserves. We currently estimate that the costs of remediation will not materially affect our operations or cause us to materially exceed our anticipated level of capital expenditures. Although resolution of environmental liabilities will require future cash outlays, it is not expected that such outlays will materially impact our liquidity position, although there can be no assurance that such impacts would not occur.
Seasonality
Seasonal changes and weather conditions typically affect our sales of products in our paving, pavement marking, roofing, and construction applications, which generally results in higher sales volumes in the second and third quarters of the calendar year compared to the first and fourth quarters of the calendar year. Sales for our other product applications tend to show relatively little seasonality.
